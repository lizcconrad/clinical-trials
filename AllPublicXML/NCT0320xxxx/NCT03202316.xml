  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of atezolizumab,
      cobimetinib, and eribulin (ACE) can help to control inflammatory breast cancer that is
      metastatic (has spread). The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Atezolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and
      patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Cobimetinib is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of patients with unresectable (cannot be removed
      with surgery) or metastatic melanoma. Eribulin is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      The combination of atezolizumab, cobimetinib and eribulin for the treatment of metastatic
      inflammatory breast cancer is considered investigational. The study doctor can explain how
      the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 33 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled in 1 of 2
      study groups: Group A or Group B. Both groups will receive the same drugs at the same
      schedule, and the same dose of atezolizumab and eribulin. However, Group A may receive a
      different dose of cobimetinib. Up to 9 participants will be in Group A and 24 participants
      will be in Group B.

      If you are enrolled in Group A, the dose of cobimetinib you receive will depend on when you
      join this study. The first group of participants will receive the highest dose level of
      cobimetinib. The next new group will receive the same dose of cobimetinib if no intolerable
      side effects were seen. If intolerable side effects were seen, then the next new group will
      receive a lower level dose. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of
      cobimetinib is found.

      If you are enrolled in Group B, you will receive cobimetinib at the highest tolerable dose
      found in Group A.

      Study Drug Administration:

      The pre-cycle is 4 weeks, Cycles 1-4 are 21 days (about 3 weeks), and Cycles 5 and beyond are
      28 days (about 4 weeks).

      During the pre-cycle, you will receive atezolizumab and cobimetinib only. During Cycles 1-4,
      you will receive all 3 study drugs. Starting at Cycle 5, you will only receive atezolizumab
      and cobimetinib

      You will receive atezolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes every 2 weeks while on study.
      However, your first infusion will be given over about 1 hour.

      You will take cobimetinib by mouth at the same time every day with or without food on a 3
      weeks on, 1 week off schedule. This means you will take the study drug every day for 3 weeks
      in a row and then will not take cobimetinib for 1 week. If a dose of cobimetinib is missed or
      if you vomit a dose, do not take a &quot;make-up&quot; dose. Wait and take your next dose as scheduled.

      You will receive eribulin by vein over about 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of Cycles 1-4.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking atezolizumab and cobimetinib for as long as the study doctor thinks
      is in your best interest. You may receive up to 4 cycles of eribulin. You will no longer be
      able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or
      if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      During Week 1 of the pre-cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      During Week 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Before Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a tumor biopsy for biomarker testing.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for cytokine and biomarker testing.

      Before Cycles 2 and 5 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 8, 11,14, and so on):

        -  You will have an eye exam.

        -  You will have an ECHO or MUGA.

        -  Starting at Cycle 5, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for cytokine and
           biomarker testing.

        -  Starting at Cycle 5, you will have imaging scans.

      Before Cycle 3:

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for cytokine and biomarker testing.

        -  You will have imaging scans.

      On Day 8 of Cycles 1-4, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      End of Study:

      After your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, cytokine, and biomarker
           testing.

        -  You will have an ECHO or MUGA.

        -  You will have imaging scans.

        -  If you have not had one in the last 3 cycles, you will have an eye exam.

      Follow-Up:

      For about 3 months after the last dose of study drugs or until you start another anticancer
      therapy, you will be asked about your health and any side effects you may have had. You may
      be asked during a routine clinic visit or you may be called by a member of the study staff.
      If you are called, each call should last about 2 minutes.

      About every 6 months for at least 2 years after you stop taking the study drugs, you will be
      contacted and asked about how you are doing. If you are called, each call should last about 2
      minutes. This may also be done in a regular clinic visit.

             inducer) (2) Grapefruit juice (potent cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor)

         25. Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody or pathway
             targeting agents. But patients who have received prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 may
             be enrolled, provided the following requirements are met: (1). Minimum of 12 weeks
             from the first dose of anti-CTLA-4 and &gt; 6 weeks from the last dose; (2). No history
             of severe immune-related adverse effects from anti-CTLA 4 (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 and 4)

         26. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to
             interferon [IFN]-a or interleukin [IL]-2) within 6 weeks or five half-lives of the
             drug (whichever is shorter) prior to study treatment

         27. Treatment with investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to study treatment (or
             within five half lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer)

         28. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to
             prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor
             necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents) within 2 weeks prior to study treatment. But: a.
             Patients who have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications
             (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled. b. The use of
             inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients
             with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed.

         29. History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to
             chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins

         30. Patients with prior solid organ transplantation on anti-immunosuppressant
