  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is a high malignancy cancer which progress rapidly , and the
      rates of morbidity and mortality is very high in China. Radiotherapy as a effective treatment
      is commonly used in unresectable HCC patients. Preclinical models have shown that
      anti-angiogenesis medicine,such as rh-endostatin, can normalize the tumor vasculature to make
      it more efficient for oxygen delivery, which can enhance the radiosensitivity subsequently.
      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rh-endostatin combined with radiotherapy
      in the treatment of HCC.
