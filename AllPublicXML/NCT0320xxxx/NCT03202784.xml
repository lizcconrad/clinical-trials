  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized study to investigate the relative bioavailability of two
      formulations of BCX7353 and to determine if there is a food effect
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 24 healthy subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of two
      formulations of BCX7353 and one of the formulations administered with a high-fat meal. A
      14-day washout period will separate each dose.
