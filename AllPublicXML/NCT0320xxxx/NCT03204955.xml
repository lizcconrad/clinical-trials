      This pilot study will compare the two hypertonic solutions currently used for subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (SAH) - related complications and to determine if the reduction of chloride load
      is safer, and as efficacious as the classic hypertonic solution.

      This pilot study aimed to collect high-quality randomized and prospective information to help
      plan a future, larger multicenter trial. The study will compare the two hypertonic solutions
      currently used for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) - related complications and to determine if
      the reduction of chloride load by using a sodium acetate and sodium chloride mixture can lead
      to a relative reduction of serum chloride, reduce kidney injury, and as efficacious as the
      classic hypertonic solution.

      Hyperosmolar therapy is one of the mainstay treatments for SAH-related cerebral edema and
      vasospasm, in order to reduce delayed cerebral ischemia. Recent evidence from the literature
      correlates high chloride load when applying IV fluids with worse outcome in a variety of
      critically-ill patients. Hypertonic saline, with which most hyperosmolar treatment is done,
      contains a supra-physiologic chloride load. It is possible that by changing the hypertonic
      solution to a &quot;chloride-lean&quot; one, the study team would be able to reduce the side effects of
      hypertonic sodium-chloride without losing its efficacy in treating SAH-related complications.
