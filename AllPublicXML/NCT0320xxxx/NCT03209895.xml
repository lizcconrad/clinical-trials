  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a proprietary nutritional supplement
      that contains Krill Oil (KO), astaxanthin (AX) and hyaluronic acid (HA) to reduce pain and
      discomfort in participants, compared to an inert placebo (palm oil) control and to a positive
      control (glucosamine-chondroitin). The purpose of the study is to determine if the
      combination of KO, AX, and HA will benefit participants with joint pain.
