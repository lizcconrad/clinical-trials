    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine ventricular loading conditions during and after
      PulseCath® iVAC2L support, and assess its impact on specific load dependent humoral factors
      and cardiac enzymes. These specific patterns are so far unknown and will be compared with the
      validated FDA-cleared and CE marked Impella CP. Ten cases with Impella CP will be performed
      in this study to obtain the exact same measurements for comparing purposes.

      This is a mechanistic exploratory study. The objective is to determine the effects of the new
      PFLVAD PulseCath® iVAC2L and the CFLVAD Impella CP on ventricular loading using left
      ventricular pressure-volume loops, in association with systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic
      parameters obtained from right and left catheterization. Additionally, assessments of
      specific load and flow-dependent humoral factors and cardiac enzymes will be made during and
      after the use of mechanical circulatory support. These specific patterns are so far unknown
      and will be compared with the LV-to-arterial continuous flow CFLVAD Impella CP. Ten cases
      treated with Impella CP will be included in this study to obtain the exact same variables for
      comparing purposes. Knowledge of optimal patterns may help in determining the ideal
      circulatory device platform. If a difference is demonstrated, a randomized trial could be
      designed to detect differences in clinical outcomes between pulsatile and continuous flow
      circulatory support.
