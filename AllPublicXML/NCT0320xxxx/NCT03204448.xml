  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the clinical performance of BioCLIA Ro60 for measuring the
      autoantibody in autoimmune disease patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      100-200 clinically-diagnosed disease samples, as well as approximately 300 samples of various
      control diseases, will be used in the study. The specimen will be collected as the clinically
      leftover samples that have been used for routine clinical diagnosis purpose or research
      purpose, and with de-identification methods. Each set of samples will also be tested on a
      control serologic Anti-Ro60 detection kit, QUANTA Flash Ro60. Clinical sensitivity and
      clinical specificity will be analyzed for, also a method comparison conclusion will be drawn
      by comparing the two methods.

    <measure>Clinical performance of BioCLIA Ro60</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>About 500 Î¼l or more of each de-identified sample, in the form of serum or plasma, will be tested on-board with the automated BioCLIA serologic antinuclear antibodies (ANA) assay. Result will be reported in the form or IU/ml of antibodies in the samples. Clinical sensitivity of BioCLIA Ro60 will be determined by dividing the number of Ro60 positives by the number of relevant disease samples. Clinical specificity of BioCLIA will be determined by dividing the number of Ro60 negatives by the number of control disease samples.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Method comparison between BioCLIA Ro60 and BioFlash/QUANTA Flash Ro60</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The same samples tested in BioCLIA Ro60 will be tested on-board with the automated BioFLASH instrument with QUANTA Flash Ro60 reagents. Result will be reported in the form of CU of antibodies in the samples. Clinical sensitivity of BioFLASH/QUANTA Flash Ro60 will be determined by dividing the number of Ro60 positives by the number of relevant disease samples. Clinical specificity of BioFLASH/QUANTA Flash Ro60 will be determined by dividing the number of Ro60 negatives by the number of control disease samples. Degree of agreement between BioCLIA Ro60 and BioFLASH/QUANTA Flash Ro60 will be calculated.</description>
