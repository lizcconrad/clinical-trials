      This study will compare treatment emergent incidence rate of ADA between TPI-120 and US
      licensed Neulasta in normal healthy adult subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects have been selected as the study population for this comparative study
      because this population is more homogenous with respect to immune response and offers
      significant advantages with regards to recruitment and logistical aspects. This study will
      comprise of two cycles with each cycles will have a single dose of PEG FILGRASTIM
      administration to all study subjects as per the randomization schedule. Subjects will be
      confined from at least 10 hours prior to dosing, at the time indicated by the CRU, until 36
      hours post-dose on day 2 in each Cycle. Dosing in each Cycle are separated by 21 days.

      Subjects will return for all subsequent blood draws and ADA assessments, as indicated in The
      Schedule of Event
