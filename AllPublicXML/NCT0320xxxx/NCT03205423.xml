  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal will evaluate the ability of gabapentin maintenance to reduce the abuse
      liability of alcohol, oxycodone, and alcohol in combination with oxycodone in participants
      with both Opioid Use Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the abuse of prescription opioid medications is a pervasive problem in the U.S. In
      addition, co-abuse of opioids and alcohol represents a significant problem from the
      perspective of increased toxicity and decreased success in treatment. Surprisingly few
      studies have examined the effects of combined administration of opioids and alcohol in
      humans, and no clinical studies have examined the reinforcing effects of this combination.
      The current 8-9-week inpatient study will systematically evaluate gabapentin because it shows
      promise for treating both opioid and alcohol use disorders (OUD and AUD). The guiding
      principle is that a medication's effects on positive subjective responses and reinforcing
      effects are the best laboratory procedures to date in predicting its clinical efficacy. We
      will examine the ability of gabapentin to alter opioid-, alcohol-,and combined
      opioid/alcohol-mediated responses. Participants will meet DSM-5 criteria for moderate-severe
      OUD and be physically dependent on opioids. In addition, participants will meet DSM-5
      criteria for moderate-severe AUD, but they will not be physically dependent on alcohol. All
      of the participants will be maintained on oral morphine throughout the study and different
      doses of gabapentin will be evaluated.
