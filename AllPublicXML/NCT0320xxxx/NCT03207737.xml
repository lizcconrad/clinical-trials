  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of onsite and telehealth programs for
      individuals with spinal cord injury. The primary aim of this study is to compare the
      effectiveness of a blended 7-day onsite health promotion program followed by a 12-month
      telehealth package composed of exercise, nutrition, and mindfulness, to a 12-month
      telehealth-only package in individuals with spinal cord injury. The investigators hypothesize
      that the blended onsite and telehealth program will achieve better gains in fitness, dietary
      control, body composition, and pain management scores across a one-year period in comparison
      to the telehealth-only group. The secondary objective of this study is to examine changes in
      psychosocial mediators between the two groups to determine if key social cognitive theory
      constructs were significantly different between the two groups. The investigators hypothesize
      that the blended onsite and telehealth program will achieve better improvements in these
      outcomes compared to the telehealth only group.

    <description>Participants will live on campus for one week and complete the MENTOR program, which is a course about resilience and how nutrition, exercise and mindfulness help with resilience for individuals with a spinal cord injury. Different experts will cover the three main topics with lectures and application of knowledge through related activities. Participants will then begin a one-year telehealth program at home. The telehealth program will consist of readily available information focusing on nutrition, exercise and mindfulness for individuals with a spinal cord injury and a telehealth coach who will interact on the phone with the participants once every two weeks. This will continue for a total of 26 phone calls until the participant returns for 1-year follow-up testing.</description>
