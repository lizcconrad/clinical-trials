  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first choice of treatment for moderate to
      severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Although adherence is critical for achieving
      a good treatment effect, and early intervention if treatment problems emerge is important for
      achieving good adherence, information on patient compliance is usually based on assessment of
      the first few weeks of treatment. Telemedicine technology allows for monitoring of CPAP
      pressure, air leaks, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and compliance on a daily basis and could
      therefore be an option allowing for adequate support and quick response if a patient has
      problems with the treatment. In addition, improving early experiences of CPAP, identifying
      patients in need of more intensive support could potentially improve adherence but also
      reduced cost of care, and increased patient satisfaction.

      The proposed study will recruit 200 OSAS patients starting CPAP treatment; 100 patients
      randomized to afterwards receiving telemonitoring in combination with telephone calls, and
      100 patients randomized to receiving usual office visits. All patients will in addition
      answer questionnaires on sleep and health, quality of life, and patient satisfaction after
      the first CPAP information visit and then again after 6 months of treatment. At time of
      follow-up all patients will also answer questionnaires on side effects of CPAP. Health
      economic variables will also be measured throughout the testing period.

      The study will provide valuable information regarding benefits of telemonitoring in clinical
      work with CPAP therapy. Implementation of telemedicine-based monitoring of CPAP therapy may
      be an important part of increasing adherence among patients but also in the development of a
      more cost-effective care as it can provide clinics with increased treatment capacity and
      follow-up of both new and established patients. It would further improve the care for these
      patients who often have a lifelong treatment, which aims to reduce the risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease or premature death.
