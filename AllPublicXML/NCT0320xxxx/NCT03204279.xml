    <textblock>
      This study is Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) dose-finding study of
      oral netupitant administered concomitantly with oral palonosetron in pediatric cancer
      patients for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy.
      Two different netupitant dosages will be tested in patients aged from 3 months to &lt; 18 years:
      1.33 mg/kg up to a maximum of 100 mg, and 4 mg/kg up to a maximum of 300 mg. All netupitant
      doses in all age classes will be concomitantly administered with palonosetron 20 μg/kg (up to
      a maximum dose of 1.5 mg) which is the IV palonosetron dose approved by USA FDA for the
      pediatric population. The primary objective is to investigate the PK/PD relationship between
      netupitant exposure (AUC, Cmax) and antiemetic efficacy (CR in delayed phase) after a single
      oral netupitant administration, concomitantly with oral palonosetron in pediatric cancer
      patients receiving Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC) or Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy
      (HEC) cycles. Efficacy parameter to be used in the correlation is the proportion of patients
      with Complete Response (CR i.e., no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) during (&gt;
      24-120 h after the start of chemotherapy on Day 1).

      The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability after single oral
      administration of netupitant given concomitantly with a single oral administration of
      palonosetron; to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (AUC, Cmax, tmax and t1/2) of oral palonosetron
      at the fixed dose of 20 μg/kg in pediatric patients with the concomitant administration of
      netupitant. A total of 92 pediatric cancer patients receiving either HEC or MEC will be
      enrolled in the study.
