      Current prospective cohort study is to evaluate the association between fasting lipid
      profiles (including total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A, apolipoprotein B and
      lipoprotein(a)) and fasting plasma glucose at admission with cardiovascular disease outcomes
      (including fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke,
      re-hospitalization due to heart failure, revascularization by percutaneous coronary
      intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting, or cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause
      mortality.in patients with ischemic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45
      % evaluated by echocardiography during 12 months follow-up.
