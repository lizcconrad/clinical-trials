  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to create and evaluate a tool that gathers patient and family member
      feedback and makes it rapidly available to providers, enabling nimble and responsive safety
      and quality improvement efforts. Aim 1. Determine feasibility and acceptability of the
      patient data collection and provider dashboard tool. The investigators will conduct usability
      testing prior to study start, measure user (patients and providers) engagement over time, and
      gather feedback about the tool at study end. This will test the hypothesis that patient and
      caregiver characteristics will predict tool use. Aim 2. Assess whether reporting patient- and
      caregiver- observed processes of care to providers leads to changes over time. The
      investigators hypothesize that performance on structured items of interest will improve over
      time with rapidly available data presented to providers. Aim 3. Estimate tool implementation
      effect sizes, using a pre-post design, on medical errors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than a decade after the seminal Institute Of Medicine report, &quot;To Err is Human&quot;, failure
      rates in patient safety remain stubbornly high in hospitals. Prior efforts to improve
      hospital quality have had relatively little impact, in part due to limited access to timely
      quality improvement data. The long-term goal of this application is to leverage existing
      technologies to give voice to hospitalized patients and their family members, leading to
      improvements in hospital safety and quality. The overall objective in this application is to
      create and evaluate a tool that gathers patient and family member feedback and makes it
      rapidly available to providers, enabling nimble and responsive safety and quality improvement
      efforts. The central hypothesis, based on the theory of co-production, is that observations
      from patients and families, gathered in a structured way, will provide actionable information
      regarding patient safety and quality. The rationale for doing this project is to test an
      innovative new approach to creating a rapidly available data stream to providers who are
      working on specific improvement efforts, and a mechanism for creating a quality improvement
      approach that is inherently patient-centered. The investigators plan to test the central
      hypothesis and thereby accomplish the objective of this application by focusing on the
      following areas of research for Health IT: Use, Implementation, and Impact on Outcomes, under
      the study type &quot;Pilot and feasibility&quot;, pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine
      feasibility and acceptability of the patient data collection and provider dashboard tool (Use
      and Implementation). The investigators will conduct usability testing prior to study start,
      measure user (patients and providers) engagement over time, and gather feedback about the
      tool at study end. The investigators hypothesize that patient and caregiver characteristics
      will predict tool use. Aim 2. Assess whether reporting patient- and caregiver- observed
      processes of care to providers leads to changes over time (Implementation). The investigators
      hypothesize that performance on structured items of interest will improve over time with
      rapidly available data presented to providers. Aim 3. Estimate tool implementation effect
      sizes, using a pre-post design, on medical errors (Impact on outcomes). The proposed research
      is innovative, in the investigators' opinion, based on a paradigm-shifting conceptual model
      of patient-engaged quality improvement, and because it leverages technology to gather and
      present data in an unprecedented manner. The expected contribution of the proposed research
      will be an adapted tool that will gather meaningful and important data on patient safety and
      present it in an actionable way to providers and hospital leaders, resulting in a powerful
      data stream to fuel rapid improvements in patient safety. Pilot data from this proposal will
      inform the design of a future cluster-randomized trial of the new tool across multiple
      hospital systems. This contribution will be significant because it represents key steps
      towards a new approach to improving patient safety in the hospital.

    <description>This is a hospital unit-level outcome measure, assessing unit-level rate of adverse events and preventable medical errors in a time period before the intervention, and the unit-level rate at the end of the intervention. The investigators will apply standard definitions of medical errors as preventable failures in processes of care and adverse events as preventable and non-preventable unintended consequences of medical care that lead to patient harm. This is a composite measure and will be measured as total count of medical errors plus total count of adverse events per 100 admissions. The investigators will not track this measure across the same group of patients in the before and after periods. Participants will be included for the duration of their admission, which may vary. The rate will be measured cross-sectionally in both time periods.</description>

    <description>After completing enrollment surveys, including measures of patient activation and medical knowledge, participants will be invited to use the novel IT. The technology is a mobile responsive website for survey data collection made by our technology vendor, QuesGen. Patients and family members will be able to access the website from any personal device with internet access: laptop, tablet, or smart phone. QuesGen will send a text message reminder to participants with a link to specific questionnaires at scheduled time intervals. Frequency of text messaging will likely be daily, but will ultimately reflect family and patient feedback in Aim 1. In addition to text reminders, participants will be able to answer questionnaires at-will by accessing the mobile responsive website.</description>
