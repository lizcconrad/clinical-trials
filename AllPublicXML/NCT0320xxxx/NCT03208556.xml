  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PD1 pathway is critical in determining the response to CAR T cell therapy. Emerging data
      suggested that Inhibition of PD1 could enhance the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy. iPD1 CD19
      eCAR T cells is an enhanced version of the classical 2nd generation anti-CD19
      4-1BB-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells with cell-intrinsic PD1
      inhibition by incorporation of a PD1 shRNA-expressing cassette in the CAR lentivector. This
      design will enhance the anti-tumor activities of CAR T cells by inhibiting PD1 induction
      after CAR T cell activation. This pilot, single arm, one center, dose-escalation, open label
      study is to determine the safety and efficacy of iPD1 CD19 eCAR T cells in relapsed or
      refractory CD19 positive lymphoma.

      Subjects will be given a lymphodepletion chemotherapy comprised of Fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide prior to CAR T cell infusion. The chemotherapy is completed 1 to 4 days
      before the first dost of iPD1 CD19 eCAR T cells.
