      Overall morbidity rate remained high after distal pancreatectomy (DP), ranging from 30% to
      60%. Whilst postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains serious and also is one of the
      most common complications after DP (12% to 40%). POPF after DP is also associated with major
      complications such as bleeding or septic shock and remains an equivocal problem. However, all
      the previous reports were retrospective review, non-randomized study, or individual
      experience and showed no significant improvement of overall POPF. As always, this issue
      remains in obscurity and seek for a more concrete evidence to solve.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic surgery has been called formidable operation not only the technical challenge to
      surgeons but also demanding for patients. It evolved into a safe procedure with mortality
      rates of &lt;5% recently, cutting down gradually from 25% in the 1960s. However, overall
      morbidity rate remained high ranging from 30% to 60%.

      Distal pancreatectomy (DP) has been believed a safer and minor procedure compared with
      pancreatic head resection including standard pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), pylorus-preserving
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), or duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR).
      Whilst postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains serious and also is one of the most
      common complications after DP. BÃ¼chler et al observed that the POPF rate was in fact
      significantly higher after DP when compared to pancreatic head resections. The variable
      documented incidence of POPF following DP ranges from 12% to 40%. POPF after DP is also
      associated with major complications such as bleeding or septic shock and remains an equivocal
      problem.

      Although the majority of complications are not life-threatening, POPF could prolong
      hospitalization, expend expenditure for healthcare, abrade the quality of life; moreover,
      delay in further management for a fraction of patients with malignancy. Over the past two
      decades, various risk factors and multitudinous operative procedures have been held for
      reduction POPD following DP. These include underlying disease process, method of stump
      closure, and concomitant splenectomy However, all these reports were retrospective review,
      non-randomized study, or individual experience. As always, this issue remains in obscurity
      and seek for a more concrete evidence to solve.
