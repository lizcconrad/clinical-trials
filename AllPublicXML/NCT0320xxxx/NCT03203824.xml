  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this graduate student study is to determine if ingestion of dark chocolate
      (70% cacao) will change brain frequencies between visualization at a state of rest and a
      state of exercise performance via electroencephalography (EEG) in vigorously active
      individuals.

      The procedures include: On day one, participants will fill out a dark chocolate Likert scale,
      physical activity assessment, and demographic questionnaire. Day two and three, on
      consecutive days will include, three EEG measurements will be recorded: 1) at baseline, 2)
      during visualization of rest for one minute, and 3) during visualization of usual vigorous
      exercise for one minute. The second day all three measurements will be recorded without dark
      chocolate (70% cacao). The third day all three measurements will be recorded again.
      Measurements 2 and 3 will be recorded savoring dark chocolate and after fully ingesting the
      dark chocolate respectively.

    <description>The EEG, electroencephalogram, is a test that detects abnormalities in the brain waves or the electrical activity of the brain. During the procedure, electrodes consisting of small metal discs with thin wires are pasted onto the scalp. The electrodes detect tiny electrical charges that result from the activity in the brain cells. EEG wave band activity will be recorded from 9 cerebral cortical scalp locations: F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, and P4 using the EEG B-Alert 10X System, Carlsbad CA. Each of the brain frequencies will be measured in 5 second increments. Data collection will last no longer than 2 hours for each session.</description>
