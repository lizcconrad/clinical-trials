  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized study will investigate the use of niraparib in patients with
      tumors known to have mutations in BAP1 and other select DNA damage response pathway genes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BAP1 is an ubiquitin ligase that is critical in helping to regulate the cell cycle, cellular
      differentiation, and cell death. This protein is also intimately involved with DNA
      double-strand break repair. Germline mutations in the BAP1 gene are associated with a
      hereditary cancer syndrome that increases the risk of uveal melanoma, mesothelioma and renal
      cell carcinoma. PARP is another protein that is crucial in DNA repair and enables continued
      cell replication and survival. It is hypothesized that PARP inhibition with niraparib will
      result in significant cytoreduction in patient tumors with mutations in BAP1 and other
      components of the DNA damage response pathway through synthetic lethality. Synthetic
      lethality is the inhibition of a gene that a cell relies on to compensate for the loss of
      another gene, resulting in the cell's demise.
