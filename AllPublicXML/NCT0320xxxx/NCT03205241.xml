      Research Plan

      Eleven trained cyclists have completed 4 cycling performance trials, before and after 4 weeks
      of fish oil supplementation and before and after 4 weeks of placebo with a 4 week washout
      between supplementation periods. During the performance trials blood, expired air and heart
      rate were collected. The blood samples have been used to investigate the production of
      inflammation resulting from the cycling performance test. Inflammation has been assessed
      using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IL-6, which is an inflammatory cytokine. Work
      done from the cycling performance will be analysed to investigate whether there is a
      relationship with power and inflammation and whether this is modulated by fish oil
      supplementation.

      Specific Aims

        1. Does 4 weeks of Fish Oil supplementation attenuate the inflammatory response following
           high intensity cycling.

        2. Is a modulation of the inflammatory response connected to cycling performance.

      Hypotheses

        1. Four weeks of n3-PUFA supplementation will reduce the inflammatory response

        2. A reduction in inflammation will improve cycling performance

      Anticipated Outcomes

      A high level of cycling performance, indicated by a high average power, will be associated
      with high levels of systemic inflammation. n3-PUFA supplementation will decrease the level of
      inflammation and consequently cycling performance will be improved.
