      It's a prospective, single arm, open label phase II clinical trial, in which the safety and
      efficacy of Chidamide plus R-CHOP regimen is accessed in de novo DLBCL patients, who have
      received 2 courses of R-CHOP but only achieved PR or whose MRD tests for ctDNA revealed
      positive results.
