      This is a randomized, prospective, open label, multicenter study to assess the effectiveness
      of IC2000 and SPY Fluorescence Imaging Systems (SPY) in the identification of lymph nodes
      during lymphatic mapping in subjects with breast cancer.

    <description>The periareolar area of the breast will be injected twice with 0.2 ml of a 1% Isosulfan Blue solution followed by injection twice with 0.05 ml of a 2.5 mg/ml solution of IC2000. Lymph node mapping will occur first with Isosulfan Blue based on direct visualization followed by intraoperative fluorescence visualization using IC2000 and SPY-PHI. As per standard of care, all subjects will receive an injection of Tc-99m radioactive colloid either the day before or the morning of surgery. The gamma probe will be used in conjunction with Tc-99m radioactive colloid to identify the SLNs during mapping; SLN identification will be performed first in all subjects as per standard of care.</description>
