  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic inflammation is a potentially debilitating complication of thoracic surgeries that
      can result in significant physical and economic morbidity for afflicted patients. There is
      compelling evidence for the role of central nervous system in the regulation of systemic
      inflammatory responses through humoral mechanisms. Activation of afferent vagus nerve fibers
      by cytokines triggers anti-inflammatory responses. Direct electrical stimulation of the
      peripheral vagus nerve in vivo during lethal endotoxemia in rats inhibited Tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) synthesis in liver preventing the development of shock. The vagal regulatory
      role of systemic inflammation after lung lobectomy is unknown.

    <measure>The postsurgical inflammatory response: the effect of vagus stimulation on proinflammatory interleukin concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>3 time points: 24 hour prior to Operation (baseline), 1st and 4th postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>changes of serum Interleukin (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, IL-1) concentrations in pg/ml from baseline and over the postsurgical course up to the 4th postoperative day in both study groups. The baseline is defined as the serum concentration of the target interleukins at 24 hours prior to surgery. Afterwards the changes in the interleukins concentrations will be measured on the 1st and 4th postoperative days in both groups in order to analyze the effect of vagus stimulation on the intensity of the postsurgical inflammatory response.</description>

    <time_frame>3 time points: 24 hour prior to Operation (baseline), 1st and 4th postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>changes of serum CRP concentrations in mg/L from baseline and over the postsurgical course up to the 4th postoperative day in both study groups. The baseline is defined as the serum concentration of CRP at 24 hours prior to surgery. Afterwards the changes in the interleukins concentrations will be measured on the 1st and 4th postoperative days in both groups in order to analyze the effect of vagus stimulation on the intensity of the postsurgical inflammatory response.</description>
