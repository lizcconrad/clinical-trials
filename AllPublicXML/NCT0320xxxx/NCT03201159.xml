  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug (VLX103) is being developed for the treatment of Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and
      other liver diseases. Alcoholic Steatohepatitis is an inflammatory (associated with
      irritation, swelling and cell damage) disease that affects the liver. It is associated with
      heavy and chronic intake of alcohol and presence of fat in the liver. Signs and symptoms
      often include fever, yellowing of the skin, nausea and impairment of liver function.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics (what the drug
      does to the body) and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is handled by the human body, like
      absorption and elimination) of increasing doses of VLX103 in subjects with moderate Alcoholic
      Steatohepatitis. In other words, we will evaluate how your body tolerates VLX103 at a
      specific dose and the effects that this VLX103 dose has on your liver and your body in
      general. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate if VLX103 has the potential
      to treat Alcoholic Steatohepatitis patients, to determine the maximum dose that can be
      tolerated, and to measure the levels of VLX103 in your blood at different time points during
      the study.

      VLX103 is an experimental drug. Experimental means that the drug has not been approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Alcoholic Steatohepatitis. The active
      ingredient in VLX103, pentamidine, is approved for treating parasitic (microorganisms)
      infections. Pentamidine is currently approved and marketed in about 20 countries, including
      the United States, for use by injection (administered by a syringe) and by inhalation
      (administered by a nebulizer) for other health conditions. However, VLX103 is the first oral
      form of pentamidine being developed, and is administered by mouth as an oral tablet.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multiple cohorts, dose escalation Phase Ib study, in which up to 3
      doses of VLX103 will be assessed for safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in well
      defined moderate ASH patients cohorts receiving increasing doses of VLX103. The overall study
      design is characteristic for early phase, first in patient clinical evaluation of safety and
      pharmacodynamics, especially when prudent dose escalation is recommended. A maximum of 18
      moderate ASH patients will be enrolled and treated in at least 4 clinical sites throughout
      the US. The open label nature of the study design will allow to efficiently monitor the
      safety of VLX103 throughout the trial, and taking rapid decisions about dosing adjustments
      (dose reduction or discontinuation within each dosing cohort, for each patient).

      After an adequate screening period (Day -7 to -1), all eligible patients of the first dosing
      cohort will receive the initial, low dose of VLX103 150 mg per day (QD) for 14 consecutive
      days. Subjects will be evaluated only for safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
      during this period. Pre-established safety criteria will be used to decide upon dose
      escalation, for each subject. If patients tolerate well VLX103 at 150 mg QD , a second cohort
      will then receive a 300 mg QD regimen for 14 days. At the end of this period, safety,
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics will be assessed as well. The next dose will be 450 mg
      QD for 14 days, with the same monitoring process. Long term safety will also be assessed, at
      all 3 doses, at Day 30 and 90 post treatment initiation.
