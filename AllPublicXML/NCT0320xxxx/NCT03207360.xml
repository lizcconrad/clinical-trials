  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to develop and test a novel psychosocial pain management
      intervention for patients with advanced cancer. It is hypothesized that the intervention will
      demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. The first aim is to develop
      a combined pain coping skills training and meaning-centered psychotherapy intervention. The
      second aim is to test the intervention's feasibility and acceptability as well as preliminary
      efficacy for improving primary outcomes (i.e., pain, pain interference, and meaning in life)
      and secondary outcomes. Two efficacious, theory-driven interventions will be integrated to
      address pain management by teaching pain coping skills with a novel emphasis on enhancing a
      sense of meaning in life. Participants will be patients with advanced cancer and
      moderate-to-severe pain. The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase I of the study will
      be intervention development. The intervention content will be guided by theory and mentoring
      from a team of leading experts in pain management and meaning-centered psychotherapy. Initial
      intervention content will be further informed by interviews with patients with advanced
      cancer. Content will then be refined through an iterative patient testing process. Phase II
      of the study will be a single-arm pilot trial testing the intervention. The intervention will
      be delivered in-person and consist of four, 45-to-60 minute therapy sessions. Study measures
      will be collected at baseline (0 weeks), immediately post-intervention (5 weeks), and 4-weeks
      post-intervention (9 weeks).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective pain management is a major healthcare concern for patients with advanced cancer.
      Compared to patients with early-stage disease, those with advanced cancer report higher
      levels of pain and greater functional impairment related to pain. There is a critical need
      for psychosocial pain management interventions that are specifically designed to address the
      suffering of patients with advanced cancer. The proposed study seeks to develop and assess
      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a novel integration of pain
      coping skills training and meaning-centered psychotherapy for patients with advanced cancer
      and moderate-to-severe pain.
