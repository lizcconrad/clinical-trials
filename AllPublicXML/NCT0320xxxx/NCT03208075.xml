    <textblock>
      The investigators have conducted the study about the effects of normal diet and
      low-phosphorus diet on phosphorus homeostasis in healthy subjects, now this study is designed
      to explore further about the effect of high-phosphorus diet on phosphorus homeostasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serum phosphate concentrations are not only associated with cardiovascular and all-cause
      mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, but also associated with the mortality in
      community population. Thus, maintaining normal serum phosphate and reducing postprandial
      fluctuation of serum phosphate are essential for healthy people.

      The investigators have conducted a study about the effects of normal diet (phosphorus 1500mg)
      and low-phosphorus diet (phosphorus 500mg) on phosphorus homeostasis in healthy men. The
      results showed low-phosphorus diet could significantly reduce serum phosphorus and urine
      phosphorus level compared to normal diet. However, the levels of serum FGF23 and a-klotho
      were not different between these two groups.Thus, the investigators want to further explore
      the effects of high-phosphorus diet (phosphorus 2300mg)on phosphorus homeostasis in healthy
      men.

      Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a crossover clinical study to evaluate the
      phosphorus homeostasis modulated by native normal diet, restricted phosphorus diet, high
      phosphorus diet and then to explore the underlying mechanisms.
