  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 B feasibility trial with Galunsertib, a TGFβ inhibitor, in combination with
      carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with newly diagnosed, persistent or recurrent
      carcinosarcoma of the uterus or ovary. The objective of the study is to determine whether
      this drug combination is safe for this patient population and to see if it is effective in
      shrinking cancers, keeping them from growing or helping patients live longer.

      Patients who consent to this study will receive treatment for four 28 day cycles unless they
      are unable to continue study treatment due to toxicity or disease progression. Paclitaxel and
      carboplatin will be given intravenously on day 1 of each cycle and galunisertib in pill form
      on days 4-17. No medicine will be given on days 17-28 of each cycle. Patients may have the
      option of continuing treatment with the study drug if they complete the 4 cycles the study
      requires. Subjects will receive tests and procedures that are part of regular cancer care as
      well as those required for the purposes of the study. Blood samples will be taken to monitor
      the level of study drug in the blood. Patients will have the option of allowing blood and
      tumor samples to be used for future research.
