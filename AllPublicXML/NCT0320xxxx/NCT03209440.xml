  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goal is to improve spiritual care outcomes for elderly patients with cancer.
      The study team will use a spiritual intervention, Dignity Therapy (DT), to help these
      patients maintain pride, find spiritual comfort, enhance continuity of self, and ultimately
      make meaning of their life threatening illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team propose a 3 arm pre/posttest, RCT with a 4-step (approximately 12 months per
      step), stepped-wedge design to compare effects of usual outpatient palliative care (usual
      care) and usual care along with either nurse-led or chaplain-led DT on patient outcomes,
      cancer prognosis awareness. The study team will assign 6 outpatient palliative care sites to
      usual care during the first-step, and randomly assign two sites per step to begin and
      continue DT led by either a nurse or a chaplain during each of the next 3 steps. During the
      usual care steps, 280 patients will complete pretest measures and satisfaction with
      palliative spiritual care services, receive usual palliative care, and complete posttest
      measures. During the experimental steps as part of routine palliative care service delivery,
      280 patients will complete pretest measures, receive nurse-led or chaplain-led DT, and
      complete posttest measures. Using mixed level analysis with site, provider (nurse, chaplain)
      and time (step) included in the model, the study team will compare the usual care and each of
      the DT groups for effects on dignity impact, existential tasks, and cancer prognosis
      awareness and explore the moderating effects of physical symptoms and spiritual distress. The
      study team will also determine the effect of usual care and DT on the patient's satisfaction
      with palliative spiritual care services and the report of the patient's unmet spiritual
      needs.

The items are scored on a 5-point scale from 'strongly disagree' (1) to 'strongly agree' (5). The Cronbach's α from a preliminary study was .85. Scores ranged from 7-35 in the DT group and 5-29 in the usual care group and showed sensitivity to DT effects at posttest with an effect size of 0.7; it was not measured at pretest, but we will do to increase power and potential for inferences.</description>

We have two outcomes because we are testing two interventions and will use appropriate statistical approach to avoid multiplicity.</description>

    <description>Palliative care nurses usually see patients each clinic visit to assess vital signs, function, symptoms, and to provide patient and family education. They document findings and interventions in the electronic health record (EHR). Whereas usual care for palliative care chaplaincy in the outpatient setting varies by site, chaplaincy care for usual care patients in this study will follow the usual practice for inpatient palliative care chaplaincy, which is to visit all new referrals to the clinic and assess their spiritual and religious needs. This assessment is then memorialized in a spiritual treatment plan documented in the EHR.</description>
