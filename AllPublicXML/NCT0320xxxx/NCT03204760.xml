    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a single dose of intramuscular
      dexamethasone versus 3 days of twice-daily oral prednisolone in the management of mild to
      moderate asthma exacerbations in children and test whether this single dose of intramuscular
      dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (max. 18 mg) is equal to prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (max. 40 mg) in the
      treatment of exacerbations of asthma in children, as measured by the Pediatric Respiratory
      Assessment Measure (PRAM).

      This study will be performed in Assiut university Children Hospital and will include patients
      with asthma exacerbations presented to the emergency department for three months. All
      children presenting to the emergency department with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations
      will be assessed to decide if the child needs treatment with salbutamol. Before starting
      treatment the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM), vital signs, and oxygen
      saturation will be recorded. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) will also be recorded if the
      patient was 6 years or older.

      Children with mild to moderate asthma exacerbation will be given the first dose of salbutamol
      and will be reassessed after 20 min by the emergency department attending. If further
      salbutamol is needed, subjects automatically will receive the second dose 20 min apart and
      receive either single dose of intramuscular dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg to a maximum of 18 mg)
      or oral prednisolone for 3 days (1 mg/kg to a maximum of 40 mg), given orally .

      A repeat physical examination will be performed, including oxygen saturation, vital signs,
      PRAM, PEFR after the 3rd dose of salbutamol and at the end of the third day to evaluate the
      effect of prednisolone and dexamethasone on the improvement of asthma scores. Patient
      compliance to prednisolone therapy for three days will be also recorded.

      This study will be performed in Pediatric hospital - Assiut university and will include
      patients with asthma exacerbations presented to the emergency department for three months.

    <description>The Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) , a validated, responsive and reliable tool to determine asthma severity in children aged 2 to 16 years, appears to be the most appropriate as an application in the emergency care setting .
The PRAM score consists of five components and has a maximum total of 12 points: suprasternal retractions (0 to 2), scalene muscle contraction (0 to 2), air entry (0 to 3), wheezing (0 to 3) and O2 saturation (0 to 2) .</description>

    <description>Dexamethasone is a long-acting glucocorticoid with a half-life of 36 to 72 hours . It has been used safely in children with croup and bacterial meningitis . It is well absorbed both orally and parenterally .Single dose of intramuscular dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg to a maximum of 18 mg).</description>

    <description>Prednisolone is relatively short acting with a half-life of 12 to 36 hours, thereby requiring daily dosing. Outpatient steroid therapy is effective once compliance is assured.. Prolonged treatment course, vomiting, and a bitter taste may reduce patient compliance with prednisolone. Oral prednisolone for 3 days (1 mg/kg to a maximum of 40 mg), given orally in two devided doses .</description>
