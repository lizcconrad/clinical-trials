  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current scientific literature, it is clear that SUI can cause several social, hygienic
      and personal relationship problems. It has also been proven that this condition affects many
      more menopausal women than menacme, and this is believed to be due to the hypoestrogenism
      characteristic of this phase.

      On the other hand, weakness of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) is also related to the genesis
      of SUI. The role of these muscles would be to keep the bladder neck elevated (above the pubic
      symphysis) during increases in abdominal pressure, and its weakness would lead to excessive
      lowering of the bladder neck at these times, leading to SUI due to bladder neck
      hypermobility.

      The conservative treatment of this condition, therefore, encompasses the strengthening of
      PFMs, which would avoid excessive descent of the bladder neck during increases in abdominal
      pressure, thereby reducing urinary loss.

      In the current literature there are studies proving the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle
      training; however, in relation to the literature on abdominal hipopressive gymnastics, it is
      observed that the scientific evidence is still poor, however, the technique is still Widely
      spread through extension courses offered throughout Latin America, France and Spain; With
      regard to the comparison of these methods with respect to their clinical efficacy and the
      quality of life and patient satisfaction, there are no consistent studies, and this fact
      motivated us to carry out this study.

    <description>The hipopressiva abdominal gymnastics group will be composed of randomized women who participated for 12 weeks of intervention, where it was performed in groups of a maximum of 4 patients, being performed respecting the basic sequence of the exercise proposed by Marcel Caufriez: 1) Inspiration, 2) Maximum Expiration, 3) Diaphragmatic aspiration being performed 3 series of 8 to 12 repetitions. The exercises will be performed in groups of a maximum of 4 patients, starting in the first 4 weeks with 3 sets of 8 repetitions in antigravity postures, with two lying postures and one sitting posture, and evolving over the next 4 weeks to 3 sets with 10 repetitions A lying posture, a sitting posture and orthostatic posture, in the last 4 weeks 3 sets of 12 repetitions in the gravitational postures, being a sitting posture and two orthostatic postures.</description>
