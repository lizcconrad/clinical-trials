    <textblock>
      The purpose of this matched comparison, multiple baseline study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a comprehensive youth-led sexual violence (SV) prevention program, Youth
      Voices in Prevention (Youth VIP). The prevention program builds on youth-adult partnerships
      among middle and high school students in Rapid City, South Dakota. Consenting students will
      take part in a youth summit where they will be trained as popular opinion leaders to spread
      SV prevention messages among middle and high school youth and parents. Following the summit,
      youth will work in small groups focused on different aspects of evidence-based prevention
      strategies including bystander intervention, social marketing messaging, parent education,
      norms change, and social emotional learning. Multiple research methods will be used to
      examine implementation process and cost. In addition, consenting students will take six
      surveys across three years including several surveys before programming begins, and several
      to document Youth VIP outcomes after prevention programming takes place. Survey data from a
      demographically similar community will be used to compare changes over time among youth in
      Rapid City, SD and youth a comparison city not implementing Youth VIP. All phases of the
      project will be implemented with collaboration from a Research Programming Advisory Board of
      community members and professionals from Rapid City, SD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sexual violence (SV) impacts adolescents at rates higher than most other age demographics.
      Although it is a critical public health issue for youth, there are few prevention initiatives
      that lead to reductions in SV. There is increasing recognition that SV prevention efforts may
      be most effective if youth are central to the development and implementation of such efforts.
      Problematically, there are no rigorously evaluated youth-led SV prevention efforts, and
      researchers also know little about the process by which youth create prevention initiatives.
      Teen UP (TU) is a youth-led initiative in Rapid City, SD that focuses on addressing a variety
      of public health issues, including awareness about SV. This &quot;homegrown&quot; initiative is well
      integrated in the community and is the ideal platform on which additional multi-level,
      evidence-based SV prevention strategies can be added. Researchers and SV prevention
      specialists at the University of New Hampshire, in partnership with Rape Prevention
      Education-funded agencies in South Dakota (SD) (i.e., Network Against Family Violence and
      Sexual Assault [The Network] and Working Against Violence Inc. [WAVI]), will work together
      along with a number of community stakeholders (e.g., educators, peers, elders) and expert
      consultants to enhance TU to include additional SV prevention strategies, a project titled
      Youth Voices in Prevention (Youth VIP). Although the plan for the programming enhancement
      will be refined based on feedback from the Research and Programming Advisory Board (RPAB) and
      data collected during the refinement and planning phase of the project, the current plan is
      to convene a youth summit where high school youth will be trained as popular opinion leaders
      to diffuse SV prevention messages in addition to youth joining a formal working group
      specific to a SV prevention strategy that also aligns with youth's career aspirations. A
      mixed method approach will be used to measure implementation processes, fidelity, and costs
      over time, and to assess the impact of Youth VIP on rates of sexual violence among middle and
      high school students and intermediate outcomes including positive bystander actions, and
      indicators of positive youth development. Collaboration with the community of students,
      parents, and professionals in Rapid City will be promoted by establishing a Research
      Programming Advisory Board (RPAB) that will meet monthly during the project.

      All students in grades 7 through 10 in the fall of 2017 will be invited to participate in two
      baseline and four follow-up surveys that will be given in school. Surveys will take place in
      fall and spring of each of three school years, and the cohort enrolled in fall of 2017 will
      be followed over time. Recruitment of students and parents is being done in close
      collaboration with the Rapid City Area School District. The investigators anticipate
      enrolling 4,000 students.

      A comparison community that is demographically similar to Rapid City but located in a
      neighboring state will enroll a cohort of 7th through 10th graders during the 2017-18 school
      year. These students will take three surveys, one each spring during the three years of the
      study. This school district will not receive Youth VIP. The investigators anticipate
      enrolling 1,000 students.

      Qualitative data related to implementation process and fidelity will be examined using
      content analysis. Continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (mean,
      standard deviation); categorical variables will be described with counts and percentages.
      Change scores and percent change scores will be calculated across several baseline time
      points as well as across two years of program implementation. Multilevel modeling will be
      used to examine changes among Rapid City students compared to students in the comparison
      community. One data set will be change across time at the individual level and another will
      be aggregated school-level data with the matched control school data merged in. Descriptive
      statistics will be conducted to evaluate the distributions of variables, testing for out of
      range values and outliers, and determining the need for transformation of non-normal
      distributions. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the measures for their
      psychometric properties for the current samples using exploratory and confirmatory factor
      analysis or structural equation modeling. Evaluation will include inspection of factor
      loadings, error variances, intercorrelations of factors, path coefficients and overall model
      fit. Additionally, the investigators will test for treatment differences in the total sample
      on key variables collected on each time point (e.g., gender, income, race/ethnicity, etc.).
      The investigators will calculate Horvitz-Thompson weights or propensity scores to adjust for
      bias in the models to compare treatment effects. For the primary outcome, SV rate of
      victimization and perpetration, the investigators will use mixed effect logistic regression
      models to estimate the difference of intervention and non-intervention groups
      (pre-intervention vs. post intervention in single case, multiple baseline design and
      treatment difference between intervention schools and matched non-intervention schools),
      adjusting by other background variables including social, demographics, and community-level
      characteristics. Secondary behavioral, dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed the same way SV
      perpetration and victimization are analyzed. The model can also be slightly altered to
      include time as a continuous variable to examine the trajectories of SV rate reduction as
      well as changes over time in intermediary and secondary outcomes as a function of Youth VIP
      exposure and engagement.

    <description>Youth VIP is a youth-led set of prevention strategies. Youth and their adult mentors are trained in evidence based sexual assault primary prevention strategies at a three day youth summit. The summit is followed by participation in working groups in which youth and their adult mentors will adapt best practices for sexual assault prevention to the Rapid City community and diffuse these strategies through both their own social networks and more formally in work in Rapid City middle and high schools.</description>
