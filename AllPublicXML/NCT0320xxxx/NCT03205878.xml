  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are less physically active than healthy controls.

      First choice of treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy with
      an improvement in oxygen saturation and sleep. No improvement on physical activity has been
      shown.

      The current study would randomize patients in a standard care group (CPAP) and an
      intervention group (CPAP + telecoaching). Telecoaching will be performed for 3 months, with
      physical activity assessment before, after 3 months and 12 years.
