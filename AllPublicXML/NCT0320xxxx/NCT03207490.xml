    <textblock>
      The major issue for a person who has suffered a stroke is the severe impairment affecting the
      hand and the high risk to have a poor recovery associated. Innovative approaches are needed
      in the next future, translating recent advances from neuro-engineering, into feasible devices
      for rehabilitation care. The FP7-EU project MYOSENS aims to translate known motor control
      logic from sEMG prosthetic control, to rehabilitation robotics. The target is to promote the
      closing of sensory-motor loop on the basis of intention to move, as detected from residual
      sEMG (i.e. Extensor Digitorum Communis, Flexor Digitorum Profundus).

      The objectives of this pilot study are:

        -  to assess whether a clinical and kinematic effect might be induced providing a
           closed-loop control by sEMG signal for robot (i.e. Amadeo Â®) assisted therapy of hand
           function

        -  to determine safety and feasibility of including robotic therapy into daily
           rehabilitation programs after stroke.

      A total of 20 patients has been recruited, all of them received on daily basis 1 hour of
      robot therapy in adjunction to 1 hour of standard therapy. Overall the hour of robotic
      therapy include both subject preparation (15 minutes to place surface electrodes on the
      forearm and set the right position of sitting and upper limb) and delivery of exercises. The
      treatment protocol includes passive and active training of flexion and extension movements of
      the fingers. The passive part lasts 5 minutes, while the active one provides 25 total minutes
      divided into 5 exercises. The robot therapy lasts 15 consecutive sessions, 5 times a week,
      for 3 weeks.

    <measure>Change at Reaching Performance Scale (RPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, then 3 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>RPS assesses the ability of subjects to reach an object (a cone). The cone is placed at both 4-cm (close) and 30-cm (far) distance from the subject. The subject is asked to reach and grab the cone if possible. The observer evaluates the quality of reaching instead of the grip strength (Total score = 36 points).</description>

    <measure>Change at Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, then 3 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity is measured using the MAS of five muscles: Pectoralis major, biceps, wrist flexors, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus (Total score = 20 points).</description>

    <measure>Change at Nine Hole Pegboard Test (NHPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment, then 3 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>NHPT measures the dexterity of the hand. Patient should insert 9 pins in the board. There are 9 pins. The number of pins inserted in 50 sec are registered or if the patient inserted 9 pins, then the time is registered.</description>
