  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a common syndrome caused by the body's response to an infection. Septic shock
      is responsible for 10% of all ICU admissions and 30% of ICU deaths. Use of &quot;beta blocker&quot;
      medications may improve outcomes after septic shock. This pilot study evaluates protocols to
      infuse the beta blocker esmolol in patients with septic shock.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, feasibility study of esmolol infusion in septic shock. The
      objective is to evaluate the feasibility, adequacy, and efficiency of study protocols for a
      subsequent ECASSS study. This study (ECASSS-R2) extends observations made in an initial
      pilot, ECASSS-R.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years

          2. Within 72 hours of admission to the ICU and septic shock (sepsis present at time of
             admission)

             a. Septic shock defined by SEPSIS-3 consensus criteria as i. Suspected or documented
             infection ii. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score increased by at least 2
             points over baseline iii. Lactate &gt; 2mmol/L iv. Receiving vasopressors to treat
             hypotension after at least 20 ml/kg intravenous crystalloid volume expansion

          3. Receiving vasopressors through a central venous catheter for more than 60 minutes.

          4. Arterial catheter in place or expected to be placed imminently.

          5. Heart rate &gt; 90/min while receiving vasopressors for more than 60 minutes.

          6. Adequately volume expanded, as manifest by any of the following, performed as part of
             routine clinical care (i.e., no study procedures will be performed before signed
             consent). If none of these measures are clinically available, the clinical attending
             must confirm that volume expansion is adequate. (After enrollment, a final safety
             check will confirm the adequacy of volume expansion.)

               1. Central venous pressure (CVP) &gt; 15 mm Hg.

               2. Negative Passive-Leg Raise (PLR) maneuver (&lt;10% increase in cardiac output after
                  PLR).

               3. No cardiac output response (&lt;10% increase) after rapid infusion (&lt;5 min) of 250
                  ml of IV crystalloid (i.e., a graded volume expansion challenge [GVEC]).

               4. Inferior vena cava (IVC) plethora

               5. For patients who happen to be breathing passively (i.e., paralyzed or deeply
                  sedated) on a positive pressure mechanical ventilator delivering at least 8 ml/kg
                  tidal volumes and in normal sinus rhythm, stroke volume variability &lt;13% (such
                  patients are acknowledged to be uncommon; the protocol does not recommend or
                  require the induction of passive breathing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lack of informed consent.
