    <textblock>
      Alendronate (ALN), commonly use bisphosphonates is proposed to have osteostimulative
      properties in vivo and in vitro, as shown by an increase in the matrix formation, and acts as
      a potent inhibitor of bone resorption. AV widely known for its wound healing, analgesic,
      antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, immune boosting and significant
      anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aims to explore the efficacy of 1% ALN and AV
      gel as a local drug delivery as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the
      treatment of degree II furcation defects

      gel as a local drug delivery as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the
      treatment of degree II furcation defects.

      Methods: Ninety patients with mandibular buccal class II furcation defects were randomly
      allocated into three treatment groups: SRP plus placebo gel (group 1), SRP plus 1% ALN gel
      (group 2) and SRP plus AV gel (group3). Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at
      baseline and gel were delivered at respective site. Then again all clinical and radiographic
      parameters were recorded after 6 and 12 months from baseline.
