      Drs. from the Mayo Clinic Rochester will plan and execute a feasibility study of the phase I
      prototype version of the Virtual Reality exposure therapy system. Dr. X, who has significant
      experience in evaluating patient experiences and opinions of technologies intended to change
      behavior, will oversee a qualitative study to examine the prototype system. Twenty children
      with generalized anxiety disorder with perfectionism who have received less than 3 treatment
      sessions and a parent will be recruited to pilot the Virtual Reality system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty children with generalized anxiety disorder (perfectionism) who have received less than
      3 treatment sessions and a parent will be recruited to pilot the Virtual Reality system.
      Participants will be identified through the Mayo Clinic Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Clinic
      (PADC) using purposive sampling methods. Each patient will participate in a single (up to)
      2-hour visit, allowing for breaks as needed. Staff from Mayo Clinic HealthCare Policy &amp;
      Research experienced in qualitative data analysis and not involved with the patients' medical
      care or development of the prototype system will conduct the study visits. During the first
      30 minutes the patient and parent will be introduced to the Virtual Reality system and the
      rationale for this feasibility study. Next, a therapist from the PADC, all of whom are
      experienced exposure therapists, will lead the patient through exposure exercises using the
      Virtual Reality system for up to 30 minutes. During the next period, up to 30 minutes, the
      therapist will go to a different room and the patient, with support from their parent, will
      complete exposure exercises using the Virtual Reality system that the therapist directed them
      to complete. During the exposures the interviewer will observe, code and record the patient's
      interaction with the Virtual Reality system. The data from the Virtual Reality system will be
      automatically transmitted to a cloud service running on a local laptop to study the
      effectiveness of the system's automatic logging capabilities. For the remaining time (up to
      30 minutes) the interviewer will interview the patient about his or her experience with the
      Virtual Reality system and then will ask for observations and opinions from the parent.
