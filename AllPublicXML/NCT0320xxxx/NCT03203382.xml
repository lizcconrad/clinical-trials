  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are suspected of or diagnosed with Sjogren's disease will be evaluated for
      ocular symptoms and corneal nerve morphology. We are specifically interested in the
      relationship between Vitamin D level and aberrations in the morphology of the corneal nerves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with either suspected or confirmed diagnosis of Sjogren's disease will be recruited
      to participate. Participation will involve the completion of a brief survey (the OSDI),
      corneal evaluation with an aesthesiometer, corneal staining with fluorescein and lissamine
      green, and finally measurement of tear-film breakup time. In addition, participants will have
      their corneal nerve morphology evaluated with the Heidelberg confocal microscope and finally
      they will have a blood draw performed to assess vitamin D level.
