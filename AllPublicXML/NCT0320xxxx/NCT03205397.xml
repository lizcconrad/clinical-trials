  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, during surgery, only 4% of parents are present at induction, most often for
      children with disabilities with iterative interventions. Some studies have shown that the
      presence of parents during induction decreases the anxiety of children, while others do not.
      Their conclusions all advocate preparing parents for this presence in the operating room in
      an accompanying course.
