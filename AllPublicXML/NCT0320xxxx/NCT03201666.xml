      This diagnostic test is aimed to compare the Karyotyping, CMA and NIPT for prenatal
      diagnosing chromosomal anomalies. Pregnant women who needed prenatal genetic diagnosis meted
      the study criterion; fetal amniotic fluid was regular examined by Karyotyping and CMA, and
      maternal peripheral blood was collected for NIPT detecting. And the CMA result as a golden
      standard, the main outcome is compared the diagnostic efficacy of NIPT for diagnosing
      chromosomal anomalies.

      Aim: to compare the Karyotyping, CMA and NIPT for prenatal diagnosing chromosomal anomalies.

      Design: diagnostic test Set: Prenatal diagnosis center of Taizhou City Study population: The
      Pregnant women who needed amniocenteses for prenatal genetic diagnosis were recruited.

      Methods: amniotic fluid was regular examined by Karyotyping and CMA, and maternal peripheral
      blood was used for collected for NIPT detecting.

      Statistic: CMA result as a golden standard, the main outcome is compared the diagnostic
      efficacy of NIPT for diagnosing chromosomal anomalies.
