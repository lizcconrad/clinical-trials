    <textblock>
      Pegylated interferon α-2a(Peg-IFN-α) not only inhibit viral replication, but also play an
      important role in immune regulation, while Nucleoside analog(ue) drugs only inhibit viral
      replication. In hepatitis B infection, CD4+T Cells are the main effector cells in adaptive
      immune response. This study was aimed at investigating the changes of CD4+T Cells frequency
      and function, and the expression of costimulatory molecules during Peg-IFN-αand nucleoside
      analog(ue) therapy.Meanwhile, the investigators want to verify whether Peg IFN - alpha
      suppressed the virus and the reduction of virus led to the recovery of CD4+T Cells function,
      or Peg IFN - alpha enhanced CD4+T Cells function which gave rise to the decline of the virus.

      Pegylated interferon α-2a(Peg-IFN-α)and Nucleoside analog(ue) drugs can inhibit viral
      replication , but Peg-IFN-α also play an important role in immune regulation . In hepatitis B
      infection, CD4+T Cells are the main effector cells in adaptive immune response.Peg-IFN-α
      recommended as the first-line treatment has a higher chance to achieve HBeAg seroconversion
      and even HBsAg disappearance than nucleoside analog(ue) drugs, which may be related to the
      functional activation of CD4+T Cells in the case of hepatitis and the function enhancement of
      CD4+T Cells during Peg-IFN-α therapy. This study was aimed at investigating the changes of
      CD4+T Cells frequency and function, and the expression of costimulatory molecules during
      Peg-IFN-αand nucleoside analog(ue) therapy.Meanwhile, the investigators want to explore
      whether the decline of HBsAg and HBeAg resulted in recovery of CD4+T cells function, or
      recovery of CD4+T Cells function led to the decrease of HBsAg and HBeAg. Several studies
      demonstrated that HBsAg and HBeAg could damage CD4+T cells function, and the loss of HBsAg
      and HBeAg led to recovery of CD4+T cells function.
