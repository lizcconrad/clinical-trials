  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to expand the evidence base of neuropsychological services in the
      context of medical management of epilepsy, examining whether treatment outcome and patient
      satisfaction with medical care are significantly improved when neuropsychological evaluation
      is included as an additional component of medical care within a comprehensive epilepsy
      center. All participants will complete an initial survey and a follow-up survey regarding
      views towards their epilepsy treatment. Participants will be randomized into one of two
      groups. One group will be given a neuropsychological battery in addition to the survey. The
      primary study hypothesis is that the addition of neuropsychological services to
      treatment-as-usual will result in significant improvements in (a) satisfaction with medical
      care, (b) patient perceived treatment outcome, and (c) physician-rated medical compliance.
      The secondary hypothesis is that participants who undergo neuropsychological evaluation will
      be generally satisfied with their experience with neuropsychological services.
