        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of advanced melanoma (histologically confirmed
             stage III [unresectable] or stage IV skin, ocular, or mucosal melanoma)

          -  Newly initiated with nivolumab monotherapy as their first-line therapy for previously
             untreated advanced melanoma between June 2015 and June 2016

          -  At least 18 years of age at time of treatment decision

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a current primary diagnosis of a cancer other than advanced melanoma ie,
             a cancer other than melanoma that requires systemic or other treatment

          -  Patients currently included in an interventional clinical trial for his/her locally
             advanced or metastatic melanoma. Patients who have completed their participation in an
             interventional trial; or who are not receiving study drug anymore and who are only
             followed-up for overall survival can be enrolled. In case of a blinded study, the
             treatment arm (ie, type of administered treatment) needs to be known.

          -  Patients &lt; 18 years of age at time of treatment initiation

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply
