    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety of the
      low level laser MC-8XL device treatment in subjects with an unsuccessfully treated Diabetic
      Foot Ulcer (DFU) that has been present for at least 3 months.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to either Treatment group or Control group, following
      which, treatment of each subject will be provided by a qualified nurse at the clinic or in
      the home setting, everyday for up to 16 weeks.

      Study assessments and adverse events monitoring will be also performed throughout the study.

    <intervention_name>MC-8XL low level laser device and Standard wound care</intervention_name>
    <description>The MC-8XL, a handheld Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) device, comprised of an infrared laser diode that generates wavelength of 808 nm and a green laser diode with a wavelength of 525 nm will be used to treat the experimental group.
Along with the active LLLT, generally accepted standard wound care procedures will be used during the clinical trial by a qualified study nurse or doctor. These procedures will include wound cleaning and drying before irradiation with the laser device (sham or active). Each ulcer will be also assessed and debrided if needed.
After irradiation, each ulcer will be dressed with saline gauze dressing and offloaded.</description>

    <description>The Sham device is of similar appearance, emitting only green light for indication with a wavelength of 525 nm of a low power, with inactive IR laser which will be used in the Control group.
Along with the sham device, the same generally accepted standard wound care procedures will be used.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Immeasurable wounds or wounds that are unsuited to this laser treatment (usually due
             to the wound's location, e.g. in the area between the toes).

          -  Presence of any suspicious pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions, or having cancer.

          -  Being on medications that are immunosuppressive, may affect peripheral blood flow or
             may affect normal wound healing.

          -  Being on medications that might cause photosensitivity.
