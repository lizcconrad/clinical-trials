  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alveolar bone is a bony portion surrounding the root of a tooth. The alveolar bone disappears
      gradually when the tooth is extracted. This bone loss often becomes a problem if a patient
      wants to close the missing tooth space with orthodontic treatments (braces), or to get a
      dental implant (a metal post replacing a tooth). Therefore, we would like to place small
      screws at the extraction sites to preserve the alveolar bone when the teeth need to be
      extracted and a patient cannot start treatments some time.

      Mini-screws (small metal screws) are routinely used for regular orthodontic treatment. We
      will recruit patients who require extractions of two upper small molars (maxillary premolars)
      on both right and left sides. We will place one mini-screw on one side while the other side
      will be untouched after teeth extractions. Both sides will be followed at 4 months and 8
      months for examinations.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of transcortical mini-screws on ridge
      preservation following tooth extraction with a split mouth design. The study will evaluate
      clinical and radiographic outcomes following transcortical screw placements at extraction
      sites compared to non-treated extraction sites.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the clinical outcomes between the treated sites with a
      transcortical screw (the experimental group) and the non-treated sites (the control group)
      Null Hypothesis: There will be no differences in clinical parameters between the two groups.

      Approach: The investigators will conduct a prospective split-mouth design clinical study. The
      investigators will compare the clinical changes in vertical bone height and horizontal bone
      width at 4 months and 8 months from baseline (tooth extraction).

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the radiographic outcome between the experimental group and the
      control group Null Hypothesis: There will be no difference in alveolar ridge height and width
      between the two groups.

      Approach: The study will measure ridge height and width using cone beam computed tomography
      (CBCT) at baseline and 8 months.
