  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesalazine, steroid, immunosuppressants and biologic agents are main medical treatments in
      treating inflammatory bowel diseases. Yet some patients develop severe side effects or
      initial invalid to conventional therapies. Some studies have already showed that tarcolimus
      and methotrexate are both effective in inducing and maintaining disease remission. Here we
      conduct a retrospective study to compare the efficancy of tarcolimus and methotrexate in
      treating refractory inflammatory bowel diseases as rescue therapy.
