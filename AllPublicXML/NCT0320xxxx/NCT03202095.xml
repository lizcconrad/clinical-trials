      The investigators hypothesize that the administration of a widely available, naturally
      occurring dietary supplement, creatine monohydrate, will reduce the severity of depression in
      individuals with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to determine whether 12 weeks
      of creatine supplementation is an effective treatment for depression in individuals with type
      2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Depression is a debilitating illness associated with diminished quality of life and
      significant personal and societal costs. Depression is twice as common in those with type 2
      diabetes compared to the general population. Antidepressants are commonly prescribed as
      treatment for depression; however, they may not be the optimal treatment for people with type
      2 diabetes. Creatine has been shown to decrease symptoms of depression in many types of
      individuals when used over the course of 8 weeks or more. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether creatine can decrease symptoms of depression in individuals with type 2
      diabetes when taken daily for 12 weeks. This study also investigates how creatine impacts
      brain chemistry as creatine decreases depressive symptoms.
