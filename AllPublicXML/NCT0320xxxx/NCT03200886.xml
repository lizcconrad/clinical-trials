  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint (TMJ), also called rhizarthrosis is a common
      disease, mostly affecting post-menopausal women. Intra-articular therapy with hyaluronic acid
      (HA) was usually recommended as a second-line treatment after failure of non-pharmacological
      modalities, only in early stages of the disease .Aim of the present observational,
      retrospective, comparative study is the assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of i.a.
      injections of an hybrid HA formulation (Synovial H-L®) in comparison to triamcinolone in
      patients with TMJ Osteoarthritis (OA). We are analyzing the records collected in the
      departmental archives of outpatients affected by TMJ OA, according to the ACR criteria for
      the classification for hand OA and who were treated with i.a. Sinovial H-L or triamcinolone
      acetonide from December 1st, 2015 to December 1st 2016.The patient's assessment of
      spontaneous hand pain on a 0-100 mm VAS with 0 representing the absence of pain and the FIHOA
      score validated in Italian language were routinely recorded and documented in our centre
      prior to the injections (T0), at the time of the second i.a. administration (T1), after one
      month (T2) and after 3 (T3) and 6 months (T4) following the i.a. therapy.

      The primary outcome criteria of our study is the change of VAS and FIHOA from baseline to the
      end of treatment. Furthermore, we chose as secondary outcomes the duration of morning
      stiffness, the Italian version of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the validated
      Italian version of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) routinary registered
      in our medical record before the i.a. therapy, at the end of the treatment and after 1, 3 and
      6 months.

      The chi square test, t test or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriated, will be used to evaluate
      differences between groups before i.a. treatment the clinical and demographical data.

      Mixed-effects linear regression models will be used to evaluate temporal trends and
      differences in the two groups for specific outcomes: VAS pain, VAS stiffness, FIHOA and PCS
      and MCS from SF-36 questionnaires. In these types of statistical models, the effects of the
      covariates and their standard errors are correctly estimated taking into account the
      hierarchical structure of the data (i.e., patients and visits). For the compute of SF-36s Z
      score will be used mean and SD of U.S. general population. Data analysis will be performed
      using Stata vers 13.0 software. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data as
      frequencies (categorical variables) or mean +/-SD (continuous variables) as appropriate. P
      values &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant.
