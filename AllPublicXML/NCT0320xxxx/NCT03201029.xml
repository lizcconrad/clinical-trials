  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a physician, narrowing ones' practice to a particular pathology or group of people is
      common. Dermatologists are able to concentrate within a number of different areas: cancer,
      cosmetics, pediatrics or ethnic populations to name a few. Recently, there has been an
      emphasis on developing skin of color (SOC) clinics and recruiting dermatologists who focus on
      skin diseases that effect patients with skin of color. In this study, patients with SOC is
      defined to encompass that of persons of African, Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern, and
      Hispanic backgrounds. An emphasis on SOC benefits patients in a variety of ways: 1) these
      dermatologists are trained to recognize pathology that may present differently, depending on
      the Fitzpatrick skin type and ethnicity of the patient, 2) these dermatologists are trained
      to address medical disparities that are present among patients with SOC, 3) these
      dermatologists are trained to address culturally sensitive topics that may be common among
      patients with SOC. Despite the growing number of SOC patients and the benefit that SOC
      clinics provide, studies have not looked at the characteristics that influence dermatologists
      to focus on SOC as opposed to other specialty areas. Therefore, we aim to identify
      information that may influence dermatologists to focus on skin disease prevalent among
      patients with SOC.

      Currently, there are nine academic institutions with an Ethnic Skin Center in the United
      States. Given the limited number of academic centers with a designated center focused on SOC,
      a lot of care of skin of color patients happens in private practices. This is supported by
      the fact that many of the members in the Skin of Color Society are dermatologists in private
      practices. Thus, SOC clinic is defined broadly in our study to encompass not only academic
      dermatologists but also private practice dermatologists who have special interest in care of
      skin of color patients. Regardless of the type of practice, we hope to identify unique
      characteristics of dermatologists focusing on SOC skin diseases.

      Dermatologists who are members of the Skin of Color Society practicing in the US will be sent
      a recruitment letter in the mail that includes a description of the study and paper survey.
      The survey will collect participant first and last name so the research team can track
      replies. Participant first and last name will not be transferred from the surveys and not
      used in data analysis. Even though it is likely that there are dermatologists with practices
      involving skin of color patients or with interest in skin of color patients who are not
      members of the Skin of Color Society, we believe that this will be a representative group of
      physicians with this interest. We do not believe we will experience significant bias.
      Duration of the subjects' involvement will be approximately 10 minutes. The total participant
      recruitment period will be approximately 8 weeks. Quantitative survey responses will be
      compiled, coded, and entered into a statistical program.
