    <textblock>
      This study will define the impact of a probiotic supplement on microbiome, immune system, and
      metabolic syndrome. This study will determine the degree to which a probiotic supplement can
      1) improve metabolic markers and metrics of metabolic syndrome, 2) alter microbiota
      composition and function, 3) impact microbiota metabolites, short-chain fatty acids—potential
      normalizers of metabolic and immune dysfunction, and 4) regulate immune status and function
      including reducing chronic, systemic inflammation as assessed by high dimensional immune
      profiling.

    <textblock>
      The centrality of the gut microbiota to human health has emerged in just the last decade,
      with the last three years implicating our modern, deteriorated gut microbiota in numerous
      chronic diseases. It is likely dietary changes in the last half-century consistent with
      adoption of the Western diet have had an adverse impact on the gut microbiota. A critically
      important next step in this field of research is to identify how different probiotic
      supplements can potentially restore the microbiota in alignment with the optimization of
      human health, particularly in regard to the reversal or prevention of chronic diseases
      including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. This study is designed
      to elicit and contrast the amount of increase in microbiota diversity and related metabolic
      output achievable following consumption of a probiotic supplement commonly available to the
      general population. The results could contribute to dietary recommendations for reversing the
      chronic disease epidemics of westernization.
