  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paronychia is inflammation of the skin surrounding the nail that leads to secondary
      infection. Iatrogenic paronychia has been clearly associated with cancer chemotherapies. This
      phase-2 trial is a dose finding study and will evaluate topical VBP-926 solution against a
      vehicle control.

    <intervention_model_description>Once subjects have been determined to be eligible for participation in the study, they will be randomized to one of the three treatment arms. The randomization number will be generated according to the randomization schedule prepared prior to the start of the study. Participants will be assigned to receive assign treatment solution VBP-926 (either lower or higher concentration) or vehicle in 1:1:1 ratio using the IWRS system.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The randomization will be done centrally by a randomization programmer/statistician who will be the only un-blinded participant. That person will not have any part in the decisions regarding patient populations and/or protocol violations.</masking_description>
