  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this research is to develop an efficacious training paradigm to
      enhance stroke survivors' defense mechanisms against falls and possibly reduce healthcare
      cost. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the direct medical cost for
      fall related injuries to be $34 billion annually. Forty percent to 70% of community-dwelling
      stroke survivors experience detrimental falls each year and tend to have 1.5 to 4 times
      higher risk of hip fracture than their healthy counterparts; with only less than 40% of those
      individuals regaining independent mobility. Falls, thus not only affect activities of daily
      living but also reduce mobility, increase risk of second stroke and mortality. Despite
      potential financial and functional implications of falls in this population, health-care
      personnel are limited in their ability to develop and validate interventions to reduce
      fall-risk for them. Further emphasis is placed on locomotor training with focus on enhancing
      paretic limb function. The project design consists of a randomized controlled trial to
      examine the ability of chronic stroke survivors to acquire, generalize and retain adaptations
      to slip-perturbation training for not only mitigating fall risk but also improving walking
      function. It also explores translation of this paradigm to the sub-acute population. The
      paradigm is novel in that it targets contributions of the paretic vs. non-paretic limbs on
      fall-risk through a bilateral training paradigm that involves training the non-paretic side
      first and then paretic to facilitate acquisition of fall-prevention skills on the paretic
      side, which may otherwise take longer to acquire training effects. The longer-term benefits
      of such perturbation training, targeting both limbs for reducing falls will be assessed not
      only in the laboratory but also in real life via wearable sensors, along with improved
      community walking function. The hypothesis of this study if supported by the results will
      provide an evidence-supported training protocol to reduce the fall-risk not only in people
      living with hemiparetic stroke but also among survivors of other acquired unilateral cortical
      lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year and 689,450 reported having short
      and long-term disabilities leading to dependence in activities of daily living. It has been
      reported that stroke survivors experienced detrimental falls each year and most occurring
      during walking. The likelihood of experiencing a fall upon discharge from rehabilitation
      being significantly higher than during the rehabilitative phase. Falls resulting from
      environmental perturbations such as slips contribute to a significant percentage of these
      falls. Hence, it is important to develop innovative and effective paradigms for fall-risk
      reduction in chronic as well as sub-acute stroke survivors. The purpose of this research is
      to understand the effect of bilateral slip-perturbation training protocol targeting training
      both paretic vs. non-paretic limbs on fall-risk reduction and prevention. Also, to find its
      effect on increasing community ambulation in community dwelling stroke survivors.

      Participants in this study will be individuals with chronic (&gt; 6 months) hemiparesis
      following stroke or individuals with sub-acute stroke (&gt; 6weeks and &lt; 6 months), ambulatory
      (with or without assistive device) and more than 21 years of age. Subjects will be screened
      for the inclusion criteria. If subjects pass the screening, they will go through the full
      clinical balance assessment and laboratory dynamic stability test. The chronic stroke
      survivors will be randomized into two groups: - Group A: Slip training group; Group B:
      Control group. While, the sub-acute stroke survivors will be randomized into two groups: -
      Group C: Slip training group; Group D: Control group.

      For the slip training groups (A and C), all subjects' normal walking pattern and their
      recovery responses to slip will be recorded with a motion tracking system (including
      videotaping) while they walk across an instrumented area along a straight path in the lab. A
      slip will be induced after a subject steps on a low-friction platform.

      For the chronic stroke subjects, baseline activity monitoring using wearable sensors will be
      performed for up to four weeks prior to the training session followed by activity monitoring
      for 12 months. While for the sub-acute stroke subjects, it would be done for 6 months.

      For groups A and B, the follow-up stability test will be at 6 and 12 months post-training
      session, which will consist only of one slip induced on the training side and contralateral
      side. For groups C and D, follow-up session is 6 months post training session.

      Incidence of falls and physical activity will be monitored between training and re-test
      sessions through falls, activity monitoring-questionnaire to describe details of the falls
      and through the wearable sensors for groups A, B, C and D.

    <description>Perturbation is induced successfully and safely to reproduce inadvertent falls in a protective laboratory environment. Falls will be measured by amount of force recorded on the load cell attached to the ceiling mounted safety harness system donned by the participant. Instability of the body's COM and poor limb support prior to touchdown of the recovery step account for 90~100% of subsequent falls (occurring ~500ms later) in both sit-to-stand-slip and in gait-slip, in the laboratory settings.</description>

    <description>Slips will be induced by a low-friction platform (65×30×0.6 cm, μ&lt;0.05) embedded side-by-side in the walking path, set nearly flush with the floor surround. The moveable platform, mounted on top of a pair of force platforms (AMTI, Newton, MA) for measuring ground reaction forces is firmly locked in a stationary position. An unannounced release occurs at heel strike of the perturbed, without the knowledge of subject, after which the platform is free to slide up to 150 cm. The mechanical release is controlled by the loading on the force platforms and the computer.</description>
