  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been great interest in recent years to take advantage of stem cells to treat liver
      cirrhosis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been shown to be safe and effective for liver
      diseases in some studies. Randomization controlled studies are needed to confirm the long
      term effect of MSC treatment for liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to investigate the safety
      and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in hepatitis B and C related liver cirrhosis patients.

      This study is an open-label multicenter randomized control study. Patients with with
      decompensated cirrhosis will be randomly assigned to receive MSC treatment plus standard
      medical care(treatment）or standard medical care (control). Three times of MSC infusion
      (1x10E6 cells/kg body weight) via peripheral vein will be given to the experimental group
      (once in 4 weeks). The primary outcome is absolute change in liver function indexes and and
      scores. Secondary outcomes are cirrhosis-related complications, symptoms, life quality, and
      survival.
