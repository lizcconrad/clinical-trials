  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the efficacy of BGB-A317 assessed by Independent Review Committee
      (IRC) in subjects with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), as measured
      by Overall Response Rate (ORR) per the Lugano Classification
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center and multi-national Phase 2
      study.Approximately 68 with confirmed CHL would be enrolled.

      Response will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan per the Lugano Classification.
      Computed tomography scan with contrast will occur as required by protocol, until progressive
      disease (PD), new anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, death, lost to follow-up, or
      end of study (EOS), whichever occurs first. Total body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
      allowed if CT with contrast is contraindicated. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT may be
      used in lieu of a CT with contrast only if the CT of the PET/CT has been performed with
      diagnostic quality and contrast is administered.

      During treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor such as with BGB-A317, pseudo-progression
      may occur due to immune cell infiltration and other mechanisms as manifested by apparent
      increase of existing tumor masses or appearance of new tumor lesions. Subjects are allowed to
      continue study treatment if there is suspicion of pseudo-progression, provided they are
      asymptomatic and have radiographic progression only, until a second consecutive CT scan
      demonstrates PD at which time study treatment will be discontinued permanently.

      Subjects will be evaluated for AEs (all Grades per National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 [NCI CTCAE v. 4.03]), serious AEs
      (SAEs), and any AEs requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation.

      The Safety Population includes all subjects who received any dose of BGB-A317. This will be
      the population for the safety analyses. The modified Safety Population includes all subjects
      in the Safety Population who had confirmed cHL. This will be the population for the efficacy
      analyses.

      The Per-protocol Population (PP) includes subjects who received any dose of BGB-A317 and had
      no major protocol deviations. Criteria for exclusion from the PP will be determined and
      documented before the database lock for the primary analysis. This will be the secondary
      analysis population for efficacy analysis. The PK population includes all subjects who whom
      valid BGB-A317 PK parameters can be estimated.
