  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the use of DiabetesFlex in diabetes
      care compared to standard care in relation to patient involvement and relevance for specific
      group of persons with T1DM.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of DiabetesFlex will lead to a higher degree of
      patient in-volvement, improved glycaemic control and a decrease in total number of
      consultations compared to standard care. Furthermore, the investigators aim to identify if a
      specific sub-population within the T1DM population will benefit significantly from the
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition, and provision of individual and effective
      diabetes care is a major challenge. The is a lack of evidence on the optimal frequency of
      attending outpatient clinics for persons with T1DM.

      The use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in diabetes care area are limited and none
      existing in a Danish context. This includes studies, which combine PRO measure with diabetes
      management, patient involvement and self-management.

      The study will generate knowledge and directions for ways to reframe and to optimize the
      future management of diabetes care.

    <description>In DiabetesFlex intervention, patients are offered 3 consultations/year. One mandatory consultations (30 minutes). The patient, an endocrinologist and a diabetes nurse attend.
Two optional consultations, patients can choose between face-to-face consultations, a telephone consultation or to cancel the consultation.
Ahead of the consultations, patients fill out the AmbuFlex Diabetes questionnaire and deliver a blood and urine sample.
Based on the patient's response to the AmbuFlex Diabetes questionnaire, the result of the blood sample and the urine sample, the diabetes nurse assign the patient to a face-to-face consultation, a telephone consultation or no consultation with an endocrinologist, a diabetes nurse or a dietician.</description>

    <description>Standard diabetes care consists of 3 consultations (15 minutes)/year with a physician or a diabetes nurse by turns.
Ahead of the consultation patients send in a blood sample for measuring HgA1c, urine sample for measuring urin-albumin creatinin ratio and other blood samples depending of arrangements made in the last consultation.
Once a year in relation to a consultation, patients fill in the Problem Area In Diabetes (PAID) (20) scale together. Furthermore, based on the patients or healthcare professional judgement, patients see a dietician when needed.</description>

Questions concerning: HgA1c, home-based blood pressure monitoring, incidents of hypoglycemia, diabetes complications, regular eye check, regular food check, erectile dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy, The PAID scale, Topics patients may want to talk with the health care professional about, the patient's evaluation of the need for diabetes care.
