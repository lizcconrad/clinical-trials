      This is an open label, single arm study of midostaurin in patients with relapsed or
      refractory AML.

    <textblock>
      Clinical trials have shown that the multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin improves survival in
      patients with AML. The main objective of this study is to investigate its effect (in
      conjunction with cytarabine) on progression free survival, as well as overall survival and
      morphologic response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. This study will also
      attempt to identify specific populations of patients with relapsed or refractory AML who best
      respond to treatment with midostaurin to enhance treatment planning.

    <description>Treatment will consist of 3 phases: induction (a 28-42 day cycle), followed by consolidation (up to 4 cycles), and lastly maintenance (up to 24 cycles). Each cycle in the consolidation and maintenance phases will last 28 days. Patients will proceed from one phase to the next if they have achieved or maintained a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery by International Working Group 2003 response criteria. Patients may receive a allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant between the end of the induction phase and the start of the maintenance phase.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to registration on the study
             and the ability for the subject to adhere to the study visit schedule and all the
             study-related procedures.

          -  A diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML. For the purpose of this study, refractory
             AML is defined as failure to achieve CR after one cycle of induction chemotherapy and
             relapsed AML is defined as any evidence of disease recurrence after achieving CR of
             any duration.

          -  Both males and females ≥ eighteen years of age

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥ 70% or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             performance status &lt; 2 (unless poor performance status is related to the disease).

          -  Adequate organ function defined as:

          -  AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN),

          -  Serum bilirubin &lt; 2.5 x ULN, and

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min.

          -  Laboratory values can be outside of this range if secondary to AML disease.

          -  An ejection fraction of &gt; 45% confirmed by echocardiogram.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than one month.

          -  Subjects who previously received midostaurin are allowed if the last dose of
             midostaurin was given ≥ six months prior to disease relapse.

          -  Females who are non-pregnant and non-nursing.

          -  Females of reproductive age and males must agree to avoid getting pregnant or to
             father a child while on therapy and for five months after the last dose of
             chemotherapy.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must either agree to continued abstinence
             from heterosexual intercourse or begin one of the following acceptable methods of
             birth control: IUD, tubal ligation, or partner must use a latex condom during any
             sexual contact, even if the partner has undergone a successful vasectomy. Hormonal
             contraception is an inadequate method of birth control.

          -  Males must use a latex condom during any sexual contact with WOCBP, even if they have
             undergone a successful vasectomy (while on therapy and for five months after the last
             dose of chemotherapy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ of seventy-six years.

          -  Subjects with the inability to swallow oral medications.

          -  Clinical evidence of active CNS leukemia.

             (HSCT).

          -  Subjects must not have any uncontrolled or intercurrent illness including, but not
             limited to,

          -  ongoing or active infection,

             acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for at least five
             months after the last dose of chemotherapy.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of PKC412.

             the results of the study or that puts the subject at high risk for treatment
             complications, in the opinion of the treating physician.

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.

          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or
             physical illness.

             procedures.
