  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that ocular surface disease (OSD) is common among patients with glaucoma
      with a prevalence of 50% or more. The percentage of affected patients appears to increase
      with increasing number of topical anti-glaucoma products instilled. Both pre-clinical and
      clinical work has indicated that the preservatives used in anti-glaucoma drops, particularly
      benzalkonium chloride, are mainly responsible for this detrimental effect. As such more and
      more anti-glaucoma drugs without preservatives entered the market.

      To prove that switching from preserved to unpreserved antiglaucoma medication improves the
      signs and symptom of OSD is, however, not easy. This is on the one hand related to the
      physiological variability of these parameters over time and on the other hand to the poor
      association between signs and symptoms. Recently, a new method for measuring tear film
      thickness (TFT) using ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been
      introduced. Using this method, it has been shown that there is a correlation between reduced
      TFT and OSD symptoms. In the present study, it is hypothesized that changing patients who are
      on preserved prostaglandin formulations to preservative free tafluprost may be associated
      with an increase in TFT.
