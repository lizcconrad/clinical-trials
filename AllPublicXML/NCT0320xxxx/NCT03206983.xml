  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the intraoperative stability, safety and overall efficacy of the Canabrava Ring
      (AJL - SPAIN) when used to expand pupils with less diameter than 5 mm and pupils with
      sphincter synechiae.

    <textblock>
      In this consecutive case series, 30 eyes of 29 patients underwent cataract surgery using a
      new disposable small-pupil expansion device, Canabrava's Ring (AJL Ophthalmic, Spain). It is
      the first iris expansion ring produced with indents that do not align with each other in the
      superior and inferior regions, resulting in a small vertical length (0.4mm) that minimizes
      risk of endothelial contact. All eyes had poorly preoperatively dilated pupils of less than
      5mm. Fifteen eyes had significant infective or traumatic pathology preoperatively. Vertical
      and horizontal pupil diameters were evaluated pre-, intra- and 1 month postoperatively, and
      were used to calculate pupil circumference. Intraoperative and postoperative pupil
      circumference comprised the primary outcomes of interest.
