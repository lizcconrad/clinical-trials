  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to compare the effects of a healthy, lean beef diet and an
      average American, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) style diet, that is low in
      saturated fatty acids (SFA), on insulin sensitivity in men and women with risk factors for
      diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, crossover study that includes two screening visits, one
      baseline visit, two 28-d test periods and an end-of-washout visit. A 2-week washout period
      will separate the two treatments. Subjects will be screened to identify metabolic syndrome
      and/or prediabetes at the screening visits. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to a
      test sequence (USDA/lean beef or lean beef/USDA diets) and the appropriate calorie menu
      within each test diet, which will be determined based on each subject's calculated energy
      needs for weight maintenance. Study foods will be dispensed, and subjects will be instructed
      to consume all of the foods in their entirety for the duration of each 28-d test period, and
      avoid consuming any additional food or drink items that has not been provided to them.
      Compliance will be assessed through a Food Deviation Log where subjects will record any
      non-study food/beverages consumed, and any portions of the study foods not consumed.

      An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) will be completed at baseline and the end of
      each treatment period, and fasting glucose and insulin will also be measured at screening and
      at the first test visit in each treatment period. Fasting blood samples will be collected for
      lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurements at all treatment
      visits. Additionally, fasting blood will be drawn for measurement of apolipoprotein B and A1
      and lipoprotein particles and subfractions at baseline and the end of each treatment period.

      Assessments of vital signs, body weight, evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      medication/supplement use, and adverse effects will be performed throughout the study.
