      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the immuno-persistence (type specific IgG
      antibody) of the tested vaccine administered in girls aged 9-17 years ,comparing to young
      healthy adults of 18-26 years who received the standard 3-dose schedule (0,1,6 months).

      This is a follow-up study which is based on the bridging study of a recombinant human
      papillomavirus 16/18 bivalent vaccine in preadolescent girls(Unique Protocol
      ID:HPV-PRO-006,Identifiers: NCT02562508) .We will recruit people who have participated in
      bridging study before and collect their serum samples to test the seroprevalence and
      geometric mean concentrations of anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 antibody on 18 and 30 months after
      dose 1.
