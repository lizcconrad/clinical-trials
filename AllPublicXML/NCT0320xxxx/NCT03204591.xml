  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute hepatic insults including hepatitis flare-up, active alcohol assumption and hepatotoxic
      drug use are common in patients with cirrhosis especially in Eastern countries.These patients
      are at high risk of developing acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and associated with high
      short-term mortality. And the natural history of these patients is frequently complicated by
      bacterial infections, which lead to deterioration of underlying diseases. The present study
      is aimed to investigate the prevalance and risk factors of bacterial infections in those
      patients and its impact on in-hospital/short-term mortality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The presence of cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy, endoscopy, radiological
             examination, or clinical evidence of prior hepatic de-compensation;

          2. Flare up of acute severe liver injury within one month before enrollment. Acute severe
             liver injury is defined as: increase of serum bilirubin &gt;=85mmol/L and international
             normalized ratio (INR)&gt;=1.5 with a definite hepatic insult.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (1)pregnancy; (2) disseminated maliganancy; (3)previously received a liver transplant; (4)
        HIV infection;
