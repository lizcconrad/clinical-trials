      Phase1 study of TTC 352 for treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is open-label, accelerated dose escalation study of TTC 352, a selective human ER
      partial agonist for treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer in patients who received and
      progressed on at least two lines of endocrine therapy with one that included a CDK4/CDK6
      inhibitor.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      TTC-352 for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer progressing after endocrine
      therapy.

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TTC-352 will be determined using initial single-patient
      cohort escalations until grade 2 toxicity, then expansion to a modified-Fibonacci
      dose-escalation 3+3 design. Patients enrolled at each dose escalation step must complete the
      first 28-day cycle of treatment without a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), or be withdrawn
      because of a DLT, before additional patients may be enrolled for the next dose escalation
      step. The MTD dose level cohort will be expanded to a total of 9 patients, to further
      evaluate safety. In each cohort pharmacokinetics of TTC-352 will be evaluated.

          7. have any other severe, uncontrolled medical condition, including unstable congestive

             Classification (Appendix III))

          8. have a known or suspected allergy to the study drug or any study drug component;

          9. have any other medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation, that may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results or that otherwise would, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, make study participation inappropriate;

         10. have any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to the planned
             start of study treatment;

         11. have received any other investigational drug within 28 days (or 5 half-lives, if
             longer) prior to the start of study screening.
