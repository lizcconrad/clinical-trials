        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or drug
             allergies. In particular, any history or evidence at Screening of chronic GI disorders
             (e.g., celiac sprue, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, etc.), thyroid disease, or

          3. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that could have increased the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or could have interfered with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, made the
             subject inappropriate for entry into the study.

          4. Positive results of alcohol or substances of abuse at screening or upon admission to
             the clinical research unit.

         13. Known sensitivity to any of the components of the investigational product formulation
