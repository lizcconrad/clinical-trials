    <textblock>
      The WAVECREST PMCF Study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study to confirm
      safety and performance of the Coherex WaveCrest Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occlusion System
      in the current medical practice setting in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who
      are at increased risk for stroke. Up to 65 subjects may be enrolled at up to 15 study sites
      in Europe. Patients will be followed through 45 days post-procedure.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The criteria for implant are in accordance to the current version of the Instructions for
        Use:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-valvular paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial fibrillation

          2. 18 years of age or older

          3. LAA anatomy amenable to treatment by percutaneous techniques

          4. Risk factors for potential thrombus formation in the LAA

          5. Willing to participate in the required follow-up visits and tests

          6. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has
             provided written informed consent as approved by the Ethics Committee or Institutional
             Review Board at the study site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known contraindication to percutaneous transseptal intervention

          2. Left atrial appendage anatomy or size that will not allow appropriate implantation of
             the WaveCrest Implant

          3. Intracardiac thrombus or other cardiac abnormality visualized prior to implant that
             would significantly impact procedural safety

          4. Mitral valve stenosis &lt; 1.5 cm2 or any stenosis consistent with rheumatic valvular
             disease or history of mitral valve replacement or repair

          5. Known contraindication and/or allergy to nickel

          6. Known active bacterial infection (i.e., sepsis, endocarditis)

          7. Any known medical condition or overall health of the subject that could adversely
             affect procedural safety or potentially prevent the patient from completing all study
             required visits and tests.

          8. Pregnant or breastfeeding women due to the risk of exposure to x-rays and medications
             associated with the implant procedure.
