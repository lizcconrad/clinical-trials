  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of emricasan in improving event-free survival based on a composite
      clinical endpoint (where all-cause mortality, new decompensation events, and MELD score
      progression are events) in subjects with decompensated NASH cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study treatment duration will be at least 48 weeks with study visits every 4 weeks up to
      Week 48 and every 8 weeks after Week 48. All subjects will continue treatment until the last
      subject in the study reaches 48 weeks in the study. At least 30% of subjects randomized
      should have baseline MELD score ≥15 and ≤20.

      For each subject, the study will consist of:

        -  Screening period of up to 4 weeks

        -  Randomized, double-blind treatment period of at least 48 weeks

        -  A follow-up visit 2 weeks after completion of study drug treatment

      The duration of each subject's participation will be at least 54 weeks for those completing
      the entire study.
