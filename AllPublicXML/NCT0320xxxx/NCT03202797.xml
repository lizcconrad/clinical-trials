  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      360 million people in the world suffer from debilitating hearing deficiency. The cochlear
      implant is indicated in certain patients with severe profound deafness. The principle of the
      cochlear implant is to directly stimulate auditory nerve fibres by electrodes inserted in the
      cochlea. The steps in auditory rehabilitation are the surgical insertion of the cochlear
      implant, activation, and follow-up regulation. There is no formal consensus to define the
      exact modalities for regulation during activation or follow-up, but the principles are
      respected according to centres that regulate cochlear implant. Bimodal audition is the fact
      of having a cochlear implant and a contralateral hearing aid. In patients with cochlear
      implants, having binaural bimodal audition improves their auditory vocal performance in
      silence and in noisy environments. It needs to be considered when a second cochlear implant
      is not indicated for the contralateral ear. It has been shown that by allocating frequencies
      different from the default frequencies attributed by the manufacturer, intelligibility and
      perception of music are modified. The investigators therefore with to study this working
      hypothesis and to develop a simple protocol for the reallocation of frequencies in order to
      optimise auditory performance in the everyday lives of patients with implants by using an
      evolutionary algorithm.
