  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of functioning and age-related health problems tend to appear earlier in individuals
      with intellectual disability (ID) than in their non-disabled peers and due to this people
      with ID who are in employment tend to need to retire earlier, producing social, economic and
      health problems. The Feldenkrais method (FM) is a movement-based form of learning that
      enhances body balance and physical functioning. We hypothesized that the FM could be helpful
      to improve balance and functioning of employed people with ID.

      The aim of this study will be to determine the effects of a Feldenkraisn Method (FM) program
      in improving functionality and body balance in supported employed individuals with ID. To
      evaluate this effect, a total of subjects will participate in a longitudinal and clinical
      trial.

      Sample size has been calculated to detect minimal significant effects on the variable of
      physical performance (SPPB): accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a
      bilateral contrast, 26 individuals are required in order to detect a difference equal to or
      greater than 1.5 unit in the SPPB (SD= 1.94). It has been increased the sample size in an
      additional 20% (losts during follow-up) and 5% (mortality). The resultant sample size is
      determinate in 32 individuals, who are equally randomized in both experimental and control
      groups.

      Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 22.0). Data
      were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all
      outcome measures. Mean differences within the groups in the functional tests and
      stabilometric outcomes were estimated using paired sample t-tests, while mean differences
      between the groups in these variables were estimated using repeated measures analysis of
      variance. Differences were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. To determine the magnitude of
      the interactions between time and group, the effect size or µ2 was calculated as described by
      Cohen (1998) and interpreted as small (&gt; 0.01 and &lt; 0.06), moderate (≥ 0.06 and &lt; 0.14) or
      large (≥ 0.14).

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be recruited at a company which provides supported employment. The primary recruitment strategy will be the information provided to the potential participants and legal guardians by the medical staff of the company. Informed consent will be obtained from the participants and their legal guardians. Afterwards they will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) by centre through sealedopaque envelopes to either the control or the intervention group by coin-tossing sequence generation.
It has been designed an experimental multicentre simple randomized study, with random allocation to a control group (CG) or to an experimental group (EG). This study is an open-label trial as the assessors who were experienced specialist in working with people with ID (psychologists, nurses, physicians, physiotherapists) are not blinded to group allocation.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>CHANGE FROM BASELINE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURED BY SPPB (SCORE) AT 30 WEEKS</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants are assessed at baseline (1 week before the intervention) and at 30 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a composite score of performance (0-12) based on 3 functional tasks. On each task, subjects can score between 0-4, with the higher values representing the best performance. Walking speed at a 4 m course is timed. Chair rise represented the time to complete 5 chair rises as quickly as possible. As a balance measure, standing balance score is used with responses ranging between 0-4. The sum of above mentioned three tasks provides the total SPPB score. Based on their subsequent risk for disability, mobility limitations have been characterized as being mild (score ≥10), moderate (score 7-9), and severe (score 4-6).</description>

    <time_frame>Participants are assessed at baseline (1 week before the intervention) and at 30 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Postural control is assessed with a static stabilometric platform (Winposture, Medicapteurs, FR) at an acquisition frequency of 50 Hz. Participants are asked to stand as still as possible with the eyes opened and bare foot during 60 sec. In order to ensure the same foot position for all the subjects, they are placed on the platform using a plastic device provided with this. Participants were instructed to look straight ahead at a mark placed onto the wall 2 m away at eye level. Data collection is initiated after participants adopted the required posture on the platform, stabilized their postural sway and signalled the experimenter that they are ready to begin. For security reasons, an assessor remains near the participant without touching or providing additional instructions during the test. Displacements of the centre of gravity are expressed in terms of sway area (mm2) and path length (mm).</description>

    <description>They EG will receive the intervention of FM consisting of 30 lessons (1h-lesson per week; 30 weeks) verbal instructions provided by the therapist to participants. These instructions provide different options on how to perform a specific task with the purpose of leaving the decision on how to do the movement up to the performer, who has to focus on thinking, feeling, sensing and doing the movement as easily as possible.The lessons can be conducted sitting, standing or moving within a room.</description>
