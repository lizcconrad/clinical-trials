    <textblock>
      This study will ask Thai MSM and transgender women (TG) participants to self-select to
      participate in one of the 3 different study groups which provide various degrees of
      integrated online interventions and offline interventions for the Recruit-Test-Treat-Retain
      for HIV prevention and care among 3 groups (A, B1 and B2). All participants will be followed
      up either offline or online for 12 months. HIV-negative participants will be scheduled for
      repeat HTC at months 6 and 12. HIV-positive participants will be scheduled either offline or
      online to review their treatment history at months 6 and 12. HIV-negative participants in
      Group B1 and B2 can choose again at months 6 and 12 to switch from the online to offline, and
      vice versa, at the HIV testing/post-test counseling step and the referral to HIV treatment
      step

    <intervention_model_description>Prospective study to evaluate the first-time HIV testing, successful referral to HIV treatment, retention HIV testing among 3 different study groups. A participants will receive offline HIV testing,counseling and conventional retention strategies. HIV-positive result in A can choose to have either online or offline to HIV treatment. B1 participants will be guided to access services at the 'Adam's Love Clinic, that set up specifically to provide private, fast HIV testing and post-test counseling. B2 participants will be mailed a rapid HIV test kit. Counselor will guide the participant through an online HIV testing process. Post-test counseling will provided HIV test result online. Participants can choose one of two HIV testing and post-test counseling options. HIV-positive participants in B1 and B2 can choose again to refer to HIV treatment either online or offline. All participants in B1 and B2 will receive an online retention strategy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The first-time HIV testers, successful HIV tests completed and successful referral to HIV treatment are the categorical data which don't have the units to measure. These variables are the binary outcome in which there are only two possible status e.g. yes or no, therapeutic successes or failure. The details are as follows:
The first-time HIV testers: this outcome variable is collected from the questionnaire; the probability of the outcome is likely to be &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.
Successful HIV tests completed: this outcome variable is collected form the result of the laboratory; the probability of the outcome is likely to be &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot;.
Successful referral to HIV treatment: this outcome variable is collected form the confirmation of antiretroviral treatment; the probability of the outcome is likely to be &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;failure&quot;.
Therefore frequency and proportions of participants who have the possible outcome that we are interested (who are the first HIV testers, who</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of HIV-positive participants who have virological suppression at each study visit after initiating ART.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of HIV-positive participants who have virological suppression at each study visit after initiating ART among MSM and TG who access online vs. offline services will be reported together with 95% confidence intervals. Formal comparisons between groups will be made using a Chi-squared test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The retention rates of HIV-negative MSM and TG for repeated HIV testing and HIV-positive MSM and TG for antiretroviral treatment when online vs. offline retention methods are used</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The retention rate (or event-free survival functions) is the probability value that participant will remain in the study in any time point. The probability value is between 0 to 100% and will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method for overall and separately by HIV-status and arms. Formal comparisons between HIV-status, online and offline retention arms will be made by a log-rank test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The factors associated with the preferences for the online option of HIV pre-test counseling, HIV testing and post-test counseling, referral for HIV treatment, and retention services among MSM and TG</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The association of covariates with a preference for online vs. offline services at first visit will be modeled using logistic regression. Predictor covariates will include socio-demographic data, sexual and drug use behaviors, social network characteristics, perceived barriers and facilitators for HIV testing, beliefs and experiences around stigma and discrimination related to HIV and/or being MSM or TG, strengths and supports for stigma/discrimination, and HIV testing history.</description>

    <description>Offline or online referral to HIV treatment facility HIV-positive participants can choose to receive either an offline or online referral to HIV treatment facilities. An offline referral method usually includes a referral letter and/or a telephone call, followed by a series of calls to participants to ensure successful referral. Those who choose an online referral will be able to register online with an HIV treatment facility which provides ART without cost under the national programs. Participants will receive a registration code which will allow them to access HIV treatment clinics directly without the need to go through the regular registration and appointment system at that facility.</description>

    <description>A trained online counselor will guide the participant through an online HIV testing process which includes quality checking of the test kit,obtaining blood through finger prick,performing the testing steps,reading the test result. A positive result from the first test will trigger the need for referral to confirmatory tests. The provisional nature of the positive result from the single rapid HIV test will be emphasized but the urgency to get immediate confirmatory tests and linkage to HIV treatment facilities will encouraged and supported. HIV positive test result will be confirmed only with three positive tests. Any online testing session with uncertain qualities at any step will be repeated at a later time or the participant will be offered offline HIV testing.</description>
