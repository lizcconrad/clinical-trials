  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Right heart failure is the main cause of morbi-mortality in patients with pulmonary
      hypertension (PH), including patients of chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension
      (CTEPH) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) etiologies. Endarterectomy is an effective
      treatment for patients with CTEPH to lower pulmonary pressure. Evidence of postoperative
      right heart remodeling are contrasted according to the studies and determinants of right
      heart failure are still unclear. Similarly, few evidence exists on right ventricular
      remodeling after bilateral lung transplantation for patients with pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH). Recent evidence have supported the role of inflammation and immunity in
      the pathophysiology of PAH . While several cytokines have been shown to predict survival ,
      little is known on the implication of inflammation and immunity in postoperative Right
      Ventricular failure in patients with PAH.

      • The specific translational goal of this current project is to elucidate the role of immune
      biomarkers in 6 months postoperative right heart adverse remodeling in patients with CTEPH or
      PAH. We speculate that selected immune biomarkers (such as CXCL9, interleukin -18 or
      interferon) and growth factors (such as HGF) are correlated with mid-term postoperative right
      heart failure.

      All consecutive adults with either CTEPH referred to our center for endarterectomy, or PAH
      referred for lung transplantation, will be included, aiming for 150 CTEPH and 50 PAH. After
      inclusion, patients will undergo assessment of right heart dimensions and function by cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, including 4-Dimensions blood flow sequences) and 2D and 3D
      trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), as well as immune panel analysis. All patients will
      undergo as part of routine care right heart catheterization within a week after TTE and MRI
      imaging. On the day of surgery, pulmonary pressure will be measured by right heart
      catheterization monitoring (as part of routine care) in order to estimate the drop of
      pressure and to adjust for the extent of endarterectomy for patients with CTEPH. TTE will
      also be performed on the day of surgery if possible. At 7 days post-endarterectomy or
      transplant, clinical outcomes will be collected and peripheral blood will be collected.
      Patients will be prospectively follow-up for 6 months. Death, need for reintervention,
      duration of vasopressor after surgery and number, duration and cause of readmission will be
      recorded. At 6 months after surgery, all survivors will undergo the same biological sampling,
      as well as an 4D MRI and a 2D and 3D TTE. Data of right heart catheterization at 6 months (as
      part of routine care) will be collected as well.
