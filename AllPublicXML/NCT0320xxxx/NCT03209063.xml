      Recurrent miscarriage is a pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestation. The recurrent
      pregnancy loss usually occurring in the first trimester of gestation and its rate is quite
      high (15-20% even in full reproductive period) . In 2012, the American Society for
      Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee issued a statement that defined recurrent pregnancy
      loss as a disease distinct from infertility defined by two or more failed consecutive
      pregnancies.

      Recurrent miscarriage is a pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestation. The recurrent
      pregnancy loss usually occurring in the first trimester of gestation and its rate is quite
      high (15-20% even in full reproductive period) . In 2012, the American Society for
      Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee issued a statement that defined recurrent pregnancy
      loss as a disease distinct from infertility defined by two or more failed consecutive
      pregnancies. Thrombophilia is the tendency to develop thromboses due to inherited defects in
      the coagulation system. Thrombophilia was identified as a major cause of recurrent pregnancy
      loss , Because pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, thromboembolism is the leading cause of
      antepartum and postpartum maternal mortality .The four most common genetic markers for
      thrombophilia are; prothrombin gene mutation(FII, G20210A), methylene tetra hydrofolate
      reductase mutations (MTHFR and A1298C), factor V Leiden (FVL, G1691A) , and plasminogen
      activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) . Prothrombin G20210A refers to a human gene mutation that
      increases the risk of blood clots.The variant causes elevated plasma prothrombin levels
      (hyperprothrombinemia), Prothrombin is the precursor to thrombin, which plays a key role in
      causing blood to clot (blood coagulation).Prothrombin G20210A can thus contribute to a state
      of hypercoagulability . Methylene tetra hydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the rate-limiting
      enzyme in the methyl cycle, and it is encoded by the Methylene tetra hydrofolate reductase
      gene. It was thought that deficient Methylene tetra hydrofolate reductase, by causing
      elevated homocysteine levels, led to an increased risk of venous thrombosis, coronary heart
      disease, and recurrent pregnancy loss .
