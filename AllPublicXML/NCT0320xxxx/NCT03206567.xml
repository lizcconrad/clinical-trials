      NUTRAFOL® is a novel nutraceutical supplement, scientifically formulated to specifically
      target the multiple underlying causes of hair loss and thinning in women. It does not contain
      hormones, drugs, or industry by-products.

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      physiological effects of NUTRAFOL® supplement compared to placebo in forty (40) female
      subjects, ages 21-65 years of age with self-perceived thinning hair over the course of six
      months of continued use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NUTRAFOL's Synergen Complex® is a patent-pending formulation of botanicals with potent
      anti-inflammatory, anti-stress adaptogenic, antioxidant and DHT-inhibiting properties -
      combined to synergistically combat the multiple underlying factors that compromise hair
      growth and health. Some patented ingredients include Sensoril Ashwagandha, BCM-95
      BioCurcumin, USPlus Saw Palmetto, EVNolMax 20% Tocotrienol/Tocopherol complex, Bioperine
      (piperine), Cynatine HNS (solubilized keratin), and Capsimax (capsaicin), all of which are
      standardized and clinically tested.

      Ingestion of NUTRAFOL® supplement over a six (6) month period will strengthen and promote the
      growth of hairs in female subjects, ages 21-65 years of age with self-perceived thinning hair
      when compared to using the placebo tablet. The primary endpoints will be favorable analysis
      using the Canon Power Shot G16 with 3GEN Dermlite FOTO Pro for macrophotography hair count
      analysis of terminal and vellus hairs at the three (3) month and six (6) month visits. The
      secondary endpoints will be favorable improvement in terminal hair diameter measured by the
      Dino-Lite Digital Microscopic, favorable improvement in the Hair Check device hair bundle
      measurement for Hair Mass Index (HMI), favorable improvement in the Blinded Physician Global
      Hair Assessments for hair growth and hair quality, statistically significant positive
      feedback on the Women's Hair Loss Quality of Life, Self-Assessment and Subject Treatment
      Satisfaction and Ease of Use questionnaires after six (6) months of NUTRAFOL® supplement or
      placebo ingestion. See Table of Study Procedures.

      All patients enrolled must be identifiable throughout the study. The Investigator will
      maintain a personal list of patient numbers and patient names to enable records to be found
      at a later date and the list will be stored in a locked cabinet. Subject numbers consist of a
      2 digit number from 01 to 40. Patients will be randomized to active or placebo supplements
      (2:1 ratio, 26 active and 14 placebo) using a randomization table prepared prior to the start
      of the study by a non-participating staff member at the office of the Investigator. The study
      blind will not be broken until the end of the study. All test product and placebo will be
      labeled with subject numbers per the non-participating staff member. Subjects will be
      assigned a subject number in numerical order as enrolled. Randomization will occur by
      assignment to either NUTRAFOL® supplement or placebo with 2:1 ratio (26 active and 14
      placebo). Subjects who terminate their study participation for any reason, regardless of
      whether study medication was used or not, will retain their randomization number.

      Visit Procedures: Pre-Study Procedures

        1. Candidate subjects will be screened with the eligibility requirements by telephone prior
           to Visit 1.

           the scalp and the diameter of the hairs measured (see Appendix IV).

      All primary and secondary parameters will be collected at Visits 1, 2 and 3. Missing data
      values will be minimized by intensive training of the interviewers in techniques of
      clarifying answers and checking questionnaires while participants are on-site. When missing
      values are identified, several approaches such as rescheduled within 24 hours of completion
      of tests or interviews will be employed to acquire the necessary data. Missing data will be
      also examined to assess randomness. Descriptive statistics will be obtained for all
      variables, tests of normality of continuous measures will be made and data will be examined
      for homogeneity of variance. An appropriate statistical method will be employed to correct
      for any abnormalities. The comparability of the two treatment groups in baseline demographic
      and clinical features will be tested with analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for continuous
      variables and Chi-square analyses for dichotomous variables. Initially, groups will be
      compared across all three visits for overall interaction effect. For any outcome with
      significant two-way interaction, group differences from baseline Visit to other two visits
      will be tested using analyses of variance with repeated measurements. These analyses were
      performed using the SPSS version 19. All analyses were two-tailed, where applicable, with
      p-value of 0.05 or less is obtained but other p-values may be evaluated on a case-by-case
      basis

    <description>The first primary efficacy parameter from the digital macrophotographs will be the number of terminal hairs in the target area of the scalp. Terminal hair is defined as coarse hair, short or long, found on the scalp with minimum cross-sectional diameter of greater than 40 micrometers. Digital macrophotographs will be taken of the selected target area (1 cm by 1 cm) of each subject at each visit as specified under the Schedule of Procedures. The digital macrophotographs will show the five black colored markings on the scalp that define the target area. Digital macrophotographs will be performed using a Canon Power Shot G16 with 3GEN Dermlite FOTO Pro system.The macrophotographs are then read by the investigator to determine the terminal hair count.</description>

    <description>The second primary efficacy parameter from the digital macrophotographs will be the number of vellus hairs in the target area of the scalp. Vellus hair is defined as fine, short hairs found on the scalp with maximum cross-sectional diameter of 40 micrometers. Digital macrophotographs will be taken of the selected target area (1 cm by 1 cm) of each subject at each visit as specified under the Schedule of Procedures. The digital macrophotographs will show the five black colored markings on the scalp that define the target area. Digital macrophotographs will be performed using a Canon Power Shot G16 with 3GEN Dermlite FOTO Pro system.

    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Dino-Lite Microscopic digital photographs to measure the diameter of the hair will be taken of the selected target area of each subject at each visit as specified under the Schedule of Procedures. Ten (10) terminal hairs just on the border of the 2 cm x 2 cm area used for the Hair Check HMI will be randomly chosen (not all from one direct area) and cut at the surface of the scalp thus not creating any bald patches. The hair diameter will then be measured at 1mm from the cut end of the hair. All calibrations and measurement will be done at the setting of 230X. The ten (10) hair measurements will then be recorded in the source and averaged to attain a median hair diameter for the target area.</description>
