      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of Apatinib in
      combination with AP(Pemetrexed/Carboplatin) or AC(Pemetrexed/Carboplatin) as first-line
      chemotherapy in subjects with advanced EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung
      cancer(NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib, an oral highly potent tyrosine-kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR-2, has demonstrated
      improved survival in previously treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung
      cancer(NSCLC).

      The phase I study is conducted to explore the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting
      toxicities(DLT), Maximum Tolerable Dose(MTD), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of Apatinib
      combined with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy(PB-DC) in first-line advanced EGFR wild
      type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This will use a dose reduction trial design. A
      cohort of 3~6 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level, If 0 of 3 or ≤ 1 of 6 subjects
      experience a DLT, the phase I trial will stop and the current dose will be considered the
      MTD. If 1 of 6 or more subjects experiences a DLT, dose reduce to the next dose will occur.

      Following completion of the dose de-escalation trial and determination of MTD, A randomized
      controlled trial(RCT) including 30 subjects may be enrolled to further evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of Apatinib in combination with
      platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy(PB-DC) in the same target population.
