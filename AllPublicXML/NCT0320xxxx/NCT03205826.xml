  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The Chartis® ( Pulmonx, CA, USA) measurement system is a tool to assess interlobar
      collateral ventilation during bronchoscopy. Assessing collateral ventilation is important
      when you intend to treat a patient with endobronchial valves. Chartis measurement of
      collateral ventilation can be performed under both conscious sedation as well as general
      anesthesia. There is no consensus on what is the preferred method of anesthesia for Chartis
      measurements in the literature.

      Objective: In this project we want to investigate whether there is a difference in Chartis
      measurement outcomes between these two methods of anesthesia: conscious sedation and general
      anesthesia.

      Study design: This study will be a single center observational study

      Study population: The study population exists of patients with severe emphysema who undergo
      collateral ventilation assessment before bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment with
      one-way endobronchial valves.

      Intervention: All patients will undergo two subsequent Chartis measurements. The first
      measurement will be performed with the patient undergoing conscious sedation and the second
      measurement with the patient under general anesthesia.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Our primary outcome measure is the failure rate of the
      Chartis collateral ventilation measurement under general anesthesia versus conscious
      sedation.
