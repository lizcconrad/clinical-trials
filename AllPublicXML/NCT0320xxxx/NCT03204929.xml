      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study of Cu(II)ATSM administered orally to patients with
      early idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The study will be conducted in two phases. In the first
      phase, dose cohorts of six patients each will receive escalating daily doses of Cu(II)ATSM to
      establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The starting dose will be 12 mg/day, which has
      been shown to be well tolerated in an ongoing phase 1 pharmacokinetic and dose-finding study
      of Cu(II)ATSM in patients with ALS (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02870634). In the second
      phase of the study, an expansion cohort of 20 patients will be treated at the RP2D to confirm
      tolerability and assess preliminary evidence of efficacy.

      In both the dose escalation and expansion cohorts, once the first 28 days of treatment are
      completed, at the discretion of the investigator a patient may continue to receive Cu(II)ATSM
      treatment for a maximum of six 28-day treatment cycles.
