  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1: This is a remote observational study in which participants will complete cognitive
      assessments developed by Posit Science. Participants will be healthy controls aged 18-65 with
      reliable internet access and a device that they can use to access the assessments, such as a
      laptop or iPad. Participants will complete up to 6 Posit Science assessments in different
      domains of cognition, which should last approximately 30 minutes.

      Phase 2: This is an in person observational study in which participants will complete
      cognitive assessments developed by Posit Science. Participants will be healthy controls aged
      18-80 who are fluent in English, . Participants will complete one of three batteries
      developed by Posit Science, which include combinations of visual, auditory, and social
      cognitive assessments. Afterwards participants will complete TEPS and BIS/BAS surveys. This
      study will be conducted at the Driven to Discover building at the Minnesota State Fair.
      Participation will last approximately 20 minutes.
