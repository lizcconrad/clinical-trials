    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a culturally tailored lifestyle intervention designed to
      prevent, or delay onset of, T2DM in Mexican Americans with prediabetes. Half the participants
      take part in a lifestyle program that emphasizes preparing and eating healthy
      Mexican-American foods and increasing physical activity and the other half will take part in
      an &quot;enhanced&quot; usual care control group.

      The main purpose of this study is to test a culturally tailored lifestyle intervention that
      incorporates motivational interviewing and is designed to prevent, or delay onset of, T2DM in
      Mexican Americans with prediabetes. Groups of participants will be randomly assigned to: a)
      an experimental group that receives a lifestyle program (12 2-hour weekly educational group
      sessions) that emphasizes preparing and eating healthy Mexican-American foods and increasing
      physical activity, followed by 14 bi-weekly support group sessions to problem solve remaining
      barriers to adopting recommended behaviors and 3 booster sessions to enhance maintenance of
      behavioral changes; OR b) an &quot;enhanced&quot; usual care control group that receives lab results
      with individualized guidance and referrals. A secondary aim of the study is to examine the
      influence of genetic variation at selected candidate genes for glucose regulation on response
      to the lifestyle intervention.
