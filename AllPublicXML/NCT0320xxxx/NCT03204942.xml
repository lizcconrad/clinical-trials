      STUDY DESIGN This is a Prospective Randomized Controlled trial that will be conducted at the
      National Cancer Institute. All patients who are eligible for the study will be included and
      randomized into 3 equal groups.

      PATIENTS AND METHODS After approval from the Ethics Committee at the National Cancer
      Institute, Cairo University, and obtaining written informed consent, eighty-one patients with
      thoracic segmental pain due to metastasis, unresponsive to conventional therapy and meeting
      the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to either one of the two types of treatment,
      PRF or TRF lesioning of the DRG or the control group. Patients will be carefully evaluated
      for neurologic deficits and side effects. Assessment of pain will be done at baseline then at
      1, 3, 6 months after the procedure. Randomization will be done using randomized permuted
      block design. Randomization list will be generated through random.org online site.

      Patients will be randomly assigned and divided into 3 equal comparable groups. Before the
      procedure, laboratory investigations, Dorsal X-ray, CT and MRI will be done. All Patients
      will be interviewed and examined by physicians trained in interventional pain management.
      Patients will be carefully assessed on physical exam for sensory, motor, or reflex deficit
      and carefully documented. Patients will be informed about the technique of the blocks, and
      written informed consents will be obtained.

      The types of measures used to assess pain relief will include single rating scales; VAS, and
      multiple-dimension composite measures; Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODI),
      The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BM22.

    <time_frame>Assessment of pain will be done at 6 months after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC has developed one of the most commonly used measurements for this purpose: the QLQ-C30 which is designed to capture QOL outcomes in a brief internationally recognized and validated tool . EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3) ,contains 15 relevant items to palliative care from the QLQ-C30, including multi-item physical and emotional function scales, multi-item symptom scales (fatigue and pain), single-item symptom scales (nausea/vomiting, appetite, dyspnea, insomnia, and constipation), and one scale pertaining to perceived overall QOL.</description>

    <measure>visual analog scale (VAS), to evaluate pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment of pain will be done at 6 months after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>is commonly used to rate various subjective experiences a VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end such as &quot;no pain&quot; on the left and &quot;severe pain&quot; on the right. The patient marks on the line three pain ratings, corresponding to current, best and worst intensity of pain experienced over the past 24 hours.The average of the 3 ratings will be used to represent the patient's level of pain over the previous 24 hours.. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.The VAS has consistently demonstrated sensitivity to changes in cancer pain associated with treatment or time ) and usually shows strong associations with other pain intensity ratings, it appears adequately valid and reliable as measures of pain intensity among the many different samples of persons with cancer</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODI),</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment of pain will be done at 6 months after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is a self-administered questionnaire divided into ten sections, each with six items designed to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 scale, with 5 representing the greatest disability.If a patient marked more than one statement for a question, the highest scoring statement is recorded as the true indication of disability. The scores are assessed from 0% to 20% to indicate minimal disability, 20% to 40%, to indicate moderate disability, 40% to 60% to indicate severe disability, 60% to 80% to indicate crippled, and 80% to 100% to indicate bed bound or exaggerating their symptoms</description>

    <description>RF will be performed with the patient in a prone position with mild flexion of the spine. Fluoroscopy beam positioned in an antero-posterior direction. A 10 cm RF needle 20 G with a 10 mm active tip.The needle is inserted in a slightly medial-cephalad direction under the transverse processes, and using lateral fluoroscopic imaging, incrementally walking into the thoracic intervertebral foramen. So the location of the needle tip confirmed by sensory stimulation at 50 Hz. The point of maximum stimulation is at 0.5 V intensity and this is designated to be the location of the DRG. Slight redirection can be done to optimize the stimulation; injection of contrast reveals epidural uptake. After establishing the site for the RF, 1 ml 2% lidocaine should be injected through the needle.</description>
