    <textblock>
      This study aims to better understand the behavioral, neurobiological and hormonal
      underpinnings of stress and reward reactivity of adolescents suffering from borderline
      personality disorder compared to healthy adolescents by a multimodal approach based on
      clinical assessments, structural and functional mri and experimental acute stress exposure.

    <textblock>
      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a severe condition associated with intense emotional
      and behavioral responses to stressful events, impulsivity, and risk-taking behavior. It has
      been shown to begin in adolescence. However, very few studies have addressed the
      physiopathology of BPD in adolescents. In order to gather rational information for targeted
      care, the heterogeneity of BPD determinants needs to be disentangled. To this aim, a
      multimodal approach to BPD dimensional aspects is proposed.

      BPD adolescents will be compared to typically developing controls in two complementary
      experimental designs: (1) Monitoring of neurovegetative, hormonal and body motion responses
      to an acute stress, with the hypothesis that stress reactivity might account for the
      physiopathology of the disorder; (2) Structural and functional imaging (fMRI BOLD) in the
      context of a reward processing task to delineate the neural/functional basis of BPD risk
      taking behavior.

    <description>The fMRI session will provide three types of data: (1) task-related activity to probe the striato-limbic and prefrontal regions, (2) resting state connectivity to examine the integrity of canonical networks, and (3) MR structural images to measure regional volumes of key functional nodes. For the task-related fMRI study, the investigators will use the monetary incentive delay task that reliably elicit an activation in known functional networks underlying reward anticipation/outcome.</description>

    <description>The stress elicitation experiment is based on a time-constrained mental arithmetic test in the presence of an observer. The task usually lasts about 30 minutes.
During the task, the investigators will monitor: neuro-vegetative parameters (skin conductance, temperature, respiratory and cardiac frequencies, and VNA) ; biological parameters : salivary Cortisol and Amylase before test (baseline), 15 min and 30 min after testing (respectively corresponding to Reactivity and Recovery) ; micro-behavioral cues extracted from 2D video and 3D sensors (Microsoft Kinect).</description>

    <description>Structural and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The functional acquisition will last 20 minutes and the structural acquisition 18 minutes. All MR image acquisition methodologies are already functioning on the 3 Tesla Prisma machine within the ICM(Brain and Spine Institute), Salpetriere. The fMRI session will provide three types of data: (1) task-related activity to probe the striato-limbic and prefrontal regions, (2) resting state connectivity to examine the integrity of canonical networks, and (3) MR structural images to measure regional volumes of key functional nodes.
For the task-related fMRI study, the investigators will use the monetary incentive delay task that reliably elicit an activation in known functional networks underlying reward anticipation/outcome.</description>
