  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to study the safety and tolerability of
      durvalumab and tremelimumab when given to patients with metastatic (has spread)
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      This is an investigational study. Tremelimumab and durvalumab are not FDA approved or
      commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only. The study
      doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work in more detail.

      Up to 27 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive tremelimumab by
      vein over 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-4. You will not receive tremelimumab after Cycle 4.
      You will also receive durvalumab by vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-13.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will stay in the clinic for about 1 hour after your dose of study
      drugs to be watched for any side effects. After that, depending on what the study doctor
      thinks is in your best interest, you may only need to stay in the clinic for about 30 minutes
      after the dose.

      On days that you receive both tremelimumab and durvalumab on the same day, you will receive
      tremelimumab, wait about 1 hour, and then receive durvalumab.

      You may receive palliative radiation therapy as part of your standard care while taking part
      in this study. The study staff will discuss this option with you.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 4 cycles of tremelimumab and up to 13 cycles of durvalumab. You may no
      longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Retreatment:

      Depending on how you respond to the study drugs and what the study doctor thinks is in your
      best interest, you may be able to receive an additional 13 cycles of treatment as described
      above (durvalumab and tremelimumab for 4 cycles and then 9 cycles of durvalumab alone). This
      is called retreatment. If you take part in retreatment, you will sign this informed consent
      form again.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your PSA levels.

      Every 8 weeks for the first 48 weeks and then every 12 weeks after that, you will have a bone
      scan and either an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      At any time the doctor thinks it is needed:

        -  You may have an EKG.

        -  Urine may be collected for routine tests.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 60 days after your last dose of study drug(s), blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn
      for routine tests.

      About 90 days after your last dose of study drug(s), blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn
      for routine, antibody, biomarker, and PK testing. Antibodies are created by the immune system
      and may attack foreign cells or substances, such as the study drugs.

      If you cannot or do not want to come back to the clinic for these follow-up visits the study
      staff will call you and you will be asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you
      may have. This call should take about 5 minutes.

      Long-Term Follow-up:

      Starting at about Month 4 after your last dose of study drugs and every 3 months after that
      until the study ends, the study staff will either call you or you will come in for a clinic
      visit and you will be asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you may have. If
      you are called, the call should take about 5 minutes.

      If you have severe side effects, you may return to the clinic more often so the study doctor
      can check on your health.

      About Month 6 after your last dose of study drugs, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn
      for antibody testing.

      At Month 12 and then every 6 months after that, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      You will continue to have MRI/CT scans every 8-12 weeks, depending on the status of the
      disease. If the disease gets worse, these scans will stop.

Any grade 3 or higher adverse event that is potentially treatable with steroids will only count as an extreme toxicity if it does not improve to grade 1 or better within 2 weeks of steroid therapy.
