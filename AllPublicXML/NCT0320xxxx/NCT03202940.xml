  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug combination as a possible treatment for anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Alectinib

        -  Cobimetinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of
      investigational drugs or new combinations of approved drugs. In addition, a Phase I study
      tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for further studies.
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied. Following the phase I study,
      additional participants will be enrolled to the Phase II component. The phase II component
      will test the safest doses of alectinib and cobimetinib (as identified in the Phase I
      component) in a larger group of patients.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved alectinib as a treatment option
      for this disease.

      The FDA has not approved cobimetinib as a treatment for this specific disease. However,
      cobimetinib is approved for treatment of melanoma, another type of cancer.

      Alectinib is an oral ALK inhibitor made by the pharmaceutical company Genentech. The term ALK
      inhibitor means that alectinib targets the abnormal ALK protein that is causing your lung
      cancer cells to grow. Alectinib has been tested in other clinical research studies and
      results show that the drug may help stop the growth and spread of ALK+ lung cancer cells.

      Cobimetinib is an oral inhibitor of MEK, a signaling protein that can cause some types of
      lung cancer to grow. Cobimetinib is also made by Genentech. Laboratory studies suggest that
      ALK and MEK may work together to help ALK+ lung cancer cells grow. In the laboratory,
      combination treatment with drugs targeting ALK and MEK prevented lung cancer cells from
      growing. It is possible that combination treatment with alectinib and cobimetinib will work
      better than alectinib alone to control the spread of the cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are trying to determine whether the combination of
      alectinib and cobimetinib is safe and well tolerated. This study will help determine the
      doses of the drugs that should be used in the Phase II portion of this study. Another purpose
      of this study is to determine whether adding cobimetinib to alectinib is effective for
      treating lung cancer that has already stopped responding to alectinib alone. In order to help
      understand why the cancer may have stopped responding to alectinib and whether treatment with
      the two drugs effectively blocks growth signals, all participants in this study will have
      periodic blood collections and undergo multiple biopsies.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC (Stage IV,
             AJCC v7.0) that carries an ALK rearrangement, as determined by the Food and Drug
             Administration (FDA)-approved fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) test, using
             Vysis® ALK Break apart FISH Probe, or the Ventana® immunohistochemistry (IHC) test.
             Diagnosis using next generation sequencing (NGS) via a local diagnostic test will be
             accepted for enrollment but will need to be confirmed with either FISH or IHC.

          -  For the expansion cohort: Patients must have had disease progression on alectinib
             (including patients who received alectinib as first-line treatment). Subsequent
             anti-neoplastic therapy (including other ALK inhibitors or chemotherapy) after
             progression on alectinib is not permitted. Note: patients in the dose-finding portion
             of the study may have received other anti-neoplastic therapy after progression on
             alectinib.

          -  At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Previously irradiated
             lesions are not measurable unless the lesion has demonstrated clear progression after
             radiation.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 for patients treated in the
             expansion phase. ECOG PS ≤ 1 is required for participants in the dose-finding portion
             of the study.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  Patient willingness and disease accessible to pre-treatment, on-treatment tumor, and
             progression biopsies (core biopsies). A cell block from a pleural effusion may be
             substituted for a core biopsy.

          -  Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication. Does not have any
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as malabsorption syndrome
             or major resection of the stomach or small bowel that may alter absorption of the
             medication.

          -  For participants in the dose-finding phase, a minimum washout period of at least 5
             half-lives between the last dose of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and the
             first dose of study treatment is required. For patients on crizotinib, a 7 day washout
             is sufficient. A shorter washout period may be considered in the event of disease
             flare, after discussion with the Sponsor. No washout is required if the most recent
             anti-neoplastic therapy is alectinib.

          -  Patients must have recovered from treatment toxicities to ≤ Grade 1 or to their
             pretreatment levels except for adverse events (AEs) that in the investigator's
             judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient.

          -  Patients can either be chemotherapy-naive or have received platinum-based chemotherapy
             for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Acute effects of therapy must have
             resolved to baseline severity or to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for AEs that in the
             investigator's judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient. Patients who
             have received prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors are eligible.

          -  Recovery from effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury at least 28
             days before the first dose of study treatment

          -  For all women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be obtained at
             the baseline visit before starting study treatment. For women who are not
             postmenopausal (≥ 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile
             (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain abstinent or use two adequate
             methods of contraception, including at least one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year, during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of
             study drug.

               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                  methods of contraception.

               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
                  tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of
                  combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine
                  devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom
                  and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt;1% per year.
                  Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.

          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent or use a barrier method of contraception (e.g.,
             condom) during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of
             study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this same period

               -  Men with a pregnant partner must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for
                  the duration of the pregnancy.

               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                  methods of contraception.

          -  Patients with untreated, controlled asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) lesions
             are allowed in this trial as long as the CNS is not a site of progressive disease on
             alectinib monotherapy. If the CNS is a site of progressive disease on alectinib
             monotherapy, treatment of CNS lesions is required for enrollment.

          -  The use of seizure prophylaxis is allowed as long as patients are taking non-enzyme
             inducing anti-epileptic drugs (non-EIAED). If patients were previously on EIAEDs and
             these have been discontinued, they must have been discontinued for at least 2 weeks
             prior to treatment start. If patients require an anti-epileptic medication, then a
             CYP3A4 non-EIAED can be used such as levetiracetam, valproic acid, gabapentin,
             topiramate or lacosamide.

          -  Patients requiring steroids must be at a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week
             prior to enrollment

          -  Patients with asymptomatic leptomeningeal disease are eligible for participation in
             this trial. However, patients who had progression of leptomeningeal disease on
             alectinib will be required to undergo CNS radiation to meet eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study or
             those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than
             3 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants who experienced progression of CNS lesions on alectinib who have not
             received local CNS therapies (radiation, surgery) to address the lesions. CNS imaging
             obtained at least 21 days after completion of radiation is required for confirmation
             of response.

          -  Radiation therapy (except palliative to relieve bone pain) within 7 days of study
             entry. Palliative radiation (≤ 10 fractions) must have been completed at least 48
             hours prior to study entry. Stereotactic or small field brain irradiation must have
             been completed at least 7 days prior to study entry. Whole brain radiation and
             radiation for leptomeningeal metastasis must have been completed at least 2 weeks
             prior to study entry. Acute effects of radiation must have resolved to baseline
             severity or to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for AEs that in the investigator's judgment do
             not constitute a safety risk for the patient.

          -  Participants with uncontrolled tumor-related pain.

               -  Symptomatic lesions amenable to palliative radiotherapy (e.g., bone metastases or

               -  Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause
                  functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastases that are not
                  currently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for
                  loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients who are receiving denosumab prior to enrollment who are not willing and/or

               -  Glaucoma with intraocular pressure ≥ 21 mmHg

               -  Grade ≥ 2 serum cholesterol (patients with a history of elevated cholesterol
                  controlled with lipid lowering medication to Grade ≤ 1 are eligible)

               -  Grade ≥ 2 hypertriglyceridemia (patients with a history of elevated cholesterol
                  controlled with lipid lowering medication to Grade ≤ 1 are eligible)

               -  Grade ≥ 2 or symptomatic hyperglycemia (fasting). Hyperglycemia may be corrected
                  with medications to Grade ≤ 1.

               -  Grade ≥ 2 uncontrolled hypertension (patients with a history of hypertension
                  controlled with anti-hypertensive medication to Grade ≤ 1 are eligible)

          -  Major surgical procedure other than for diagnosis within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day
             1 or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the
             study.

          -  Evidence of active malignancy (other than current NSCLC, non-melanoma skin cancer, in
             situ cervical cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, localized/stable renal masses, ductal
             carcinoma in-situ/lobular carcinoma in-situ (DCIS/LCIS) of the breast, or localized
             and presumed cured prostate cancer) within the last 3 years.

          -  Active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease or previous gastric resection or lap
             band.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills

          -  Concurrent use of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors

          -  Prior treatment with a mitogen activated kinase pathway (MAPK) inhibitor

          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the cobimetinib formulation

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would
             preclude the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of
             the results or render the participant at high risk from treatment complications.
