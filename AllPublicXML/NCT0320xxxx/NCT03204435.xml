      Purpose: Have an evaluation of clinical benefits and risks of hybrid operating techniques in
      management of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) with coexistence of atherosclerotic intracranial
      arterial stenosis (AIAS), whose management strategies are inconsistent. Meanwhile, as a new
      cooperative interventional modality, optimized workflows, technical key knots and operation
      routines will be explored in the study.

      Objects: Patients with IAs with coexistence of AIAS, coincident with inclusion and exclusion
      criterion and admitted in participating organizations.

      Methods: Patients will be distributed into 2 groups, including traditional therapy
      group(control group) and hybrid operating group(trial group), and conduct with traditional
      multi-stage neurosurgical management or one-stage hybrid operating management
      correspondingly. The morbidity rate of peri-operative cerebral hemorrhagic/ischemic event is
      considered to be the primary observing indicator, and morbidity rate of peri-operative
      cerebral hemorrhagic/ischemic event, while peri-operative mortality rate, and health-economic
      indicators are secondary indicators.The information of operations will be recorded in detail
      as evidence of optimization of workflow and technical key knots.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients of intracranial aneurysms with coexistence of cerebrovascular stenosis, coincident with inclusion and exclusion criterion, will be distributed into traditional therapy group(control group) and hybrid operating group(test group), and conduct with traditional neurosurgical management or one-stage hybrid operating management separately.
Traditional therapy group: intervene the aneurysms and vascular stenosis unsimultaneously. Clipping procedure is preferred to aneurysms, while endovascular intervention is preferred to stenosis.
Hybrid operation group: one-stage hybrid operating technique is conducted. The aneurysms and vascular stenosis will be executed via the cooperation of microsurgical procedure and endovascular interventional techniques.</intervention_model_description>
