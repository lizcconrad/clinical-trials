    <textblock>
      In the currently proposed phase I/II study, the investigators aim to treat patients with
      relapsed and/or relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have progressed on
      carfilzomib-based therapy with an FDA approved c-MET inhibitor, cabozantinib. Our hypothesis
      is that the additional rescue blockade with cabozantinib added to the carfilzomib will (1) be
      safe and tolerable and (2) will show activity by demonstrating objective response to
      combination carfilzomib/cabozantinib therapy. In correlative studies, the investigators aim
      to show that (1) the serum and marrow MUC20 levels which will be judged by genomic and flow
      cytometric studies will directly correlate with primary plasma cell MUC20/c-Met pathway
      activation and inversely correlate with protease inhibitor (PI) resistance; and (2) a
      correlation of the gene and MUC20 expression profiles of patients with clinical outcomes may
      confirm the biomarker MUC20 as a predictor of disease sensitivity to PI, and allow future
      personalization of c-Met-targeted therapies, as well as combination approaches based on c-Met
      inhibitors.

      To be eligible for this study, patients must have been previously diagnosed with
      histologically or cytologically confirmed symptomatic MM, must have measurable disease and
      have had at least two, but not more than four prior lines of therapy for their disease, with
      lines of therapy being separated by the presence of documented disease progression.
      Additionally, patients eligible will be those who have failed carfilzomib either as a single
      agent as the last form of therapy, or carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone, or
      carfilzomib in combination with revlimid and dexamethasone.

      In Phase I of this study the investigators will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      among three doses. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be based solely on adverse events
      that occur during cycle 1. The initial dose of cabozantinib for all patients treated on this
      study will be 20 mg P.O. daily, which is designated dose level -1.

      Response assessment will be performed at start and after cycle 2 using the serum and/or urine
      protein electrophoresis with immunofixation and serum free light chains to assess disease
      burden. Disease response quality will also be assessed after completion of three cycles of
      therapy, and then every cycle after that. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be performed
      after the baseline sampling only to confirm the achievement of a complete remission (CR).

      All patients will be closely followed for toxicity from the time of informed consent until 30
      days after last administration of study medication. Adverse event and serious adverse events
      will be followed until baseline or less than or equal to grade 1 levels. Every subject who
      fulfills all aspects of patient eligibility who receives a partial or complete course of
      chemotherapy will be evaluable for dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

    <description>Response will be determined by the IMWG response criteria guidelines. All subjects in phase I that receive the MTD will be included in phase II study analysis. The investigators will use a Simon two-stage design to compare response rates of 0.25 versus 0.05 with alpha=0.05 and power of 0.8083. Nine patients will be enrolled in the first stage. The hypothesis will be rejected and enrollment will cease if no response is seen in the first 9 patients enrolled on the Phase II portion of the study. Otherwise, another 14 patients will be accrued for a total of evaluable 17 patients.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are receiving any concurrent investigational agent with known or
             suspected activity against MM, or those whose adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier have not recovered to grade 0 or 1.

          2. Patients who have known CNS involvement with MM

          3. Patients who have previously been treated with another agent targeting the MUC20/c-Met
             axis, including either monoclonal antibodies to MUC20 or c-Met, or small molecule
             inhibitors of c-Met.

             carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort)
             should be avoided because it may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations.
             If patients are taking any strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, alternate medications with no or
             minimal CYP3A4 inhibitors should be sought prior to trial enrollment.

             recent history of hemorrhage or hemoptysis; dehiscence or wound healing complications
             requiring medical intervention; severe hypertension that cannot be controlled (blood
             pressure of &gt; 150 systolic or &gt; 100 diastolic mm) with anti-hypertensive therapy
             within 7 days of first dose of therapy.

          7. Pregnant or lactating women

          8. Patients with non-secretory MM, active plasma cell leukemia, defined as either having
             20% of peripheral WBC comprised of CD138+ plasma cells, or an absolute plasma cell
             count of 2 x 109/L, known amyloidosis, or known POEMS syndrome

          9. Patients who have required plasmapheresis and exchange less than 2 weeks prior to
             initiation of therapy with cabozantinib

         10. Patients with known moderate or severe hepatic impairment, active hepatitis A, B,
             and/or C infection

         11. Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients are not considered to have a
             &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy for a prior malignancy,
             are disease free from prior malignancies for &gt;5 years, and are considered by their
             physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse. Also, patients with basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, superficial carcinoma of the bladder, carcinoma of the prostate
             with a current PSA value of &lt;0.5 ng/mL, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are
             eligible. Patients who are on hormonal therapy for a history of either prostate or
             breast cancer may enroll, if there has been no evidence of disease progression during
             the previous 3 years.

         12. Allergy to carfilzomib or cabozantinib or any excipients

         13. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other
             conditions, psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise the patient's
             ability to understand the patient information, to give informed consent, to comply
             with the study protocol or to complete the study or, in the judgment of the Principal
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for study participation.

         14. The subject has experienced any of the following:

               -  clinically-significant GI bleeding within 6 months before the first dose of study
                  treatment;

               -  GI disorders particularly those associated with a high risk of perforation or
                  fistula formation including:

                    -  Tumors invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory
                       bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis,
                       symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis or acute
                       obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric outlet
                       obstruction

                    -  Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, intra-abdominal
                       abscess within 6 months before randomization,

               -  hemoptysis of ≥ 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of red blood within 3 months before the
                  first dose of study treatment;

               -  any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the
                  first dose of study treatment.

         15. The subject has radiographic evidence of cavitating pulmonary lesion(s);

         16. The subject has tumor invading or encasing any major blood vessels;

         17. The subject has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract (esophagus, stomach, small or
             large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor
             within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib;

         18. QTcF &gt; 500 msec within 1 month before the first dose of study treatment:

             - Three ECGs must be performed for eligibility determination. If the average of these
             three consecutive results for QTcF is ≤ 500 msec, the subject meets eligibility in
             this regard.

         19. Inability to swallow intact tablets

         20. The subject has PT/INR or PTT test ≥ 1.3 x the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the
             first dose of study treatment;

         21. Concomitant anticoagulation at therapeutic doses with oral anticoagulants (eg,
             warfarin, direct thrombin and Factor Xa inhibitors) or platelet inhibitors (eg,
             clopidogrel);

         22. Subjects who have Carfilzomib-related posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
             (PRES) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) should not be challenged with Carfilzomib.
