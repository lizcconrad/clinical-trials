  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects approximately 1% of newborns in the US, with 25% of
      those affected having critical conditions requiring open heart surgery within one year of
      birth. Surgical and medical advances have allowed many patients to live beyond their fourth
      and fifth decades of life. Unfortunately, cardiac arrhythmias are a relatively common sequela
      due to cardiac anomalies and surgical scars in addition to residual volume and pressure load
      on the heart. Atrial arrhythmias, including sinus node dysfunction and intra-atrial
      re-entrant tachycardia (IART) are among the more common abnormalities found in adults with
      repaired CHD. The presence of IART significantly increases morbidity and mortality, and
      anti-arrhythmic medications have been shown to be a sub-optimal treatment strategy with the
      majority of patients requiring multi-drug therapy. Catheter ablation procedures remain a
      treatment option, but are less successful for some patient demographics. In the mid-1990's,
      pacemakers with atrial anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) capabilities were developed, primarily
      for the management of atrial flutter and fibrillation in adults with structurally normal
      hearts. Given the need for pacemakers in the CHD population to manage sinus node dysfunction
      and atrioventricular node conduction block, the adoption of atrial anti-tachycardia
      pacemakers began to gain favor. However, there is limited data available comparing the safety
      and effectiveness of ATP therapy between various demographics of CHD patients. In the current
      study, the investigators aim to determine if ATP is an effective treatment strategy for IART,
      specifically within particular sub-populations of CHD patients. Additionally, investigators
      hope to delineate any significant differences in efficacy of ATP treatment between adult and
      pediatric congenital heart patients. The research team will accomplish our goals with a
      retrospective, multi-center study in which data is collected from existing electronic medical
      records and pacemaker interrogations. Following data collection, the investigators will
      employ statistical analyses to determine if certain CHD demographics are statistically
      significant predictors of ATP therapy outcomes.

      The purpose of this prospective/retrospective study is to determine how effective atrial
      anti-tachycardia therapies are with the congenital heart patients who are known to have
      atrial arrhythmias. As this population ages, we know that arrhythmic burden increases and
      medications are increased or changed for symptomatic improvement.

      Patients will be enrolled at the time of anti tachycardia device ATD placement or when device
      therapies are turned on. Patients will need a minimum of 5 years of clinical history prior to
      implantation and after implantation (unless patient is very young). Data will be collected
      both retrospectively and prospectively. The research team will consent patients at the time
      of clinical evaluations and scheduled follow-ups (usually 3 - 6 months). If therapy is
      effective, investigators will determine the specific programming which was successful. If
      therapy was ineffective, investigators will also determine if a change in programing was made
      and if this improved ATP efficacy. Investigators will also determine the arrhythmia burden.
      Cardioversion and medications before and after ATD implantation will be the key determinants
      of arrhythmia burden in this study.

      University of Iowa is moving to begin the multi-institutional portion of this study by asking
      for centers to assist with enrollment so that the investigators can meet our enrollment goal.
      The investigators wish to recruit a minimum of 250 subjects and will collect data for up to
      300 subjects. The research team will move to a retrospective and prospective enrollment
      looking at how well ATP works in ATD therapy devices for patients who have CHD. No
      interventions will take place as this is a chart review and observational study.
