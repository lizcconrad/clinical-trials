      the investigators aim to set up a multicenter registry study for severe PJP requiring ICU
      admission. The purpose of this study is

        1. to establish a prospective severe PJP registry about clinical characteristics,
           laboratory and radiographic findings, critical care management and outcomes.

        2. to explore the predictive factors associated with outcomes ;

        3. to compare the difference between PJP patients with HIV and without HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) is a common opportunistic infection in
      immunocompromised patients. Although the mortality of patients with mild to moderate PJP has
      declined substantially, the reported outcomes of severe PJP requiring ICU admission,
      especially with mechanical ventilation are grave. The data on this group of patients is very
      limited and mainly comes from retrospective studies.

      the investigators aim to set up a multicenter registry study for patient with severe PJP
      requiring ICU admission to provide comprehensive descriptive data on diagnosis, clinical
      course, critical care management and outcomes in a large cohort.

      All patients with PJP admitted to the participating ICU during a two-year period will be
      enrolled. The CRF will be made available to the participating sites as a printable
      paper-based CRF.

      The following individual patient data for study participants will be collected:

        -  General demographic information

        -  Presence of risk factors for PJP and comorbid condition

        -  use of prophylactic SMZ/TMP, immunosuppressive medications prior to ICU admission

        -  Information about PJP and co-infection diagnosis

        -  vital signs, laboratory(blood serum and BALF sample) and radiologic data at ICU
           admission and during ICU stay

        -  organ failures and severity of the disease at admission, new onset of organ failures
           during ICU stay

        -  Medications for PJP, time course and modalities and settings for respiratory support

        -  ICU, 28-day mortality, hospital, 90-day mortality
