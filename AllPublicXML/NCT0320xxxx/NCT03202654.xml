  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial are to assess the effects of corn oil and coconut oil on
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, and other aspects of the fasting
      lipoprotein lipid profile, as well as insulin sensitivity and an inflammatory marker, in men
      and women.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, crossover, pilot study that includes two screening visits and two
      4-week test periods, separated by a 3-week washout. Subjects will consume study products
      providing 4 tablespoons oil/day of either corn oil or coconut oil replacing the same amount
      of oil in the background diet. Subjects will otherwise be encouraged to follow their habitual
      diet during both treatment periods. They will receive diet instructions on the incorporation
      of food substitutions during the test periods to maintain habitual energy intake. Subjects
      will record daily study product intake and compliance in a Daily Log. An intravenous glucose
      tolerance test (IVGTT) will be completed at baseline and the end of each treatment period for
      evaluation of insulin sensitivity. Fasting blood samples will be collected for lipid profile
      and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurements at all visits. Assessments of
      vital signs and body weight, review of concomitant medication/supplement use and inclusion
      and exclusion criteria for relevant changes, and evaluation of adverse effects will be
      performed throughout the study. Compliance will be assessed using the Daily Log intake
      percentages as the primary source.
