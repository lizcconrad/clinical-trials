  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study 250 µg of G17DT was administered at Weeks 0, 2 and 6 in order to demonstrate
      non inferiority compared to gemcitabine in prolonging survival in advanced pancreatic cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, confirmed by histology or cytology, in
             patients not suitable for pancreatic tumor resection with curative intent.

          -  A diagnosis of recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma (previously confirmed by histology
             or cytology) in patients who have had a primary tumor resection.

          -  Male or female patients over 18 years of age.

          -  Laboratory values within the following ranges at screening:

        Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Haemoglobin &gt; 9.5 g/dL White
        blood cell (WBC) count &gt; 3.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 times
        ULN Aspartate transaminase (AST, SGOT) &lt; 3 times ULN

          -  A life expectancy of at least 2 months.

          -  A negative pregnancy test at the screening visit (females of childbearing potential
             only).

          -  Signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of other malignant disease (except basal cell carcinoma or in situ carcinoma
             of the uterine cervix).

          -  Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy (including gemcitabine).

          -  Previous radiotherapy within 30 days of baseline.

          -  Use of systemic (oral or injected) immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids,
             within 30 days prior to the baseline visit. Inhaled corticosteroids for chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma were permitted.

          -  Females of child bearing potential who are pregnant, lactating, or who are planning to
             become pregnant during the period of the study.
