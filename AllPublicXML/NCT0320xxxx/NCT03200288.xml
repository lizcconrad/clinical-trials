        If unilateral knee OA: Subjects demonstrating at screening pain intensity in the target
        knee measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ≥40 mm VAS, and ≤ 20 mm in the contralateral
        knee and confirmed at randomization after wash-out from analgesics/NSAIDs.

        If bilateral knee OA: definition of the most symptomatic joint at screening based on
        subject's evaluation and Investigator's clinical judgment with subjects demonstrating pain
        intensity in the target knee measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ≥40 mm VAS, and ≤ 20mm
        in the contralateral knee and confirmed at randomization after wash-out from
        analgesics/NSAIDs.

          -  Subjects are able to understand and are willing and able to comply with study
             procedures including usage of acetaminophen as the only analgesic.
