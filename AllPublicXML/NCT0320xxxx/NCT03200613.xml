  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thromboprophylaxis options are limited for patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) and
      there are no studies on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for thromboprophylaxis in this
      population. Participants will be randomized to apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or standard dose
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), either enoxaparin 40 mg or dalteparin 5000 units,
      subcutaneously once daily for 90 days or until fully mobilized, whatever comes first.
      Thromboprophylaxis will be started as soon as hemostasis is achieved. The primary outcome for
      this pilot study will be the recruitment rate per year (i.e. the screened to enrolled ratio).
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be a composite of symptomatic, objectively verified,
      venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined as upper or lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
      and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) or sudden death where PE cannot be excluded. The primary
      safety endpoint will be major bleeding.

    <textblock>
      Patients with acute (SCI) have a high risk of VTE despite thromboprophylaxis. The current
      standard thrombprophylaxis is to use LMWH fas soon as hemostasis is achieved. The duration of
      thromboprophylaxis is commonly 3 months. This entails once or twice daily subcutaneous
      injections of LMWH for the patients for this duration, which is inconvenient for the
      patients. There are currently no studies on use of DOACs for thromboprophylaxis in patients
      with SCI.

      We will perform a pilot study at Hamilton General on apixaban versus LMWH for
      thromboprophylaxis in patients with acute SCI. Upon providing written informed consent,
      eligible patients will be randomized to apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or LMWH, either
      enoxaparin 40 mg or dalteparin 5000 units, subcutaneously once daily for 90 days or until
      fully mobilized, whatever comes first.

      The primary outcome for the feasibility study will be the recruitment rate per year (i.e. the
      screened to enrolled ratio). Other key feasibility measures will be accrual ratio, protocol
      violations pertaining to eligibility criteria and randomization procedures, retention rate
      for primary end-point assessment at 1 year, and the estimates of endpoint rates in the
      population. The primary efficacy endpoint will be a composite of symptomatic, objectively
      verified VTE (upper or lower limb DVT and/or PE) or sudden death where PE cannot be excluded.
      The primary safety endpoint will be major bleeding.

      This will be the first study comparing the use of LMWH against a DOAC in SCI patients. Use of
      a DOAC such as apixaban can eliminate the burden associated with daily injections for the
      patients.
