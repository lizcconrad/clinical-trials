  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the hypothesis that gene transcriptional changes occur within 24
      hours of virus exposure in the blood and nasal mucosa, and to identify early biomarker
      signatures that are predictive of higher viral shedding at the peak of disease
    </textblock>

      This study will systematically investigate the early pre-symptomatic period following
      exposure to influenza in humans. The data obtained will be essential for further
      understanding of the natural history of human antiviral responses, and will allow us to
      identify a panel of biomarkers that can predict which individuals will go on to more severe
      symptoms and higher viral shedding, so that treatments and other interventions can be made at
      an early stage.

    <description>Participants will be inoculated with Influenza A/California/04/09 3.5x10(4) tissue culture infective dose 50% (TCID50) in 1 mL in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) delivered by intranasal drops. They will then be monitored as in-patients for 10 days with daily clinical assessment and blood and respiratory tract sampling. Following discharge, they will be followed up for up to 6 months post-inoculation.</description>
