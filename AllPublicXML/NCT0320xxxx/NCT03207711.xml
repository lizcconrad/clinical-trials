  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most expensive chronic disease in the U.S.

      Lifestyle modification is central to T2DM management, but long-term adherence to dietary
      recommendations is difficult. A key challenge is the difficulty of coping with cravings for
      high carbohydrate or sugar-laden foods in an environment where these foods are tempting and
      widely available. One mechanism by which mindfulness may increase long-term dietary adherence
      is by better equipping individuals with skills to experience food cravings and difficult
      emotions without eating in response. Such approaches seek to strengthen abilities to be
      non-judgmentally aware of, tolerate, and respond skillfully to food cravings and difficult
      emotions without reacting impulsively or maladaptively. The investigators hypothesize that
      improved ability to manage food cravings and emotional eating is a key mechanism through
      which mindfulness-enhancements can improve dietary adherence. The study will test a
      mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for improving dietary adherence. Although the particular
      diet employed is not the focus of this study, the study will use a diet with about 10% of
      calories from carbohydrate as: (1) it induces a low level of ketone production, which will be
      used as a biomarker for dietary adherence; (2) prior studies suggest it improves metabolic
      parameters in T2DM, including glycemic control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods to measure eating in
      response to difficult emotions and/or food cravings. In the R61 phase, the team will ensure
      this measure is appropriate for further testing and assess the impact of the MBI components
      on our hypothesized behavioral mechanisms in N=60 persons with T2DM. The study plans 3 waves
      of 20 persons each with 12 weekly sessions. All participants will attend an in-person group
      course providing education on basic behavioral strategies for diet and physical activity.
      Participants will be randomized to receive this education alone (Ed) or this same material
      with added MBI components (Ed+MBI). The team will also pilot test two levels of intensity of
      maintenance phase intervention (monthly group meetings alone or supplemented by
      individualized attention) to prepare them for R33 testing. the investigators plan an R33
      phase trial in which 120 persons with T2DM will be randomized (using a 1:2 ratio) to Ed or
      Ed+MBI conditions and followed for 12 months, including a 9-month maintenance phase. The
      study will test the robustness of the effect of MBI components on our proposed behavioral
      mechanisms, and on dietary adherence, as well as preliminary effect sizes on weight and
      glycemic control. The study will use an innovative adaptive intervention design to optimize
      maintenance phase intensity, which the investigators believe may be key to augment the MBI
      effects.

    <description>All participants will receive instruction in the carbohydrate-restricted diet (CR).The study diet has approximately 10% of kcal coming from carbohydrate, typically 50 grams/day or fewer, not including fiber. Participants will be encouraged to eat a normal amount of protein, typically about 80-100 grams/day (about 20-25% of calories), and the rest of their calories from fat. Foods that are encouraged include green leafy and other non-starchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, oils (especially olive oil), fish, poultry, tofu, and avocados. Other foods consistent with the diet include berries (in modest amounts), meats, eggs, and cheese. Key foods to minimize include any sugar-sweetened foods or beverages, bread, pasta, potatoes, highly processed packaged foods, and other starchy foods.</description>

    <description>In addition to the carbohydrate-restricted diet described above, the Ed+MBI group will receive mindfulness training consisting of two integrated components: 1) use of a mindful eating app at home to learn and practice mindfulness skills for food-cravings and eating, and 2) in-person group-based meetings to discuss and troubleshoot how the mindfulness practices are working. Key mindfulness content includes helping people improve their relationship with food and control food cravings and using mindful eating approaches including paying attention, noticing habit loops, understanding brain science and food/sugar addiction, disrupting emotional and stress eating, cultivating acceptance and curiosity, lovingkindness, detaching from thoughts, using healthy restraint, and maintaining motivation.</description>

             intake so that they can follow either diet, and otherwise be able and willing to
             participate in the intervention. Intervention content must be practiced to evaluate
             whether it is effective.
