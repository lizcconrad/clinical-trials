  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In approximately half of individuals with Down syndrome, an higher than normal number of
      vessels cross the optic disc margin. Investigator hypothesize that early retinal vessel
      branching occurs due to inhibition of angiogenesis by triplet overexpression of endostatin,
      an angiogenesis inhibitor encoded on chromosome 21. Since angiogenesis is critical in the
      development of eyes and other organs angiogenesis depended (specially kidney, brain, and
      recently described lungs and heart), early branching of retinal vessels at the level of the
      optic disc would also likely result in abnormal renal and other organs development in these
      individuals. Investigator wish to determine whether observation of optic disc vessels may
      serve as an indicator of elevated endostatin levels and other angiogenesis-dependent organs
      anomalies.

      Investigator will measure the serum levels of endostatin as well as others angiogenetic
      factors in Down syndrome children versus control group 1 constituted by the patient mothers.

      Investigator will also perform renal and low urinary tract Doppler ultrasound with
      measurement of renal dimension in order to determine if the kidneys of patients with high
      level of serum of endostatin are smaller than those of patients with normal level of
      endostatin. Data observed in Down syndrome children will be compared to control group 2age
      constituted by sex and age matched healthy children Urine microalbuminuria and urine
      microalbuminuria/creatinuria from the first urine in the morning will be evaluated.
