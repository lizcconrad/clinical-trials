  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects 1.4 million people in the U.S. and its incidence has doubled
      over the past 20 years. The Diabetes Autoimmunity in the Young Study (DAISY) will estimate
      overall burden of T1D and other autoimmune diseases in the general population by age 30. The
      study will evaluate environmental risk factors for development of islet autoimmunity and
      progression to T1D.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children determined to be at an increased risk for development of type 1 diabetes, either due
      to known genetic markers or due to family history of T1D, are followed from birth and
      monitored for development of T1D-related autoimmunity, on an annual basis. At annual clinic
      visits, participants are tested for development of these autoantibodies and data is collected
      related to environmental exposures. In addition to blood collection for determination of
      autoantibodies, serum and plasma are frozen, and stored for future analyses. Other biological
      samples collected for further future analysis include: throat swabs, rectal swabs, saliva,
      and urine. If T1D-related autoantibodies are detected, the participant is asked to increase
      the frequency of clinic visits to 2-4 visits per year in order to more closely monitor for
      onset of disease. The endpoint of the study is diagnosis of T1D per the American Diabetes
      Association (ADA) criteria.

        The study population was selected from among the eligible population in the Denver
        Metropolitan are as described in the section above. Approximately 50% of the participants
        are female. The ethnic distribution in the general population newborn cohort is
        representative of the general Denver Metro area population: 7% African American, 30%
        Hispanic, 56% non-Hispanic white, and the remaining of biracial or other ethnicity. The
        ethnic distribution of the sibling/offspring cohort is representative of T1D in the general
        U.S. population: 5% African American, 10% Hispanic and 85% non-Hispanic white.
