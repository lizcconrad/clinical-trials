  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serial use of urine multi-level pregnancy tests (MLPTs) has been shown to be a reliable and
      efficient strategy for excluding ongoing pregnancy after medical abortion at ≤ 63 days of
      gestation. This pilot project will assess whether MLPTs can enhance the quality of remote
      medical abortion services through enabling women to reliably ascertain their abortion
      outcomes at home sooner than would otherwise have been the case.

      safe2choose provides remote medical abortion services through the Internet (information,
      counselling and access to abortion pills) in a growing number of countries worldwide.
      safe2choose will collaborate with Gynuity Health Projects to pilot the utility of MLPTs for
      home follow-up as part of its remote medical abortion services.

      As safe2choose does not have a physical office, the location of the sponsor's office is
      listed in this entry as the study location. Women from the United States are NOT eligible to
      enroll.

    <description>Study participants will be instructed to perform a baseline MLPT immediately prior to administering the first dose of abortion medication and a second MLPT one week later to ascertain the follow-up hCG range. Any woman who obtains a stable or increasing hCG result, when comparing the baseline test result with the follow-up test result, will be instructed to contact safe2choose. Any woman who obtains a decrease in her hCG range, when comparing the baseline test result with the follow-up test result, will be informed that her abortion was a success and she is no longer pregnant.</description>
