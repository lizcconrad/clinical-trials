  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve detection of esophageal (pre)malignant lesions during surveillance endoscopy of
      patients at risk of developing malignancies, for example in Barrett's Esophagus (BE), there
      is a need for better endoscopic visualization and the ability for targeted biopsies. Optical
      molecular imaging of neoplasia associated biomarkers could form a promising technique to
      accommodate this need. It is known that the biomarker c-Met is overexpressed in dysplastic
      and neoplastic areas in BE segments versus normal tissue and has proven to be a valid target
      for molecular imaging.

      Edinburgh Molecular Imaging Ltd (EMI) has developed a fluorescent tracer specifically
      targeting c-Met by labeling a small peptide to a fluorescent fluorophore: 'EMI-137'. The
      investigators hypothesize that when EMI-137 is administered intravenously, it accumulates in
      c-Met expressing high grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), enabling
      (early) cancer visualization using a newly developed fluorescent fiber-bundle. This
      hypothesis will be tested in the current pilot intervention study.
