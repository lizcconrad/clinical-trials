  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major burn patients are characterized by large exudative losses of Cu, Se and Zn. Trace
      element (TE) repletion has been shown to improve clinical outcome. The study aimed to check
      if our repletion protocols were achieving normalization of TE plasma concentrations of major
      burn patients and if the necessity for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) might
      increase the needs.

      Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in burn patients requiring intensive
      care (ICU) between 1999 and 2015. The cohort was divided into 4 groups according to the
      protocol changes. Period 1 (P1): 1999-2000, P2: 2001-2005, P3: 2006-2010, P4: 2011-2015.
      Changes consisted mainly in increasing TE repletion doses and duration. Demographic data,
      daily TE intakes and weekly plasma concentrations were retrieved for the first 21 ICU-days.

    <description>Infectious complications retrieved from the discharge reports, based on microbiological findings and antibiotherapy introduction or rotation. Multiple positive cultures were considered only once when they were related to a unique infectious episode. Concomitant sites of infection, including primary bloodstream infections, were considered as separate episodes of infections. Episodes of infections due to several microorganisms were considered only once. Infections were defined according to the criteria of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), American Burn Association (ABA) and International sepsis forum.</description>
