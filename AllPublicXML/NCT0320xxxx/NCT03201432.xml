  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the important causes of disability and death in the world, in which more
      than half were ischemic strokes. About 1/4 of the ischemic stroke occurred in the vertebral
      basilar artery system, especially when in the presence of extracranial proximal vertebral
      artery stenosis. Vertebral artery stenting is a minimally invasive method for the
      reconstruction of vertebral artery stenosis and the early clinical studies showed that it was
      feasible, safe and effective, but the high rate of restenosis has become a bottleneck
      restricting its development. Previous systematic review had suggested that the drug eluting
      stent might reduce the incidence of restenosis of vertebral artery. However, prospective
      randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of bare metal stents and drug eluting
      stents on the prevention of restenosis remains absent.

      60 patients were randomly assigned into DES and BES group to compare the safety and efficacy
      in the treatment of symptomatic extracranial vertebral artery stenosis with drug eluting
      stents (YINYI) and bare metal stents (Express SD), especially the stent restenosis rate after
      6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic posterior circulation ischemia（Vertebral basilar artery system TIA or
             non-disabling ischemic stroke）result from the stenosis in the extracranial proximal
             vertebral artery stenosis.

          -  Atherosclerotic extracranial proximal vertebral artery stenosis demonstrated by
             angiography(any of the following): 1) bilateral vertebral artery stenosis ≥70%, or
             vertebral artery stenosis ≥70% concomitant occlusion of contralateral vertebral
             artery; 2) superior lateral vertebral artery stenosis ≥70%; 3) non-superior lateral
             vertebral artery stenosis ≥50%, but the vertebral artery was directly extended to the
             posterior inferior cerebellar artery on this side and symptoms were related to
             insufficiency of the ipsilateral posterior inferior cerebellar artery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) lesions characteristics (such as diffuse lesions) which was not suitable for
             interventional treatment, or unstable condition that cannot tolerate the
             interventional therapy;

          -  2) vertebral artery stenosis caused by non atherosclerosis disease: Takayasu arteritis
             or other diseases;

          -  3) severe stroke within 3 months;

          -  4) contraindicated using contrast agents: such as chronic renal insufficiency or had
             serious contrast agents allergy history;

          -  5) malignant tumor;

          -  6) with Alzheimer's disease or mental illness previously or currently ;
