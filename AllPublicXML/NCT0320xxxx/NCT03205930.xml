    <textblock>
      Neoantigen （Neo）is a new targets for immune cells，that the DC neoantigen immunotherapy was
      more effective in triggering specific T-cell responses. Neo-MASCT using the DC vaccine and
      neoantigen T cells .Dendritic cells(DC) was induced from autologous peripheral blood，and be
      loaded with antigens and re-infused. In vitro, antigen-pulsed DC can stimulate autologous
      T-cell proliferation and induction of autologous specific cytotoxic T-cells(CTL)，similarly
      re-infused.

      The study is aimed to evaluate the safety of Neo-MASCT in patients with advanced NSCLC.

      This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is the safety study in small samples,
      and the second stage is the sample size expansion phase.

      20 failed standard treatment patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC will be recruited .
