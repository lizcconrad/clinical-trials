  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Debio 1450 is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4, therefore inhibitors of CYP3A4 have the potential
      to raise Debio 1450 plasma concentrations. Hence, it is important to determine the effect of
      CYP3A4 inhibition by itraconazole on the Pharmacokinetics of Debio 1450.
