  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Esophageal cancer is a common cause of cancer deaths. Most cases of this cancer are
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Many of these cases come from two parts of the
      world with high-risk. One of these is in East Africa and include the country of Malawi.
      Researchers want to learn what factors explain the high risk there so we can understand
      better what causes this cancer in people everywhere.

      Objective:

      To learn more about causes and outcomes of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using Malawi
      because of the large number of cases in that country.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old who have ESCC and live in a certain region of Malawi

      Adults in the same age group and location who do not have ESCC

      Design:

      Participants will be screened at a hospital in Malawi.

      Participants will have a 1-hour interview. They will answer questions about:

      Demographics (age, ethnicity, education)

      Place of residence

      Medical history and family medical history

      Drug, alcohol, and tobacco use

      Hot beverage consumption

      Indoor air pollution

      Occupation

      Food habits

      Farming

      Gastrointestinal health

      Participants will have their teeth and fingernails examined.

      Participants will be asked to give samples of blood, urine, saliva, toenails, and for the
      cancer cases, a small piece of their tumor.

      Participants will have 4 phone calls a year for 2 years to ask about their health....

      Background: Esophageal cancer causes an estimated 400,000 deaths per year and ranks as the
      sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, just after breast cancer. Esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for 89% of all esophageal cancer cases worldwide and many of
      the cases originate in two high risk regions, one in Asia and the other in Africa. Smoking
      tobacco and heavy alcohol consumption do not explain the incidence rates in the high-risk
      regions. It is therefore important to consider a wide range of etiologic factors to explain
      the high rates of cancer in these populations. Malawi has the highest incidence rates of ESCC
      in Africa. Our previous studies in Kenya and preliminary studies in Malawi point to a number
      of potential ESCC risk factors.

      Objectives: Our study aims to enhance our understanding of the causes and outcomes for ESCC
      in Malawi

      Eligibility: All suspected ESCC cases will be eligible for enrollment.

      Design: We will conduct a case-control study of ESCC at Kamuzu Central Hospital, recruiting
      300 ESCC cases and 300 controls, to (1) evaluate exposures (including consumption of very hot
      beverages, use of firewood as fuel, tooth loss and animal exposure) which may influence risk
      of ESCC in Malawi and (2) collect biological samples to quantify exposures of interest
      (included in the current proposal) and to study the genetics and genomics of ESCC tumors (to
      be included in a future proposal).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  All suspected ESCC cases will be eligible for enrollment.

          -  All KCH patients (Bullet)18 years of age who are residents of the Central Region of
             Malawi and are diagnosed with histology-confirmed ESCC will be invited to participate
             as cases in the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients &lt;18 years old

          -  Those living outside the Central Region, those who are medically unable to complete
             the study procedures (including questionnaire, biosample collection or endoscopy), and
             those who are unable to understand the study procedures or give informed consent.

        While we do expect to see younger people with ESCC in Malawi (as we have seen in Kenya),
        cases under the age of 18 are rare: the field team would expect to see one or two a year.
        This estimate is in line with the cancer registry data from Malawi. Therefore, we will not
        enroll subjects younger than 18 years old.
