  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG)
      with diet and exercise, to diet and exercise alone, to see which is better in weight loss
      reduction. We will also compare the effects of ESG to diet and exercise comorbidities such as
      diabetes, sleep apnea and high cholesterol as well as the various obesity related hormones.

      This is a single center, prospective randomized case control study with an additional non
      randomized case arm. This study includes two research interventional groups. Groups A: ESG
      with diet and exercise modules. Group B: Diet and exercise modules only. We propose to
      compare ESG to behavioral modification including diet and exercise for patients who have a
      BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2 or greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 with 1 or more
      obesity related co-morbidity and who cannot undergo conventional bariatric surgery(or decline
      the surgical option). We will also compare the effects of ESG to diet and exercise on
      comorbidities such as diabetes, sleep apnea and high cholesterol as well as the various
      obesity related hormones.
