    <textblock>
      Background:

      Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare tumors. They usually form inside and near the
      adrenal gland or in the neck region. Not all these tumors can be removed with surgery, and
      there are no good treatments if the disease has spread. Researchers think a new drug may be
      able to help.

      Objective:

      To learn the safety and tolerability of Lu-177-DOTATATE. Also, to see if it improves the
      length of time it takes for the cancer to return.

      Eligibility:

      Adults who have an inoperable tumor of the study cancer that can be detected with
      Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

      Eligible participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center.

      Participants will get the study drug in an intravenous infusion. They will get 4 doses, given
      about 8 weeks apart.

      Between 4 and 24 hours after each study drug dose, participants will have scans taken. They
      will lie on their back on a scanner table.

      Participants will have vital signs taken. They will give blood and urine samples.

      During the study, participants will have other scans taken. Some scans will use a radioactive
      tracer.

      Participants will complete quality of life questionnaires.

      Participants will be contacted by phone 1-3 days after they leave the Clinical Center. They
      will then be followed every 3 to 6 months for 3 years or until their disease gets worse.

      Background:

        -  Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) are rare tumors arising from neural crest
           tissue that can develop in sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia throughout the
           body. Those arising in the adrenal gland are called PHEOs while those located
           extraadrenally are called PGLs.

        -  While benign and uni-focal, PHEO/PGL can be effectively treated with surgical resection,
           patients with metastatic PHEO/PGL often times have few effective and efficient treatment
           options with current treatments aimed more at palliation and symptom control.
           Furthermore, some benign head and neck PGLs may be inoperable because of their size and
           location.

        -  Somatostatin receptors (SSTR), especially type 2, have been shown to be over-expressed
           in a number of human tumors, including gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), carcinoids,
           neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, and PHEO/PGL among many others.

        -  Ionizing radiation such as the beta particles emitted by Lu-177 cause DNA damage to
           target cells through both direct and indirect mechanisms. In addition, ionizing
           radiation has also been shown to induce cell death through what is known as the
           bystander effect, a phenomenon where cellular signaling from irradiated cells towards
           non-irradiated cells induces cellular damage and eventually death in nearby surrounding
           cells.

        -  Lu-177-DOTATATE is a somatostatin analog that predominantly recognizes SSTR2. This
           reagent has been used extensively and its well-tolerated safety profile and efficacy has
           been shown in a variety of neuroendocrine tumors.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the safety and to evaluate the ability of Lu-177-DOTATATE to improve upon
      progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months in patients with inoperable, SSTR positive
      PHEO/PGL by comparing PFS of patients treated with Lu-177-DOTATATE to historical controls
      from existing literature.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically-proven, surgically inoperable, PHEO/PGL patients (both newly diagnosed or
           patients with existing diagnoses are eligible)

        -  Must have presence of SSTR+ disease as documented by positive Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan

             -  Positivity of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan defined as having at least one lesion that is
                greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter with uptake that is higher than or equal
                to liver and is qualitatively higher and distinguishable from background activity.

             -  Patients with bone-only disease (i.e. no RECIST-measurable lesion) will also be
                eligible as long as the Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan is positive

        -  Age: greater than or equal to 18

        -  Karnofsky Performance Score greater than or equal to 60

        -  Able to understand and willing to sign informed consent

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-arm, single-center, phase 2 study evaluating efficacy and safety of
           Lu-177-DOTATATE in the selected patient population divided into two cohorts: 1) SDHx
           cohort will include patients with the succinate dehydrogenase mutation, which is the
           most common and most aggressive genetic sub-group of patients with PHEO/PGL, and 2)
           apparent sporadic cohort which will include patients without a clear genetic mutation

        -  Simon 2-stage optimal design will be applied to each cohort independently. For each
           cohort, if 11/18 patients are progression-free at 6 months, accrual will proceed to the
           second stage, where an additional 23 patients will be accrued, for a total of 41
           patients per cohort.

        -  Assuming a loss-to-follow-up rate of 10%, a total of 45 patients will be accrued to each
           cohort, with a total accrual ceiling of 90 patients.
