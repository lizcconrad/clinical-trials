  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center Phase 2 study in subjects with histologically
      documented MCL who have no response or relapse after ≥ 1 but &lt; 5 prior treatment regimen(s).
      The study is composed of an initial screening phase, a single-arm treatment phase, and a
      follow-up phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnostic report has to include evidence for morphological and cyclin D1 or t (11;
             14).

          2. Men and women, 18-75 years of age.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

          4. Measurable disease by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI).

          5. Received prior regimens for MCL.

          6. Documented failure to achieve any response, [stable disease (SD) or progressive
             disease during treatment] or documented progressive disease after response to the most
             recent treatment regimen.

          7. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

          8. Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN (unless documented Gilbert's syndrome).

          9. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective forms of birth
             control throughout the course of the study and at least up to 90 days after last dose
             of study drug. Highly effective forms of birth control include abstinence,
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy with no menstrual bleeding for 6 months,
             intrauterine contraception, hormonal methods such as contraceptive injection, oral
             contraceptive, etc. Males must have undergone sterilization-vasectomy, or utilize a
             barrier method while the female partner utilizes the effective forms of birth control
             noted above.

         10. Life expectancy of &gt; 4 months.

         11. Able to provide written informed consent and can understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or history of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.

          2. Prior exposure to a BTK inhibitor before enrollment.

          3. Prior corticosteroids with anti-neoplastic intent within 7 days.

          4. Major surgery within 4 weeks of screening.

          5. Toxicity must recover from prior chemotherapy.

          6. History of other active malignancies within 2 years of study entry.

          7. Currently clinically significant active cardiovascular disease.

          8. QTcF &gt; 450 msecs or other significant ECG abnormalities.

          9. Uncontrolled systemic infection or infection requiring parenteral anti-microbial
             therapy.

         10. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or active hepatitis B or hepatitis
             C infection (detected positive by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).

         11. Pregnant or lactating women.

         12. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition or organ system dysfunction which, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, or put the study at
             risk.
