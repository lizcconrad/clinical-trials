    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to photographically characterize the endometrium in patients
      presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding at age group from 20 to 45 years old.

      and compare dilatation and curettage with hysteroscopy in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of
      the etiology of abnormal uterine bleeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menstrual dysfunction is the cause of discomfort and disturbed healthy lifestyle. Abnormal
      uterine bleeding (AUB) is considered as a common problem in premenopausal women. AUB is
      defined as bleeding from the uterine that is abnormal in volume, regularity, and/or timing.

      There are various diagnostic modalities available in the market, ranging from traditional
      dilation and curettage (D&amp;C), transvaginal sonography, hysteroscopy and saline infusion
      sonography. Dilation and curettage is the most widely used simple day care procedure for
      histological evaluation of the endometrial. It was once considered as the gold standard of
      investigating women with AUB.

      Office hysteroscopy is a very useful technique for diagnosis and treatment of uterine
      pathology in an office-based environment. It is directly related to the technological
      explosion, which during the last years has further evolved and given us the opportunity to
      perform hysteroscopy without providing general anesthesia or sedation to the patients, due to
      the narrow width of the latest generation hysteroscopes. Hysteroscopic inspection of uterine
      cavity is a simple and well accepted method. The direct real time visualization, real-color,
      hydrated, well-illuminated, and augmented vision of the uterine cavity make this diagnostic
      tool very accurate to detect minute focal endometrial pathology and small lesions and helping
      us to take well guided direct biopsies.
