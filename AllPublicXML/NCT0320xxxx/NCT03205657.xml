  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to perform a retrospective review of patients with poor risk
      relapsed/refractory B-NHL having received HSCT and targeted immunotherapy at the Maria Fareri
      Children's Hospital between January 1, 2012 and June 1, 2015. The investigators will review
      the clinical records and collect the data with de-identified medical information from our
      HSCT clinical research database.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will obtain the following information from the patient's medical records:
      clinical factors including age at presentation, gender, clinical presentation, laboratory and
      pathology data, lymphoma diagnosis, clinical staging criteria, anti-cancer therapy as well as
      supportive care medicines, complications of therapy (adverse events graded from CTCAE v4.0),
      and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy (chemotherapy, donor source, cell dose),
      course (engraftment, GVHD, chimerism), and follow-up (disease status).

    <description>Adverse events (according to CTCAE 4.0) will be reviewed for all as well as outcome data retrospectively to determine if the treatment was equal or better than standard of care for relapse/refractory B-NHL in terms of the number of adverse events reported. Data reviewed will include laboratory values, radiology exams and disease evaluations.</description>
