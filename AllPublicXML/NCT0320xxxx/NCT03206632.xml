  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      690517 in healthy Chinese and Japanese male subjects following oral administration of single
      doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose
      proportionality as well as the investigation of pharmacodynamic effects following single
      rising doses of BI 690517.

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days
