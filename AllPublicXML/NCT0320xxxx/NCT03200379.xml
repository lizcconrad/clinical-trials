      To determine the treatment efficacy, safety and long-term outcomes of chronic hepatitis C
      patients receiving directly acting antivirals in Taiwan

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) in Taiwan supports the use of antivirals
      against CHC. Recently, the introduction of directly acting antivirals (DAA) has markedly
      improved the treatment adherence, efficacy and safety issues in well-designed clinical
      trials. However, the real world community effectiveness and long-term benefits of DAA for HCV
      treatments remain to be determined. Since the NHIA in Taiwan has reimbursed the DAA in the
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients in the near future, establishment of a well
      prospectively designed registry policy is demanded in the national level to explore the unmet
      needs of HCV control in Taiwan. The primary purpose of the study is to establish a nationwide
      registry of patients undergoing antiviral treatment with DAA regimens for CHC at both
      academic and community practices. Based on this database, the clinical gaps regarding to
      treatment guidelines and management of adverse events will be identified. The registry system
      will be established as a research network and provide sufficient high-quality clinical
      information for investigators in Taiwan.

        Eligible subjects would be those CHC patients who receive approved DAA in the daily
        practice. No clinical developing medications will be allocated patients. Baseline
        characteristics including viral status and basic demography will be evaluated before
        antiviral therapy. On treatment responses and adverse events will be and recorded during
        treatment period. The final treatment outcome defined as sustained virological response 12
        weeks after treatment (SVR12) and safety profile will be then judged and evaluated. To
        explore the long-term outcome of the CHC patients receiving DAAs, patients will receive
        constant post-treatment outpatient department follow-up. All the interventions and
        follow-up strategy will be the same as other CHC patients who do not precipitate in the
        projects.
