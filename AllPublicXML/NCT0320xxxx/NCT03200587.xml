  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized, phase I dose-finding, of Cabometyx +
      Avelumab, to establish safety, feasibility, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Cabometyx in combination with Avelumab, and to investigate
      preliminary efficacy. The MTD or RP2D determined in this study will be used for a future
      study to formally test efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subject aged ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histologically proven mRCC with a clear cell component.

          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Measureable disease by RECIST 1.1

          -  ECOG Score 0-1

          -  Adequate organ function as described in the protocol

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening for women of childbearing
             potential

          -  Highly effective contraception for both male and female subjects throughout the study
             and for at least 120 days after last Avelumab treatment administration if the risk of
             conception exists

          -  Able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following:

               1. intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,
                  intra-articular injection);

               2. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or
                  equivalent;

               3. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan
                  premedication).

          -  Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immuno-stimulatory
             agent per treating physician's clinical judgment. Subjects with diabetes type I,
             vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid diseases not requiring immunosuppressive
             treatment are eligible.

          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation.

          -  Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics (antibiotics should have been
             completed prior to registration).

          -  Known history of testing positive for HIV or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

          -  Known history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at
             screening (positive HBV surface antigen or detectable HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody
             screening test positive)

          -  Active and inactive vaccinations within 4 weeks of the first dose of Avelumab and
             while on trial is prohibited.

          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
             antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3).

          -  Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (≥ New York Heart
             Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring
             medication.

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1); however,
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 not constituting a safety
             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory bowel
             disease, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into this study.

          -  Subjects taking prohibited medications as described in protocol. A washout period of
             prohibited medications for a period of at least two weeks or as clinically indicated
             should occur prior to the start of treatment
