  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation is an effective therapy for
      controlling urinary incontinence. Premature ejaculation (PE) and urinary incontinence are
      anatomically and physio-pathologically similar. Based on this, the use of this therapy is
      considered to be viable for the control of PE.

      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve
      electrostimulation for the ejaculatory reflex.

      Patients and Methods: Phase II clinical trial. Patients with a diagnosis of premature
      ejaculation who are treated at the Colombia Boston Medical Group clinic will be included. The
      participants will receive 3 transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation therapies per
      week for 12 weeks. The IELT and the PEDT scale will be evaluated on week 6, at the end of
      treatment and three months after completing the protocol.

    <description>Three (3) sessions per week for twelve (12) consecutive weeks, with a duration of 30 minutes each, with the application of 20 Hertz with a pulse amplitude of 200 MI sec. in each session. The intensity will be applied individually for each patient depending on the tolerance of the individual. In each session, it is normal to have plantar flexion of the foot and flexion of the first toe, and after the session and particularly during the first sessions there is the possibility of muscle pain, which should be tolerable.</description>
