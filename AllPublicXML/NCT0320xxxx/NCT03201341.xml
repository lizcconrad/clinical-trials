  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To accurately control body movements to interact with objects, our brain needs
      representations of the body and the nearby space. The broader aim of this research project is
      to study the behavioural and physiological mechanisms involved in the constitution of these
      representations, to identify their neural bases, in order to better understand the
      dysfunctions in the context of neurological or developmental disorders.

    <description>To better understand the normal functioning of the brain within the framework of the representation of the body and of the space of action. During the experiment, physiological measurements will be recorded: electrical activity at the surface of the muscles (electromyography - EMG), scalp (electroencephalography - EEG) or skin (electrodermal response). Similarly, the movements of the arm will be recorded using an infrared kinematic system requiring simply the placement of markers at strategic points such as the tip of the thumb and forefinger, the wrist, the elbow ... Movements of the eyes can also be recorded, either with the aid of an electrooculograph (EOG) or with the aid of an infrared tracking device. Electrotactile stimulations of very low intensity and painless can also be administered.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>To better understand the normal functioning of the brain in the representation of the body and the space of action, to identify the brain areas critical for these functions and to determine their functional roles. The examination will consist of several very short scans at the very beginning and then a scan of about ten minutes intended to take a detailed anatomical image of the brain. Then, the subject will carry out the experimental task during one or more scan (s) whose cumulative duration will not exceed 45 minutes. The task accomplished is explained in detail by the experimenter.</description>

    <description>To better understand the normal functioning of the brain in the representation of the body and the space of action, to identify the critical brain areas for these functions and to determine their functional roles and to study how They interact.The complete examination includes a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment followed by an MRI examination. The task accomplished is explained in detail by the experimenter.</description>

    <description>To better understand the normal functioning of the brain in the representation of the body and the space of action, to determine the functional role of the brain areas involved in these processes. Before the Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) examination, MRI of the brain will be performed.The TMS review will consist of three distinct sessions separated from one another by at least one week, depending on the protocol, and which will differ simply at the site or type of stimulation.</description>

    <description>The acquisition of the surface EOG activity will be carried out by means of 3 surface electrodes, one of which, referred to as a reference, is placed on a bone zone (the glabella, above the nasion) and two others placed on The temples, coupled to an EOG amplifier.</description>

    <intervention_name>MEG</intervention_name>
    <description>During the examination, the subject will have to perform tasks comparable to those described for the fMRI procedure, but with the additional possibility, offered by the MEG environment, of performing pointing or seizing of objects, provided that the Trunk and the subject's head be held in place by a suitable restraint system.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</intervention_name>
    <description>TMS is a non-invasive technique that uses very short (~ 100μs) magnetic pulses applied to the scalp to transiently and focally disrupt or improve the functioning of neuronal populations in the underlying superficial cortical regions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial electrical stimulation in direct current (tDCS)</intervention_name>
    <description>The tDCS consists in passing a current of low intensity (generally ≤ 1mA to stimulate the cerebral cortex) between an anode and a cathode placed on the scalp, a part of this current crossing the tissues, and in particular the cortical regions situated between these two Electrodes. Generally, if the cathode is placed on the region of interest, it will be inhibited, while it will be energized if the anode is positioned thereon.</description>
