  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to assess the effect of different levels of muscle relaxation on the
      success of low-pressure insufflation, surgical conditions and patient recovery following
      laparoscopic repair of a ventral hernia (VHR) between 2 and 10cm in diameter. Patients will
      be randomized to moderate (TOF 1-2) or deep (post tetanic count 1-2) relaxation.

      Specific Aim 1. Compare two different modes of neuromuscular blockade (moderate and deep) on
      the ability to maintain low insufflation pressure during laparoscopic VHR. All procedures
      will start with low-pressure insufflation (8 mm Hg). Surgeon assessment of the conditions
      will be serially performed during surgery on an established visual scale. If conditions are
      deemed less than adequate (score 1-2), insufflation pressure will incrementally increase up
      to 15 mm Hg. Outcome for this specific aim will be the mean insufflation pressure during each
      procedure, and the ability to perform low-pressure laparoscopic VHR.

      Specific Aim 2. Evaluate the success of moderate neuromuscular blockade on the ability to
      maintain good conditions (visual scale grade 4 or 5) for each. Surgical conditions will be
      considered successful when scores are maintained at 4 or 5 throughout the duration of the
      procedure. Outcome for this aim will be the mean score for surgical condition assessment for
      each procedure, using a previously published surgeon-driven scoring system (score 4-5 will be
      used as a surrogate of good visualization).

      Specific Aim 3. Assess patient recovery with low and high insufflation pressures during
      laparoscopic VHR. Patient overall satisfaction with recovery, pain level, pain medication
      requirement, PONV incidence and severity will be assessed in multiple time points following
      surgery. Outcomes for this aim will be mean pain (visual scale), PONV severity (analogue
      score) and incidence (binary outcome), and patient satisfaction using the QoR-15 survey.
      Assessments will be performed at 30 minutes, 1, 12 and 24 hours following surgery.

Surgeon assessment of the conditions will be serially performed during surgery on an established visual scale. If conditions are deemed less than adequate (score 1-2), insufflation pressure will incrementally increase up to 15 mm Hg. Reversal of muscle relaxation will be performed at the end of the procedure using established medications used in clinical practice. In theory, deep relaxation may require a more prolonged reversal process, but using contemporary medical agents (sugammadex), reversal from deep relaxation is prompt (2-3 minutes) without any additional delays.</description>
