    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to determine the efficacy of new powered prosthetic
      devices for individuals with transfemoral amputations. The anticipation is that this will be
      a high-impact technological intervention with the potential to restore significant
      functionality to individuals with lower limb amputation and transform the field of lower limb
      prosthetics. The objective of the proposed clinical trial is to fully evaluate the
      biomechanical and energetic effects of using PKA prosthesis and quantify functional
      performance and quality of life changes.

      The overall goal of this research is to bring powered devices, with suitable advanced control
      systems, to the clinic and home. The anticipation is that this will be a high-impact
      technological intervention with the potential to restore significant functionality to
      individuals with lower limb amputation and transform the field of lower limb prosthetics.

      The objective of the proposed clinical trial is to fully evaluate the biomechanical and
      energetic effects of using a powered knee-ankle prosthesis, identify task-specific training
      strategies for every-day device use, and quantify functional performance and quality of life
      changes at home and in the community. The hypothesis is that the powered knee-ankle
      prosthesis will demonstrate a significant improvement in function over existing technology.
      Furthermore, the hypothesis is that incorporating neural control information will provide
      enhanced, intuitive control of this device. Thus the approach is to directly compare the
      powered device with current state-of-art passive microprocessor controlled (MP) prostheses
      using a randomized cross-over study to control for subject-specific variation.

      1.1 Aim 1: Perform in-laboratory training and testing to compare gait biomechanics and
      clinical performance over several ambulation modes using either a passive prosthesis or a
      powered prosthesis. The expectation is the PKA prosthesis to enable gait kinetics and
      kinematics that more closely resemble those of individuals with intact limbs, therefore
      lowering the biomechanical and metabolic effects of ambulation.

      1.2 Aim 2: Perform home trials to evaluate community mobility and social interaction when
      using a powered knee-ankle prosthesis or a passive device. The expectation is that
      participants will choose to complete more diverse functional, occupational, and recreational
      activities when using the PKA prosthesis.

      1.3 Aim 3: Quantify performance with the PKA device when using a novel intent recognition
      algorithm that allows for seamless transitioning between activities compared to a standard
      control method. The expectation is that pattern recognition- based control will further
      improve mobility and decrease the physiological costs of ambulation compared to using the
      standard control method.

    <intervention_model_description>Upon screening and enrollment participants return for up to 8 prosthetic fitting sessions and up to 12 physical therapy training sessions using their own microprocessor (MP) knee prosthesis and the powered knee-ankle (PKA) prosthesis. Once training is complete participants will return for up to 6 post-training assessment sessions per device. The device participants begin with will be randomly selected but there will be equal opportunity to train with both devices. In between training, there will be an 8 week &quot;wash out period&quot; to allow normalization to use of the device, reducing carryover effects. After wash-out period protocol will be repeated with second device.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Week 6-7 (Post-Training Assessments); Weeks 21-22 (Post-Training Assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>This test is used to determine participant's endurance while walking at different speeds on a motorized treadmill. Participants will be secured to an overhead safety harness during this test. Participants will walk for up to 2 minutes each at different speeds on the treadmill. The treadmill speeds will be varied between 0.2 meters/second up to 2.0 meters/second at increments of 0.2 meters/sec. Close to the end of every 2 minute walk period, the participant will be asked to rate the perceived exertion for the walking task. Before incrementing the speed and continuing with the test, participants will be asked if participants would like to continue to walk and if the speed can be incremented. Participants metabolic and heart rate will be monitored frequently and recorded during this test. A physical exertion rating scale will be used to record participant's perceived exertion during every 2 minutes throughout the trial.</description>

If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a mask to measure oxygen consumption. COSMED K4B2 (K4B2 COSMED, Italy) is a portable gas analysis system that measures oxygen consumption (VO2) and Carbon-dioxide production (VCO2 ) in a breath by breath fashion.</description>

It has been rigorously developed using modern psychometric methodology and is intended for use in clinical practice and research. PLUS-M™ instruments are based on a set of 44 calibrated questions called an item bank. PLUS-M™ instruments measure prosthetic users' mobility (i.e., the ability to move intentionally and independently from one place to another). PLUS-M™ questions assess respondents' perceived ability to carry out actions that require use of both lower limbs, ranging from household ambulation to outdoor recreational activities. The described activities relate to two primary forms of movement, locomotion (i.e., movement in a continuous, repeatable pattern) and/or postural transitions (i.e., movement from one position to another or one type of activity to another).</description>

    <description>The Vanderbilt powered prosthesis is a transfemoral prosthesis with powered and coordinated knee and ankle joints. The Generation 3 prosthesis is actuated by two brushless direct current (DC) motors, providing up to 100 Nm of torque at the knee joint, and with the assistance of a parallel stiffness, up to 200 Nm in plantar flexion at the ankle. Sensors measure knee and ankle joint angles, axial load in the shank, and position and orientation of the prosthesis in space (via a 6-axis inertial measurement unit). An onboard lithium-ion battery provides sufficient energy for approximately 10,000 steps between battery charges. The prosthesis prototype weighs approximately 4.3 kg (9.5 lb), the mass of which is approximately equivalent to the intact limb of a 48 kg (105 lb) person.</description>
