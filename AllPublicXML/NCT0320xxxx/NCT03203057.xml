      Background Troponin are proteins found in the cardiomyocyte and are a cornerstone in the
      diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction. Troponin is released to the bloodstream as a result
      of an cardiomyocyte injury. Troponin is frequently assessed in hospital care for patients
      with chest pain and dyspnea.

      Guidelines recommend troponin assessment at admission and repeated at 3 to 6 hours, depending
      on the assay. High-sensitivity assays measure concentrations that are ten-times lower than
      earlier generations of assays. However, the time from when troponin is elevated in the
      bloodstream after an ischemic injury, measured with high-sensitivity assays, are not fully
      known.

      During an X-ray imaging of the heart's blood vessels (coronary angiogram) it is possible to
      do a short, controlled occlusion of coronary artery by inflating a small balloon in one of
      the coronary arteries. Numerous earlier studies in patients have used this method for induced
      occlusion of one coronary artery for 1 to 3 minutes. Only one of the studies measured
      troponin I.

      The aim with this study is to quantify and compare the release of troponin T and troponin I
      in the early hours after a controlled induced ischemia.

      Study Design This is a prospective, descriptive and experimental study. There will be
      included 40 patients, without acute ischemic cardiac disease. They will be randomized in 4
      groups.

      0: 10 patients - control group, no balloon occlusion

        1. 10 patients - balloon occlusion for 30 seconds

        2. 10 patients - balloon occlusion for 60 seconds

        3. 10 patients - balloon occlusion for 90 seconds

      Subsequently there will be assessed serial blood samples 0 - 3 hours: Every 15 minutes 3 - 6
      hours: Every 30 minutes

      Statistics This is a pilot study and it is estimated that ten patients are sufficient number
      of patients in each group to assess elevation of troponin after occlusion of coronary artery.
      The thesis is there is a dosage-response correlation between the length of balloon occlusion
      and the concentration of troponin in blood stream.
