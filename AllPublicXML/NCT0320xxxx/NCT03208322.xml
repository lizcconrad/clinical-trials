  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the number of adverse events (AEs)
      reported by chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients receiving at least 1 dose of daclatasvir (DCV)
      and asunaprevir (ASV) at the 2 sentinel sites and that have been reported through the Mexican
      Health Authority's AE surveillance system during a specified 24-month study period. The
      secondary objective is to describe AEs reported by CHC patients receiving treatment with DCV
      and ASV treated by doctors at participating sentinel sites for the National Pharmacovigilance
      Center (CNFV) in Mexico during a specified 24-month study period.
