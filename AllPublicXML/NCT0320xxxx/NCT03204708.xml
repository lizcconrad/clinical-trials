  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy were divided into two groups. patients in
      catheter group were placed a catheter with open technique by the surgeon in the pectoral
      area. thirty minutes before extubation %1 lidocain 10 ml, %0.5 bupivacain 10 ml and 10 ml
      %0.9 sodium chloride were given through the catheter for postoperative analgesia. patients in
      iv analgesia group were given 100 mg tramadol iv 30 minutes before extubation. visual analog
      pain scale (VAS) scores, rescue analgesic requirement, complications were recorded and
      compared between two groups 1, 6, 12, 24 hours and 90 days after surgery.

      patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy were divided into two groups by computer.
      patients in catheter group were placed a catheter under clavipectoral fascia in the
      neighbourhood of nervus thoracicus longus, nervus thoracodorsalis, nervus pectoralis
      lateralis, nervus pectoralis medialis at the 1/3 lateral part of clavicula. solution included
      10 ml of %0.5 bupivacain, %1 lidocain, 10 ml %0.9 sodium chloride totally 30 ml were given
      via the catheter for postoperative analgesia at the end of surgery. patients in iv analgesia
      group were given 100 mg tramadol iv 30 minutes before extubation. Patients in both groups
      were given dexketoprofen 50 mg iv if the VAS score was over 4. VAS scores, rescue analgesic
      requirement and timing, complications were recorded and compared between groups 1, 6, 12, 24
      hours and 90 days after surgery.
