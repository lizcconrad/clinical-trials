  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase Ib dose-escalation study to assess MTD, safety, tolerability, and
      PK of PTC596 when combined with standard paclitaxel and carboplatin for women with stage III
      or IV epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer receiving neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. For all cohorts, PTC596 will be given in combination with paclitaxel and
      carboplatin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For all cohorts, PTC596 will be orally administered at least 30 minutes prior to IV
      chemotherapy, twice a week on day 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 of each 21-day cycle. The starting dose
      is 1.3 mg/kg in cohort 1. Carboplatin (AUC = 6 mg/mL min) will be administered IV on day 1
      and paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) will be administered IV once a week on days 1, 8 and 15 of each
      21-day cycle. Dose escalation levels for PTC- 596 are1.3mg/kg, 2.6mg/kg, 5.2 mg/kg and
      7.0mg/kg Q BIW. Doses may be de-escalated for management of toxicity with the lowest dose
      being 0.65 mg/kg. A total of 3 cycles of PTC596 and paclitaxel/ carboplatin will be given
      before iCRS and an additional 3-5 cycles following iCRS.
