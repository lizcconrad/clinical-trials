  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to characterize the acute cognitive and
      psychophysiological effects of the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis,
      9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in individuals with euthymic bipolar disorder (BD), and to
      begin probing the mechanisms that may underlie its effects in this illness.

      This study is expected to contribute to a better characterization of specific effects of THC
      in individuals with BD compared to healthy controls (HC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the dose related acute effects of inhaled THC, administered through a vaporizer
      over approximately 20 minutes, between HC and euthymic BD individuals (referred to as eBD) on
      a range of subjective and objective parameters as described below:

      Primary Aims:

        -  Verbal memory, measured by a modified computer version of the Rey Auditory Verbal
           Learning Test (RAVLT) and/or the CogState battery, administered while EEG data is
           collected.

        -  Executive functioning measured by the CogState battery and/or Trails Making Test-Part B.

      Secondary Aims:

        -  Attention, measured by the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (CPT-IP).

        -  Working memory, measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale-3 Letter-Number Sequencing.

        -  Mood, measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS).

        -  Psychotic-type experiences, measured by the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI)
           and/or the Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS).

        -  Anxiety symptoms, measured by the Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A).

        -  Impulsivity, measured by the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART).

      Exploratory aims:

      •Serum prolactin, serum ACTH, serum cortisol and serum endocannabinoid levels.
