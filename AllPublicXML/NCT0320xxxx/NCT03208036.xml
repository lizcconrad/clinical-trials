  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of interventions that can effectively target and remediate the cognitive and
      functional impairment associated with schizophrenia is a treatment priority. Transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that is
      capable of stimulating brain activity to facilitate learning. The primary objective of this
      study is to evaluate the pairing of two therapeutic techniques, cognitive remediation and
      tDCS, as a cognitively enhancing intervention. This study is designed to address four
      questions. Is cognitive remediation paired with tDCS more efficacious than cognitive
      remediation delivered with sham stimulation? Is it possible to predict responsiveness to the
      intervention? Is intervention-induced cognitive change sustainable? Are there barriers to
      implementing this intervention in clinical practice?

      To examine the incremental benefit of pairing tDCS with cognitive remediation, a 110
      clinically stable outpatients between the ages of 18-60 who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia
      or schizoaffective disorder will be enrolled in a double-blind, double-baseline,
      sham-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either tDCS or sham stimulation concurrent with working memory focused cognitive remediation.
      Training will be offered to participants in a small group format. Training will consist of 48
      sessions, with 2-3 sessions scheduled in a week. Each training session will last 2 hours. One
      hour will be spent completing cognitive exercises that require working memory skills on a
      computer. TDCS or sham stimulation will be offered concurrent with the first 20 minutes of
      training with a StarStim neuromodulator. One mA of anodal stimulation will be applied to the
      left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the cathodal electrode will be placed in the
      contralateral supraorbital position. Upon completion of working memory training, participants
      will transition to a 30-minute discussion group. The discussion will focus on application of
      cognitive skills in everyday life. Effective strategies for approaching cognitive tasks will
      be described and practiced. Participant experience with aspects of the training will be
      monitored with self-report measures of motivation, mood, and physical reactions. To assess
      intervention-induced change, working memory, other aspects of cognition, functional capacity,
      and community functioning will be assessed pre- and post-intervention. Cognitive outcomes
      will be assessed with training tasks as well as tasks that are unfamiliar to participants. A
      performance-based measure will be used to assess functional capacity for everyday living
      skills and a self-report instrument will be used to assess community functioning. Potential
      confounds such as symptom severity, medication changes, outside treatment hours, and
      significant life stressors will be assessed individually every 2 weeks during the
      intervention phase of the study. Sustainability of intervention-induced change will be
      assessed with assessment sessions 6 weeks and 6 months post-intervention. Change in
      performance during the first 12 training sessions on two working memory training tasks, a
      n-back task and a complex span task, will be used to determine if early response to treatment
      is predictive of post-intervention outcomes. An intent-to-treat analysis will be used to
      analyze intervention-induced change. Regression analyses will be conducted to identify
      predictors of treatment response.

      Achieving the proposed objectives will yield important information about the efficacy,
      durability, and efficiency of a novel pairing of cognitively enhancing interventions.
      Findings will inform treatment development for patients with schizophrenia as well for
      patients with other cognitively compromising illnesses.
