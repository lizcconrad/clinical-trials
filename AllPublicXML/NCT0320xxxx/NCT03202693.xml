    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-dose study to evaluate (1) the
      absorption, metabolism, and excretion patterns of a single dose of [14C] PA-824, and (2) the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single oral-suspension dose of unlabeled
      PA-824 in healthy adult male subjects. Unlabeled PA-824 and [14C]-PA-824 will be administered
      together in an oral-suspension formulation. Enrollment is planned for one dose group of 6
      subjects. All 6 subjects will receive the same treatment.
