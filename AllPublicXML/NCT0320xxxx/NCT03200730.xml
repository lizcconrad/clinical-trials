  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The lack of a holistic approach to palliative care can lead to a fractured sense
      of dignity at the end of life, resulting in depression, hopelessness, feelings of being a
      burden to others, and the loss of will to live among terminally-ill patients. Building on the
      clinical foundation of Dignity Therapy, together with the empirical understanding of
      dignity-related concerns of Asian families facing terminal-illness, a novel Family Dignity
      Intervention (FDI) has been developed for Asia palliative care. FDI comprises a recorded
      interview with a patient and his/her primary family caregiver, which is transcribed, edited
      into a legacy document, and return to the dyads for sharing with the rest of the patient's
      family. The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility, acceptability and potential
      effectiveness of FDI in reducing psychosocial, emotional, spiritual, and psychophysiological
      distress in community-dwelling and in-patient Asian older terminally-ill patients and their
      families living in Singapore.

      Methods/Design: An open-label multicentre randomized controlled trial. 126 patient-family
      dyads are randomly allocated to one of two groups: (i) intervention group (FDI offered in
      addition to standard psychological care), and (ii) control group (standard psychological
      care). Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes are assessed in face-to-face interviews at
      baseline, three days and two week after intervention, and during an exit interview with
      family caregivers at two month post bereavement. Primary outcome measures include sense of
      dignity for patients and psychological distress for caregivers. Secondary outcomes include
      meaning in life, quality of life, spirituality, hopefulness, perceived support and
      psychophysiological well-being, as well as bereavement outcomes for caregivers. Qualitative
      data are analyzed using Framework method.

      Discussion: To date, there is no available palliative care intervention for dignity
      enhancement in Asia. This first-of-its kind study develops and tests an evidence-based,
      family-driven psycho-socio-spiritual intervention for enhancing dignity and wellbeing among
      Asian patients and families facing mortality. It address a critical gap in the provision of
      holistic palliative care. The expected outcomes will contribute to advancements in both
      theories and practices of palliative care for Singapore and other Asian communities around
      the world.

      Study Design

      This study adopts an open-label multicentre randomized controlled trial design comprising of
      two groups: (i) intervention group (Family Dignity Intervention offered in addition to
      standard psychological care), and (ii) control group (standard psychological care include
      emotional support and psychosocial home visits). Consenting participants including one
      patient and one family caregiver from one family unit (i.e. patient-family dyad) will be
      randomly allocated to one of these two groups after baseline assessment meetings have been
      conducted.

      Study Sites

      Study settings include two hospice service providers in Singapore. First, Dover Park Hospice
      (DPH) is a secular, nonprofit organization that offers both in-patient and homecare hospice
      services to terminally-ill patients and their families. It is one of the largest hospice
      service provider in the country with over 50 in-patient beds. Second, HCA Hospice Care (HCA)
      is a registered charity that offers daycare and homecare hospice services to terminally-ill
      patients and their families. With a head office and numerous satellite service stations
      across the country, it offers national wide services to all Singaporeans. Both DPH and HCA
      are funded publically and via donations, service admission are based on physician referrals
      and mean-testing mechanisms as ascribed by the Singapore Ministry of Health. Both service
      providers house a team of palliative care specialist including physicians, nurses, social
      workers and counselors to provide round-the-clock support to individuals and families facing
      the end of life.

      Participants

      The sample comprises 126 Asian families in Singapore. Each family includes a patient-family
      dyad: (i) one older terminally-ill patients, and (ii) one identified family member whom the
      patient considers to be his or her primary or trusted caregiver. Participants are recruited
      through the in-patient, daycare and homecare hospice service units of DPH and HCA.

      Recruitment, assessment, intervention and follow-up procedures

      Appointed research nurses of DPH and HCA are asked to distribute research information
      pamphlets to all patients and family caregivers eligible for the study, based on their
      clinical assessments of patients using the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale; patients who
      received a score of 20 or below are considered too ill and ineligible to participate. At
      least one week is given for full consideration to participate in the study, after which, the
      research nurses contact each eligible family to seek their verbal consent for study
      participation. Once verbal consent is obtained, a simple information sheet containing the
      names and contact details of the patient-family dyad are forwarded to a member of the
      research team. The responsible researcher then contacts the patient-family dyad via telephone
      to organize a convenient time for the first baseline assessment meeting.

      The first meeting is attended by the appointed FDI therapist, as well as responsible
      researcher who will (i) explains the study to the patient-family dyad; (ii) answer any
      questions they may have about their participation; (iii) checks that they have fully
      understood the implications of the study before obtaining written consent. As a final check,
      the researcher screens patients with the Mini-Mental State Exam to assess cognitive
      functioning, and those who scored below 18 are considered unfit to participate. In such cases
      patient-family dyads are excluded. This will be done sensitively, whereby the researcher and
      the FDI therapist spend some time chatting with the patient-family dyads about neutral topics
      before ending the meeting. This approach has worked successfully in previous studies of
      similar nature.

      For patient-family dyads who are deemed fit to participate after the final check, the
      researcher conducts a baseline assessment with patients and caregivers individually, then
      open the next envelop in sequence to ascertain group allocation. Dyads assigned to the
      control group are reminded that they will receive three to four psychosocial visits from the
      research team, through which they will have the opportunity to share their feelings along
      their illness trajectory as well as their views on taking part in the study. Dyads assigned
      to the intervention group are given two sets of FDI framework questions, one for patients and
      one for caregivers, so that they have an opportunity to think and discuss about their
      responses. After a brief framing session conducted by the FDI therapist, a time will be
      arrange for the intervention interview within the next two to three days.

      After the intervention interview is completed, the recorded transcript has been edited and
      finalized by the patient-family dyad, the FDI therapist sets up a time for a family sharing
      session in which the 'legacy' document is shared with selected members of the patients'
      family. A hard copy of the legacy document is also be given the patient-family dyad for
      safekeeping.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be conducted by an independent statistician. Treatment allocation (Family-oriented Dignity Intervention or Control) will be performed by block randomization with a fixed block size of two; each block will comprise of two patients with comparable terminal illness, along with their family caregiver, to reduce potential confounding effects of different illness types. Allocation concealment is facilitated by using sequentially number opaque sealed envelopes for consecutive and eligible families. To reduce the risk of bias, the researcher opens the next envelope to ascertain which group the family has been allocated to after baseline measures have been collected.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A standard framework of 12 FDI questions is given to patient-family dyads in the intervention group during baseline to provides them with the opportunity to think about their responses. During the intervention interview scheduled 2-3 days later, the FDI therapist follows that dyad's cues, help them to organize their thoughts, facilitate disclosure of cherished memories, and encourage the expression of appreciation. The interview is be recorded, quickly transcribed verbatim then edited into a coherent narrative. A second review session is arranged to review and finalize the edited transcript with the dyads. Once the &quot;legacy&quot; documents are ready, a final family sharing session is arranged for the dyads to share and read this document to each other and their loved ones.</description>
