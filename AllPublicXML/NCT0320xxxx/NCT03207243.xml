  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3772847, an anti-interleukin (IL)33 receptor monoclonal antibody, is a novel treatment for
      asthma. This is a phase 2a study which aims to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of GSK3772847 in subjects with
      moderately severe asthma. The study will be conducted in 4 phases including screening, run-in
      phase, treatment phase and follow-up. In treatment phase, eligible subjects will be
      randomized to receive either GSK3772847 or placebo administered via intravenous (IV) route
      every 4 weeks in addition to open-label background therapy of fluticasone propionate/
      salmeterol (FP/Sal) 500/50 micrograms (mcg) twice daily. During the treatment phase, the
      background therapy will be switched to FP 500 mcg for 2 weeks and the dose of FP will be
      reduced by approximately 50 percent at every 2 weeks until complete FP discontinuation. The
      total duration of study will be approximately 33 weeks and approximately 148 subjects with
      moderately severe asthma who are maintained on high-dose of inhaled corticosteroids/
      Long-Acting Beta-2-Agonists (ICS/LABA) will be randomized.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant abnormal ECG findings at Visit 2.

          -  An abnormal and significant finding from 24-hour Holter monitoring at Screening (Visit
