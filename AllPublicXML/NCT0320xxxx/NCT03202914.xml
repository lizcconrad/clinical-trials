  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present record represents a secondary data analysis of the Modification of Diet in Renal
      Disease (MDRD) Study. For this analysis, the MDRD study data and specimens were retrieved
      from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Central
      Repository. A global, untargeted, metabolomic profile was used to investigate biomarkers of
      dietary intake as well as biomarkers of kidney disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study was conducted in order to: 1) quantify the metabolomic expression of
      dietary intake; and 2) examine the relationship between metabolites that reflect dietary
      intake and kidney disease progression. This secondary data analysis leverages the completed
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study, a randomized clinical trial of dietary
      protein restriction (N=840).

    <intervention_model_description>The present study consists of a secondary data analysis of the MDRD Study. Planned analyses will be limited to participants with available stored specimens.
The original MDRD Study was a 2 x 2 factorial study design, in which individuals were randomized to amounts of protein and phosphorus intake and levels of blood pressure control. In this secondary data analysis, we will analyze metabolites according to level of protein intake and will adjust for the blood pressure intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Metabolites were measured using a global, untargeted, metabolomic platform in serum specimens collected at the 12 month follow-up visit in the MDRD Study. Reverse phase, untargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry quantification was used to measure metabolites. Peaks were quantified by calculating the area under the curve. Data were normalized to account for day-to-day instrumental variation. Compounds were identified by comparison to a library of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities and matches were determined based on retention time, mass-to-charge ratio, and chromatographic data.</description>
