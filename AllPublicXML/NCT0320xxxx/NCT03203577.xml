      Objective: To prove that initiation of chronic ventilatory support at home, in patients with
      chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease (NMD) or thoracic cage
      problem is not inferior compared to initiation in a hospital based setting. In addition we
      believe that the start at home is cheaper compared to an in-hospital start.

      Hypothesis: Initiation of chronic ventilatory support at home is effective, safe and cost
      effective compared to a hospital-based initiation.

      Study design: A nationwide non-inferiority multi-center randomized parallel active control
      study.

      Study population: Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency due to a neuromuscular
      disease (NMD) or thoracic cage problem who are referred for chronic ventilator support.

      Intervention: The start of HMV at home Standard intervention to be compared to: The start of
      HMV is normally in a clinical setting as recommended in the national guideline.

      Outcome measures: Primary: PaCO2. Secondary: Health related quality of life; lung function;
      nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide assessment and saturation, and costs Sample size
      calculation/data analysis: This is a non-inferiority trial based on PaCO2 as primary outcome.
      A difference in favor of the hospital care group of smaller than 0.5 kPa will be labeled as
      non-inferior. To retain 72 evaluable patients, and allow for drop-outs, we will include 96
      patients in total.

      Cost-effectiveness analysis: A cost analysis will be conducted alongside the clinical trial.
      Costs of the initiation of HMV at home and in the hospital will be estimated form a societal
      perspective over a time horizon of 6 months.

      Time schedule: After an initial phase of 6 months recruitment will start and will take 24
      months. Thirty-six months after the start of the study the last assessments will be done and
      analysis and writing of the papers will start. After 42 months the study will end.
