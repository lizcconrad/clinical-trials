  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II SBIR project is designed to address the critical public health problem of
      bullying and cyberbullying among middle school age youth. The project involves developing and
      testing bullying and cyberbullying prevention materials, including interactive classroom
      sessions and corresponding serious games, based on the evidence-based substance abuse
      prevention approach called Life Skills Training. The product has the potential to fill a gap
      in the intervention tools currently available to schools that can be widely disseminated
      throughout the country using existing marketing and dissemination channels and decrease the
      adverse consequences of bullying and cyberbullying as well as substance abuse.

    <description>The investigators will assess (via questionnaire) key study variables regarding bullying and cyberbullying and hypothesized risk and protective factors. These outcomes will be examined and compared in both the intervention group and the active comparator group at a post-test assessment and 12-month and 24-month follow-up assessments.</description>

    <description>The prevention materials for middle school bullying and cyberbullying will (1) utilize both interactive classroom sessions and serious/educational games (digital games used to educate in an entertaining format); (2) positively change social norms surrounding bullying and cyberbulling; (3) challenge positive expectancies about bullying and cyberbullying; (4) enhance protective factors by building social, self-regulation, and relationship skills throughout the interactive learning and behavioral rehearsal; and (5) include booster sessions.</description>

    <description>The evidence-based LifeSkills Training program has been successfully used as a universal, school-based substance abuse and violence prevention program for middle school youth. The goals of the LST program are to teach youth the personal self-management skills, social skills, and other life skills needed to successfully resist drug and alcohol use, navigate developmental tasks, increase resilience, and facilitate healthy psychosocial development.</description>
