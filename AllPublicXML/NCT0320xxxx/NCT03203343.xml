      Today there are various surgical techniques for inguinal hernia. In this study, investigators
      want to compare the ''PIRS'' operating technique laparoscopy and modified &quot;Marcy&quot; operating
      technique with open inguinal access. Investigators would compare both groups to find out
      witch one does the lesser inflammatory stress response on the organism.

      Inguinal hernia represents the protrusion of the abdominal cavity contents through the
      inguinal canal. Today there are various surgical techniques for inguinal hernia. In this
      study, investigators want to compare two standard methods that are regularly performed at the
      University hospital of Split at department of pediatric surgery. These are the ''PIRS''
      operating technique laparoscopy and modified &quot;Marcy&quot; operating technique with open inguinal
      access. The choice of operating technique depends solely on the choice of a chosen pediatric
      surgeon. Given the fact that the child is indicated for an operation, regardless of
      participation in the study, there are no significant risks of participating in this study,
      except for possible but rare complications resulting from the peripheral venous blood draw
      (haematoma, soreness and pain). To carry out this study, the child should be taken (drawn) 3
      peripheral venous blood samples (on day of operation, 24 hours after surgery and 6 days after
      surgery) from which the laboratory parameters are taken and counted (Leukocytes, C - Reactive
      Protein, Interleukin 6 and Tumor necrosis factor α).

      Lab results would be compared between both groups to find out witch one does the lesser
      inflammatory stress response on the organism.
