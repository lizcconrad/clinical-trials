  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a monocentric, prospective, observational, comparative follow-up
      study based on two previously treated patient groups. The first group consists of patients
      treated with the patient-specific unicondylar knee implant iUni®. For that group, 30 patients
      will be included in the study and analyzed. The final follow-up after 24 months has already
      been documented by the study center. Compared to that, a consecutive series of 50 Univation®
      X patients will be invited for a 24 months follow-up in 2018. In total, it is planned to
      include 80 retrospective patients for that historical control study design.

      The products under investigation were used in routine clinical practice and according to the
      authorized Instructions for Use (IfU). Those data that are obtained in routine clinical use
      will be documented in the Case Report Form (CRF).
