    <measure>The seizure-free rate during 26-week Maintenance Period for participants with partial onset seizures (POS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A seizure is a brief episode of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. POS affects only a part of the brain. The outward effect can vary from change in emotions or feelings (simple partial seizure) to loss of awareness and consciousness (complex partial seizure). The percentage of participants with POS who achieved a seizure-free status during the 26-week Maintenance Period of 4 milligrams (mg) will be calculated. For participants for which the perampanel dose is increased from 4 mg to 8 mg, the seizure-free rate of the 26-week Maintenance Period of 8 mg will be evaluated to calculate the percentage of participants who achieved a seizure-free status regardless of perampanel dose.</description>

    <measure>The seizure free rate during 52 weeks of treatment (ie, 26-week Maintenance Period plus 26-week Extension Phase) for participants with POS</measure>

    <description>A seizure is a brief episode of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Median time to first seizure onset will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Median time to withdraw from the study will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with any treatment-emergent (TE) serious adverse event (SAE) resulting in discontinuation of perampanel</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse events [AE] as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>

    <description>The Treatment Phase consists of the 4 milligrams (mg) Treatment Phase (the Titration Period [6 weeks] and the Maintenance Period [26 weeks]) and the 8 mg Treatment Phase (the Titration Period [4 weeks] and the Maintenance Period [26 weeks]) if participants require a higher dose. In the 4 mg Titration Period (6 weeks), participants will initiate 2 mg perampanel once daily (QD) for 2 weeks and then will be up-titrated to 4 mg QD and will continue this dose for 4 weeks. If participants have no safety issues at the end of the Titration Period, they will start the 4 mg Maintenance Period for 26 weeks. Participants will only need the higher dose if they are having seizures. In the 8 mg Titration Period (4 weeks), participants will be administered 6 mg perampanel QD for 2 weeks and then will be up-titrated to 8 mg QD and will continue this dose for 2 weeks. If participants have no safety issues at the end of the Titration Period, they will start the 8 mg Maintenance Period for 26 weeks.</description>
