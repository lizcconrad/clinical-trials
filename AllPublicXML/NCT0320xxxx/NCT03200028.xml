      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the revised brain training
      program on the cognitive abilities (e.g., attention, executive function), functional status
      and quality of life of individuals diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
