  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All of the tools currently available for preoperative preparation of children either use a
      third person approach (i.e., use media whereby they watch a video or look at pictures of
      another child receiving an anesthetic), provide tours at some time previous to the operation
      date, or are shown the equipment that they will encounter during their anesthetic. No
      preoperative programme currently allows the child to experience the entire chain of events
      from leaving the preoperative preparation area (and their parents), walking to the operating
      area, being initially prepared for and receiving anesthesia and recovering from anesthesia,
      in real time and from a first person perspective. As such the investigators are carrying out
      this study to assess whether virtual reality preoperative preparation is effective in
      reducing anxiety at induction of anesthesia.

      The investigators' goal in this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality
      preoperative preparation on anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia. The hypothesis is
      that utilisation of this novel 1st person immersive preparatory method will lead to an
      enhanced understanding of what will happen to the child (in addition to what the environment
      looks and sounds like) when they have their anesthetic. The investigators believe this
      enhanced understanding and preparation will lead to the reduction in anxiety levels before
      and during the induction of anesthesia, and will also lead to a reduction in postoperative
      negative behaviour disorders.
