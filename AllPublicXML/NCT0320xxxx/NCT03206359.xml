  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GADD34 (Growth Arrest and DNA Damage inducible-protein) is a regulatory subunit of PP1
      (phosphatase 1) phosphatase which dephosphorylates eIF2alpha (eucaryotic initiation factor 2
      alpha subunit), representing a negative feedback loop of the unfolded protein response (UPR).
      Moreover, GADD34 is necessary for type I interferon (IFN) production in response to viral
      infection in murine models. We investigate here the expression of GADD34 in systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE), in which type I IFN has an important pathogenic role.

      We report a case-control study on GADD34 gene expression in PBMC (peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells) of SLE patients (n=60) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=30).
      The level of GADD34 gene expression, as well as of type-I IFN response genes in PBMC is
      measured by quantitative PCR.
