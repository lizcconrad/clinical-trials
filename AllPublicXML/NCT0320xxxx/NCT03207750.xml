    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if there is any immune interference between the
      Porcine circovirus free (PCV-free) liquid Human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine and routine infant
      vaccinations currently in use in the US, namely Pediarix®, Hiberix® and Prevenar 13® as
      compared to the currently licensed lyophilized formulation of the HRV vaccine when
      co-administered with the same routine vaccinations in healthy infants 6-12 weeks of age
