  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of sleep restriction
      (SR) and cognitive therapy (CT) in Gulf War Veterans with insomnia.

      The primary hypothesis is that the efficacy of these treatments will depend upon an
      individual subject's baseline characteristics. For SR we expect that baseline measures of
      &quot;excessive time spent in bed&quot; may predict response and for CT we expect that baseline
      measures of cognitive arousal and pain may predict response. Exploratory analyses using
      signal detection techniques will systematically compare and contrast the potential usefulness
      of a number of additional potential moderator measures.

      Insomnia is a serious health problem in Gulf War Veterans that is often associated with
      extensive prescription of sleeping medications. Although safer, even the latest &quot;sleeping
      pills&quot; can lead to cognitive impairment and risk of abuse. Thus non-pharmacological
      treatments for insomnia have been pursued as alternatives to medications. Cognitive Behavior
      Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the term widely used to describe therapies that combine
      behavioral and cognitive therapies for insomnia. The combined CBT-I approach has
      well-documented efficacy. Between 2012 and 2014 over 650 VA mental health clinicians have
      received extensive training in CBT-I. Although CBT-I is efficacious, the optimal target
      populations for its major components has not yet been well-defined for Gulf War Veterans. We
      propose to address this gap and develop tools for clinicians to identify the best treatment
      for insomnia for individual Gulf War Veterans.

      Our hypotheses will be tested in a randomized parallel groups design. Randomization will be
      based on type of treatment assignment: either to SR or CT. After screening and randomization
      in the 2-week baseline phase, subjects will receive SR or CT in the 6-week treatment phase.
      There will be no more treatment after this point. At the end of the 6-week treatment,
      subjects will return to repeat many of the psychological tests administered during baseline
      to determine the short-term benefit. This 4-year proposal will include 100 subjects (2 groups
      of 50 each) with outcome, mediator and moderator measures collected at appropriate points.

      All subjects will receive education about basic sleep hygiene as well as information about
      the science of sleep including sleep stages and sleep regulation.

      Sleep Restriction Therapy (SR). The initial Time in Bed (TIB) prescription is calculated on
      the average total sleep time (TST) reported in the baseline sleep logs. After one week,
      depending on subject's daily sleep logs, the therapist suggests a new TIB prescription.
      Napping is neither prescribed nor proscribed. However, if subjects find themselves very
      sleepy (not just tired, but actually sleepy) they are advised to take a brief (15 to 30
      minutes) nap to ensure their safety.

      Cognitive Therapy (CT). The CT treatment module is designed to meet three general goals: 1)
      identification of dysfunctional sleep cognitions, 2) challenging their validity, and 3)
      replacing them with more adaptive substitutes. Several specific techniques designed to meet
      these goals are discussed in materials distributed to subjects. Similar to SR, subjects in CT
      are given information about relevant elements of the science of sleep and healthy sleep
      practices.

      We will also continue to monitor progress post-treatment in the follow-up period. The
      complete package of outcome measures will be repeated at the follow-up session. We will tell
      subjects that we expect the benefits of treatment to continue and/or improve with time and we
      will also encourage subjects to continue practicing the treatment instructions to maintain
      their progress after active treatment ends.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility via a phone interview and an in person evaluation.

      At the in-person evaluation, after signing a consent form, a more detailed interview about
      sleep problems, and medical and psychiatric history will be obtained by the Duke Structured
      Sleep Interview, including evaluations of cognitive impairment and depression. Exclusion
      criteria will further be evaluated by the following given solely at the office evaluation:
      Acute/Unstable Chronic Illness checklist, Berlin Questionnaire, Columbia Suicide Severity
      Rating Scale (C-SSRS), DUKE Structured Sleep Interview, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HDRS24), Life Stressor Checklist, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5
      (MINI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Sleep
      Disorder Questionnaire (SDQ), Sleep Related Behavior Questionnaire, and the Thought Control
      Questionnaire Insomnia-Revised (TCQI). Subjects will additionally be set up with PSG
      equipment. The PSG will be completed in the subject's own home and be used to screen for
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder. Subjects will return to the lab
      the next morning to have the equipment removed.

      Participants will be evaluated on the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire
      (APSQ), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the
      Insomnia Severity Index each visit during weeks 1-8, and again at week 32. Sleep logs will be
      done daily during weeks 1-8, and again at week 32. The following will be done at weeks 1, 8,
      and 32:

      AUA8 Noctoria; Brief Pain Inventory short form (BPI-SF); Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI); Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS); Dysfunctional Beliefs
      and Attitudes about Sleep Scale; AUA8 (DBAS); Glasgow Content of Thoughts; Glasgow Sleep
      Effort Scale; Multidimensional fatigue Inventory; Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ);
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); SF-36 (RAND).

      Subjects will be evaluated on Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire at weeks 1, 2, 8 and
      32.

      Subjects will be evaluated on the SAMI at weeks 1 and 8.

      Subjects will be evaluated on the Trial Making Test, MOCA, Color Word Interference test and
      the RBANS at weeks 1 and 32.

      Following the completion of treatment at week 7, subjects will complete the Treatment
      Adherence Survey, Treatment Satisfaction Survey and Working Alliance Inventory. The Working
      Alliance Inventory will also be given at the second treatment session (week 3).

      Blood will be drawn to measure levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Urine samples will be
      collected at during each of the 3 study phases to monitor abstain from drugs of abuse, except
      for medical marijuana used less than four times a week. Samples will be collected by nurses
      at the VA Clinical Studies Unit and analyzed by the VA lab. Blood samples will be taken at
      the same time to be analyzed for C-reactive protein. Remaining blood will be banked to be
      analyzed for genetic factors.

    <description>The Veteran's subjective experience of severity of insomnia using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The ISI has been shown to be a reliable subjective measure of insomnia severity as well as a sensitive measure of symptom change including Veteran insomnia treatment studies. Recently it has also been related to objective polysomnography measures. The scale ranges from 0 to 28, with a score of 0-7 indicating no clinically significant insomnia, scores 8-14 indicating sub threshold insomnia, 15-21 indicating moderate insomnia and 22-28 indicating severe insomnia.</description>

    <description>Wake after sleep onset (WASO) will be measured by daily sleep logs. This is included as a secondary measure because difficulty in maintaining sleep is the most commonly reported insomnia complaint; i.e., they either experience unwanted wake time during the night and/or they wake earlier than they want in the morning.</description>

    <measure>SF 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 measures Quality of Life (QOL), including both emotional and physical disabilities, is easy to understand, brief, widely used, and has been found to be useful as a measure of health status. It covers 8 domains of QOL: physical functioning, role functioning/physical, role functioning/emotional, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health, and a single-item ninth component: reported health transition (health compared to 1 year ago). Each of the dimensions of the SF-36 yields a score (1-100). Large-sample means and standard deviations of the 8 dimensional scales have been published for various subject populations and disease groups. We will use the general health domain as our overall indicator of health-related QOL and perform additional analyses on the 8 individual scales.</description>

    <measure>Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FOSQ is designed to be administered to individuals who have a sleep disorder, and is recommended for use in intervention studies as an outcome measure. The questionnaire is designed to measure functional status in situations that produce sleepiness. There are five subscales: vigilance, intimacy and sexual relationships, general productivity, activity level, and social outcome. Test-retest reliability for the scale has been found to be .91 when administered a week apart. The internal consistency of the components and the total score was above .85 (Cronbach's alpha).</description>

    <description>Sleep Restriction Therapy will regulate the time you spend in bed on the basis of information collected about your sleep from sleep diaries during the evaluation and during treatment. Sleep restriction therapy is designed to improve your sleep quality by matching the opportunity you give yourself for sleep to the amount of average sleep ability you exhibit on your sleep diaries. Once the quality of your sleep has improved then then sleep quantity is gradually increased by slowly increasing your sleep opportunity. Sleep restriction therapy will also attempt to strengthen your bed sleep connection by focusing on what activities you engage in when you are awake in the middle of the night.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Therapy is designed to identify incorrect ideas about sleep, challenge their validity, and replace them with correct information. This therapy tries to reduce worry, anxiety, and fear that one won't sleep by providing accurate information about sleep. The treatment part of the study lasts six weeks. During the treatment, you will meet with the therapist for a total of six sessions: once per week for six consecutive weeks. Each session lasts approximately 60 minutes.</description>
