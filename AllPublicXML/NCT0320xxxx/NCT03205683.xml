  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that a standard course of INF can result in significant improvement in CTS as
      measured by clinical, electrodiagnostic, or ultrasound measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INF is a novel non-invasive therapy based on the principle of restoring vascular function at
      the capillary level in peripheral nerve. his therapy has been shown to improve clinical
      function in patients with diabetic-associated polyneuropathy, a model for various forms of
      ischemic neuropathy. CTS is a common condition where regional compression at the wrist
      results in ischemic focal demyelination of the distal median nerve. This results in sensory
      dysfunction, pain, and eventually axon loss and weakness if the compression is sufficiently
      severe and prolonged. Standard therapy for CTS includes wrist splints, regional lidocaine
      injections, ergonomic adjustments, various forms of occupation therapy, and ultimately
      surgical release of the carpal tunnel ligament. However, all of these are either temporary in
      their effect or invasive. The diagnosis of CTS relies on clinical, electrodiagnostic or NCS,
      and ultrasound methods.

    <description>The intraneural facilitation intervention is a novel manual physical therapy approach with anecdotal evidence in neuropathic pain symptoms through biasing blood flow from an artery through the nutrient vessels into the epineurium of an accompanying nerve. The main concept of intraneural facilitation is the use of two manual holds. The first hold is called facilitation hold and includes putting the contralateral joint in a maximal loose-pack position that is comfortable to the patient. The hypothesis with this initial hold is the nerve will have greater excursion the accompanying artery and the nutrient vessels that are clustered at the joint will be stretched. This stretch may enlarge the opening at the junction of the artery and bridging nutrient vessel, therefore consistently creating a vascular bias into the neural epineurial capillaries. Theoretically, this creates increased epifascicular vascular pressure which may be absent due to epineurial ischemia.</description>

    <description>Will be performed by a different therapist than actual INF. The patient will be asked to do the following combination of passive range of motion (PROM) and active ROM activities to promote blood flow in the affected arm Each visit will last about 45 minutes, twice a week for 6 weeks (total 12 sessions).
Missing &gt; 4 sessions will invalidate subject outcomes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients referred to the LLUH Neurology Electrodiagnostic Laboratory with
             electrodiagnostic and clinical evidence of CTS (uni- or bilateral)

          2. Ages &gt;18 and &lt; 75 (irrespective of gender)

          3. Current use of splints as long as the frequency of treatment is unaltered and onset of
             use is &gt; 1 week in duration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior carpal tunnel release &gt; 2 years ago

          2. The presence of any condition that would prevent NCS from accurately diagnosing CTS
             (e.g., hereditary polyneuropathy or acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy)

          3. Workman's Compensation cases

          4. Pregnancy

             therapy, injections)

          6. Clinically silent CTS in face of positive electrodiagnostic results

          7. Sufficiently severe clinical symptoms that warrant more aggressive therapy i.e.,
             carpal injections or release

             subject participation or outcomes
