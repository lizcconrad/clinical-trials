  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balance and gait problems in subjects with neurological disease lead to reduced mobility,
      loss of independence and frequent falls. Treadmill training is a widely used form of
      treatment and it has been used in subjects with neurological disease to ameliorate walking
      and balance deficits. The Virtual Reality Treadmill as a therapeutic tool has been recently
      introduced to practice gait adaptability elicited by aligning foot placement relative to the
      projected visual context.

      Forty-eight subjects with neurological disease will receive treadmill training treatment
      randomly divided in Traditional Treadmill training and Virtual Reality Treadmill training.

      The aim of this randomized controlled study is to assess whether Treadmill training with
      Virtual Reality is better than Traditional Treadmill training in improving dynamic balance
      and cognitive aspects in subjects with neurological diseases.
