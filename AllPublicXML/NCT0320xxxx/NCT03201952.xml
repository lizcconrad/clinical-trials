  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate distal intestinal bile salt administration in humans by deliving
      ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) into the terminal ileum of subjects with a pre-existing ileostomy
      and assessing several hormone levels following an oral glucose tolerance test compared to a
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of gallstone
      dissolution and primary biliary cirrhosis. Other than these two diseases, exploratory
      research - both preclinical and clinical - has demonstrated other beneficial effects of UDCA.
      For example, systemic administration of UDCA for several weeks (4-6 weeks) has been shown to
      improve insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic, obese individuals. Whether or not these effects
      on insulin sensitivity may be acute in nature and are detectable by OGTT are unknown. Based
      on growing knowledge of bile salt receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, at least some of
      these effects of bile salts on metabolism appear to be mediated by receptors constitutively
      expressed in the terminal ileum (e.g. TGR5 receptor that is upstream of GLP-1 and insulin
      secretion that control blood glucose levels). Thus, metabolic effects may be inducible with
      acute UDCA administration directly into this region of the intestine that could be useful in
      screening compounds or designing future mechanistic studies. This pilot study is designed to
      examine the effects of UDCA on oral glucose tolerance versus a placebo in non-diabetic across
      a range of body mass indexes by infusing UDCA directly into the ileum of volunteering
      subjects with a pre-existing ileostomy and measuring hormone response. The investigators aim
      to recruit approximately 4-5 volunteers in a lean BMI range (18.5-25 kg/m2), overweight
      (&gt;25-29.9), class 1 obesity (&gt;30-35 kg/m2), and class 2 obesity (&gt;35-40 kg/m2) for a total of
      ~16-20 participants.
