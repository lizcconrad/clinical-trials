      130 pregnant women with Iron deficiency anemia, in the 2nd trimester (microcytic hypochromic
      anemia, hemoglobin range from 9-10.5g/dl, serum ferritin less than 12 ng/ml), from the
      outpatient clinics in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, in Ain Shams University
      Hospital, Cairo, Egypt, will be enrolled and distributed into one of 2 groups by a computer
      generated random number table. Each of the 2 groups will receive 2 medication for 2 months
      with specific instruction to increase iron absorption. One group named L will receive powders
      of bovine lactoferrin and tablets of placebo form, the 2nd named F will receive ferrous
      sulphate tablet and placebo in powder form. Hemoglobin concentration, packed-cell volume
      (PCV) , mean cell volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin
      concentration (MCHC), Serum ferritin will be done at the start and the end of the treatment
      period.

      The study will includes130 pregnant women, from the outpatient clinics in the Obstetrics and
      Gynecology Department, in Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. Women should be
      diagnosed as having iron deficiency anemia, in the 2nd trimester (complete blood count,
      showing microcytic hypochromic anemia, hemoglobin range from 9-10.5, serum ferritin less than
      12 ng/ml). Women will be enrolled and distributed into one of 2 groups by a computer
      generated random number table. Each of the 2 groups will receive 2 medication for 2 months
      with specific instruction to increase iron absorption. One group named L will receive powders
      of bovine lactoferrin and tablets of placebo form, the 2nd named F will receive ferrous
      sulphate tablet and placebo in powder form. Hemoglobin concentration, PCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC,
      Serum ferritin will be done at the start and the end of the treatment period.
