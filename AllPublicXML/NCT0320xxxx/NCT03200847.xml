      Primary Objective

        -  To identify the MTD and RP2D of the combination of pembrolizumab and ATRA.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Describe the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with pembrolizumab and all-trans
           retinoic acid (ATRA) [brand name VESANOID] in melanoma patients.

        -  To assess the anti-tumor activity in terms of a). The reduction in MDSC
           (immunosuppressive myeloid -derived suppressor cells) frequency and suppressive function
           (measured as a continuous variable)in peripheral blood of advanced melanoma patients
           undergoing pembrolizumab and VESANOID combination therapy. b). progression free
           survival.

      Exploratory Objective

        -  To determine the clinical outcomes with tumor-specific T cell responses.

          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.

          3. State willingness to comply with all study procedures and be available for the
