  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be healthy volunteers and all procedures will be completed for research
      purposes only. Two groups will be recruited, females who use cannabis (marijuana, MJ), and
      female who do not use cannabis (controls). Female MJ users will be enrolled in a protocol
      that includes an outpatient drug administration session and a 4-day/3-night inpatient stay on
      the Johns Hopkins Bayview Clinical Research Unit (CRU). During outpatient visits, MJ users
      will have an MRI, and complete MJ self-administration and cognitive performance sessions. MJ
      users will then reside on the CRU,and complete MJ abstinence, and self-report instruments for
      withdrawal discomfort. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan of brain cannabinoid type 1
      receptors will also be completed. Non-users will complete MRI, PET imaging and cognitive
      testing under an outpatient protocol (no MJ administration).

      The primary goals of this project are to examine whether use of cannabis alters brain
      cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) availability in females, and if severity of cannabis
      withdrawal is correlated with CB1 receptor availability. CB1R are widely distributed in the
      human brain and can be quantified using PET imaging with the radiotracer 11C-OMAR
      (Carbon-11-OMAR). The effects MJ use on brain CB1R have not been studied in females. The
      current study will enroll 10 female MJ users in an inpatient protocol that includes
      administration of smoked MJ, followed by monitored abstinence with daily behavioral
      assessments, and PET imaging with 11C-OMAR. PET data will collected in 10 matched controls
      for comparison. The proposed study is an important first step to determine whether localized
      CB1R changes in female MJ users help explain, and provide a neurobiological target for
      intervention. Results will increase knowledge of cannabinoid mechanisms of cannabis use and
      severity of dependence in females, an understudied population.

    <description>Marijuana withdrawal discomfort will be self-reported using the marijuana withdrawal checklist, available via PhenXToolkit.org. Items are: depressed mood, irritability, nervousness/anxiety, restlessness, increased aggression, increased anger, violent outbursts, nausea, decreased appetite, stomach pain, shakiness, sweating, sleep difficulty, strange/wild dreams, craving to smoke cannabis, diarrhea/loose stools, dizziness, muscle spasms/aches, hiccups, stuffy nose, feverish feeling, hot flashes, chills, increased appetite, headaches, fatigue/tiredness, yawning, difficulty concentrating, and general physical discomfort. Participants can describe symptoms not listed on the questionnaire (Other). Each item is rated as 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, or 3=severe. A sum score is calculated from items that are valid, reliable cannabis withdrawal symptoms (Budney et al, 2003, Journal of Abnormal Psychology,112(3): 393-402).</description>
