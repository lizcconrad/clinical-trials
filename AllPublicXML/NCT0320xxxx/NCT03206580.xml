  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy and elderly population are increasing. Health professionals try to provide
      longevity with good quality of life for this population, through the functional independence
      maintenance. In this context, physical exercise has an important role, specially the strength
      training. The ability to produce muscle strength is positively associated with the
      functionality and independence of older people. Different types of strength training can lead
      to different neuromuscular and functional gains. These types of interventions can help health
      professionals to determine characteristics of training for the elderly, aiming the
      maintenance of their functional independence. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine
      the effects of a concentric strength training versus a concentric-eccentric strength training
      for knee flexors and extensors on structural, neuromuscular and functional parameters in
      older people, as well as to investigate the effect of a detraining period. Additionally, the
      investigators will try to identify which structural and neuromuscular parameters of lower
      limbs are better related to the functionality.
