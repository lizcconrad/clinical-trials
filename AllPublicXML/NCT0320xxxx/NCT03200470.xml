  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter study. All patients presenting for revision hip or knee
      arthroplasty for all indications under the respective surgeon's care may be eligible. Per
      standard of care preoperatively, all patients must have blood drawn for erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate(ESR), C-reactive protein(CRP) and D-dimer. Aspiration of the joint in
      question may be performed at the discretion of the treating surgeon and results documented.
      Intraoperative samples will also be collected and sent for NGS analysis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-operative D-dimer testing should be performed if this is in keeping with the local
      institutional standard of care. Otherwise, D-dimer testing will be omitted from the
      pre-operative panel of tests collected.

      NGS results will be made available to the Investigator. Treatment will remain within keeping
      with the Investigator's standard of care. NGS results may be used at the discretion of the
      treating surgeon in guiding patient treatment.
