  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microneedles can be prepared as a low-cost patch that is simple for patients to apply for
      vaccine delivery targeting the many antigen-presenting cells present in the skin. Data
      regarding the safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and acceptability of a microneedle patch
      in children are lacking. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity,
      and acceptability of placement of a placebo microneedle patch to the skin of children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available vaccine delivery methods include intramuscular or subcutaneous injection are
      limited by patient needle phobia and the need for trained medical personnel. Alternative
      routes of vaccination that avoid hypodermic needles have previously been poorly immunogenic,
      require live vaccines, utilize bulky devices and/or are unsuitable for self-administration.
      Novel vaccine delivery methods such as microneedles can render vaccination easier and more
      acceptable to the public by simplifying vaccine access. Microneedles are micron-scale needles
      that administer vaccine directly into the skin using a simple minimally invasive approach
      without generating sharps waste. This study is designed to investigate the safety,
      reactogenicity, and acceptability of a placebo microneedle patch in children.

    <time_frame>Day 1 through the Final Study Visit (Day 27 - 38).</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate safety following application of the patch topically, microneedle patch-related serious adverse events will be recorded. Information to be collected includes event description, date of onset, severity and date of resolution/stabilization of the event. Severity and relationship to study product will be assessed by the Investigator or sub-investigator. AE summary tables will be based on treatment-emergent AEs for the safety population. AEs will be summarized by severity, relationship to treatment, and AEs leading to discontinuation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Grade 3 placebo microneedle patch-related solicited adverse events (AE).</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days following application of the patch. Day 15 if receive additional microneedle patches.</time_frame>
    <description>Patch-related solicited AE grade 3 will be recorded. Adverse Event Grading is based in five criteria:Irritability (fussiness), Lethargy (drowsiness), Decreased appetite, Vomiting and Fever on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (Significant; prevents daily activity; &gt;102.1 for Fever).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of solicited application site reactogenicity events.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days following application of the patch. Day 15 if receive additional microneedle patches.</time_frame>
    <description>Reactogenicity events are reactions that are common and known to or expected to occur following the administration of the study product. Number of solicited application site reactogenicity events (e.g., erythema, induration, bruising, itching) will be recorded. Subjects Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) will be provided with a memory aid, thermometer and ruler to record the presence of solicited symptoms and oral temperature. Reactogenicity event details will be collected via review of the subject's memory aid and by interview with the subject LAR. The subject memory aid will be reviewed with the subject LAR at subsequent visits.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 through the Final Study Visit (Day 27 - 38).</time_frame>
    <description>Patch-related unsolicited adverse events AE grade 3 will be recorded. Adverse Event is graded as Grade 3 if significant, prevents daily activity.</description>

    <measure>Number of new-onset medical conditions (NOMC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through the Final Study Visit (Day 27 - 38).</time_frame>

    <time_frame>8 days following application of the patch. Day 15 if receive additional microneedle patches.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with localized rash, scarring or evidence of secondary infection at microneedle patch application site will be evaluated by a study investigator. Per investigator discretion, photographic documentation and dermatologic referrals may be initiated for subjects with localized reactions. Number of all adverse events described at the site at which the placebo microneedle patch was applied will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Legally Authorized Representative (LAR)'s acceptability of vaccination using a microneedle patch assessed by survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>Before application on Day 1, after patch removal on Day 1, at Day 2 (+1 day), Day 8 (+2 days), and the Final Visit (Day 27 - 38). Day 9 (+2 days) and Day 15 (+3 days) if receive additional microneedle patches.</time_frame>
    <description>LAR will complete a survey that assess vaccination acceptability items and vaccination knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs. The LAR will report on absolute and relative scores of ease of use, pain, product apprehension, comparative product utility, and overall preference comparing placebo microneedle patch application to previous experience with needle and syringe injection; preference comparing the post-patch period to prior experience with vaccination and perception of ease to administer a microneedle patch in the future. Basic sociodemographic characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, healthcare utilization/access, parental educational attainment, healthcare experience including previous immunization history, and socioeconomic indicators (household income, education) will be collected.</description>
