  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, open-label, cross-over clinical pharmacokinetic trial to
      investigate a strategy for probenecid &quot;boosting&quot; in the setting of tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The study will be
      conducted at the Indiana University Clinical Research Center. All samples will be processed
      and the amount of tenofovir/FTC in plasma, blood, and urine, and tenofovir diphosphate and
      emtricitabine in peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be determined using validated
      analytical methods developed by the investigators at the University of Colorado. Probenecid
      plasma and urine concentrations will also be measured using an in-house assay. Following
      completion of the study, the secondary aim will be accomplished via analysis of selected
      samples collected at baseline and following treatment. Those selected samples will be
      assessed for urinary markers of proximal tubulopathy (urine total protein, albumin,
      creatinine, phosphorus, retinol binding protein, and beta-2-microglobulin) and serum alkaline
      phosphatase, osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 N propeptide, cystatin C, and creatinine to
      determine if the probenecid boosting strategy does indeed lead to less potential renal and
      bone toxicity.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomly allocated to enter the study in either the control or treatment arm using a blocked design to ensure equal numbers of subjects in each sequence group (n=8, control to treatment; n=8, treatment to control). Following a washout period of at least 6 weeks, each individual will crossover to the next study phase. The randomization table will be constructed prior to subject enrollment by the Principal Investigator using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS®) randomization procedure. In the event that an individual is withdrawn from the study, an alternate participant will replace that individual using an identical study sequence to maintain the block design. A total of 16 subjects will be initially enrolled in an effort to ensure that at least 14 subjects complete the entire study. If needed, additional subjects will be screened and enrolled until the target enrollment of n=14 subjects have completed the entire study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The area under the TFV-DP PBMC concentration-time curve (AUC) will be calculated via routine non-compartmental approaches. The primary trial outcome will be the geometric mean ratio (GMR) calculated as the test phase/control phase TFV plasma and TFV-DP PBMC AUCs. A two one-sided statistical testing procedure, as recommended by the FDA, will be used for the primary endpoint analysis. If the 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean ratio is contained entirely within the bounds of 0.8-1.25 then the probenecid &quot;boosting&quot; strategy is determined to provide equivalent tenofovir diphosphate concentrations relative to the control regimen.</description>
