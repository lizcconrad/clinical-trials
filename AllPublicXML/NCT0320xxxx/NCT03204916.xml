      This research trial studies cancer care delivery in adolescent and young adult patients with
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Surveying institutions, evaluating delivery of care at the
      patient level and seeking input from healthcare providers may help doctors increase rates of
      adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines. It may also
      improve care for adolescent and young adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of adolescent and young adult (AYA) acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) patients with a documented treatment plan consistent with NCCN guidelines for
      AYAs with ALL.

      II. To evaluate the proportion of AYA ALL patients whose delivered treatment during induction
      and post-induction therapy (PIT) is consistent with NCCN guidelines for AYAs with ALL.

      III. To determine the impact of treating physician specialty and facility type on likelihood
      of AYA ALL patients having a documented treatment plan concordant with NCCN guidelines when
      stratified by age group (15-17year[y], 18-21y, and 22-39y).

      IV. To determine the impact of treating physician specialty and facility type on the
      likelihood of AYA ALL patients receiving induction and post-induction therapy (PIT)
      concordant with NCCN guidelines when stratified by age group (15-17y, 18-21y, and 22-39y).

      V. To identify for AYAs with ALL, targetable structure- and process-level barriers and
      facilitators which will increase the proportion of patients having a documented treatment
      plan and receiving treatment according to NCCN guidelines.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore potential correlations with clinical and social demographic variables to the
      presence of a documented treatment plan and delivered treatment consistent with NCCN
      guidelines in AYAs with ALL.

      OUTLINE:

      CHART REVIEW: Patient medical record data is abstracted and treatment plans are reviewed for
      consistency to NCCN guidelines. For each patient, induction and post-induction care is
      recorded as either concordant with NCCN guidelines or non-concordant with NCCN guidelines.

      SITE QUESTIONNAIRE: Participating sites complete a questionnaire which is designed to capture
      facility-oriented data.

      FOCUS GROUPS: Healthcare providers participate in focus groups over 1-2 hours to discuss
      facilitators and barriers to AYA ALL guideline concordance. Participants provide responses
      via electronic handheld technology in order to maintain anonymity followed by discussion of
      the ideas for clarification.

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Univariate descriptive statistics will be used to determine the proportion of patients with delivery of guideline-consistent care during induction and the first two months of post-induction therapy (overall, induction and PIT). Primary analysis will describe the proportion of patients meeting this endpoint. Generalized linear mixed models will be used to estimate the proportion of patients who are delivered guideline-consistent care and the corresponding confidence intervals accounting for the correlation of outcome within institution.</description>

    <description>Descriptive analysis will be used to examine the differences in the proportion of patients with a documented treatment plan consistent with the NCCN guidelines and with induction and post-induction therapy delivered according to guidelines, between primary physician type (pediatric oncology vs. other) and facility type groups (children's hospital [CH] vs. other). Analyses will be conducted stratified by age and overall.</description>
