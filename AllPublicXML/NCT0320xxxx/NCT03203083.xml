  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-leg squat (SLS) is a functional test visually rated by clinicians for assessing lower
      limb function as a preventive injury strategy. SLS clinical rating is a qualitative
      evaluation and it does not count objective outcomes as kinematics data and surface
      electromyography (sEMG) assessment. Based on the SLS rating, the aims of this study were (i)
      to determine the clinical rating agreement among six raters and (ii) to assess kinematic and
      sEMG predictors of good SLS performance in physically and non-physically active individuals.

    <description>The single-leg squat (SLS) is a clinical functional test commonly used to evaluate clinical abnormal movement patterns of the lower limbs in terms of kinetic chain or co-ordinating muscle activity. This scale accounts for the assessment of five dimensions: overall impression, trunk posture, pelvis in space, hip joint motion and knee join motion. The SLS is potentially promising as a functional test since it involves both daily activity and athletic task.</description>
