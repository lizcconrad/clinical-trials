  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venepuncture can be challenging, especially in patients with co-morbidities that predispose
      them to have inaccessible veins. Multiple unsuccessful venepuncture attempts compromise
      patient care. It causes pain, delays in obtaining blood samples for investigations and
      instituting intra-venous treatment.

      Venepuncture assistive devices (VAD) include ultrasonography, and devices that utilize
      infra-red or transillumination. These are expensive, not widely available, and have not been
      rigorously proven to be effective. This preliminary study using an ordinary pen-torch for
      transillumination showed promising results. 95% of patients with known difficult venous
      access required two or less attempts for successful cannulation. It costs 35 times cheaper
      compared to the cheapest VAD in the market. The concept is promising but the technique
      cumbersome.

      Building upon the concept of transillumination, the aim of this study is to develop an
      idiot-proof cost-effective pocket-sized VAD (FireFly) to improve venepuncture success. A
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to determine its safety and efficacy. Two
      candidate prototypes will be modelled using Computer-Aided Design (Inventor®, Autodesk®,
      California, USA) and fabricated using 3D-printing. Each prototype will be fitted with
      light-emitting diodes of a specific wavelength (6500Knm, 4500Knm, or 660nm). Compared to
      existing VADs, FireFly will be significantly smaller and lighter. It will be constructed
      using nylon-based polyamide and silicone, with flexible circuitry. Flexibility allows it to
      conform to the patients' limbs. A large transverse viewing window optimizes vein
      visualization.

      We include adult patients aged 21 to 100 with difficult venous access (history of ≥3
      consecutive attempts required for successful cannulation during the current admission)
      requiring non-emergent venepuncture in the RCT. Each patient undergoes venepuncture over the
      upper-limb using one of the following: Veinlite® EMS (TransLite®, Texas, USA) (Control), a
      commercial transillumination device; Prototype-1; Prototype-2; Conventional venepuncture
      without an assistive device. Outcome measures include: successful cannulation within 2
      attempts; duration of venepuncture; subjective user feedback. Fisher's exact and
      Kruskal-Wallis tests will be performed.

      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients with a history of difficult
      venepuncture who agreed to be enter into the study will be randomized into one of 4 groups
      using a sealed envelope system: 1. Conventional venepuncture; 2. Veinlite® a commercial Light
      emitting diode (LED) transilluminator device; 3. FireFly Vein Finder Prototype 1; 4. FireFly
      Vein Finder Prototype 2. Hemodynamically unstable patients are excluded. The nurse involved
      in the care of the patient will attempt venepuncture over the upper limb. A group of nurses
      will be recruited before the start of patient recruitment. A maximum of 4 times attempts is
      allowed, before escalation to a doctor/phlebotomist.

      A standardized venepuncture technique using standardized instruments will be utilized. Veins
      will be localized using one of the above techniques. Both Veinlite and FireFly utilize the
      concept of transillumination. Placing it onto the skin will cause the outlines of the veins
      to show up. Once a suitable vein is localized, a tourniquet is applied (Braun® International,
      USA). The area of the skin to be cannulated is disinfected with an alcohol wipe (Webcol®,
      Covidien®, USA). For the setting of IV cannulation, a standardized 23 gauge IV cannula is
      used (Introcan Safety®, Braun®, USA). Normal saline (PosiFlush® 3ml, BD®, USA) will be used
      for flushing the cannula after successful cannulation. For blood taking, a syringe (Terumo®,
      Philippines) ranging from 2ml to 20ml and a 23G needle (Venofix®, Braun®, USA) will be used.
      All instruments needed for venepuncture, including 4 IV cannula or 4 needles should be by the
      patient's bedside prior to the start of each venepuncture attempt. Duration of the procedure
      will be recorded using a stop watch. This is defined as the time (in minutes) from the start
      of attempt to localize a vein to its successful cannulation. Successful cannulation is
      defined either as the ability to flush 2ml of normal saline into the IV cannula or the
      ability to draw 2ml of blood from the vein. A post-procedure questionnaire will be filled up
      by the nurses after attempt at venepuncture.

      Outcome data include: number of attempts and duration needed for successful venepuncture.
      Patient data include: age, sex, race, body-mass index, history of intra-venous drug abuse,
      and renal function. Nurses who consent to join the study will be required to participate in a
      pre- trial tutorial which is estimated to last for 1 hour. During the tutorial, techniques of
      locating veins using pen torch transillumination and by using the Veinlite® device will be
      taught. A standardized technique of venepuncture will also be taught. Tutorial will be in the
      form of slide- show presentation and hands-on training. During the hands-on training, nurses
      will attempt to identify veins on fellow trainees using both the FireFly and Veinlite®.
