      This study will be conducted at La Liga Contra el Cancer in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. The
      overall objective of this project is to improve symptom management for patients undergoing
      chemotherapy in Honduras. The first step in this line of research is a &quot;proof of concept&quot;
      feasibility study in which the investigators will demonstrate their ability to train nurses
      to administer a non-pharmacological, telephone-delivered, symptom management program for
      chemotherapy patients.

      The investigators will use the team's previous experience delivering a standardized,
      non-pharmacological palliative care intervention by telephone to inform a &quot;proof of concept&quot;
      feasibility study in Honduras. They will train nurses at La Liga Contra el Cancer in San
      Pedro Sula to conduct the telephone sessions and monitor their fidelity to treatment as they
      enroll a minimum They will then evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
      effectiveness of the program.
