    <textblock>
      Phase I, open label, single arm, non-randomized, multicenter, prospective dose escalation
      study in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (alloHSCT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine a recommended dose for F16IL2 in combination with BI
      836858 in AML relapse after alloHSCT and investigating safety and tolerability of the
      combination regimen.

      Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) with overdose
      control that will be fitted to binary toxicity outcomes. The estimate of parameters will be
      updated as data are accumulated using the BLRM. At the end of the dose escalation phase, the
      probability of toxicity at each dose combination level will be calculated to determine an
      estimate of the MTD. Once the MTD or a biological active dose has been defined, additional
      patients (up to 10) will be treated with F16IL2 and BI 836858 dosed at this dose combination
      in order to confirm the safety profile of the combination.

             relapsing after alloHSCT, and fulfilling at least one of the following:

               1. bone marrow blasts ≥ 5% of all nucleated cells

               2. appearance of blasts in the peripheral blood

             HBsAg, anti-HBsAg-Ab and anti-HBCAg-Ab is required. In patients with serology
             documenting previous exposure to HBV (i.e., anti-HBs Ab with no history of vaccination
             and/or anti-HBc Ab), negative serum HBV-DNA is required.

          5. Negative serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential* within 14 days of
             starting treatment.

          6. Informed consent personally signed and dated to participate in the study.

          7. Willingness and ability to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests and other study procedures.

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using, from the screening to six
                  months following the last study drug administration, highly effective
                  contraception methods, as defined by the &quot;Recommendations for contraception and
                  pregnancy testing in clinical trials&quot; issued by the Head of Medicine Agencies'
                  Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (www.hma.eu/ctfg.html) and which include, for
                  instance, progesteron-only or combined (estrogen- and progesteron-containing)
                  hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine
                  devices, intrauterine hormone-releasing systems, bilateral tubal occlusion,
                  vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence. Pregnancy test will be repeated at the
                  end of treatment visit.

        Women of childbearing potential are defined as females who have experienced menarche, are
        not postmenopausal (12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause) and are
        not permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or
        bilateral salpingectomy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known central nervous system manifestation of AML.

          2. Previous treatment (e.g., stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
             investigational drugs) within 4 weeks or a minimum of 5 half-lifes of the treatment,
             whatever is shorter, of the first study drug intake for this current AML relapse after
             alloHSCT, except hydroxyurea to control peripheral cell counts up to one day before
             study medication.

          3. Active GvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression, unless controlled with low dose
             steroids equivalent to a maximum of 10 mg methylprednisolone per day.

          4. Chronically impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min).

          5. Inadequate liver function (ALT, AST, ALP or total bilirubin ≥ 3.0 x ULN), if not
             caused by leukemic infiltration.

          6. Any severe concomitant condition which makes it undesirable for the patient to
             participate in the study or which could jeopardize compliance with the protocol.

          7. History within the last year of acute or subacute coronary syndromes including
             myocardial infarction, unstable or severe stable angina pectoris.

          8. Heart insufficiency (&gt; Grade II, New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria).

          9. Irreversible cardiac arrhythmias requiring permanent medication.

             proliferative retinopathy.

         13. Major trauma including major surgery (such as abdominal/cardiac/thoracic surgery)
             within 4 weeks of administration of study treatment.

         14. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

         15. Requirement of chronic administration of corticosteroids. However, low dose
             corticosteroids (maximum 10 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent per day when
             administered for GVHD) are allowed.

         16. Presence of active and uncontrolled infections or other severe concurrent disease,
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the patient at undue risk or
             interfere with the study.

         17. Known active or latent tuberculosis (TB).

         18. Known hereditary fructose intolerance.

         19. Concurrent malignancies other than AML (except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast) unless the patient has been
             disease-free for at least 2 years.

         20. Concomitant treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors or other drugs with proven
             anti-leukemic activity.
