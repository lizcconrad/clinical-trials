        The study will target enrollment of 90 patients who were treated with nivolumab-based
        regimen prior to an allogeneic HCT with at least 45 patients who received nivolumab
        immediately prior to the allogeneic HCT

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years;

          -  First allogeneic HCT for cHL;

          -  Patients with prior autologous HCT for cHL;

          -  Any conditioning regimen, graft source or donor type.

          -  For the primary analysis additional criterion includes prior exposure to nivolumab for
             treatment of cHL immediately prior to the allogeneic HCT, as defined as nivolumab used
             alone or in combination with other agents and used as the last line of therapy prior
             to an allogeneic HCT with the interval between the last dose of nivolumab and start of
             the conditioning regimen no longer than 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL

          -  Previous chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy or other genetically modified
             cellular product
