  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch (BPD-DS) is an accepted and published type
      of bariatric surgery in the United States. The surgery involves both restriction and
      malabsorption to achieve weight loss by creating a sleeve gastrectomy as well as two
      intestinal connections that bypass some of the small intestine, decreasing the amount of food
      that is absorbed. The BPD-DS procedure produces the most weight loss of any bariatric surgery
      commonly performed but has the highest risk of malnutrition and gastrointestinal side
      effects. The loop duodenal switch (L-DS) is a bariatric surgery which has been modified from
      a biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch to maintain excellent weight loss while
      possibly reducing side effects. The surgical modifications in this procedure include reducing
      the number of intestinal reconnections from two to one and reducing the amount of small
      intestine which is bypassed. The L-DS operation is considered experimental by the American
      Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery as long-term data in large numbers of patients is
      not available for weight loss or side effects. The purpose of this study is to examine weight
      loss and other outcomes in the L-DS operation up to 1 year after the procedure.

      Patient eligibility criteria: between 19-70 years of age at enrollment, BMI â‰¥ 40 kg/m2, and
      the subject is under consideration for surgery for obesity or metabolic disease and elects to
      undergo a primary loop duodenal switch procedure or as a conversion procedure for failed,
      sustained weight loss after a sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic adjustable gastric band
      performed more than 12 months prior to time of evaluation. All subjects will undergo a
      standard comprehensive bariatric surgery evaluation which includes but is not limited to
      nutrition consultation, psychological evaluation, laboratory tests and supervised medical
      weight loss. Once the study subjects have met all of the insurance requirements, the
      bariatric clinic will submit for insurance approval for a duodenal switch operation. Once
      surgery is approved, study subjects will have a standard pre-operative history and physical
      visit no more than 30 days prior to surgery and will fill out a survey regarding
      health-related quality of life and amount of gastrointestinal symptoms experienced (diarrhea,
      constipation, bloating, etc).

      This study does not change the number of visits, timing of visits, or laboratory blood draws
      surgical patients would have with the bariatric surgery clinic or staff. Study subjects will
      be seen in the clinic at 2 and 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months per the bariatric surgery
      center protocol. As part of these normally scheduled visits, weight loss and health status
      will be recorded. Labs will be checked at 3, 6, and 12 months for nutritional status. A
      survey to reassess health-related quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms will be
      performed at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.

      1. Screening and Informed Consent Subjects will be screened on a weekly basis for eligibility
      of enrollment. If eligible, patients will be approached by study staff at the initial
      surgical consultation. The purpose of the study and risks of the procedures will be explained
      to the subject and the consent process must be documented accordingly in the medical record.
      Subjects who agree to study participation must sign an IRB approved informed consent form.
      Subjects will be informed that their participation in this study is voluntary and they may
      refuse to participate or discontinue from the study at any time. Subjects will be given the
      opportunity to ask the investigator questions so that they are adequately informed about the
      research. A copy of the signed informed consent must be provided to the subject and the
      informed consent process will be documented in source documents. If new information becomes
      available that may affect a subject's decision to continue to take part in the study, this
      information will be discussed with the subject by the investigator.

      Failure to meet submission requirements:

      Each patient will be required to meet their individual insurance companies requirements for
      submission of bariatric surgery approval. Subjects who provide study consent but then do not
      submit for insurance approval or are denied will be considered &quot;discontinued&quot; and will not
      require additional study follow-up visits. The reason for the discontinuation will be clearly
      delineated on the applicable case report form. Subjects in who the L-DS procedure is begun
      but not completed will be considered &quot;discontinued&quot; once discharged from the hospital and not
      require any additional study follow-up visits. Reasons for discontinuation will be recorded
      in the case report form. Additionally, female patients of child bearing age will undergo a
      standard of care pregnancy test at the time of the pre-operative surgical testing (2/3 weeks
      before surgery) and always the morning of surgery by urine HCG.

      Surgical Procedures:

      The operation will be performed per standard of care and as previously described (1-3), with
      the exception that in this protocol the duodeno-intestinal anastomosis will be performed at
      approximately 300 cc with moderate stretch from the ileocecal valve, rather than 200 cm or
      250 cm, as in previous reports. The purpose of this change is to allow greater nutrient
      absorption since a previous report observed no difference in mean excess weight loss between
      200 cm and 250 cm (Sanchez-Pernaute 2013). In addition, the sleeve gastrectomy will be
      performed over a 40 French bougie. The duodeno-intestinal anastomosis will be hand-sewn.
      Subjects will be maintained on a low-calorie diet for the first post-operative month, as per
      standard of care. In addition, multivitamin supplements, calcium, and iron should be
      prescribed and maintained per standard of care.

      Schedule:

      Subjects will be evaluated preoperatively, during the procedure, at discharge, and at 2
      weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Assessments to be conducted/data
      collected at each visit are listed below and in the study assessments table.

        1. Pre-operative Assessment The following assessments will be performed pre-operatively
           prior to the scheduled surgical procedure and the results recorded on the appropriate
           subject report form Verification of pre-operative eligibility criteria Subject

           anastomosis performed at approximately 300 cm from the ileocecal valve, hand-sewn
           anastomosis, and fascia closure for all port sites accommodating trocars greater than 12
           mm) surgical conversions to open concomitant procedures performed during the procedure

           expressed as change from baseline at 3, 6 and 12 months only need for endoscopy adverse
           events (see below)

        5. Adverse Events Adverse events for all bariatric procedures are tracked within our
           centers Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program
           (MBSAQIP) database. All bariatric centers accredited by the American Society for
           Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) are required to submit all bariatric surgery
           data, including experimental procedures like the L-DS, to the MBSAQIP database for
           quality review. Our bariatric surgery team has open access to our centers data for
           quality review purposes and will compare adverse events for the L-DS to the other
           procedures performed by our center. Adverse events are categorized by organ system
           (wound, respiratory, urinary tract, CNS, cardiac, or other) as specified by the MBSAQIP.
           Any post-operative occurrence within 30 days will be documented if related to the
           bariatric procedure. Bariatric related readmission and reoperations are also tracked per
           MBSAQIP guidelines. The L-DS would be stopped if a statistically significant increase in
           morbidity, mortality, or failed weight loss is found compared to the centers other
           commonly performed bariatric procedures.
