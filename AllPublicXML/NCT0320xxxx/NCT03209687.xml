  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that addition of daily small dose of human
      menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) drug following oocytes retrieval could improve the fertility
      outcome in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in the IVF unit of Cairo University. Females undergoing ICSI
      cycles in the age between 20 and 40 years will be allocated to one of 2 groups. Long agonist
      protocol will be used. Allocation to either one of 2 groups will be done on the day of
      oocytes retrieval. The first group will take (in addition to the routine care) daily human
      menopausal gonadotropin drug injection for 2 weeks. The second group will receive the routine
      care.
