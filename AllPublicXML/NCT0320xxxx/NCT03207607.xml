  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of mid-morning gel snacks on subjective
      appetite, glucose and insulin responses, and food intake in healthy weight young adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      23 (14 male, 9 female) healthy, non-smoking human subjects aged 18-30 years with a body mass
      index (BMI) between 20 and 24.9 were recruited in the experiment. Five gel snacks including a
      control snack and four modified snacks containing whey protein, oats, coconut oil or
      maltodextrin were tested. On six separate mornings, at least 3 days apart and after a 12
      hours overnight fast, each participant consumed a standardized breakfast of cereal, milk, and
      orange juice at home, then arrived in the lab 2 hours after breakfast to receive one of the
      five test snack treatments or skip snack. Subjective appetite by a 100 mm visual analogue
      scale (VAS) was measured at baseline (0 min) and after each treatment up to 2 h (15, 30, 60,
      90, and 120 min). Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were measured via finger-prick at
      the same time VAS measurements were taken. Food intake was measured via ad libitum pizza
      lunch.
