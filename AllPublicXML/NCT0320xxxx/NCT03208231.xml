    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of VRC01 in
      HIV-1-infected infants beginning combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VRC01 is an experimental human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of VRC01 in HIV-1-infected
      infants initiating cART within 12 weeks of birth.

      The infants will be randomly assigned to either receive VRC01 (Arm 1) or not receive VRC01
      (Arm 2). Infants in Arm 1 will receive VRC01 at study entry (Week 0) and Weeks 2, 6, and 10.
      Infants in Arm 2 will receive no study product.

      Participants will attend study visits at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 16, 20, 24, 36, and
      48. Visits will include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, and specimen
      collection.

      Infants' mothers may optionally be enrolled in the study for one-time specimen collection for
      exploratory evaluations. Maternal study participation is not required for infant study
      participation.

      Study duration is approximately two years. Accrual is expected to require approximately one
      year, and each infant will complete 48 weeks of follow-up.

                  entry.

               -  Infant's mother received any active HIV-specific immunotherapy prior to infant
                  study entry.

               -  Infant's mother received any passive HIV-specific immunotherapy within two years
                  prior to infant study entry.

               -  If infant's mother is breastfeeding: mother is planned to receive any active or
                  passive HIV-specific immunotherapy at any time during infant study participation.

          -  Infant initiated a combination of three or more ARVs, all at or above recommended
             treatment doses, within 48 hours of birth. Recommended treatment doses are as follows:

               -  Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): As per World

             that, in the opinion of the site investigator or designee, would interfere with the
             infant's ability to comply with study requirements.

          -  Infant has any other condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator or
             designee, would make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.
