  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that will include the
      participation of 14 Jiu-Jitsu athletes between 18 and 33 years. The aim of the study is to
      evaluate the effects of carbohydrate consumption on fatigue and exercise-induced muscle
      damage in Jiu-Jitsu athletes.

    <textblock>
      Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a sport characterized by intermittent high-intensity efforts
      separated by periods of low intensity. Muscular strength is considered one of the most
      important physical components to be developed, especially in the upper limbs through dynamic
      and static actions. The activities of high intensity (relation effort-pause) carried out by
      the upper and lower limbs during BJJ can induce muscle fatigue. In order to minimize the
      glycogen depletion and to guarantee the availability of energy substrate to the athlete
      during the physical exercise, the carbohydrate intake before moderate intensity exercises
      should be between 5-7 g / kg of weight / day. The intervention group will receive a 30g
      maltodextrin beverage and the placebo group a non-carbohydrate drink. There will be 3 combat
      simulations of 8 min each, with intervals of 10 min between fights. Athletes will be
      instructed to remain with their usual intake during the study. The outcomes will be: manual
      grip strength (dynamometer), upper limb strength (KGST), lower limb strength (vertical jump),
      subjective exertion perception (Borg scale), pain perception (Nilsson scale), blood markers
      of muscle damage (CK and LDH), lactate, and glycemia.
