  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare a standard of care manual toileting
      protocol (e.g., &quot;check and change&quot; strategy) to toileting patterns recorded by the TENA
      Identifi system in identifying incontinence patterns and events, and, whether such data
      differentially improve a care planning strategy, nursing effort, product use, and wet-time
      for urinary incontinence.

    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence in nursing homes influences resident dignity and quality of life. It
      also drives significant use of healthcare resources, including time and caregiver assistance,
      and costs of care. Various toileting programs are used to address urinary incontinence,
      including habit training, bladder training, prompted voiding, and check and change
      procedures. Clinical trials have found that 33% to 60% of residents either became continent
      or reduced the frequency of incontinence episodes to less than one per day with the
      introduction of a prompted voiding program.

      There are several drawbacks to current programs. Manually recorded wet checks do not identify
      when incontinence occurs, only when wetness is detected, reducing the precision of time of
      incontinence to the window of time between checks. Nursing home staff create individualized
      care plans for each resident, based on standard check and change procedures, but poor
      precision in ascertaining timing and quantity of incontinence episodes can contribute to less
      frequent resident toileting or changing.
