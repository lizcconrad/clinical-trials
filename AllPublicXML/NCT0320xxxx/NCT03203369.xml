      A Phase 1 dose-finding study of Universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells targeting cluster
      of differentiation (CD) 123 (UCART123) administered intravenously to patients with relapsed
      or refractory Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN), followed by a dose
      expansion phase in relapsed or refractory BPDCN patients or newly diagnosed BPDCN patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose-finding study of UCART123 administered
      intravenously to patients with BPDCN. he study will consist of two phases, a dose-escalation
      phase in relapsed or refractory BPDCN patients and a dose-expansion phase in
      relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed BPDCN patients and relapsed/refractory BPDCN
      patients. The safest dose of UCART123 used at the dose level where activity is observed will
      be used in the dose-expansion phase. The study's primary assessment is the the safety and
      tolerability of UCART123 administered to patients with BPDCN, and to determine the
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of UCART123. T

             route of steroids are permitted;

          -  Any known uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, hypertension not
