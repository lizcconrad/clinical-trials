  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with a known diagnosis of peripheral artery disease as measured by an abnormal ankle
      brachial index (&lt;.9 or &gt;1.1) will undergo a single 5 min exposure of 670 nm light, 1 cm above
      the gastrocnemius muscle. Blood flow will be measured by infusion of ultrasound contrast and
      subsequent acquisition of ultrasound images. 2 blood samples will be collected for
      measurement of nitric oxide metabolites.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be subjects between the ages of 18 and 85 who have been diagnosed
             with peripheral artery disease. Men and women will be recruited for participation. All
             ethnicities will be included in this study.

        Diagnosis of peripheral artery disease is defined as an Ankle Brachial index of &lt;0.9 or
        greater than 1.1 either at rest or during treadmill exercise.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusionary criteria include age under 18 years and over 85 years, those who are
             unable to understand the consent process , those who cannot read or speak English,
             active pregnancy, hypersensitivity to perflutren contrast agents, pulmonary
             hypertension, active illicit drug use, untreated blood pressure over 160/95, sickle
             cell disease, or a history of intracardiac shunt. Additional exclusion criteria
             neurological diseases such as spinal stenosis, unspecified pain disorders, and any
             uncontrolled medical conditions.
