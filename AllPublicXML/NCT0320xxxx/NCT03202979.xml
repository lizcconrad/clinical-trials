  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to collect preliminary information on the effect of low doses of
      trazodone on pain intensity in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy and to evaluate the
      neuropathic pain symptoms, anxiety, sleep, quality of life, safety and tolerability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, double-dummy, dose finding, parallel
      group, multicentre, international, prospective, pilot study.

      The present study is planned to assess the efficacy and the safety of an 8-week treatment
      period with low doses of trazodone (30 mg daily or 60 mg total daily, respectively)
      administered to patients affected by painful diabetic neuropathy.

      Gabapentin will be administered together with the investigational drug in open label
      conditions in order to assure an effective pharmacological treatment to all patients. A slow
      titration of gabapentin will be applied in this trial in order to control possible side
      effects when co-administered with trazodone.
