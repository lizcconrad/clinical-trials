    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of Relay Pro and Relay
      NBS Pro devices in humans having thoracic aortic pathologies.

      Clinical results will be used to apply for the CE certification.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm clinical study in patients
      presenting thoracic aortic pathologies. Patients with thoracic aortic pathologies who are
      planned to undergo thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with a stent-graft based on
      routine clinical assessments performed as part of the patients' standard care will be
      screened after obtaining the informed consent from the patients, and if eligible, enrolled
      and scheduled for the implantation procedure with the study device.

      Following a baseline assessment, the implantation procedure will be performed according to
      the Instructions for Use and local routine practice. A follow-up visit will be performed 30
      days after the implantation procedure. The investigator will perform assessments of the
      implantation procedure and device system and document adverse events and device deficiencies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient diagnosed with thoracic aorta pathology (aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, dissection,
             penetrating ulcer or intramural hematoma) suitable for TEVAR with a Relay Pro or Relay
             NBS Pro stent-graft; diagnosis must be confirmed by contrast computed tomography
             angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months of the planned
             implant procedure.

          -  Proximal and distal aortic necks suitable for stent-graft placement (i.e., diameter
             ranging between 18 and 42 mm)

          -  Proximal and distal landing zones suitable for the stent-graft

          -  Adequate vascular access for insertion of the delivery system, i.e., femoral or iliac
             arteries a minimum 6 mm in diameter to accommodate the 19 to 22-Fr outer-diameter
             delivery system and no excessive disease precluding delivery system entry/passage or
             iliac arteries that could be extended via an access conduit.

          -  Written informed consent provided by the subject him/herself (not a representative)
             upon enrollment

          -  Arterial access size insufficient for delivery system entrance or impossibility to
             perform a surgical access conduit

          -  Treatment of lesion that would require a delivery system with usable length greater
             than 90 cm

          -  Excessive arterial disease precluding delivery system entrance or passage

          -  Systemic infection

             (IUDs), and sexual abstinence.

          -  Patient committed to an institution by virtue of an order issued either by the courts
