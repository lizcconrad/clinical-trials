  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The designed study follows up on the previous one by the international T-cell project (Bellei
      et al,, 2012) and its purpose is to verify whether a prospective collection of data would
      permit access to more accurate information permitting a better definition of prognosis and
      investigation of more adequate treatment strategies for these neoplasms.

      The analysis of patients distributed in all five macro regions of the country and a
      comparison among them will provide a real picture of the disease in Brazil, limiting the bias
      probably found in the previous projects.

      Patients with diagnosis histologically confirmed T-cell or NK-cell lymphoma will be
      registered in the study, despite of their planned treatment. Registration will be made
      on-line on a key restricted accessible web-database after obtaining the informed consent
      dated and signed by the patient. Every registered patient has as well to undergo a central
      histopathology review by a panel of experts. The referring pathologist will collect and
      review the patological material sent by the participating centers, without knowing the
      clinical outcome of the patient. Validated cases have to be supplied of information regarding
      treatment procedures and follow up updating for at least 5 years. The primary endpoint is the
      overall survival and other endpoints such as event free survival; progression free survival,
      complete and partial response rates.
