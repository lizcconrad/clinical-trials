  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) model theoretically fits with treating
      appearance-related anxiety in individuals with a visible difference. This study examines the
      effectiveness of an acceptance-based self-help manual for this population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with visible difference commonly experience social anxiety due to
      appearance-related concerns. There are limited resources to help people with
      appearance-related distress, so internet-provided self-help interventions may be beneficial.
      A pilot randomised controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of an acceptance-based
      self-help intervention to a waitlist control group.

      We hypothesise (1) the acceptance-based self-help intervention will significantly increase
      participants' &quot;psychological flexibility&quot;, (2) significantly decrease fear of negative
      evaluation from others and (3) significantly increase their quality of life, compared to the
      waitlist control group. Data will be collected at two time points only.

      General distress (CORE-10) will be collected pre-intervention only to ensure randomisation
      has been successful. Should the two groups significantly differ in distress, this will be
      accounted for in subsequent analyses.

    <description>The BFNE-II is a 12-item revised version of the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation scale (BFNE; Leary, 1983) used for measuring fears of negative evaluation (e.g., ''I am afraid that others will not approve of me''). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all characteristic of me) to 4 (extremely characteristic of me). This correlates highly with measures of social anxiety.</description>
