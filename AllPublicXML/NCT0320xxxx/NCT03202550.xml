      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 2 arms. It will
      be comparing the effects of placebo compared to 1 mg oral lorazepam/5 mg oral oxycodone on
      pain scores during cervical dilator placement prior to dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E).

      Potential participants will be first introduced to the study via routine intake call.
      Participants will be identified at the participant's office visits to the Johns Hopkins'
      Women's Center for Family Planning. If a patient desires D&amp;E for a second trimester
      pregnancy, the patient will first receive standard counseling. Only after providing written
      informed consent for the procedure will the patients be screened for eligibility in the
      study. If the patient is eligible the participant will be asked by a member of the research
      team if the patient is interested in participating. If the patient is, the study will be
      explained to the participant and written consent will be obtained after participant is given
      the opportunity to have all questions answered.

      The study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 2 arms.
      Participants will first complete a survey to collect demographic data.

      Participants in both arms will receive the institution's current standard analgesia for
      cervical dilator placement. In addition to this standard regimen, participants will be
      randomized to receive either: (1) a dose of two oral placebo pills, or (2) 1mg of oral
      lorazepam with 5 mg of oral oxycodone prior to cervical dilator placement.

    <masking_description>The participant, provider, and nursing staff will be blinded to the intervention. The pharmacy will prepare the treatment drugs and placebos.. Randomization will be stratified by gestational age (&gt;= 20 weeks or &lt;20 weeks) and the randomization allocation sequence will be computer-generated with a random number generator by a statistician. The pharmacist will be aware of the randomization sequence and will dispense the drugs as appropriate, while keeping track of which arms participants were randomized to.</masking_description>
