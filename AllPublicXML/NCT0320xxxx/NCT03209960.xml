      The aim of this study is to improve spasticity (a form of muscle rigidity) diagnosis through
      development of a simple physical examination guide for primary care providers/clinicians.
      This guide will assist in the identification of patients who would benefit from being
      referred to a movement disorders neurologist for spasticity evaluation and subsequent
      treatment. The examination tool will be tested for bedside implementation in all consenting
      participants residing in Tennessee State Veteran's Home, which is a long-term care facility
      in Murfreesboro, TN. Each of the 140 residents will receive one neurological examination and
      two physical examinations guided by the referral tool. A medical record review will also be
      performed.

    <time_frame>Up to three months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>Two Vanderbilt primary care providers (a nurse practitioner and a primary care physician) will examine all consented residents, guided by the bedside referral tool, to determine if a referral to a movement disorders neurologist is requires for a spasticity consultation. The findings of each exam will be recorded by the research coordinator, who will keep the results blinded from the other raters. Each rater's referral decision will be compared to the diagnosis made by the movement disorders neurologist.</description>

    <measure>Spasticity Diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to three months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>There is no biomarker for spasticity. Therefore, the diagnosis will be made on physician impression. A neurologist trained in movement disorders will examine each consented patient to determine if they have spasticity. The severity of the subject's spasticity will be documented, including the following measures: presence of fixed contractures and presence of pain on movement.</description>

The findings of each exam will be recorded by the research coordinator, who will keep the results blinded from the other raters. Agreement on spasticity referral between the two Vanderbilt primary care providers who performed the bedside examination will be determined.</description>

    <description>Two Vanderbilt primary care providers (a nurse practitioner and a primary care physician) will examine all consented residents. Each primary care provider will perform elements of a physical exam guided by the bedside referral tool to determine if a referral to a movement disorders neurologist is required for a spasticity consultation.</description>

    <description>The subject will undergo elements of the neurological examination during which the movement disorders neurologist will look specifically for the presence of spasticity. If spasticity is found to be present during the examination, the neurologist will rate the severity of the spasticity in all affected limbs and record whether they would recommend treatment for spasticity, and if so, which treatment(s) they believe would be beneficial for the subject.</description>
