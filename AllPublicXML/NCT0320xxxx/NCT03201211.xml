  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this long-term follow-up of a Phase I study is to evaluate the kinetics of the
      antibody response to NTHi-Mcat antigens and long-term safety, in subjects aged between 50-71
      years at the time of enrolment in the NTHi-Mcat-001 study. These subjects were previously
      exposed to two adjuvanted formulations of the NTHi-Mcat vaccine administered according to a
      0, 2 months schedule in the NTHi-Mcat-001 (201281) study. The subjects that had received
      saline placebo controls will also be included in this follow-up study to make comparisons
      with the investigational vaccines. No vaccinations will be administered in this trial.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who previously participated in STEP 2 of study NTHi-Mcat-001 (201281), and
             performed the last study visit (Month 14) and received the 2 study vaccinations.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. return for follow-up visits). And subjects' Legally
             Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and
             will comply, with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject/ LAR(s) of the subject prior to
             performance of any study specific procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) during the
             period starting 30 days before the first follow-up study visit (Month 19 to Month 20),
             or planned use during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs since the end of the NTHi-Mcat-001 study. For
             corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and
             topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs at any time during the study
             period (e.g. infliximab).

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting
             3 months before the first follow-up visit or planned administration during the study
             period.

          -  Current alcoholism and/or drug abuse.

          -  Has significant disease (including significant neurological or psychological
             disorders), in the opinion of the investigator, likely to interfere with the study
             and/or likely to cause death within the study duration.

          -  Any other condition that the investigator judges may interfere with study findings.
