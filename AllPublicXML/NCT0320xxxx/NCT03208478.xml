  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve blocks are used to provide pain control after moderately painful orthopedic surgeries.
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction with patellar autograft is a painful
      orthopedic procedure performed after traumatic injury to the knee. Many patients undergoing
      ACL reconstruction receive a nerve block as part of their anesthetic care. These blocks can
      be performed in different locations along the femoral nerve, with advantages and
      disadvantages to each location. Recently published evidence indicates that there is no
      short-term difference in pain control between the two commonly-targeted locations (&quot;Adductor
      Canal&quot; and &quot;Femoral&quot;). However, studies involving patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty
      indicate that femoral blocks provide better pain control with movement than adductor canal
      blocks. As many patients undergoing ACL reconstruction use continuous passive motion (CPM)
      machines as part of rehabilitation starting on post-operative day one, the investigators
      hypothesize that pain control and quality of recovery in the first 48 hours after surgery
      will be superior with a continuous femoral block than with a continuous adductor canal block.
      The investigators plan to study this by randomizing patients presenting for ACL
      reconstruction to receive either a continuous femoral or continuous adductor canal block
      (both considered adequate means of pain control), and following them to 48 hours to determine
      the level of pain, quality of recovery score, opioid use, and CPM compliance.
