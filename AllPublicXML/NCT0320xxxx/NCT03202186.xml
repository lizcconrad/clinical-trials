  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the clinical trial is to demonstrate superiority of BHR401 (oral
      micronized progesterone) versus placebo as a monotherapy for moderate to severe VMS in
      postmenopausal women. Three different doses of BHR-401 (200 mg, 300 mg or 400 mg) will be
      tested against placebo in hierarchical order, starting with the highest dose. Superiority
      will be defined as a significant (significance level α = 0.05) reduction of moderate to
      severe VMS frequency compared to placebo at treatment week 12 (the primary efficacy endpoint
      of the study).
