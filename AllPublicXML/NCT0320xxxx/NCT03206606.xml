  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problematic: Spirometry is used to objectify the obstructive syndrome defining chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, this test remains underused in the primary
      care. The tools available for its interpretation are little used and the existence of several
      decision algorithms can create confusion during the diagnosis.

      Principal objective: To evaluate the impact of a mobile application (SPIRO©) on medical
      practice (interpretation and prescription of spirometry) of family physicians and family
      medicine residents working in family medicine units (FMU) in Quebec affiliated with Laval
      University.

      Secondary objective : To evaluate the usability of SPIRO© among family physicians and
      residents in family medicine working in FMU in Quebec affiliated with Laval University.

      Methods: This is a pre-post clinical trial with control group. Participants (family MD and
      family medicine residents) will be recruited from the various FMU affiliated with Laval
      University. Participants working in the FMU in the experimental group will be able to use the
      SPIRO® mobile application to facilitate interpretation of the spirometry test results while
      participants in the control group will not have access to it during the study. The basic
      characteristics of the participants and various behavioral parameters based on the theory of
      planned behavior concerning the interpretation and prescription of spirometry test will be
      measured. Data from the control group will be collected before those in the experimental
      group at the time the application is not yet available, which will minimize contamination
      between groups. The data will be collected with questionnaires delivered in person to the
      participants before the intervention (T0 time) and then four months later (T1 time) during
      their team or research meeting. Participants will be recruited in eight of the 12 Quebec FMU
      affiliated with Laval University, who will be randomly assigned to two equal groups: control
      and experimental. The intervention will consist in sending the SPIRO© mobile application to
      participants in the experimental group who will use it for a period of four months.

      Hypothesis : The investigators hypothesize that the use of the SPIRO© application will
      increase the skills and confidence of family physicians and family medicine residents in
      prescribing and interpreting spirometry compared to the control group.

      The project will be conducted in the following six major steps: 1) Collection of
      socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics of participants using sections A, B, C and D
      of the NAPI questionnaire in the control group; 2) Intervention in the control group (they
      will continue their daily medical practice without being subject to any intervention by our
      research team), for a period of 4 months; 3) Measurement of behavioral changes in the control
      group using Sections B, C, D and E of the NAPI questionnaire 4 months after the start of the
      study; 4) Collection of socio-demographic and behavioral data from participants in the
      experimental group using sections A, B, C and D of the NAPI questionnaire; 5) E-mail
      distribution of the application and use of the application by participants in the
      experimental group for a period of four months, 6) Measurement of behavioral changes in the
      experimental group after the use of the application, Using sections B, C, D and E of the NAPI
      questionnaire as well as a questionnaire on the application SPIRO© (SPIRO questionnaire)
      which will evaluate the usability of this one.

      The study has been approved by the research ethic board of the Health and Social Services
      Center of the old capital - attached to the Integrated Center for Health and Social Services
      of the National Capital.
