    <textblock>
      Test the acceptability and feasibility of a brief motivational interview intervention to
      facilitate advance care planning (ACP) conversations for older adults with serious co-morbid
      illness being discharged from the emergency department (ED). The investigators will interview
      the participants to understand their perception of the intervention and collect
      patient-reported outcomes data after leaving the ED.
