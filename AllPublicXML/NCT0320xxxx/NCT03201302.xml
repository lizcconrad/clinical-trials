  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone mass develops throughout childhood and adolescence until a peak bone mass is achieved
      during early adulthood. Fracture risk later in life can be predicted at a large extent by
      peak bone mass. Occurence of sarcopenia and osteoporosis (i.e. loss of mone mass) during late
      adulthood has been strongly associated with the degree of bone mineralization during early
      life. Nearly 50% of total bone mineral content (BMC) reached during adulthood is obtained
      during pre-adolescence rendering this period critical for skeletal health and is considered
      as an optimal period for bone/skeletal growth since during this time bones are more adaptable
      to osteogenic stimuli such as exercise-induced mechanical loading. Organized sport activities
      and/or nutrition appear to affect profoundly bone mineral density (BMD), BMC, bone geometry,
      and overall skeletal health during preadolescence offering an effective type of prevention of
      osteoporosis, a condition very difficult to treat later in life. Evidence suggest that some
      modes of exercise activities may be more effective (osteogenic) for bone development due to
      the magnitude and type of mechanical strain placed on long bones causing them to be more
      dense. Weight-bearing activities (e.g. running, jumping etc.) are believed to be more
      osteogenic than non-weight bearing activities. However, more research is required in order to
      determine: i) whether weight-bearing activities are more osteogenic than non weight -bearing
      activities during childhood and ii) the osteogenic potential of a large number of sport
      activities used by school-children as compared to a control treatment of no participation in
      organized sport activities. The present trial attempted to compare a large number of
      different sport activities in respect to their osteogenic potential based on training
      variables that are thought to affect osteogenesis while at the same time allows direct
      comparison of exercise modes that are entirely different. Therefore, the goal of this
      investigation was to determine the osteogenic potential of a large number of exercise
      training activities in boys and girls of 8-12 years of age during an entire primary school
      season.

      Healthy, previously untrained, pre-pubertal boys and girls (N=335) were assigned to 16
      different groups: 1) physical education, i.e. children participated only school in physical
      education classes (control group), 2) football (soccer) training, 3) basketball training, 4)
      volleyball training, 5) wrestling training, 6) martial arts training, 7) tennis training, 8)
      track and field training, 9) taekwondo training, 10) rhythmic gymnastics training, 11)
      artistic gymnastics training, 12) dance training, 13) swimming training, 14) climbing
      training, 15) two weight-bearing training modes, and 16) one weight-bearing and one
      non-weight bearing activity. Exercise training was performed three times per week for nine
      months and each training session had a 60-minute duration (except for the physical education
      classes at school in the control group). Anthropometric measurements (body height, body mass,
      and length and circumferences of various body segments), blood sampling, measurements of body
      composition (using dual X-ray energy absorptiometry or DEXA and skinfold calibers), bone
      measurements (bone density and bone mineral content at lumbar spine, both hips, both wrists
      and whole body using DEXA), and performance (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength,
      muscle power, flexibility and motor ability) were performed at baseline and after the
      completion of a 9-month training intervention. Nutritional intake and habitual physical
      activity were measured at baseline, mid-training and post-training (using diet recalls and
      accelerometry, respectively). Intensity and volume of training was measured once every three
      months using heart rate monitoring, accelerometry, Global Positioning System (GPS) devices
      and jump measurement. Furthermore, two other studies were also performed as a part of this
      project: a) assessment of physical activity during physical education classes for primary
      school (using accelerometry, GPS instrumentation and jump measurement) and b) a smaller
      number of participants in the football, track and field, swimming and tennis training groups
      provided blood samples before and after a training session at baseline.
