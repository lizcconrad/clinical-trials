  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is associated with different types of pain (acute, chronic, excess nociception,
      neuropathic) generated by different mechanisms in the nervous system. The rTMS could provide
      significant analgesia for refractory endometriosis pain.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) for analgesia on chronic refractory endometriosis pain.

      The first step consists of the inclusion of 12 patients followed by the filling by each
      patient of the RedCap software of five simple numerical scales for 4 weeks . Realization of a
      brain and medullary MRI to allow neuronavigation. Realization of 5 sessions of rTMS in 5 days
      during the first week then evaluation (physical examination, questionnaires) in consultation
      on post-stimulation. Then followed for 28 days in total through self-assessment of pain that
      will be filled daily on REDCap and last consultation on D28 for further evaluation
