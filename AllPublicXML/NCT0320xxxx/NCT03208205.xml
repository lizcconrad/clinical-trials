    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to report outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in pediatric
      retinal detachment (RD) accompanied with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) as well as
      complications and factors influencing the final anatomical and functional results.

      This is retrospective consecutive case series of 14 eyes treated with primary PPV for RD
      repair. Average postoperative follow-up period is 34 months.

      This is the retrospective study of 14 consecutive patients younger than 18 years age who
      underwent primary PPV at the Department of General Ophthalmology of Medical University of
      Lublin in a time period from 1st January 2006 to 1st January 2017. This study followed the
      tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The treatment chosen in the study was a part of a
      standard care. Written informed consent was taken from all subjects. All patients underwent
      vitreoretinal surgery due to RD (rhegmatogenous, tractional or combined rhegmatogenous and
      tractional). Exclusion criteria from the study was the time of follow-up less than 6 months.

      Average age at the time of the presence of RD was 10±4.7 years (range 4-17 years). Pre- and
      postoperative data were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis included gender, age at
      the presentation, laterality, etiology, duration of presenting symptoms, presences of ocular
      comorbidities, macular status (attached or non-attached), presence of PVR grade C, initial
      and final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), number of procedures, type of endotamponade
      during PPV, final lens status, duration of the follow-up, anatomical success and
      complications. Indications for PPV were as follows: presence of advanced PVR and/or total RD
      and/or multiple breaks, giant retinal tears. PVR was graded according to the Retina Society
      Terminology Classification [9]. Visual acuity was measured by Snellen charts. The anatomical
      success was defined as persistent retinal reattachment at the last follow-up visit
      (regardless of presence or absence of silicone oil tamponade).

      Statistical computations were performed using STATISTICA 13PL (Stasoft, USA) programme.

    <description>Complete 23G PPV with scleral indentation was performed using Constellation system. Posterior vitreous detachment was induced very carefully by the cutter probe using aspiration. The peripheral vitreous was removed in all eyes with 360° of the vitreous base shaved under scleral indentation. After complete retinal attachment was achieved, endolaser photocoagulation was applied around the retinal break(s) as three to four rows of burns or/and cryopexy under HPFCL. Then a HPFCL/air/5000cst silicone oil exchange was performed. In one eye only HPFCL/air exchange was performed. Sclerotomies were sutured when needed with Vicryl 8.0 sutures.</description>
