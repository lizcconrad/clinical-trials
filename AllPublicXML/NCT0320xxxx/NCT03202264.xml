  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication side effects and interactions between medications are very common in older adults
      and are related to negative health outcomes, including mobility. In this study, the
      investigators will test a new process aimed at reducing unnecessary medication use and drug
      side effects in seniors using the best medical evidence and patient preferences for
      treatment. This study will assess how feasible the implementation of this intervention is
      within a long-term care facility as well as if it is possible. The study will also assess for
      any signals of reversal of medications related mobility impairments to reduce
      medications-related mobility impairment (fatigue, pain, falls) using the intervention.
      Participants in two long-term care facilities will participate in this study. Measures will
      include feasibility outcomes regarding the logistics of the intervention as well as patients
      outcomes (falls, hospitalizations, and medications) collected before and after
      implementation. Findings will inform the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the
      effect of this intervention on health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are substantial associations between polypharmacy and reduced function from older
      adults and this is likely to be important in frail older adults both in long term care and in
      the community. The reversibility of drug-induced mobility impairment is unclear therefore the
      investigators plan to investigate signals of any impact of reducing polypharmacy on mobility.
      The investigators chose the long-term care setting given the presence of complete medication
      administration records and this patient population's high prevalence of polypharmacy and risk
      of adverse drug events. TAPERMD is an electronic tool for systematic medication reduction
      that incorporates patient priorities, electronic screening for potentially harmful medicines,
      supporting evidence tools and a monitoring pathway to support medication reduction. This
      study will examine the feasibility of this tool in a long-term care setting as well as
      examine. Participants in two long-term care facilities will participate in this study.
      Measures will include feasibility outcomes regarding the logistics of the intervention as
      well as patients outcomes (falls, hospitalizations, and medications) collected before and
      after implementation. Findings will inform a randomized controlled trial to measure the
      effect of this intervention on health outcomes.
