      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to examine the role of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) in
      decreasing symptoms in patients with a diagnosis of chronic post concussive syndrome (PCS).

      Hypothesis:

      The study hypothesis is that HBOT will decrease symptoms measured by standard measurement
      tools when provided to patients who have a diagnosis of PCS and are 6 months to 36 months
      post injury.

      Study Overview:

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves the administration of inhaled 100% oxygen at
      increased ambient pressure inside a closed vessel. HBOT produces greatly elevated arterial
      and tissue oxygen tensions, producing a wide variety of physiological effects at the cellular
      and sub cellular level.

      Participants will be selected from the post-concussive syndrome population based on an
      expectation that they would experience a clinically significant improvement. Eligible
      subjects will be experiencing post concussive symptoms related to an injury within the last 6
      to 36 months. The study will be enrolling 150 paprticipants and will be randomized to two
      different treatment arms: experimental group and sham group. Participants will not be aware
      to which group they have been randomized.

      Each subject will receive a series of forty 2 hour treatments, delivered once a day, 5 days a
      week, within the hyperbaric oxygen chamber.There will be assessments completed before
      treatment series begins, at the end of treatment, 8 months and 14 months after treatment
      begins. The primary outcome will be administered at these times as well as every two weeks
      once treatment begins until the end of the study.
