      Study evaluates the relationships between daily physical activity levels (PAL) and functional
      capacity (VO2peak) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the daily physical activity with the use of activity monitor, heart
      rate monitor and event monitor in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). These wearables
      track the heart rate, heart rhythm, tracks activity and step count. The VO2 peak will be
      measured via the exercise test.
