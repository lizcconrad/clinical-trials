      Metformin (MF), a biguanide group of anti-diabetic drug has been shown to enhance osteoblasts
      differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro, thus may exhibit a
      favourable effect on alveolar bone. Statins are one of the lipid lowering drugs that help in
      reducing cholesterol levels in the body by specifically inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
      coenzyme A reductase; which is a rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. Rosuvastatin
      (RSV) have shown to have bone stimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.Statins are one of

      Methods: Ninety patients with intrabony defects were randomly allocated into three treatment
      groups: SRP plus placebo gel (group 1), SRP plus 1.2% RSV gel (group 2) and 1% MF gel
      (group3). Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline then after 6 months.
      The gels were delivered at the respective sites at baseline . Then again all clinical and
      radiographic parameters were recorded after 6 months and 12 months.
