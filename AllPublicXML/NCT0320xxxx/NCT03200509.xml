  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity plays an important role in the management of chronic low back pain (LBP).
      Engaging in an active lifestyle is associated with a better prognosis. Nevertheless, there is
      evidence to suggest that patients with chronic LBP are less likely to meet recommended
      physical activity levels. Furthermore, while exercise therapy has been endorsed by recent
      clinical practice guidelines, evidence from systematic reviews suggests that its effect on
      pain and disability are at best moderate and not sustained over time. A limitation of current
      exercises programs for chronic LBP is that these programs are not designed to change
      patient's behaviour toward an active lifestyle. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
      investigate the short and long-term efficacy of a multimodal intervention consisting of
      supervised exercises, health coaching and use of an activity monitor (i.e. Fitbit Flex)
      compared to supervised exercises plus sham coaching and a sham activity monitor on physical
      activity levels, pain intensity and disability in patients with chronic nonspecific LBP.
