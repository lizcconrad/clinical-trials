      This is a single or up to 2 centers, double-blind, randomized, single-dose, two-way,
      crossover study comparing the Test (T) and Reference (R) products following subcutaneous
      administration. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatments sequences (TR or
      RT).

      All subjects will be dosed at the CRO's designated clinical site(s) and the same protocol
      requirements and procedures will be followed within each group.

      The current study design was prepared to assess and compare the PK, PD, safety, tolerability
      of the Adello biosimilar candidate, TPI-120 and the US-licensed reference product, Neulasta®
      after administering a single subcutaneous 2 mg dose in healthy adult subjects in a crossover
      design. The primary PK parameters are AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax, and the primary PD
      parameters are baseline-corrected AUEC0-t and Emax for ANC.
