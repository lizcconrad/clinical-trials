        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female pediatric outpatients aged 5 to 18 years old

          2. Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) confirmed by the ADOS-2 and DSM-5 criteria

          3. Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) - Irritability Subscale score of 18 or greater at
             screening visit

          4. Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) score of 66T or higher at screening visit

          5. Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S) score of 4 or higher at screening

          6. Stable pharmacologic, educational, behavioral and/or dietary interventions for 4 weeks
             prior to randomization and for the duration of the study.

          7. Physical exam and laboratory results that are within normal range for individuals with
             ASD

          8. Presence of a parent/caregiver/guardian that is able to consent for their
             participation and complete assessments regarding the child's development and behavior
             throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Exposure to any investigational agent in the 30 days prior to randomization.

          2. Prior chronic treatment with CBD, CBDV or an endocannabinoid treatment.

          3. Positive testing for THC or other drugs of abuse at the screening or baseline visits
             upon repeat confirmation testing.

          4. Lifetime history of drug abuse including marijuana/cannabis use

          5. Diagnosis of a known genetic disorder (ie. Prader-Willi Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome
             etc.)

          6. A primary psychiatric diagnosis other than ASD, including bipolar disorder, psychosis,
             schizophrenia, PTSD or MDD. These patients will be excluded due to potential
             confounding results.

          7. Pregnant or lactating patients or patients who will not agree to be abstinent or use a
             double barrier method of contraception. CBDV has not been studied in pregnant or
             lactating women.

          8. A medical condition that severely impacts the subject's ability to participate in the
             study, interferes with the conduct of the study, confounds interpretation of study
             results or endangers the subject's well-being.

          9. A known diagnosis of Rett Syndrome or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, or marked
             sensory impairment such as deafness or blindness.

         10. Subjects who have had changes in allied health therapies, behavioral or educational
             interventions within four weeks prior to randomization other than those associated
             with school holidays.

         11. Subjects who have had changes in medications or medication doses within four weeks of
             randomization.
