  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      500mg Fulvestrant (Faslodex®) in ESR1 mutated postmenopausal women with hormone receptor
      positive, HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after previous aromatase
      inhibitor therapy. Fifty patients will be enrolled and treated with 500 mg Fulvestrant until
      disease progression or study closed.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression, unless any of the criteria for treatment
      discontinuation are met first. If a patient progresses during the treatment period, the
      patient must be withdrawn from the treatment and further treatment will be at the
      investigator's discretion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be followed up for disease progression, regardless of whether they have
      discontinued treatment, unless they have withdrawn consent.

      Efficacy will be determined based on tumor assessments performed by each investigator
      according to RECIST 1.1. Safety will be monitored based on the frequency and severity of
      adverse events (AEs), as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade version 4.0.

      Tumor assessments will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) or X ray if necessary every 12 weeks for all patients until documented evidence of
      objective disease progression.

      Reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities will be done by the investigator in accordance
      with CFDA regulations.

                  oestradiol level in the postmenopausal ranges (utilizing ranges from the local
                  laboratory facility).

          3. Histological/cytological confirmation of advanced breast cancer or inoperable locally
