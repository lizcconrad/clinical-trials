  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will test a tailored web and smartphone-based application (iCanCope with SCD) to
      improve pain self-management and functioning in youth (aged 12-18) with sickle cell disease.
      The program will include goal setting, peer-based social support, and pain self-management
      training. The investigators will determine initial program effectiveness through a pilot
      three-site randomized controlled trial in 160 youth randomized to treatment compared to
      attention control.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) that promote pain self-management can lead to symptom
      reduction, improved quality of life, and decreased healthcare use. However, most people with
      SCD do not receive CBT-based treatment due to barriers such as poor accessibility, limited
      availability of professionals, and high costs. First, the investigators plan to apply a
      user-centered design approach to develop and refine the iCanCope with SCD program. Second,
      program feasibility and initial program effectiveness will be determined through a pilot
      three-site randomized controlled trial. The investigators will determine study accrual and
      dropout rates as well as levels of patient acceptability and engagement. Preliminary
      effectiveness will be determined in youth receiving treatment compared to attention control
      on a range of physical, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes assessed at post-treatment and
      6-month follow-up. Third, moderators and mediators of treatment effect will be tested by
      examining whether differences in self-efficacy and patient activation predict changes in pain
      and functioning. These results will enable a future full-scale randomized controlled trial.
