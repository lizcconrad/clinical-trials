  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate prescribing exposes patients to health risks and results in wasteful public
      expenditures. This study will evaluate an approach to fighting abusive prescription: sending
      letters to suspected potentially inappropriate prescribers warning them that they are
      outliers compared to their peers and have been flagged for review. The study will target high
      prescribers of opioids in the Schedule II controlled substances class. Two types of letters
      will be tested: one focusing on the health consequences of inappropriate prescribing for
      patients, and the other focusing on the consequences for prescribers including e.g. potential
      administrative actions. Using claims data, the investigators will assess the effect of the
      letters on prescribing of opioids, receipt of opioids by patients, substitution behavior by
      prescribers and patients, and health outcomes of patients.
