  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indigestion or dyspepsia is highly prevalent worldwide. Often these symptoms are of benign
      nature and subside without treatment, or with lifestyle interventions like dietary
      modifications. Too often, gastroscopy is performed because of dyspepsia. Although this is
      indicated when malignancy is suspected, in a substantial part of the cases the gastroscopy is
      not indicated and will not achieve clinically relevant results. It is suspected that
      gastroscopy is often used for reassurance of patients or as a 'last resort'.

      Our hypothesis is that adequate education of patients can replace this need for invasive
      measures. The aim of this study was therefore to reduce the volume of gastroscopies for
      dyspepsia, by offering patients an e-learning containing educational material on dyspepsia.

      During the trial, 400 dyspeptic patients, referred for gastroscopy by the GP, will randomly
      be divided into two groups: One group will receive the e-learning instead of gastroscopy
      (intervention), the other group will receive the gastroscopy (control).

      After a twelve week follow-up, change in symptom severity, disease specific quality of life
      and fear of disease will be compared between the two groups.

      Rationale: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as dyspepsia without alarm symptoms,
      are highly prevalent in the general population. Lifestyle modifications and medication can
      reduce symptoms in most patients. Guidelines state that oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is
      only indicated in a selected high risk group. In spite of these guidelines, OGD referrals for
      dyspepsia without alarm symptoms are still substantial, subjecting patients to unnecessary
      risks and causing a burden on healthcare costs and endoscopic capacity. Therefore a strategy
      is needed to reduce the volume of OGDs in dyspepsia without alarm symptoms.

      Objective: To evaluate the clinical use of a patient-centred, education based, clinical
      strategy to reduce the volume of endoscopies for dyspepsia in patients over 18 years of age
      without alarm symptoms, referred for OGD through open-access endoscopy compared to usual
      care.

      Study design: A multicentre, randomised, controlled superiority trial, with two parallel arms
      and a primary endpoint of the percentage of patients receiving OGD. Intervention and usual
      care will be compared.

      Study population: 414 Patients, aged 18 years or above, with upper GI symptoms without alarm
      symptoms, referred for open-access OGD.

      Intervention: Patients will be offered e-learning instead of endoscopy. The e-learning will
      contain educational material and questionnaires. Questionnaire data will be extracted from
      the e-learning.

      Main study endpoints: The main study endpoint is the difference in proportion of patients
      receiving OGD between both arms and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROMS), after a follow-up of
      12 weeks.
