  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current proposal the investigators seek to evaluate the acute and short-term effects
      of mango intake on vascular and platelet function in postmenopausal women between 50 and 70
      years old.

      Our aims are 1) to determine if two weeks of daily mango intake will result in favorable
      changes in measures of vascular function, as measured using peripheral arterial tonometry
      (PAT) and platelet reactivity, in overweight and obese postmenopausal women. 2) to determine
      if two weeks of daily mango intake will change the fermentation capacity of gut microbiota.

      Investigators hypothesize that the daily intake of 330 grams of mango (2 cups) will
      significantly increase PAT while reducing platelet aggregation after 2 hours and two weeks of
      daily intake.
