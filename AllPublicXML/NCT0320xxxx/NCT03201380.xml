  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease the care of which varies according to the
      status: localized, locally advanced, or in recurrence after local or metastatic treatment.
      The precise evaluation of the degree of extension of the disease is thus essential because it
      is going to allow to adapt at best the therapeutic strategy.

      Contrary to the abdomino-pelvic scanning and to the osseous scintigraphy which(who) are a
      member(part) of the balance assessment of standard extension of the prostate cancer, the
      place of the Tomography with broadcast of Positrons to scan (TEP scan) in Choline in the
      management of patients affected by prostate cancer is not clearly defined in the national and
      European recommendations.

      The current marketing authorization ( AMM) is the research for bones localizations in the
      prostatic cancers at high risk. It indeed seems that this examination is more successful than
      the standard radiological examinations (bone scintigraphy and abdomino-pelvic scanning) in
      the detection of the bone metastatic hurts, with a sensibility of about 100 % and a precision
      of the order of 93 % according to certain studies.

      The recent data of the literature suggest a quite particular interest at the patients in
      situation of biochemical recurrence in terms of localization of (or) tumoral site (s).

      THE AMM however not specifying if this examination has to be made within the framework of the
      initial balance sheet of extension, at the time of the biochemical second offense or at the
      known metastatic stage, there is a big variability of the practices according to the centers.

      The current indications being very ill-assorted, he is interesting being able to estimate the
      heterogeneousness of the practices of way multicentre, by leading a study observationally
      retrospective in region Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (PACA).
