  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death worldwide. However
      smoking is a very difficult addiction to break whereby main reasons for not quitting or
      relapsing after cessation are the nicotine withdrawal syndrome and post-cessational weight
      gain. GLP-1 analogues are well known to stimulate insulin secretion and to reduce energy
      intake and therefore body weight. Recent findings from animal and human studies suggest a
      role of GLP-1 in the pathophysiology of addiction. The putative role of GLP-1 analogues in
      nicotine reward regulation combined with its weight reducing effects might be of major
      interest in view of novel pharmacotherapeutic options for smoking cessation.

      Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death worldwide. However
      smoking is a very difficult addiction to break and despite established smoking cessation
      programs quit rates are low, especially in the real-life setting. The main reasons for not
      quitting or relapsing after cessation are the nicotine withdrawal syndrome and
      post-cessational weight gain. GLP-1 analogues are well known to stimulate insulin secretion
      and to reduce energy intake and therefore body weight. Recent findings from animal and human
      studies suggest a role of GLP-1 in the pathophysiology of addiction. The putative role of
      GLP-1 analogues in nicotine reward regulation combined with its weight reducing effects might
      be of major interest in view of novel pharmacotherapeutic options for smoking cessation.
