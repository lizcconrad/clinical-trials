  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if systematic cognitive training can improve
      cognitive performance in participants (55 and older) with memory loss. This study will
      evaluate the effects of Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) for improvement in everyday
      cognitive and function status, in addition to long-term changes in brain networks over an
      18-month period. Although there is no distribution of medication for this study, participants
      are required to have an at-home computer.

      In this clinical trial, investigators will evaluate if systematic cognitive training can
      improve cognitive performance in participants with memory loss. This study is for those who
      have demonstrated difficulty with memory. It will evaluate the effects of Computerized
      Cognitive Training (CCT) for improvement in everyday cognitive and function status, in
      addition to long-term changes in brain networks over an 18-month period. In this study,
      participants will be randomly assigned to Training Group 1 or 2; therefore, one will have a
      50% chance of being assigned to CCT, and a 50% chance of being assigned to Crossword Puzzle
      Training (CPT). During the 18- month period, participants will be asked to come to the Memory
      Disorders Clinic at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) for a screening
      evaluation, and if eligible, will return for five follow-up visits at Weeks 12, 32, 52, and
      78.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females 55 to 95 years of age (inclusive) at the time of informed consent.

          2. Subjective cognitive complaints, i.e., memory or other cognitive complaints, e.g.,
             naming/language.

          3. Meets criteria for cognitive impairment (CI) defined as scores &gt; 1 below standardized
             norms on memory function as identified by the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) III Logical
             Memory immediate or delayed recall score.

          4. Folstein Mini Mental State (MMSE) score ≥ 23 out of 30.

          5. A family member or other individual who is in contact with the patient and consents to
             serve as informant during the study; this can be a telephone informant in the case of
             patients who do not have a live-in informant or close significant other.

          6. Access to a home desktop or laptop computer at acceptable internet speed for the study
             duration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of dementia of any type.

          2. Current clinical evidence of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, major
             depression, psychosis, or bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV criteria).

          3. Active suicidal ideation or plan.

          4. Current or recent (past 6 months) alcohol or substance use disorder (DSM-5 criteria).

          5. Clinical stroke with residual neurological deficits. While we will not exclude
             patients with cerebrovascular disease, we will not include patients who have had a
             stroke with residual clinical deficits because it is not clear that this type of
             patient is similar to the MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) patient generally, and
             clear-cut neurological impairment, e.g., hemiplegia/hemiparesis or speech impairment,
             may compromise the patient's ability to do the CCT or active control procedures and to
             complete the neuropsychological test battery.

          6. Use of medications known to have a negative impact on cognition: benzodiazepines in
             lorazepam equivalents greater than or equal to 1 mg daily, narcotics,
             anticholinergics. Other patients receive medications that may be associated with
             cognitive impairment but are rarely considered the likely etiology, e.g.,
             theophylline, nifedipine, beta blockers; they will not be excluded. Patients receiving
             other psychotropic medications not expected to have a material impact on cognition,
             e.g., SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) and SNRIs
             (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) will be eligible.

          7. Presence of any of the following disorders: a) Central Nervous System infection, with
             cerebrospinal fluid evidence of meningitis, encephalitis, or other infectious process;
             b) dementia of any type; c) Huntington's disease; d) Multiple sclerosis; e)
             Parkinson's disease; f) Other neurologic disorders with focal signs, e.g., amyotrophic
             lateral sclerosis; g) Mental retardation.

          8. Acute, severe unstable medical illness. For cancer, acutely ill patients (including
             those with metastases) will be excluded, but past history of successfully treated
             cancer will not result in exclusion.

          9. Contraindication to MRI scan: pacemaker, metal implants following surgery, any other
             contraindication to MRI. Eligibility for the MRI scan is a requirement for the study.

         10. UPSIT (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) exclusions: current
             smoker &gt; 1 pack daily, current upper respiratory infection (retested as soon as the
             infection clears). UPSIT scores are reduced in schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and
             Parkinson's related conditions; these disorders are exclusion criteria for this study.
             Patients with UPSIT exclusions, e.g., current heavy smoker (less than 3% of older
             adults in our experience), will not receive the UPSIT but will continue to participate
             in all other aspects of the study.

         11. Patients lacking English-speaking ability as determined by self-report and clinical
             evaluation.

         12. Regular online brain training or regular crossword puzzle user, defined as doing these
             procedures at a frequency of twice weekly or greater during the year prior to
             screening. Eligible participants who join the trial are instructed not to do these
             procedures on their own during the trial, i.e., independent of the study.

         13. Participation in another intervention trial for cognitive impairment.
