      To ascertain the risk factors of AA in ZheJiang Province of China at the moment, especially
      the comprehensive multiple factors risks. The author conducted a case-control research
      included 338 AA cases and 1464 controls. Subjects were surveyed using same standard
      questionnaire including personal data, past histories of diseases, family history and
      histories of occupational and daily exposure to harmful substances. Single and multiple
      Logistic regression analyses were made using SPSS17.0 on the dates to study potential factors
      in the development of AA.
