    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) on
      prefrontal metabolism and hemodynamics in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). The subjects will receive six TILS interventions and one sham intervention in a
      course of seven weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often associated with cognitive impairments. It has
      been indicated that hypoactivity of the prefrontal cortex plays a major role in the disrupted
      neural circuitry of mood and cognition.

      Transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) is a neural type of photobiomodulation that
      can elevate neuronal metabolism by exciting cytochrome c oxidase (CCO). Veterans with PTSD
      will receive prefrontal TILS interventions once-per-week for six weeks. They will also
      receive an additional sham intervention (laser power = 0) that will be randomly assigned into
      the first two sessions. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (bbNIRS) will be used to
      directly assess the CCO changes during every TILS/sham session.

      Veterans' prefrontal functions will be evaluated with three short-term memory tasks before
      and after each intervention. The prefrontal activities will also be imaged by functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to objectively assess the functional changes due to
      TILS/sham interventions.

    <description>Six weekly sessions of TILS. The TILS will consist of applying light of a specific wavelength (1064 nm) using a laser diode supplied by Cell Gen Therapeutics, LLC (CG-5000 laser, HD Laser Center, Dallas, TX, USA). Each session will consist of totally 8 minutes, with eight 1-min cycles alternating between two locations on the right forehead. The laser power will be 3.4 Watts.</description>

    <description>One weekly session of sham. The sham session will be randomly assigned into the first two intervention visits. The sham will consist of using the same CG-5000 laser for totally 8 minutes, with eight 1-min cycles alternating between two locations on the right forehead. However, the laser power will be turned to be 0 Watts. Therefore the sham session will generate same instrumental sound as TILS, but the subjects won't receive any actual laser illumination.</description>
