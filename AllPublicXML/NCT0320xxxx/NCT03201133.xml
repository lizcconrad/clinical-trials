  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a multifactorial pathology characterized by diffuse
      retropatellar and peripatellar pain in the knee joint, exacerbated by overloading activities
      on the patellofemoral joint. However, this disease showed high degree of patients not
      responsive to therapeutic strategies. This condition occurred because several factors is
      related to disease such as: (1) proximal factors (involving trunk and hip), (2) local factors
      (surrounding and or within the patellofemoral joint) and (3) distal factors (involving ankle
      and foot). Thus, the identification of clinical subgroups based in anatomic changes
      (proximal, local and distal factors) is a recent strategy that could help in the therapeutic
      strategies focused on the etiology of the disease, improve responsiveness to treatment,
      clinical and functional benefits.
