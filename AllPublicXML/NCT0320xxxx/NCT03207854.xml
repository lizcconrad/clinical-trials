    <textblock>
      This research trial collects and stores blood, tissue, and bone marrow specimens from
      patients with cancer or blood disorders, and healthy volunteers to study the immune system in
      a variety of different types of experiments, as well as associated clinical data as
      appropriate, focused on understanding mechanisms of immunotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. Identify changes in immune system parameters in patients receiving
      immunotherapies (including immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunostimulatory/immunomodulatory
      agents, cellular therapies, stem cell transplantation) and compare to changes in patients
      receiving conventional chemotherapy, targeted-agent therapy, and healthy normal volunteers
      using multiparameter flow cytometry, time-of-flight mass cytometry, cytokine quantification,
      functional analysis of immune cell subsets isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting
      (FACS), and genetic and proteomic techniques (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] sequencing,
      ribonucleic acid sequence [RNASeq], reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR],
      Western blot).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Optimize methods for measuring functional status of circulating immune cells and
      hematopoietic progenitors (activation, inhibition, cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity).

      II. Use genetic and epigenetic techniques to a) study clonal diversity in T cell subsets b)
      determine the genetic basis for T cell immune reconstitution following stem cell
      transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and healthy normal volunteers undergo collection of peripheral blood samples for
      analysis via flow cytometry, RNASeq, immunohistochemistry, cytometry by time of flight
      (CyTOF) experiments, cell cultures, and functional studies of immune cell subsets obtained by
      FACS. Patients also undergo collection of bone marrow and leukopheresis/leukoreduction
      specimens, and single cell suspensions and bulk excised tumor biopsies are obtained from
      routine testing for analysis via immunohistochemistry or CyTOF.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients known to have cancer, an immune-mediated hematologic diagnosis, or a
             healthy normal volunteer

          -  Definition of immune-mediated hematologic diagnosis: diagnoses for which immune
             dysfunction and/or immune system directed therapy (eg. aplastic anemia, autoimmune
             hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP], etc.) are involved

          -  Definition of healthy normal volunteer: persons lacking diagnoses of any type of
             cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, non-hematologic autoimmune disease (eg.
             systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis [RA], Crohn's disease) and
             not taking any immunosuppressive medications

          -  Patients must have been seen in the Norris Hospital and outpatient clinics, or the Los
             Angeles County (LAC)-University of Southern California (USC) Medical Center or
             outpatient clinics; healthy volunteers can be recruited without any physician visit
             appointments since their labs are strictly for clinical research and not for personal
             health issues unrelated to the project

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status

          -  Persons taking any type of immunosuppressive medication are excluded from
             participating as healthy normal volunteers

          -  Any patient for whom specimen collection is judged to be unsafe (for example, for
             patients unable to establish venous access)
