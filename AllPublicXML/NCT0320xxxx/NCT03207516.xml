  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, randomised crossover study, two sourdough croissants (SC) or two brewer's
      yeast croissants (BC) were served to 17 (9 F; Age range 18-40; BMI range 18-24 kg/m2) healthy
      subjects to evaluate the effects of their ingestion on postprandial gastrointestinal
      functions. Hydrogen breath test was performed to measure H2 production after SC and BC
      ingestion. Gastric volume was evaluated by Magnetic Resonance(MR) Imaging to calculate
      gastric emptying rate in the 3-hour interval following croissant ingestion. Palatability and
      postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms and perceptions over a 4-h period after the meal were
      evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS). In addition, in the 3-hour interval, blood samples
      were drawn to measure serum glucose levels. The area under the curve (AUC) was employed to
      evaluate global kinetics of all parameters and the T-test was used to evaluate differences
      between groups.

      In this monocentric study, a double-blind, randomised crossover design was used, with washout
      periods of at least one week between study days. A standardized meal consisting of two 100 g
      croissants prepared with sourdough or with brewer's yeast was administered randomly to 17 (9
      F; Age range 18-40; BMI range 18-24 kg/m2) healthy subjects after an overnight fast (at least
      8 h) and consumed in a 10-minute interval with 300 mL of water. Immediately after meal
      ingestion, subjects were asked to evaluate croissant palatability. Gastric volume was
      evaluated by Magnetic Resonance(MR) Imaging to calculate gastric emptying rate in the 3-hour
      interval following croissant ingestion. Hydrogen breath test was performed to assess
      gastrointestinal fermentation measuring H2 production after SC and BC ingestion. Postprandial
      gastrointestinal symptoms and perceptions over a 4-h period after the meal were evaluated by
      visual analogue scale (VAS). In addition, in the 3-hour interval, blood samples were drawn to
      measure serum glucose levels. The protocol was repeated twice in each subject, once with
      sourdough croissants (SC) and once with brewer's yeast croissants (BC), dispensed according
      to a computer generated randomisation list created by RC following simple randomisation
      procedures (computerized random numbers). The area under the curve (AUC) was employed to
      evaluate global kinetics of all parameters and the T-test was used to evaluate differences
      between groups.
