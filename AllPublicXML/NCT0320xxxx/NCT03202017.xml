  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of two treatment techniques called
      Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) and Lung Volume Recruitment (LVR) on breathing,
      swallowing, speech, and cough function in persons with mild to moderate ALS. Half of the
      participants will do EMST alone, and the other half of the participants will do EMST and LVR.

    <description>EMST is a treatment method that has been used to improve cough function and swallowing in ALS. EMST uses a training device that has a valve set to 50% of a patient's maximum expiratory pressure (MEP). The patient exhales forcefully until the valve releases. Patients perform 5 sets of 5 repetitions a day, 5 days a week.</description>

LVR is a technique to increase cough function that is performed with a resuscitation bag fitted with a mouthpiece and a one-way valve. The bag is used to expand the lungs, after which the patient makes a voluntary cough.</description>
