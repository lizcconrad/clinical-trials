  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide that has been proposed as an alternative therapeutic
      option in patients with prosthetic joint infection caused by Staphylococcus or Enterococcus
      species in the latest Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.

      The population pharmacokinetics (PK) of daptomycin have been described in various groups of
      patients in previous publications. However, little information exists on the PK of daptomycin
      in patients with bone and joint infections (BJI). Also, previous population studies did not
      investigate daptomycin PK over prolonged therapy, and, to our knowledge, no study has
      reported the intraindividual PK variability of this drug.

      The aim of this study is to describe the inter- and intraindividual PK variability of this
      drug.
