    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies radiofrequency technology in locating non-palpable breast
      lesions in patients undergoing surgery. Placing a miniature radiofrequency tag or microchip
      in the breast lesion before surgery and using a handheld device to guide doctors during
      surgery may improve surgical outcomes in patients with non-palpable breast lesions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility of utilizing a new Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared
      radiofrequency tag for localization of non-palpable breast lesions and provide preliminary
      data for a larger study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo mammogram or ultrasound for image-guided placement of the radiofrequency tag
      within 30 days of surgery and then undergo radiofrequency-guided localization during surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 2 weeks.
