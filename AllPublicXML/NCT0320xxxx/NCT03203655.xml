  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic populations in the US are dis-proportionally affected by high rates of obesity and
      diabetes; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Latinos are the
      minority group with the second-highest obesity prevalence in adults. In comparison to the
      general female population (61.2%), Mexican American women (73%) have a greater overweight or
      obese percentage. In addition, more than 50% of Hispanic men and women are expected to
      develop type-2 diabetes over their lifetime, compared to 40% among whites. Hispanics are also
      50% more likely to die from diabetes compared to whites. In many cases Hispanic populations
      do not have the knowledge, self-confidence and resources to participate in mainstream
      physical activity and nutrition interventions, which are usually geared towards the general
      population without considering cultural and linguistic differences.

      Information and communication technologies in the form of Internet and mobile phone access
      have grown enormously during the past decade; these technologies have the potential to affect
      food intake and physical activity as well as weight loss. Approximately 95% of countries have
      mobile telephone networks and about 70% of people worldwide use mobile phones.

      CareMessage is a Google-backed 501(c)3 nonprofit technology organization based in San
      Francisco that uses 'smart' text and voice messaging to enable clinical staff to provide
      automated yet personalized support to patients struggling with chronic conditions. The
      CareMessage™ Adult Obesity texting program adapts the Health Belief Model by strategically
      implementing behavioral concepts to help improve self-efficacy.

      The investigators will pilot test its effectiveness among a sample of Hispanic women who are
      at risk of obesity and diabetes by sending a culturally-sensitive and
      linguistically-appropriate text-based message three to 5 times a week, encouraging lifestyle
      modifications (diet and exercise education and behavior modification).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will collect data on 40 obese (Body Mass Index 30-45) Hispanic women ages
      21 to 65 years. The purpose of this research study is to test the efficacy of a mobile phone
      text message-based intervention on weight loss.

      After verifying eligibility and enrolling in the study, participants will come to Washington
      University School of Medicine, at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and fill out some questionnaires.
      The investigators will perform a brief exam that measures the lean and fat tissue using Dual
      Energy x-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) technology and will also do a modified 3-hour oral glucose
      tolerance test (MOGTT).

      Participants will wear an accelerometer (activity monitor) over a 7-day period at the
      beginning (before being randomized and enrolled in the intervention) and at the end of the
      study.

      Half of the participants will be randomized to the intervention group. The intervention group
      will be enrolled in the CareMessage™ Adult Obesity texting program, which sends a text
      message 3 to 5 times a week, encouraging lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise
      education, and behavioral strategies) that can lead to healthy weight loss. The control group
      will receive an initial talk about weight loss but will not be enrolled in any program or
      intervention.

      After six months have passed, participants will return to Washington University School of
      Medicine, regardless of the group they were assigned to, for two final visits (a short one,
      to pick up another activity monitor seven days before the study ends, and a longer visit, to
      do some final testing and fill out some questionnaires).
