  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coverage of the diabetes is a multidisciplinary care, with practitioners'
      implication(hospital and liberal), and other medical and paramedical profession: doctor,
      pharmacist, male nurse, nutritionist, etc. In fact there is a real importance of link between
      hospital and general medecine outside. That's why the pharmacist's presence during the
      hospitalization seems to be a good alternative to make the link between hospital and the
      outside pharmacist where patient take his treatment.

      Hospital pharmacis proceed to a treatment conciliation at the entrance and at discharge.

      By this conciliation the aim of the study is to show and quantify the impact of pharmacist
      presence on therapeutic target .
