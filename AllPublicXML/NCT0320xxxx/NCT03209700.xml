      This study is an extension to re-treat partial and non-responders from the previously
      approved Phase 1 MCS-AFP protocols IRB #12-009716 (Crohn's Disease perianal fistulas) and
      15-003200 (cryptoglandular perianal fistulas).

      This study is an extension to re-treat partial and non-responders from the previously
      approved Phase 1 MCS-AFP protocols IRB #12-009716 (Crohn's Disease perianal fistulas) and
      15-003200 (cryptoglandular perianal fistulas). This study will enroll patients that have
      persistent symptomatic perianal disease despite being treated with an MSC coated fistula
      plug, and also treat patients that have had recurrence of their perianal fistula.

      As per the previously approval treatment under IND 15356, patients will have a single
      affected fistula treated, which is the same fistula that was treated in the original
      protocol. The matrix for delivering the cells is a Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug.

      Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified subjects will
      be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1;
      Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessment will be made if an EUA is
      clinically necessary to assess the fistula. As this is a re-treatment trial, patients with
      incomplete response to initial plug placement typically have close follow up, recent MRI
      imaging, and may have a seton in place. If an EUA is clinically indicated, this would be by a
      colorectal surgeon for drainage of sepsis and placement of a seton as part of the standard
      clinical care for perianal fistula.

      Patients will return on: Day 1, Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24.
