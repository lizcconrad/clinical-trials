  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will be conducted in patients 18-75 years of age with multiple coronary
      artery disease risk factors (antiplatelet naïve patients) and patients with prior MI or PVD
      on antiplatelet therapy. Pharmacodynamics will be assessed at multiple time points to assess
      onset-, maintenance-, and offset-effect of vorapaxar on thrombin generation, platelet
      reactivity, and plasma/platelet endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers. Safety assessment
      will be assessed throughout the study.

             significant hazard to the subject if investigational therapy were initiated, or (b)
             would limit the prognosis of the subject, regardless of investigational therapy.
