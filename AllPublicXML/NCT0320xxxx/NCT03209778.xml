      Patients with schizophrenia suffer from autobiographical memory disorders. Patients have
      difficulty to remember vividly personal past events when they are specifically asked for.
      Indeed, this task requires a good executive functioning to retrieve precise information
      stored in long term memory. Interestingly, executive functioning has been showed impaired in
      schizophrenia and studies showed that their autobiographical memory impairments were directed
      related to their executive dysfunction.

      Yet, in daily life people remember more often autobiographical memories spontaneously,
      without trying voluntarily to recall them.

      In that case, the involuntary recall of personal past events is much less sustained by
      executive functioning.

      In this protocol the investigators would like to investigate and compare subjective
      characteristics of involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memories in order to highlight
      the role of executive dysfunction in patients' autobiographical memory impairments.
