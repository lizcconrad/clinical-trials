  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important risk factor for HPV
      infection and the development of HPV-associated lesions in female and male anogenital tract.
      Data on safety and immunogenicity of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in
      HIV-infected population are few. The present study is a non-randomized controlled clinical
      trial with the primary objective to determine safety ad immunogenicity of quadrivalent human
      papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil®) in HIV-infected female and male adolescents and young
      adults.
