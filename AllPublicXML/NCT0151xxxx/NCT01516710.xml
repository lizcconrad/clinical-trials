  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare outcomes of laparoscopic versus open liver resection
      for colorectal metastases in a prospective and randomized study. The study will include all
      non-anatomic liver resections in our institution.

      The primary end point is that the use of laparoscopic technique significantly can reduce the
      frequency of complications to liver resection. Secondary end points are 5-year survival,
      immediate surgical outcomes, quality of life and degree of impairment of the immune system.

    <description>This study aims to compare major intraoperative and postoperative parameters in patients randomized to either laparoscopic or open liver resection. Pre- and perioperative events relevant for surgical outcomes will be registered. The following intraoperative parameters will be compared: operative time, blood loss, blood transfusion, while intraoperative incidents will be classified according to the Satava classification. Morbidity within the first 30 days is the primary outcome (morbidity, yes/no), and will be classified and analysed according to the validated classification for postoperative morbidity as described by Dindo et al, by the Accordion system and by the Comprehensive Complication Index</description>
