      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of NanoDOX™ Hydrogel in conjunction with
      serial wound debridement and irrigation on the healing rates of open traumatic orthopedic and
      soft tissue wounds when compared to a serial wound debridement and irrigation alone in
      patients receiving negative pressure wound therapy/vacuum assisted closure (NPWT/VAC) with
      reticulated open cell foam (ROCF) dressings.
