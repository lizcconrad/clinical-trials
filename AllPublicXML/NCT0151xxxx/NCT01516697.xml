    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that continuously measuring stroke volume (SV) and cardiac
      output (CO) will 1) reveal hemodynamic instability in a timely manner and alert the physician
      promptly, 2) provide information for the physician to make the differential diagnosis as to
      whether the hemodynamic instability was due to vasodilatation or reduction of venous blood
      return, and 3) lead to appropriate and prompt treatment to improve patient outcome.

      -determine the SV and CO and their kinetic change using ICON® to establish a hemodynamic
      profile of the patient under spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. To determine if using
      instantaneous measurements of SV and CO to guide patient management improves hemodynamic
      stability.
