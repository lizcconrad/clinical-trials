      To determine if erlotinib given orally along with concurrent whole brain irradiation in lung
      cancer patients with brain metastases improves median overall survival and enhances local
      control compared to those treated with WBRT alone, without significantly increasing the risk
      of side effects or lowering quality of life.

      Endpoints

      Primary:

      â€¢ To determine if erlotinib given orally along with concurrent WBRT in lung cancer patients
      with brain metastases, improves median overall survival compared to those treated with WBRT
      alone.

      Secondary:

        -  To confirm the safety profile of erlotinib along with concurrent WBRT, in the context of
           treating central nervous system malignancies.

        -  To evaluate if erlotinib along with concurrent WBRT increases local control rate as
           measured by MRI at 8 weeks, compared to WBRT alone.

        -  To evaluate if erlotinib along with concurrent WBRT increases time to neurologic
           progression of disease based on neuropsychological assessment at baseline, at 8 and 20
           weeks after WBRT.

        -  To evaluate quality of life parameters in patients treated with WBRT alone vs
           concomitant erlotinib and WBRT

        -  To evaluate if mutation status has impact on the above mentioned parameters Trial design
           Open multicenter randomized phase II trial. Patients Patients &gt; 18 years with
           histologically confirmed NSCLC and brain metastases verified on either CT or MRI, not
           eligible for neurosurgery or stereotactic radiation therapy.

      Trial treatment Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either treatment arm A or B.

        -  Arm A: WBRT 3 Gy x10 alone.

        -  Arm B: WBRT 3 Gy x10 and erlotinib given concomitantly, 150 mg p.o. daily from the day
           before radiation, until the last day of radiation.

      Number of patients 150 patients will be included, 75 in each arm

        Inclusion Criteria: Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced non-small cell lung
        cancer (NSCLC) meeting 1 of the following criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed multiple brain metastases not suitable for first-line chemotherapy

          -  Relapsed NSCLC with newly diagnosed multiple brain metastases

          -  Relapsed NSCLC after second-line or more chemotherapy regimens with newly diagnosed
             multiple brain metastases

               -  Diagnosis of brain metastases confirmed by MRI (or CT if MRI is not
                  available/possible) within the past 4 weeks
