  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In bowel preparation using split dose PEG, various adjuncts to colonic cleansing were
      proposed to improve colonic preparation cleansing. Prokinetics, as an adjunct, was included
      in a few studies. The investigators study was to show that sufficient dosage of prokinetics
      added to split dose of PEG improves the state of bowel preparation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, prospective, endoscopist-blinded clinical trial in which the efficacy
      of prokinetics coadministrated with split dose PEG on the bowel cleansing was inspected.

      Endoscopists, who were blinded to the study group of the patient, immediately completed the
      Ottawa scale and the fluidity scale after procedure
