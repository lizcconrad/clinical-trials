  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for men with metastatic CRPC in 2010 following progression on docetaxel
      is cabazitaxel or abiraterone acetate/prednisone. Based on results from two other studies,
      cabazitaxel and prednisone has become a standard second line chemotherapy regimen and becomes
      the backbone upon which to improve upon. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to
      determine the recommended dose of tasquinimod in combination with cabazitaxel and prednisone
      based on safety and tolerability in men with chemorefractory metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (CRPC).
