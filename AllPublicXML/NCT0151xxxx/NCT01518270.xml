    <measure>Eyelash Thickness as Measured by Digital Image Analysis (DIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs were taken of the eyelashes. Eyelash thickness/fullness was assessed across both eyes as an average of the 3 preset areas measured in millimeters squared (mm^2).</description>

    <measure>Eyelash Darkness as Measured by Digital Image Analysis (DIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs were taken of the Eyelashes. Eyelash darkness (intensity) was measured within the spline (a narrow area approximately 5 pixels wide that bisects the area of interest). Eyelash darkness was measured in both eyes and averaged for analysis using a scale where 0=black and 255=white.</description>
