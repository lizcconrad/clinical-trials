    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determinate the feasibility of the Laparoscopic Sleeve
      Gastrectomy, a bariatric surgery i.e. a surgery as a treatment for obesity, could be proposed
      as a Day-Case surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the patients with morbid obesity
      requiring a surgical approach by Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy could be operated according
      to a &quot;day-case surgery&quot; modality.

      The sequence of this study is the following:

        1. patients consultation for bariatric management: during this consultation, the
           investigator is looking for exclusion criteria and prescribes laboratory tests.

        2. medical records of each patient are reviewed by an obesity-related staff: Laparoscopic
           Sleeve Gastrectomy is proposed.

        3. during a second consultation, the surgeon informed the patient about the proposition of
           the staff and his potential inclusion in this study

        4. after obtained his consent, the surgical procedure is planned and Laparoscopic Sleeve
           Gastrectomy is done in the Day-Case Surgery Unit.

        5. the following day the surgery, a nurse calls the patient to identify a potential
           postoperative outcome (nausea, vomiting, uncontrolled pain...)

        6. the 8th postoperative day, a consultation is done with laboratory tests and dietary
           follow-up.

        7. follow-up consultations are scheduled at 3, 6 and 12 months to evaluate the efficiency
           of the surgery procedure.
