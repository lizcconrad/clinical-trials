  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if 14 weeks of pazopanib therapy prior to surgery
      (nephrectomy) is of benefit to patients with metastatic renal cancer. Ninety-five patients
      will be recruited into his study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label study evaluating pre-operative pazopanib treatment in
      previously untreated patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancer. This study follows a
      Simon 2 stage design

      Patients will take pazopanib for 14 weeks followed by a nephrectomy. The drug will continue
      after nephrectomy until disease progression is documented. Patients will come off study once
      disease progression occurs, where they will then be followed for survival. Subsequent
      treatment at the discretion of the treating physician will be documented.

      After surgery, all patients will be radiologically evaluated 8 weekly until progression.
      Standard radical nephrectomy with lymph node dissection will be performed on those patients
      who are deemed operable. The surgery can be laparoscopic or open. Those not deemed suitable
      for nephrectomy after 14 weeks of treatment will be offered a repeat biopsy.

        The study population for this trial are patients with confirmed clear cell carcinoma with
        measurable metastases on CT/MRI imaging (by RECIST). Only a component of clear cell is
        required.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathologically confirmed clear cell carcinoma with measurable metastases on
             CT/MRI imaging (by RECIST v1.1). Only a component of clear cell is required.

               -  No prior systemic treatment or nephrectomy for RCC. Palliative radiotherapy is
                  acceptable to non target lesions.

               -  Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:

                  i. Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x uln (patients with gilbert's disease exempt) ii.
                  Serum transaminases (ALT) &lt;3 x uln iii. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;30ml/min
                  iv. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/mm3 without growth factor support v.
                  Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3

               -  Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or
                  legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all the pertinent aspects
                  of the trial prior to enrolment.

                  abnormality that would in the judgement of the investigator, impart excess risk
                  associated with study participation or study drug administration, or which, in
                  the judgement of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry
