      In this study the investigators will examine the Feeding Dynamic Intervention (FDI) as a tool
      to prevent obesity in young children. The purpose of the intervention is to improving
      caregiver feeding practices, child eating behaviors, and child self-regulation of energy
      intake in the short term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a significant public health problem. In the last three decade, there has
      been a marked increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity. Currently, 23% of preschoolers
      (2-5 years) in the United States are overweight or obese, a critical period to target in
      hopes of reversing this trend. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a novel
      obesity intervention program for preschool-aged children. Emerging consensus indicates that
      excessive, intrusive, overt control in feeding or a chaotic non-structured feeding
      environment are risk factors for childhood obesity. The 2007 Expert Committee Recommendations
      on the Prevention, Assessment, and Treatment of Childhood Obesity specifically identified
      maternal feeding practices as important, categorically stating there is consistent evidence
      to support &quot;avoiding overly restrictive feeding behaviors.&quot; The guidelines emerged from a
      growing body of literature indicating that overly controlling caregiver feeding behaviors, in
      particular, significantly increase children's obesity risk.

      Despite the evidence for the importance of feeding dynamics, no childhood obesity
      interventions focused on this area have been rigorously tested. The Feeding Dynamic
      Intervention (FDI) is a 12-week educational intervention. The intervention will be delivered
      in a closed group setting and will consist of 6 intervention sessions lasting 90 minutes
      each. We will recruit 84 mothers with 3- to 5-year-old obese children, randomly assigned to
      either the FDI or a comparison to a waiting list control group (WLG). At the end of the 6
      month study we will assess knowledge and behavioral changes between the groups on (i)
      maternal self-reported feeding practices; (ii) improving energy compensation (COMPX),
      decreasing Eating in the Absence of Hunger (EAH) and increasing mother-reported satiety
      responsiveness in their child. Finally, we will investigate an exploratory hypothesis that
      children in the FDI group, compared to children in the wait-list control group, will
      demonstrate a lower increase in body mass index (BMI) z-score over 6 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The child is between ages 3-5 years (36 to 71 months). [Note if a family has more than
             one qualifying child we will choose the child with the lower CEBQ SR score and if they
             are equal we will randomly select the target child for the study dyad.]

          -  Child's body mass index &gt; 85th percentile for age and sex

          -  This will be calculated based on age, weight and height using the Center for Healthy
             Weight and Nutrition BMI calculator [if mother is unsure of the weight and height ask
             whether she has been told her child is overweight or obese by the PCP]

          -  Child has significantly abnormal parent-reported impairment of energy regulation
             (Rating of 2.8 or lower on the CEB-Q).

          -  The mother is fluent in English (measures are limited to English at this time)

          -  Mother (or female caregiver) has primary legal and physical custody of the child and
             is primarily responsible for feeding the child. Specifically the child is not in a
             non-parental home daycare more than 20 hours/week. Structured child care centers are
             not included in this limitation because they use structure care and feeding techniques
             similar to those taught in the FeeDIn Program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child has a medical condition or takes a medication that affects appetite, eating, or
             growth;

          -  Child has food allergies or dietary restrictions that interfere with feeding or the
             study tests (i.e., milk, gluten and eggs?)

          -  Child has any developmental or behavioral diagnosis that might affect his/her ability
             to respond to a behaviorally-based intervention, e.g., cognitive impairment, language
             delay, or autism.
