    <textblock>
      Approximately 30,000 babies annually are born with extremely low birth weight (ELBW) in the
      US. These babies often have motor and/or visual problems when they grow up. It is very
      important to identify high risk ELBW infants as early as possible, so that the investigators
      can treat them earlier to prevent poor development. Neurological examination at early age is
      not good enough to identify high risk ELBW infants. One the other hand, some magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) methods such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state
      functional MRI (rfMRI) have shown great sensitivity to brain injury which may cause motor and
      visual problems. Therefore, the investigators propose to use DTI and rfMRI on ELBW infants at
      a very early age to predict longâˆ’term outcome and to identify infants who are at high risk of
      having motor and/or visual problems when they grow up.
