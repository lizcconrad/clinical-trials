    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MK-6096 versus placebo
      for preventing migraines in participants with episodic migraine. After a 28-day Screening
      period during which baseline number of monthly migraine days was assessed, participants were
      randomized to receive MK-6096 or placebo for a 12-week Treatment Period. Participants who
      completed all 12 weeks of the Treatment Period received drug or placebo for an additional 2
      weeks in the Run-out Period. Treatment assignment in the Run-out Period was determined at the
      initial randomization. In the Run-out Period, participants who received placebo in the
      Treatment Period continued to receive placebo and participants who received MK-6096 in the
      Treatment Period 2 received either MK-6096 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The hypothesis tested
      in the study is that MK-6096 10 mg is superior to placebo in reducing migraine frequency as
      measured by the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days averaged over the 12- week
      treatment period.

    <description>Participants recorded data in the electronic migraine headache diary in the evening approximately one hour before bed and prior to taking study medication during Screening and the Treatment Period. A migraine was defined as a headache with at least one associated symptom of aura, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, or vomiting. Change in the mean monthly migraine days during Screening (Baseline) versus during the 12-week Treatment Period was assessed. A negative number indicates a reduction in mean monthly migraine days.</description>

A migraine was defined as a headache with at least one associated symptom of aura, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, or vomiting. Change in the mean monthly migraine days during Screening (Baseline) versus during the 12-week Treatment Period was assessed. A negative number indicates a reduction in mean monthly migraine days.</description>
