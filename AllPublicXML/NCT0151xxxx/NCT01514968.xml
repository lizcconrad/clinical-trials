  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-dose, randomized, open-label, 2-sequence, 3-period study will evaluate the effect
      of cyclosporine on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (DNV/r) in healthy
      volunteers. Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences to receive a single
      oral dose of DNV/r or cyclosporine. In treatment period 3, subjects will receive a single
      oral dose of DNV/r plus cyclosporine. Anticipated time on study is 33 days.

             the first dose of study medication

          -  Use of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches or injectable,
             implantable devices) within 30 days before the first dose of study medication

          -  Routine chronic use of more than 2 g acetaminophen daily

          -  Use of any investigational drug or device within 30 days of screening (6 months for
             biologic therapies) or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer
