      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Trachway(R) compared with direct
      laryngoscope in tracheal intubation of double-lumen endobronchial tube.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intubation with the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) remains a great challenge for
      anesthesiologists. Although new upper airway devices, such as Trachway (R), a video-assisted
      intubating stylet, had been developed for facilitating airway management.

      The larger size and the complexity of DLT than single-lumen tube (SLT) makes the difficulties
      for DLT intubation. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to investigate the
      effects of Trachway(R)compared with direct laryngoscope in DLT intubation.
