  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to develop, deliver, and assess the efficacy of a
      parent-centered educational program (4-Health) designed to prevent preteen children from
      becoming overweight.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggest that parents can play a key role in preventing childhood obesity.
      Program objectives are to increase parents' knowledge and skills related to nutrition,
      physical activity, and best parenting practices. Developed from a successful existing
      program, the proposed program will include a novel classroom curriculum coupled with outside
      exercises, online resources, and a strong social support network. The curriculum will be
      developed with input from stakeholders during year 1 and implemented during years 2 and 3.
      The target groups are children and parents participating in 4-H Youth Development Programs in
      Montana. Intervention effectiveness will be assessed by comparing objective and self-report
      data between-groups (intervention vs. control) and within-groups (pre- to post-intervention
      and at 6 month follow-up). Physiological measures, including resting heart rate, blood
      pressure, body weight and age- and gender-specific BMI z-scores of children, are expected to
      show significant improvement among children of parents receiving the intervention compared to
      a mailed written materials control group. In addition, positive changes are anticipated in
      outcome measures provided by parents and children, including levels of daily physical
      activity and specific food and nutrition behaviors. Positive changes in parents' attitudes
      about diet, body image, and their perceived feeding practices before versus after
      intervention and at 6 month follow-up are also expected. This project will lead to improved
      understanding of how parents influence child obesity and improved interventions to prevent
      obesity.

    <intervention_name>4-Health Educational curriculum</intervention_name>
    <description>During the intervention, parents meet about every 3 weeks (90 min/session) in small groups with facilitators. During meetings classroom activities aim to integrate 3 areas: 1) parents' knowledge about healthy diets, physical activity and improved body image; 2) parents' understanding, skills and potential roles as positive change-agents (i.e., parenting and behavior management); and 3) parents' learning and practicing cognitive-behavioral exercises that encourage specific skills within the family/home setting. Between monthly meetings, participants explore a suggested online websites or facilitator-assigned questions and provide feedback. The majority of outside time/assignments for parents is spent doing take-home activities with their preteen child and family.</description>

    <description>During the Healthy Living Information intervention, participants receive packets delivered to their homes by mail at intervals similar to the meeting intervals for the educational curriculum intervention. (10 total packets.) Approximately every three weeks between late September 2011 and April 2012, corresponding approximately to the meeting times for the 4-Health Educational Program, participants in the Healthy Living Information control group receive mailed packets of information.</description>
