  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 120 subjects within the study site's practice who have already had an Ultherapy™
      treatment to the face and neck will be enrolled to monitor treatment effectiveness. Follow-up
      visits will occur at 90 and 180 days post-treatment. Study images will be obtained at each
      follow-up visit.

      This is a retrospective, single-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Ulthera
      System for non-invasive treatment of skin texture and laxity six months after treatment.
      Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores, patient satisfaction questionnaires, and quality
      of life questionnaires will be obtained.

    <description>Determined by a masked, qualitative assessment of photographs at 180 days post treatment compared to pre-treatment baseline photographs. A panel of three blinded assessors reviewed pre-treatment and post-treatment photos. Each blinded assessor was provided an identical set of pre-treatment and Day 180 post-treatment photos to assess. The pre/post treatment photos were consistent in lighting, subject positioning and focus. The visit interval of each photo, i.e. pre and post treatment, was NOT marked. Each blinded assessor conducted their assessment independently with no input from another blinded assessor, comparing each set of photos. Each assessor indicated those subjects assessed as improved.</description>
