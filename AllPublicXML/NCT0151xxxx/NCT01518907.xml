               -  The target EFP area must be located on the posterolateral thigh or within the
                  buttock and does not involve the gluteal fold

               -  The target EFP area must be evident when the subject is standing, without the use
                  of any manipulation such as skin pinching or muscle contraction (ie, CSS
                  Classification E score of 2 or 3) at screening and before injection

          -  Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 20.0 and 33.0 kg/m2, and intends to maintain
             stable body weight throughout the duration of the study (a variation of ≤5% from
             baseline body weight is permitted)
