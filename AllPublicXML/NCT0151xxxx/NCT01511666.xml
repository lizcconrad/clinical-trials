    <textblock>
      Prague out-of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) study is a prospective randomized multicenter
      clinical study comparing use of prehospital intraarrest hypothermia, mechanical chest
      compression device, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) and early invasive investigation and
      treatment (coronary angiography/percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]; pulmonary
      angiography/percutaneous embolectomy; aortography) in all patients with OHCA of presumed
      cardiac origin compared to standard of care. It is hypothesized, that above stated
      &quot;hyperinvasive&quot; approach might improve outcome of out-of hospital cardiac arrest victims.

      Background: Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has a poor outcome. Recent non-randomized
      study of ECLS (extracorporeal life support) in OHCA suggested further prospective multicenter
      studies to define population with OHCA that would benefit from ECLS.

      Aim: to perform a prospective randomized multicenter clinical study comparing use of
      prehospital intraarrest hypothermia, mechanical chest compression device, ECLS and early
      invasive investigation and treatment (coronary angiography/percutaneous coronary intervention
      [PCI]; pulmonary angiography/percutaneous embolectomy; aortography) in all patients with OHCA
      of presumed cardiac origin compared to standard of care.

      Planned intervention: patients with witnessed OHCA without ROSC (return of spontaneous
      circulation) after a minimum of 5 minutes of ACLS by emergency medical service (EMS) team
      will be after fulfilling of inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study randomized in a 1:1
      design to standard vs. hyperinvasive arm. Patients in standard arm will be further managed as
      per recent guidelines. In hyperinvasive arm, mechanical compression device together with
      intranasal cooling will be immediately instituted and patients will be transferred to cardiac
      center directly to cathlab under ongoing CPR. After admission to cathlab, overall status,
      ROSC and ECLS inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated and in case of no
      contraindications to ECLS and no ROSC or ROSC with shock, veno-arterial ECLS will be started
      as soon as possible, not later than 60 minutes after cardiac arrest onset. After ECLS
      institution, mild hypothermia will be continued by means of ECLS cooling and immediate
      invasive investigation will be performed in all patients.

      Standard postresuscitation care will follow.

    <description>Hyperinvasive arm encompasses immediate institution of a mechanical chest compression device (LUCAS) and pre-hospital intraarrest cooling by Rhino-Chill device. Immediately after institution of these two devices the patients will be directly transferred to cardiac center cathlab under continuous CPR. The use of drugs and further defibrillations are on a discretion of the emergency physician. After admission to cathlab, overall status, ROSC presence and ECLS inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>Patients in standard arm will be further managed as per recent ERC guidelines, ie. continued ACLS. The use of drugs and further defibrillations are on a discretion of the emergency physician. If ROSC is attained, patients will be transferred to the same hospital to one of intensive care units, coronary angiography/PCI will be performed only if indicated according to routine practice and mild therapeutic hypothermia will be instituted as soon as possible as per recent guidelines recommendation.</description>
