      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of oral azacitidine
      when administered once daily as two 150-mg tablets, including the effect of food, and to
      evaluate the bioavailability of oral azacitidine 300-mg when administered as two 150-mg
      tablets relative to three 100-mg tablets.
