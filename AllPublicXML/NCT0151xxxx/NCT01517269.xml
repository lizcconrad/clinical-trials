      Hypothesis: Parents who receive Parent Education Thru Simulation-Diabetes (PETS-D) will have
      significantly higher diabetes knowledge (cognitive visual schemata), better technical and
      problem-solving competence and confidence, and lower fear and stress/anxiety levels; and
      provide better diabetes management at 14 weeks compared to those parents receiving standard
      diabetes education.

    <description>Diabetes Awareness and Reasoning Test-Parents (DART-P)is a 47-item multiple-choice questionnaire. The subscales include general, insulin, hyper-hypglycemia, and problem-solving. Parent education was a significant predictor of total scores.</description>

    <description>Wysocki's Modified Problem-solving measure18 (PSM) is a 5 item questionnaire that focuses on how to proactively prevent and treat hypoglycemia. Dr. Wysocki sent us one of his vignettes developed from the structured interview measure. Based on the examples of probes that are part of the interview, we constructed a 5-question multiple choice instrument to measure parental problem-solving abilities and knowledge synthesis. We will report the reliability and validity of this measure with data from the proposed study.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Efficacy Diabetes-Pediatrics (SED-P) will be used to measure parent confidence in specific task and skill associated diabetes care, i.e. how confident they feel to perform day-to-day diabetes management.</description>

    <measure>Change in Baseline of Fear of hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-Parents (HFS-P) total score will be used to measure parental fears and avoidance behaviors associated with hypoglycemia in their children.There are 2 subscales that measure parental concerns of their child experiencing an episode of hypoglycemia and behaviors they use to prevent these episodes from occurring</description>

    <measure>Change in Baseline of Parent anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Anxiety (STAI) is a well established 40-item instrument (Likert scale, with 1 being not at all, to 4 being almost always) used to measure situational (state, how one feels at this moment) and stable (trait, how one feels in general) tendencies toward anxiety. Higher scores signify more anxiety</description>
