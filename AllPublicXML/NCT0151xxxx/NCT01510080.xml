  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to meet an existing lack of empirical studies in the field of cognitive behavioral
      therapy supervision, the present randomized controlled trial is aimed at comparing two
      different types of supervision. This study compares computer-assisted live supervision and
      delayed video-based supervision regarding efficacy and acceptance among therapists, patients
      and supervisors. The efficacy of supervision is defined on different levels such as change of
      psychotherapeutic competence, nondisclosure, self-efficacy, self-awareness of the supervisee
      as well as therapeutic alliance, supervisory alliance and therapy outcome.

    <description>Supervisees assigned to this group will receive 8 sessions of computer-assisted live supervision and 4 sessions of delayed video-based supervision while treating 2 patients during 26 therapy sessions each. Computer-assisted live supervision is also known as &quot;bug-in-the-eye&quot; (BITE) supervision. The supervisor observes the therapy session with the help of a webcam and types messages on his computer. The instructions to the supervisee appear on a second monitor located in the therapy room where the supervisee can view it whenever he wants to.</description>

    <description>Supervisees assigned to this group will receive 12 sessions of delayed video-based supervision while treating 2 patients during 26 therapy sessions each. During delayed video-based supervision the supervisor and the supervisee spend 50 minutes reviewing selected parts of video recorded therapy sessions and discussing the case.</description>
