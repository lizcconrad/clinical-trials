  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are leading causes of death and
      health care use. Diffuse airways inflammation is seen in COPD and is thought to be the reason
      for deterioration of lung function in COPD. Currently there is no medication available that
      can modify or reduce this inflammation. Furthermore, from literature review it has been shown
      that chronic inflammation can result in cancerous changes.

      Curcumin is a food additive used for centuries. Several studies showed that curcumin suppress
      the different inflammatory pathways. Specially, the TNF-alpha and the NF kappa-b are down
      regulated by this substance. This study was designed to evaluate effect of combination of
      curcumin+Bioprine on sputum cytology in patients with COPD. This is double-blind randomized
      pilot study.

    <description>We evaluated presence of moderate or worse dysplasia at baseline and each subsequent visits. The primary endpoint of this study is change in sputum cytological abnormality (moderate or worse dysplasia). The change will be comparison of 3-month follow up compared to baseline.</description>
