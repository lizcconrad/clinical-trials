      Primary Objective:

      - To compare progression free survival (PFS) in the two treatment arms

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Postoperative stage and R0 (complete) resection rate

        -  Safety: Toxicities associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery,
           morbidity/mortality, toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy1
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm will be treated for 3 cycles (1 cycle is 21
      days) before surgery and treated for a year with TS-1 Patients in the adjuvant chemotherapy
      arm will get a surgery and treated for a year with TS-1. All patients will be followed during
      and after the study treatment until death or progression, whichever comes first.
