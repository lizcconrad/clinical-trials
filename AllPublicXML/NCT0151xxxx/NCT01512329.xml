  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the lack of evidence in support of pacing self-management for patients with musltiple
      sclerosis (MS), it is examined whether physical behavior and health status of patients with
      MS improve in response to a pacing self-management program. The effects of pacing will be
      compared with those observed when applying relaxation therapy to patients with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50 patients fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) will
      be randomized to either 3 weeks of pacing activity self-management or relaxation therapy.
      Both treatment groups will receive 3 weekly sessions spread over 3 consecutive weeks. All
      treatments will be delivered by occupational therapists or physiotherapists. One treatment
      session lasts for about 45 minutes each.

    <measure>the change in subscale scores on the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured once at baseline and once post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CIS aims at assessing the subjective fatigue experience, concentration difficulties, motivation and physical activity. Higher scores on the CIS correspond to severe fatigue, many concentration difficulties, problems with motivation and a low level of physical activity. Its psychometric properties are well established.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the change in autonomic activity at rest and following 3 activities of daily living</measure>
    <time_frame>measured once at baseline and once post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 3 activities of daily living entail writing a standardized test on a laptop computer, ironing, and climbing 26 flights of stairs. For measuring autonomic activity, the Nexus 10 device (Mind Media, the Netherlands) will be used. Skin conductance, body temperature, heart rate, blood volume pressure and heart rate variability will be measured continuously in real time during a 2 minutes period, with the patient sitting on a chair (back supported and hands resting on legs). Electrodes will be placed on the left hand in all patients.</description>

    <description>The pacing self-management program (3 one-on-one sessions weekly for 3 consecutive weeks) focused on teaching the patient to estimate their current physical capabilities prior to commencing an activity. In order to appropriately pace activities (daily activities and exercise bouts), MS patients were learned to estimate their current physical capabilities prior to commencing an activity, keeping in mind the regular fluctuating nature of their symptoms. The activity duration used within the program was less than that reported by the patient so to account for typical overestimations made by the patient. Each activity block was interspersed with breaks, with the length of this break equating to the duration of the activity.</description>

    <description>Relaxation therapy (3 one-on-one sessions weekly for 3 consecutive weeks) comprised of education about the role of stress in MS biology, and the opportunities stress management provides to handle this issue. Patients were then taught how to apply stress management techniques like Jacobson relaxation skills, Schultz relaxation skills, visualization, etc.</description>
