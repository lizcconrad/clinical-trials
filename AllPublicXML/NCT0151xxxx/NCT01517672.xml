    <textblock>
      Identifying neural mechanisms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment could help
      elucidate reasons for variable treatment response and identify novel treatment targets.
      Exposure-based therapies have been associated with decreased amygdala and increased cingulate
      cortex response during emotional processing. The current study examined whether cognitive
      therapy for PTSD in women reduces activation in insula and amygdala and enhances activation
      in prefrontal regions during emotional anticipation and pre-treatment prefrontal activation
      predicts treatment response.
