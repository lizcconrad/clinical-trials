  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focal myometrial (uterine) contractions occur in a substantial number of vaginal ultrasound
      examinations and can impede accurate cervical length measurement and placental location
      determination. The timing of bladder voiding is associated with the prevalence of focal
      myometrial contractions on vaginal ultrasound cervical assessment. We propose a blinded
      randomized-controlled trial of bladder voiding immediately before vaginal ultrasound for
      cervical assessment compared with no bladder voiding immediately before vaginal ultrasound in
      order to determine the prevalence of focal myometrial contractions during vaginal ultrasound
      cervical assessment and test whether timing of bladder voiding is associated with their
      incidence.

      This blinded randomized-controlled trial will be performed through the Division of Maternal
      Fetal Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. We will offer enrollment to any
      pregnant woman at gestational weeks 14+0/7 through 31+6/7 presenting for obstetric ultrasound
      where cervical assessment and/or placental location determination is indicated. Patient
      positioning and image acquisition will follow a standard protocol and will be performed by
      the co-investigators. Outcome ascertainment will be performed by two co-investigators blinded
      to participant allocation upon completion of data collection. Demographic and obstetrical
      outcome data will be collected via review of the medical record. Analysis of primary and
      secondary outcomes will yield incidence data, and comparisons will be made between groups.

    <description>Focal myometrial contraction as defined by transvaginal ultrasound findings:
Thickening of the myometrial portion of the uterine wall visualized as two distinctly different areas of echogenicity
An unusually long-appearing cervix (possibly more than 50 mm) with an S-shaped endocervical canal and apparent internal os located appreciably cephalad
Asymmetric anterior and posterior lower uterine segment widths cephalad to apparent internal os
The thickening is transient.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the &quot;Immediate&quot; or control arm (voiding within five minutes of cervical assessment), will undergo any indicated trans-abdominal ultrasound imaging and preparations for vaginal ultrasound (including readying the probe and preparing the exam table for lithotomy position) prior to using the restroom. The participant will be instructed to proceed to the restroom to empty her bladder completely. A synchronized clock will be placed in the restroom, and the patient will be asked to note the time that she completes voiding. This will be confirmed by the research staff by noting the time the participant enters and exits the restroom. Vaginal ultrasound and cervical assessment will then be performed immediately upon return to the ultrasound room (within a maximum of 5 minutes from voiding time).</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the &quot;Interval&quot; or experimental arm (cervical assessment 15 minutes or more after voiding) will be notified of their allocation and asked to immediately use the rest room and attempt to void completely. A synchronized clock will be located in this restroom, and each participant will be asked to note the time that she completes voiding. This will be confirmed by the research staff by noting the time the participant enters and exits the restroom. The participant will return to the waiting room or ultrasound room. Any indicated trans-abdominal ultrasound imaging will be performed, and preparations will be made for the vaginal ultrasound. The participant will be asked not to void prior to the vaginal ultrasound. Cervical assessment will take place at a minimum of 15 minutes from voiding time</description>
