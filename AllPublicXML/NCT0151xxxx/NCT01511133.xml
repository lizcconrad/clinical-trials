  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the clinical samples (stool and serum) previously collected during
      clinical development of HRV vaccine, to identify if there is any evidence of PCV-1
      replication and/or immune response to the PCV-1 in vaccinated infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serum and stool samples collected from 4 clinical trials previously conducted for HRV vaccine
      (Rotarix™) are used in this study.
