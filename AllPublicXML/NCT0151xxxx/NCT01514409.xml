  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a nutritional supplement sold in many health food stores, and
      is taken in order to raise levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
      that is involved in the regulation of mood.

      Previous research has assessed the effects of raising serotonin levels using tryptophan (the
      precursor of 5-HTP) and serotonergic antidepressants on emotional processing in healthy
      volunteers. However, to date there has been no human trial investigating the effects of 5-HTP
      on emotional processing in healthy volunteers.

      Thus, the current study aims to assess the effects of 5-HTP, on emotional processing and mood
      in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The serotonin precursor 5-HTP is sold as a nutritional supplement and has been used to offset
      low mood for over 30 years due to its ability to raise levels of neural serotonin. However,
      evidence for the efficiency of 5-HTP is limited and the mechanism of action of 5-HTP in
      offsetting low mood has not been well-characterised.

      The current study assessed the ability of 5-HTP to induce biases for positive emotional
      material in healthy volunteers, similar to those induced by serotonergic antidepressants and
      the nutritional supplement tryptophan. The effects of 5-HTP on subjective mood and depressive
      symptoms were also assessed.

      Participants were randomised to receive either 150mg of 5-HTP or placebo daily for 14 days.
      Depressive symptoms and subjective mood were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Emotional
      processing was assessed on the 15th day using a battery of emotionally valenced cognitive
      tasks.

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a measure used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. It is comprised of 21 items that are scored on a scale ranging from 0-3, with total scores ranging from 0-63. Scores of over 16 are indicative of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Profile of Mood States-Bipolar (POMS-BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS-BI is a measure used to assess subjective mood. It comprises 72 adjectives which describe mood states. Participants indicate how well the adjectives describe how they feel on a four point scale ranging from 0-3. The POMS-BI measures the following six bipolar mood states: composed-anxious, elated-depressed, agreeable-hostile, clearheaded-confused, energetic-tired, and confident-unsure.</description>

    <measure>Emotional Perception: Facial Expression Recognition Task</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are shown faces displaying five different emotions - happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust. Each facial expression has been morphed between 0% (neutral) to 100% in 25% increments. Four examples of each emotion at each intensity are displayed on a computer screen (84 stimuli presentations in total). Faces are displayed for 500ms aand then replaced with a blank screen. Participants have to indicate what facial expression has been displayed by clicking the corresponding button on-screen with the mouse. Accuracy, reaction times, and misclassifications are measured.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Categorisation and Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are shown sixty personality characteristics consecutively (30 agreeable, 30 disagreeable)on a computer screen in random order for 500ms each. Participants are asked to judge whether the personality traits are 'likeable' or 'dislikeable'. Classifications and reaction times for correct choices are recorded. Participants are then asked to recall as many personality characteristics as they can in order to assess their incidental memory for positive versus negative material.</description>

    <description>The attentional probe task based on MacLeod, Matthews and Tata's (1986) visual attention paradigm is used to assess participants attention towards positive versus negatively valenced words. Accuracy and reaction time is recorded.</description>
