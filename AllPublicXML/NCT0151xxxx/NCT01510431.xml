  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol 620 provides PROCHYMAL(R) adult human mesenchymal cells to specifically chosen
      Crohn's disease patients at participating centers who typically have already demonstrated
      good response in another PROCHYMAL study, are not eligible for other PROCHYMAL studies, and
      in the view of the investigator, would not benefit significantly from other Crohn's therapies
      but would benefit from use of PROCHYMAL.

      The study is not placebo-controlled or randomized.
