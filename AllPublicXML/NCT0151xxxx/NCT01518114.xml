    <textblock>
      Exercise training (ET) is highly beneficial in heart failure patients and has been suggested
      to confer significant symptomatic and functional improvements in patients with diastolic
      dysfunction. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the safety, feasibility of a
      structured ET program in symptomatic HCM patients.

    <description>Exercise will be performed under continuous telemetry monitoring and medical supervision. Each session will include 5-10 worm-up, 30 min of aerobic activity on treadmill or bicycle ergometer followed by 10-15 min of stretch and relaxation exercise. Blood pressure will be obtained before the onset and at the end of each session. Participants will be requested to rest and observed 15-30 min before going home. The exercise intensity will be monitored and adjusted, per protocol, according to RPE using the Borg scale.
Exercise prescription will be based upon cardiopulmonary test done at baseline.</description>
