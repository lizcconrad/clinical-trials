  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized study was designed to compare pharmacokinetics of a single 50
      milligram (mg) dose of MK-0822 in participants with and without moderate hepatic
      insufficiency (abnormal liver function) in order to determine to what degree hepatic
      dysfunction may impact therapeutic blood levels of MK-0822. The primary hypothesis is that
      plasma AUC0-∞ of odanacatib in participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency is similar to
      that in matched healthy participants following a single 50 mg oral dose.

    <description>Apparent terminal half-life is the time required to divide the plasma (serum) concentration by two after reaching pseudo-equilibrium. (Note: it is not the time required to eliminate half the administered dose.) For healthy and moderate hepatic insufficiency participants, plasma samples were collected from predose to 336 hours postdose for determination of t1/2. Results are presented using harmonic mean and jackknife standard deviation.</description>
