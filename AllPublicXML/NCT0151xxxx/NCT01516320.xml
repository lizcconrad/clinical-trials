  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the different mechanisms by which Gastric
      Bypass (GBP), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy
      (VSG) affect glucose control. We wish to understand the role of weight loss versus changes in
      gut peptides in the short and long term in morbidly obese patients with Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus after GBP, LAGB or VSG. The 2 surgical groups will be compared at 10% equivalent
      weight loss and at after surgery in terms of gut hormones levels, insulin secretion and
      glucose control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remission after gastric bypass surgery (GBP) are
      unclear. The levels of the gut hormones incretins and their effect on insulin secretion,
      which is impaired in T2DM, markedly increase after GBP. The anatomical changes of GBP, rather
      than weight loss, seem to be responsible for the changes of incretins. The objective of this
      proposal is to investigate the different mechanisms by which GBP, laparoscopic adjustable
      gastric banding (LAGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) affect glucose control. We wish
      to understand the role of weight loss versus changes in gut peptides in the short and long
      term in morbidly patients with T2DM after GBP, LAGB or VSG.

      AIM 1: Will study the short term changes of incretins levels and effect in obese individuals
      with T2DM after GBP, LAGB or VSG, before and 1 month after GBP or before and after equivalent
      weight loss after LAGB or VSG.

      AIM 2: Will study the long-term (12 and 24 months after surgery) changes in the incretin
      effect on insulin secretion, in patients with T2DM after GBP, LAGB or VSG.

      AIM 3: Will study the changes of insulin secretion to IV glucose (AIRg) and insulin
      sensitivity (Si), measured by the minimal model, in patients with T2DM after GBP, VSG or
      LAGB, before and at 24 months after the surgery, at weight stability under condition of
      controlled diet.

             seizure disorder requiring anti epileptic therapy, and/or elevation of liver enzymes
             three times above the normal limit.

          2. Patients should not have significant secondary complications from diabetes that would
             preclude undergoing gastric by-pass surgery. This would include significant
             psychiatric, renal or neurological, or known active coronary artery disease.

          3. Any abnormality during the maximum exercise stress test that indicates it would be

             of enrollment.

          8. Patients diagnosed with intestinal conditions such as chronic diarrhea,
             diverticulitis, or irritable bowel syndrome. These clinical conditions would interfere
             with the collection and interpretation of the H2 breath test.

          9. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigators, may make the candidate
             unsuitable for participation in this study.
