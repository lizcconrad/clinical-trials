      Examine the effect of three different dietary messages on dietary intake and the health of
      parents and their children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial examining three
      dietary messages: increase fruits and vegetables [INCREASE], decrease energy-dense,
      non-nutrient dense snack foods [DECREASE], or increase fruits and vegetables plus decrease
      snack foods [INCREASE+DECREASE], within a 6-month, family-based obesity prevention
      intervention. Each condition will also focus on increasing family evening meals and physical
      activity. Primary hypotheses are: 1) INCREASE + DECREASE will consume a greater ratio of
      F&amp;Vs:SFs than INCREASE and DECREASE at 6 months.

      2)INCREASE + DECREASE will consume less energy than INCREASE and DECREASE at 6 months.

Both parent and child will self-monitor these behaviors. As one barrier to consuming F&amp;Vs is perceived cost of these foods, information regarding lower-cost options for F&amp;Vs will be included in the manual.</description>
