  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether oxytocin will facilitate the learning of social cognitive
      skills in schizophrenia patients who receive 12 sessions of Social Cognitive Skills Training
      (SCST). The primary hypothesis is that schizophrenia subjects who are treated with oxytocin
      will demonstrate greater improvements in a summary measure of social cognition than subjects
      treated with placebo over the course of SCST.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with schizophrenia often have serious deficits in their abilities to perceive and
      interpret socially relevant information. These deficits in social cognition can lead to
      misunderstanding the intentions of others and failing to interpret social signals that are
      important for successful social interactions. The relationship between social cognition and
      functioning has led our group to develop a research agenda that includes understanding the
      neural underpinnings of social cognitive deficits, measuring these impairments using
      brain-based biomarkers and clinical assessments, and enhancing our Social Cognitive Skills
      Training program to improve social cognition and promote recovery.

      Oxytocin, which is a hormone and neurotransmitter, is believed to impact social cognition
      through increased orienting toward and attending to socially salient visual features. There
      is also evidence that oxytocinergic signaling is impaired in schizophrenia. With this
      research, we hope to learn whether administration of oxytocin will improve different aspects
      of social cognition by examining the effects of oxytocin versus placebo administered
      intranasally before each of 12 sessions of a social cognitive skills training program on
      measures of independent living, work and social functioning.

    <description>We will assess emotion management, emotion perception, social context processing/social perception, theory of mind, attributional bias, and empathic accuracy. The primary summary measure for each test will be mean-centered and standardized to create a Z-score that will be averaged to create a single composite score for social cognition, serving as the primary outcome measure. Parallel follow-up analyses will be conducted on individual components to determine which measures are most affected by treatment. Similar secondary analyses will be employed for the event related potential (ERP) and basic cognition measures.</description>

    <description>The training utilizes skill building techniques that are commonly used in psychiatric rehabilitation. These include breaking down complex social cognitive processes into their components and automating these skills through repetition and practice. The training programs will include 12 sessions and will be administered in a small group format (6-8 participants per group) twice a week for 6 weeks. The treatment groups will include individuals who are assigned to placebo. Each training session will last for about 90 minutes (1 hour training and 30 minutes between placebo administration and start of training).</description>
