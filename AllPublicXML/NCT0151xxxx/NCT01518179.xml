  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal Radius Fractures are among the most common orthopedic injuries. Rehabilitation may be
      characterized by pain, stiffness, swelling, and decreased range of motion (hand and fingers),
      and grip strength.

      Compression gloves are used to enhance rehabilitation after various clinical conditions and
      injuries. However, there are no reports on the effect of compression gloves following Distal
      Radius Fracture (DRF).

      This study aims to assess the incremental effect of wearing Made-to-Measure Compression
      Gloves on rehabilitation following DRF.

      Working Hypothesis: The addition of Made-to-Measure Compression Gloves to routine follow up
      and treatment will enhance rehabilitation, when compared with routine follow up and
      treatment, in patients following Distal Radius Fracture.

      ICD 10, Version 2010, conditions to be included in the study (defined jointly as Distal
      Radius Fractures):

      S52.5 Fracture of lower end of radius (Colles' fracture, Smith's fracture) S52.6 Fracture of
      lower end of both ulna and radius S52.7 Multiple fractures of forearm Excl.: fractures of
      both ulna and radius: lower end (S52.6), shafts (S52.4).

      S52.8 Fracture of other parts of forearm (Lower end of ulna, Head of ulna)

      Individuals referred for rehabilitation following DRF will be invited to participate in the
      study. After obtaining an informed consent individuals will be randomized to receive routine
      follow up and treatment with or without compression glove. Individuals randomized to made to
      measure compression gloves will receive them within a week of enrolment. All participating
      individuals will be assessed by an occupational therapist at enrolment and 2, 4, and 8 week
      after enrolment. Additional telephone interview, to assess long term effect, will be
      conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months.
