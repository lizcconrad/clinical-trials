  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of alcoholic beverages, red wine in
      particular, is associated with less cardiovascular mortality. In addition, there are reported
      beneficial effects of red wine on components of the metabolic syndrome, arguably the most
      menacing cardiometabolic condition facing us due to the unfolding obesity epidemic.
      Beneficial effects have also been reported with other polyphenol-rich food stuff, such as
      cocoa and green tea and points to a beneficial effect which does not seem to be dependent on
      the alcohol content of red wine. Experimental studies with mixed or separate Red Wine
      Polyphenols (RWPs) (i.e. without alcohol) have shown beneficial effects on cardiometabolic
      parameters associated with obesity. Most research has focused on resveratrol, a specific
      polyphenol components which is quite specific to red wine and has, at least in animal
      studies, beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and endothelial
      function. Moreover, RWPs have shown to improve endothelial NO-mediated relaxation using the
      same PI3-kinase/Akt pathway as does insulin. However, data in humans are remarkably scarce

      Objective:

      To study effects of RWPs on insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, microvascular function
      (skin, muscle and cardiac), blood pressure, insulin-mediated microvascular responsiveness.

      Study design:

      Randomized controlled trial (double blind).

      Study population:

      Obese (BMI &gt;30); n=30, men or women, aged 18-60 years.

      Intervention:

      Mixed RWP 600mg/day or matching placebo for a total duration of 8 weeks.
