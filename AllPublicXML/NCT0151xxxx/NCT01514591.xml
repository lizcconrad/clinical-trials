    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the coagulation changes that occur in laboring patients
      undergoing non-elective (intrapartum)Cesarean delivery using thromboelastography (TEG). We
      will compare coagulation data to assess potential coagulation changes associated with
      hemoglobin changes before and after surgery, and related to estimated blood loss.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the coagulation changes that occur in laboring patients
      undergoing non-elective (intrapartum)Cesarean delivery using thromboelastography (TEG). TEG
      is a point- of-care device which measures the viscoelastic properties of clot formation. This
      device can provide rapid and detailed information about coagulation changes in the
      perioperative period. We will compare coagulation data collected from the study to assess
      potential coagulation changes associated with Hemoglobin changes before and after surgery,
      and related to estimated blood loss.

    <description>This study will allow us to collect more information about the hemostatic effects that occur during non-elective Cesarean delivery. This information will add to current knowledge base (which we have published) about coagulation changes in the peripartum period in patients undergoing non-elective Cesarean section.</description>
