  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies local anesthetic (EMLA) cream in younger patients
      undergoing lumbar punctures (LP). A local anesthetic cream may be effective for numbing the
      skin and reducing movement when applied prior to lumbar punctures and may reduce the amount
      of sedation necessary

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the application of a topical anesthetic (EMLA cream) to the LP site
      will decrease the total dose of propofol administered to pediatric oncology patients who are
      being sedated for LPs compared to application of a topical placebo cream.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the use of EMLA cream decreases complication rates from sedation.

      II. To determine whether the use of EMLA cream decreases traumatic lumbar punctures.

      III. To determine whether the use of EMLA cream shortens recovery time. IV. To determine
      practitioner and parent satisfaction with the use of EMLA cream.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive topical EMLA cream 60 minutes to 4 hours prior to the LP followed by
      standard sedation with fentanyl citrate and propofol.

      ARM II: Patients receive topical placebo cream 60 minutes to 4 hours prior to the LP followed
      by standard sedation with fentanyl citrate and propofol.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 1 week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Pediatric oncology patients undergoing a lumbar puncture in the Pediatric Sedation Suite;
        patients may or may not be receiving intrathecal chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients undergoing additional procedures during the same anesthetic such as bone marrow
        aspirate or biopsy will be excluded because they will likely require higher doses of
        propofol than those undergoing LP alone Patients who are allergic to or not tolerant of
        EMLA cream, propofol, or fentanyl will be excluded Patients who are pregnant will be
        excluded Patients having their LPs done by students will be excluded
