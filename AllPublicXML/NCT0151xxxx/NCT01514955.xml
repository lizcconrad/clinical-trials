  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main cause of mortality in cervix cancer is local relapse in the pelvis. Since distant
      metastasis is quiet rare, increasing local control in the pelvis can directly translate into
      improvement in survival. Obstacles in front of this approach is the dose limitation to normal
      organs located in the pelvis adjacent to the tumor. 3-D MRI based EBRT and Brachytherapy will
      grant safe delivery of more conformal higher doses of radiation to the tumor and allowing
      sparing of the normal structures.

      A total of 10 patients with a diagnosis of locally advanced cervical carcinoma will be
      enrolled. After diagnosis and written informed consent, patients will undergo investigations
      prior to treatment planning, including CT imaging as per standard of care. In addition,
      patients will have an MRI of the pelvis + PET scan + EUA and gold seeds insertion to verify
      pelvic organs movement and EB-IMRT with daily cone beam CT. Brachytherapy treatment planning
      will be based on MRI imaging with the applicator in situ.
