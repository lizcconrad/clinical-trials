  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the effect of the tricyclic antidepressant Imipramine in
      patients with longlasting health problems with no known medical explanation, defined as
      multi-organ Bodily distress syndrome (BDS). Pharmacological treatment of patients with BDS
      have never been tested, and Imipramine i low dosage (10-75 mg) has the potential of reducing
      both pain and other symptoms of bodily distress for patients with BDS. Control conditions are
      pill placebo. Study duration is 19 weeks for each of the 140 patients. End point is 13 weeks,
      i.e. after 10 weeks of 25-75 mg study drug.

      The aim of this study is to test the effect of Imipramine in patients with multi-organ Bodily
      distress syndrome (BDS). BDS is a unifying diagnosis that encompasses a group of closely
      related conditions such as somatization disorder, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and
      chronic fatigue syndrome. The project consists of a double-blinded placebo controlled trial
      of treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant Imipramine in dosages of 25-75 mg. Primary
      outcome is patient-rated improvement measured by Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I).
      Secondary outcome is functional level (physical, mental and social) measured by the SF-36
      Physical Component Summary (PCS). The study requires 140 participants and study duration is
      19 weeks for each patient. End point is 13 weeks, i.e. after 10 weeks of 25-75 mg study drug.
