  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether RNS60, in combination with budesonide, is
      safe in mild to moderate asthmatics when taken by nebulization over a 28-day period, compared
      to a 28-day control period.

             asthma, alone or in combination with other medications, with usage of 1 month (≥ 95%
             compliance) or more on the inhaled corticosteroid treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test (serum HCG) at the
             time of study entry, and again on Day 22.

             myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias within 6 months prior
             to study entry.

          -  Treatment with a humanized or chimeric antibody therapy within 4 weeks prior to study
             entry.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drugs, therapies, or medical devices within 4 weeks
             prior to study entry.

             entry and/or during the study treatment period.

          -  Use of any over-the-counter asthma treatments, including Primatene Mist, during the
             8-week active study period.
