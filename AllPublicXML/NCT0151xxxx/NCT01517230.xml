  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cluster-randomised trial will be undertaken in Burkina Faso to investigate whether a
      comprehensive mass media campaign using local radio stations can change behaviours on a scale
      large enough to result in measurable and sustainable reductions in under-five child
      mortality.

      It is hypothesised that as a result of the scale and multi-pronged nature of the campaign,
      reductions of between 10% and 20% in child mortality will be achieved.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation is conducted in 14 geographical locations throughout Burkina Faso. Seven of
      these 14 clusters have been randomly allocated to receive the mass media intervention while
      the remaining 7 clusters will serve as controls.

      Data collection includes household surveys in all 14 clusters at three &quot;key&quot; times:

        -  At baseline: Before the implementation of the intervention, between December 2011 and
           February 2012 to measure the current level of child mortality and evaluate current
           knowledge and behaviours of relevance to child health.

        -  At midline: Fifteen months after implementation of the intervention to evaluate the
           coverage of the intervention (in the intervention clusters) and, in each cluster,
           knowledge and behaviours.

        -  At endline: Two and a half years after implementation of the intervention to evaluate
           intervention coverage (in the intervention clusters), knowledge and behaviours and child
           mortality.

    <description>The media campaign is designed by Development Media International. It includes short &quot;spots&quot; and long format programs broadcast by rural community radios. Major topics to be addressed include: diarrhoea, water and sanitation, acute respiratory infections, fever/malaria, antenatal consultations, delivery in health facilities, breastfeeding, and child nutrition. The intervention is planned to start in March 2012 after completion of fieldwork for the baseline survey and will continue for 2.5 years.</description>
