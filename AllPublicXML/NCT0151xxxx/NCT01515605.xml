  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molecular monitoring is conducted in blood cells, plasma samples, urine samples and/or tissue
      from patients after kidney transplantation. In the present study the investigators examine
      the hypothesis that noninvasive diagnostic molecular monitoring can improve the outcome after
      transplantation.

      Routine clinical and laboratory data from serum and urine are evaluated at baseline and after
      0-1-2-3-4-12-16-52 weeks and 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 years after kidney transplantation.
      Mononuclear cells were obtained from the blood and transcripts of several diagnostic genes
      (including GATA3 (Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor3), GATA4 (Trans-acting
      T-cell-specific transcription factor4), GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase),
      TRPC3 (Transient receptor potential cononical type3), TRPC6 (Transient receptor potential
      cononical type6), granzyme B, perforin, FOXP3 (Forkhead box P3), ISG15 (Interferon-stimulated
      gene 15), Mx1 (Interferon-induced GTP-binding protein), MMP3 (Matrix metalloproteinase-3),
      MMP9 (Matrix metalloproteinase-9), long-non-coding RNA, and others) are quantified using
      standard quantitative RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) techniques.
      Proteomic analysis were performed in plasma and urine samples. Polymorphisms of selected
      genes are analyzed using standard techniques. Data are analyzed by descriptive statistics.
      Differences between groups were analyzed using Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis-test and
      Dunn`s multiple comparison post-test, as appropriate. Associations between variables are
      analyzed using regression analyses. Contingency tables are analyzed using Fisher's exact
      test.

      Molecular monitoring is conducted in blood cells, plasma samples, urine samples and/or tissue
      from recipients after kidney transplantation and donors. In the present study the
      investigators examine the hypothesis that noninvasive diagnostic molecular monitoring can
      improve the outcome after transplantation.
