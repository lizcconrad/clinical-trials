      To study the effect of midodrine against the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of midodrine will be assessed in those subjects who have severe symptoms of
      orthostatic hypotension when not taking midodrine and are controlled when taking midodrine.
      The study will involve approximately 9 overnight stays.

    <measure>Percent of Subjects Who Failed to Maintain a Response</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post-dose on Day 16</time_frame>
    <description>Failure to maintain a response was defined as any randomized subject that met both criterion 1 and criterion 2 below on Day 16:
The Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment (OHSA) Item 1 score increased by &gt;=4 points compared to baseline. OHSA Item 1 is a dizziness scale that is scored on a range from 0 (no dizziness) to 10 (severe dizziness). A lower score indicates less severe symptoms.
There was an increase in the number of syncopal/near syncopal events or severity of events within 15 minutes of standing compared to those observed at baseline. Syncope was defined as a loss of consciousness, and near syncope was defined as a feeling (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, feeling as though one would black out) that, without intervention, would lead to a loss of consciousness.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects must be 18 years of age or older and ambulatory.

          2. Females of child-bearing potential (FOCP) must have a negative serum beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test.

          3. A documented history of severe Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension (SOH) that, in the
             judgment of the treating physician, has required treatment with midodrine HCl, and has
             been at a stable dose for at least 3 months.

          4. The subject has manifested at least 1 of the following symptoms while standing or had
             a medical history of 1 of the following when not treated for orthostatic hypotension
             (OH): dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like they might black out.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. The subject is a pregnant or lactating female.

          2. The subject has pre-existing sustained supine hypertension greater than 180mmHg
             systolic and 110mmHg diastolic BP or had these measurements at the Screening Visit.
             Sustained is defined as persistently greater at 2 separate measurements at least 5
             minutes apart with the subject supine and at rest for the 5 minutes.

          3. Subjects taking concomitant medications of interest are excluded unless those
             medications are reviewed and discussed with the Medical Monitor or Study Physician and
             documented prior to enrolling the subject. If agreement is reached between the
             Investigator and Sponsor for the subject to continue in the study, all allowed
             medications should be maintained at a constant dose throughout the study.

          4. The Principal Investigator deems any clinical laboratory test (at the Screening Visit)
             abnormality to be clinically significant

          5. The subject has participated in other studies of investigational drugs or devices
             within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study (other than Study SPD426-406).

          6. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder
             that may require treatment or make the subject unlikely to fully comply with the
             requirements of the study or complete the study, or any condition that presents undue
             risk from the investigational product or study procedures.

          7. The subject has a concurrent chronic or acute illness, disability, or other condition
             (including significant unexpected laboratory or electrocardiogram [ECG] findings) that
             might confound the results of the tests and/or measurements administered in this
             study, or that might have increased the risk to the subject.

          8. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational product(s),
             closely-related compounds, or any of the stated ingredients.

          9. Prior enrollment failure or randomization in this study.

         10. History of alcohol abuse or other substance abuse within the last year.

          <description>On the morning of Day -1, subjects took their usual morning dose of midodrine HCl, using their own midodrine HCl supplies at approximately the same time before rising that they would normally take their morning dose. On the morning of Day 1, subjects had their usual morning dose of midodrine HCl withheld. On Day 2, all eligible subjects continued on their midodrine HCl dose regimen over at least 14 days, using study-supplied investigational product.</description>

        <title>Percent of Subjects Who Failed to Maintain a Response</title>
        <description>Failure to maintain a response was defined as any randomized subject that met both criterion 1 and criterion 2 below on Day 16:
The Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment (OHSA) Item 1 score increased by &gt;=4 points compared to baseline. OHSA Item 1 is a dizziness scale that is scored on a range from 0 (no dizziness) to 10 (severe dizziness). A lower score indicates less severe symptoms.
There was an increase in the number of syncopal/near syncopal events or severity of events within 15 minutes of standing compared to those observed at baseline. Syncope was defined as a loss of consciousness, and near syncope was defined as a feeling (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, feeling as though one would black out) that, without intervention, would lead to a loss of consciousness.</description>
