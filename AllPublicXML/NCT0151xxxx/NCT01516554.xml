  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most frequent symptoms reported by multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and
      is often a significant source of disability. Unlike normal fatigue, multiple sclerosis
      related fatigue (MSRF) occurs independently of activity level, suggesting that it is due to
      dysfunction in the neural pathways that regulate the perception of energy although the
      precise cause is still not understood. While MSRF can be managed through lifestyle
      modifications and with drug treatment, these measures are commonly either ineffective or only
      partially effective.

      Administration of the male sex hormone testosterone has been shown to improve energy levels
      in males with testosterone-deficiency states. Testosterone also reduces fatigue in patients
      with other medical conditions not associated with low testosterone levels, suggesting that
      this treatment may also be useful in symptomatic control of MSRF.

      This proposed seven-month long clinical trial is designed to test the hypothesis that
      administration of oral testosterone tablets to male MS patients will result in an improvement
      of fatigue relative to the administration of placebo tablets. As fatigue is frequently
      reported by MS patients to be one of their most frustrating and disabling symptoms, any
      proven additional treatment option for MSRF would be beneficial in improving quality of life.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adult male (18—65 years old) patients are eligible. Patients over &gt; 65 years will
             be excluded due to increased risk of prostatic hypertrophy or carcinoma in that age
             group.

          -  Patients must have diagnosis of MS using the 2005 revised McDonald Criteria.

          -  Patients must have an EDSS score ≤ 6.5.

          -  Patients must have a baseline MFIS score ≥ 45 (i.e.: those patients with fatigue).

          -  Patients must consent to participate in the study after a discussion of the potential
             risks and benefits of study participation with their physician. This consent must
             acknowledge that testosterone administration in MS is experimental and of no proven
             benefit.

          -  Patients must not be on any other agents to specifically treat MSRF (modafinil
             [Alertec®], amantadine, methylphenidate [Ritalin®, Ritalin SR®, Concerta®].

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or current testosterone administration.

          -  Any Health Canada approved indication for testosterone administration.

          -  Known hypersensitivity any component of the testosterone undecanoate (Andriol®)
             formulation including soy.

          -  History of relapse in the past 3 months.

          -  History of prostate hypertrophy or prostate carcinoma.

          -  History of breast cancer.

          -  Moderate or severe prostate symptoms (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] ≥
             8).

          -  All patients ≥ 50 years old (or ≥ 40 years old if history of prostate cancer/prostate
             hypertrophy in a first-degree relative or if African-Canadian) will be require a
             urological assessment including prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal
             exam (DRE). Such patients will be excluded if they have a high PSA level or if they
             have a palpable prostate nodule. Abnormal PSA levels will be determined using standard
             age-specific cut-off levels.

          -  Other serious medical comorbidities including: any other cancer or myelodysplastic
             syndrome, anemia or polycythemia of any cause, vascular risk factors (including
             hypertension, dyslipidemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular
             disease, atrial fibrillation, other hypercoaguable state or thrombotic risk factor),
             serious kidney or liver disease, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea or serious
             psychiatric disease.

          -  History of current alcohol misuse.

          -  Recent major surgery.

          -  Use of the following medications whose metabolism may be altered by TT: warfarin,
             corticosteroids, propranolol, cyclosporine or St. John's Wort.81

          -  Patients on cyclophosphamide or mitoxantrone (Novantrone®) chemotherapy for MS will be
             excluded. Patients on other approved disease-modifying therapies for MS
             (interferon-β1a [Avonex®, Rebif®], interferon-β1b [Betaseron®], glatiramer acetate
             [Copaxone®] and natalizumab [Tysabri®]) can participate in this trial provided they
             have been on these therapies for at least six months at a stable dose.
