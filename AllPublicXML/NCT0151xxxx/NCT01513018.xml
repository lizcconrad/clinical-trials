  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ideal tidal volume (TV) during one-lung ventilation (OLV) remains controversial. High
      tidal volumes may increase the incidence of postoperative lung injury after thoracic surgery.
      The investigators thus evaluated the influence of low (5 ml/kg) and high (10 ml/kg) tidal
      volumes on arterial oxygenation and Intrapulmonary shunt during OLV.

      One hundred patients scheduled for thoracic surgery were enrolled. During OLV, patients were
      randomly assigned to 30 minutes of ventilation with high TV (10 ml/kg with zero
      end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP)) at a rate of 10 breaths/minute or low tidal volume (5 ml/kg
      with 5 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)) at a rate of 20 breaths/minute. During
      the subsequent 30 minutes, each patient received the alternative management. Minute volume
      was thus kept constant during each experimental condition. Arterial blood partial pressures,
      hemodynamic responses, and ventilatory parameters were recorded. Results are presented as
      means ± SDs; P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

    <description>One-lung ventilation was started at skin incision using a volume-controlled square-wave flow pattern. Patients were randomly assigned to 30 minutes of ventilation with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg tidal volume without external PEEP and respiratory rate of 10 breaths/minute (n=50) or to a tidal volume of 5 ml/kg with 5 cmH2O PEEP and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute (n=50). Minute volume was thus kept constant during each experimental condition.
Randomization was based on computer-generated codes that were maintained in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes until after induction of anesthesia. During the subsequent 30 minutes of one-lung ventilation, the alternative ventilatory management was used.</description>
