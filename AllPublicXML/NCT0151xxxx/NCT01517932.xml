  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2 adrenoreceptor agonist approved by the US FDA for
      short-term postoperative sedation and analgesia.It can also reduce the stress response
      without respiratory depression.

      In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study，we gave
      dexmedetomidine or saline placebo 1h before operations were over and assessed the effects of
      dexmedetomidine on stress response and postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing
      thoracotomy during anesthesia recovery period.

Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol（4-6mg kg-1h-1），remifentanil (0.1-0.2 μg kg-1 min-1）and sevoflurane（1%).Propofol was titrated to maintain intraoperative Narcotrend values between 20 and 46.
