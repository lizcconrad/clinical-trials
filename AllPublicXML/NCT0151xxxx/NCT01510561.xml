    <textblock>
      90Y-hPAM4 is administered weekly for 3 weeks combined with 4 weekly doses of gemcitabine to
      assess. This is a dose escalation study of 90Y-hPAM4 to assess which dose is safe and
      effective as 3rd line treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Patients are
      then followed weekly for 12 weeks and afterwards for up to 1 year.

    <description>Acute safety will be assessed weekly for the 1st 12 weeks, and then for up to 1 year after completion of study drug treatment. Safety will be assessed by comparing baseline hematology and chemistry laboratory values with the values obtained weekly after treatment. Safety will also be assessed by the adverse events that are reported.</description>
