      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone
      in patients who did not achieve a complete response after initial treatment with both an
      alkylating agent (Melphalan or Cyclophosphamide) and Bortezomib. Patients who received 1
      previous treatment without achieving a complete response (CR), but who could not be treated
      with alkylators and/or Bortezomib due to contraindications, will be included.

      This will be a phase II open-label single-arm dose-escalation study. Patients with systemic
      AL amyloidosis who did not achieve a complete response after initial treatment with both an
      alkylating agent (Melphalan or Cyclophosphamide) and Bortezomib will be enrolled. Patients
      who received 1 previous treatment, but who could not be treated with alkylators and/or
      Bortezomib due to contraindications, will be eligible. Twenty-eight patients will be enrolled
      in the study. The patients will be treated with the combination of Pomalidomide and
      Dexamethasone given orally in 28 day cycles continuously, i.e. until hematologic or organ
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. There will be 2 dose levels of Pomalidomide (2 and 4
      mg/day). A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used. If less than 2 of 6 patient
      experience dose limiting toxicity at dose level 1, then all other patients will be treated at
      dose level 2. There will be 2 dose levels also for Dexamethasone (20 and 40 mg/week). The
      dose of dexamethasone will be adjusted on an individual basis, considering fluid retention
      and repetitive ventricular arrhythmias at baseline, as well as Dexamethasone-related adverse
      events. The study comprises 3 periods: screening, treatment (with evaluations of response at
      the end of every single cycle) followed by the end-of-treatment evaluation and follow-up.
      After giving written informed consent, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for
      enrollment in the study and baseline evaluations will be performed. Treatment will be
      continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. After treatment
      discontinuation, patients will be followed for survival and any possible Second Primary
      Malignancies signals for 2 years.

          -  Female: FCBP with regular cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the
             first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at study
             discontinuation, and at day 28 following discontinuation from the study. If menstrual
             cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days
             and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28
             following discontinuation from the study. In addition to the required pregnancy
             testing, the Investigator must confirm with FCBP that she is continuing to use two
             reliable methods of birth control at each visit. Counseling about pregnancy
             precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be conducted at a minimum
             of every 28 days. During counseling, subjects must be reminded to not share study drug
             and to not donate blood. Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a
             subject misses her period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is
