  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular disorders can be associated with swallowing dysfunction secondary to a
      dysfunction of the airway muscles involved in swallowing. The investigators have shown that
      respiratory failure may contribute to swallowing dysfunction in patients with neuromuscular
      respiratory failure. Furthermore, although tracheostomy has been reported as impairing
      swallowing, the investigators have shown that when a tracheostomy is performed in
      neuromuscular patients, swallowing improves because it allows the patient to feed while
      ventilated.

      The investigators now want to evaluate whether non invasive ventilation may have a beneficial
      impact on swallowing by making some adjustments to ensure a good synchronisation between
      ventilation and swallowing. This could allow avoiding the necessity of a tracheostomy or a
      gastrostomy due to swallowing dysfunction and/or malnutrition in neuromuscular patients.

      Swallowing improvement under mechanical ventilation depends on improving the synchronisation
      between the patient and the ventilator during swallowing. For that purpose, the investigators
      developed a prototype ventilator able to temporarily suspend pressurisation under the
      patient's control so that when the patient needs to swallow under mechanical ventilation he
      may do so with an inadequate insufflation of the ventilator.

      Our objective is to to demonstrate that swallowing is more adapted and easier under nasal
      noninvasive ventilation than during spontaneous breathing in neuromuscular patients requiring
      prolonged noninvasive ventilation.

      In an open monocentric pilot study, the investigators will study 10 neuromuscular patients
      usually noninvasively ventilated. The patients will be their own control and their swallow
      will be studied during spontaneous breathing and under ventilation with the adapted
      ventilator while swallowing boluses of different volumes.

      Neuromuscular disorders can be associated with swallowing dysfunction secondary to a
      dysfunction of airway muscles involved in swallowing. We have shown that respiratory failure
      may also contribute to swallowing dysfunction and that, although tracheostomy has been
      reported as impairing swallowing, when a tracheostomy was performed in neuromuscular
      patients, swallowing was improved because it allowed the patient to feed while ventilated.

      We now want to evaluate whether non invasive ventilation may have a beneficial impact on
      swallowing considering some adjustments to ensure a good synchronisation between ventilation
      and swallowing. This could allow avoiding the necessity of a tracheostomy or a gastrostomy
      due to swallowing dysfunction and/or malnutrition. Improving swallowing under mechanical
      ventilation depends on improving the synchronisation between the patient and the ventilator
      during swallowing. For that purpose, we developed a prototype ventilator able to temporarily
      suspend pressurisation under the patient's control so that when the patient needs to swallow
      under mechanical ventilation he may do so with an inadequate insufflation of the ventilator.

      In an open monocentric pilot study, we will study 10 neuromuscular patients usually
      noninvasively ventilated. The patients will be their own control and their swallow will be
      studied during spontaneous breathing and under ventilation with the adapted ventilator while
      swallowing boluses of different volumes. Swallowing will be evaluated by measuring swallowing
      duration, numbers of swallows required for a bolus, number of respiratory cycles required for
      the swallow of a bolus. Order ventilation mode and bolus volume will be randomized
