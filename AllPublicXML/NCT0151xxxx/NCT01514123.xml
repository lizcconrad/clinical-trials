    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, multi-dose, first-in-human, multicenter, two arm (Arm A: VGX-100
      alone; Arm B: VGX-100 co-administered with bevacizumab), open label, dose escalation study in
      subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study is aimed at evaluating the
      safety and establishing the recommended dose of the VEGF-C human monoclonal antibody VGX-100
      when administered alone or in combination with bevacizumab.
