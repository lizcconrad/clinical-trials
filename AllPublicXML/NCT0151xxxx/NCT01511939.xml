      The purpose of this study is to see if using a topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug
      (Pennsaid) to treat osteoarthritis knee pain will affect coagulation values in patients who
      are also taking anticoagulant or antithrombotic medications.

      Open-label active treatment Phase III study of Pennsaid (diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical
      solution) to determine the effects on coagulation parameters in patients who are equal to or
      greater than 55 years of age with moderate to severe osteoarthritis knee pain and who are
      also taking warfarin, dabigatran, or aspirin and/or clopidogrel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female adults &gt; than or equal to 55

          -  Ambulatory subjects with moderate to severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee with
             symptoms and knee pain for at least 3 months and pain on the majority of days in the
             last 30 days.

          -  Subjects with bilateral knee OA, the more symptomatic knee is the index knee and
             PENNSAID can be applied on both knees if both are affected.

          -  Radiographic evidence of Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2-4 within the past 2 years.

          -  Currently on a stable dose of anticoagulant therapy (warfarin, dabigatran, aspirin or
             clopidogrel) for the past 2 months and expected to remain on current dose for the six
             week duration of the study.

          -  If currently taking oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) and/or
             acetaminophen for OA knee pain, must be taking it for at least an average of 25 days
             per month.

          -  Those currently taking oral NSAID must be willing to perform a 7 day washout to be
             eligible to be enrolled into the study.

          -  A pain score of &gt; than 40mm on the Patient Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (100 mm
             scale) at screening and baseline visit.

          -  Able to comply with the study and give informed consent prior to performance of any
             study procedures.

          -  Unwilling to abstain from oral NSAIDs and/or other analgesic medication except for
             acetaminophen as rescue medication. Subjects taking low dose aspirin for
             cardiovascular health may remain on their stable dose throughout the study.

          -  Unwilling to abstain from taking &lt; than or equal to 1500mg of acetaminophen a day for
             rescue medication purposes during the 6 week course of the trial.

             (ULN) indicative of any significant medical disease which in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the subjects participation in the study.

          -  Any of the following abnormal laboratory results during screening:

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; than or equal to
             2.5 x ULN

          -  Other serious uncontrolled non-malignant, significant, acute or chronic medical or
             psychiatric illness that, in judgment of investigator, could compromise subject
             safety, limit subject's ability to complete study and/or compromise the objectives of
             study.

          -  History of malignancy in the past 5 years with exception of resected basal cell
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or resected cervical atypia or
