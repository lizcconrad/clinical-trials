    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving erlotinib and dovitinib
      together to treat patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib blocks the
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has known activity in non-small cell lung cancer
      and dovitinib blocks the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and other targets which may
      be important to treat lung cancer. The combination of both drugs may work better than either
      drug alone, but may also have increased side effects. This trial will look at the side
      effects of combining the drugs and look for how effective the combination may be.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination of erlotinib (erlotinib
      hydrochloride) and dovitinib (dovitinib lactate), assessing for toxicity using the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of erlotinib and
      dovitinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall
      survival (OS) of patients receiving the combination of erlotinib and dovitinib, although this
      phase will allow for patients who received any number of prior treatments, including prior
      treatment with erlotinib.

      II. To evaluate the potential impact of dovitinib on erlotinib pharmacokinetics (PK).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Starting on day 15,
      patients also receive dovitinib lactate PO QD on days 1-5 of each week. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
