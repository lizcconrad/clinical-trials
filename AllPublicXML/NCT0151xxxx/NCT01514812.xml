      This study is to evaluate the effect of YM150 on the plasma concentration of digoxin in
      healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      The study will be of a double blind, randomized, two period crossover design. Two treatments,
      digoxin in combination with YM150, and digoxin in combination with placebo, will be
      evaluated. Each subject will receive both treatments in random order. Placebo will be used to
      maintain the blind. Males and females will be equally divided over the treatment orders.

      Subjects will be dosed with digoxin and either YM150 or placebo for 8 days to reach steady
      state. In the second period the subjects will receive digoxin and the alternate treatment.
      There will be a washout period of at least 10 days between the consecutive treatments. In
      both study periods the subjects will be admitted the day prior to study drug administration
      (Day 0). The subjects will be discharged on Day 10. Approximately one week after the last
      discharge, the subjects will return to the unit for a post study visit.
