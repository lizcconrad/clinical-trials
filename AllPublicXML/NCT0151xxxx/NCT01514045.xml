  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Gastric Cancer Registry will combine data acquired directly from patients with gastric
      cancer; with a family history of gastric cancer in a first or second degree relative; or
      persons with a known germline mutation in their CDH1 (E-Cadherin) gene via an online
      questionnaire with genomic data obtained from saliva, blood and tissue samples. The purpose
      of this registry is to gain better understanding of the causes of gastric cancer, both
      environmental and genetic; whether certain genomic data can predict outcomes of treatment and
      survival.

      Collect detailed clinical and epidemiological information on eligible patients via an online
      registry and a detailed patient questionnaire. Participants can opt in to contribute a blood
      or saliva sample and paraffin block samples from a previous gastric surgery.
