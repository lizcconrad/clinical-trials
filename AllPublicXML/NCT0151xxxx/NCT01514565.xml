    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study, with no control group and no direct
      experimental intervention, where the patient's pathological material will be used to examine
      the expression of molecular biomarkers believed to predict chemotherapy response. Patients
      with locally advanced triple negative breast cancer, who are candidates for neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, will be enrolled in this clinical study. Patients will receive standard of
      care, FDA-approved and clinically validated chemotherapy regimens. The biopsy specimens taken
      during the diagnostic phase (pre-treatment specimen) will be used for specific biomarker
      evaluation. Data obtained from this pre-treatment phase will be compared with the surgical
      specimens (post-treatment phase) obtained after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The
      primary endpoint is to assess the ability of specific biomarkers to predict treatment
      response, and thus identify those patients who will achieve benefit from such treatment.

      <textblock>
        A maximum of 70 eligible patients will be enrolled. Accrual is expected to be completed in
        18-24 months. All patients must have histologically confirmed triple negative breast cancer
        and be eligible to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

    <sampling_method>Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  Histologically-confirmed triple negative invasive breast carcinoma

          -  Any type of ductal or lobular invasive carcinoma

          -  Patients with or without BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are eligible to participate

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months

          -  Pre-, Peri- or Postmenopausal

          -  Clinical Stage T2-4, N0-3, M0 (Stage II-III)

          -  Patients or their legal representatives must be able to read, understand and provide
             informed consent to participate in the trial

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function and functional status that permit
             chemotherapy administration. However, these parameters will be evaluated by the
             treating physician, and decisions regarding eligibility for chemotherapy or surgery
             will be made on a case by case scenario.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of and/or active therapy for invasive breast cancer (includes
             chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy including AIs, tamoxifen, raloxifene,
             fulvestrant or any other antiestrogen/SERM)

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers are not to be registered. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently
             active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy and are now considered to be at less
             than 30% risk for relapse (by their physician).

          -  Only ductal/lobular carcinoma in situ but not invasive component

          -  Any sort of confirmed metastatic disease (AJCC Stage IV at diagnosis)

          -  Any sort of active local radiation therapy (to the breast or the axilla), before the
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy

          -  Pregnant or lactating, in case this precludes the subject to receive chemotherapy.

          -  Impossibility to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to significant medical
             comorbidities, allergies or performance status. This will be exclusively decided by
             the treating oncologists.
