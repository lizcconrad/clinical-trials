  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a multi-center, 13000 subject validation study of several
      biomarkers for early detection of colon cancer. There are stool based biomarkers and blood
      based biomarkers being validated in this study. The biomarkers will be compared with
      colonoscopy and with FIT (fecal immunohistochemistry) tests which are the current standards
      for colon cancer screening. This is an NCI-early Detection Research Network funded project.
      The population targeted for this study are those persons undergoing colonoscopy for
      screening. Prior to colonoscopy or even prepping for colonoscopy, subjects will provide blood
      and stool samples as well as specific data regarding their GI and general medical history and
      concomitant medications. If subjects are interested in participating, arrangements will be
      made to see them. The informed consent process will take place, blood will be obtained, data
      will be obtained, and the stool kit described and given to the subject to take home. Stool
      samples will be sent back to the University of Michigan using prepaid mailing labels.

  <detailed_description>

      The clinical research associate or study nurse (hereafter &quot;CRA&quot;) at each clinical site will
      identify subjects with appointments for screening colonoscopy via IRB-approved
      HIPAA-compliant site-specific methods (Appendix B-tailored to each site). Recruitment methods
      could include letters from the primary care physicians and gastroenterologists, direct
      referrals to the study team by physicians, in-clinic recruitment advertisements, and
      presentations. Interested subjects will be asked to participate in a baseline visit prior to
      initiation of colonoscopy preparative procedures, either at the local Center or during a
      visit to the subject's home by a CRA. Advertisements (e.g., newspapers, AARP Magazine,
      Clinicaltrials.gov) may also be used to recruit subjects from the surrounding communities.

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To validate various biomarkers (stool, blood, urine, FIT) as predictive tools for assessing risk of CRC. Ultimately, these markers may increasing screening and compliance with screening recommendations of CRC by triaging those at higher risk of CRC by thesenon-invasive markers. Those at higher risk of CRC based on biomarker results would be referred for colonoscopy. The assumption is that compliance with colonoscopy would increase if biomarkers suggested an increased risk.</description>
