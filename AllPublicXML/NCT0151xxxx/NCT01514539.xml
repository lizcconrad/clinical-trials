      Hormonal Regulation of Postpartum Weight and Presence of Gut Peptides in Human Milk Studies
      suggest that childbearing is an important contributor to the development of obesity in many
      women and that breastfeeding may be protective.

      Ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) are gut hormones involved in appetite regulation and energy
      homeostasis and are biological neuroendocrine signals that potentially affect body weight and
      adiposity/

      Role of Ghrelin and PYY in Postpartum Body Weight Regulation and Presence in Human Milk.

      This study evaluated whether fasting or postprandial ghrelin or PYY is different between
      lactating and nonlactating postpartum women matched for age, body weight, and adiposity.

      Eligibility Criteria: Healthy females, 18+ years old, non-smokers, no major food allergies,
      first-time mom, currently pregnant or within 1 month of giving birth.
