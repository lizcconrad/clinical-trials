    <textblock>
      Investigators from University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Department of Pediatrics and
      University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Center for Distance Health will collaborate to
      develop a mobile-based Asthma Action Plan application to improve asthma self-management
      skills specifically targeting adolescents. The investigators hypothesize that an interactive,
      mobile-based asthma action plan will be a feasible means of reinforcing long-term asthma
      management guidelines as well as delivering acute management instructions to adolescents with
      asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A written Asthma Action Plan from a healthcare provider is one of the key features of asthma
      self-management recommended by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program asthma
      guidelines; guidelines-based asthma care has not yet fully translated to the community
      despite the fact that National Asthma Education and Prevention Program released the first set
      of national guidelines nearly 2 decades ago. Previous reports have proven that patients with
      an Asthma Action Plan have better outcomes including fewer acute healthcare utilization
      visits, fewer days missed from school, and improved symptoms scores compared to patients
      without an Asthma Action Plan. Recently, mobile-based phone applications and music file (MPEG
      layer 3)(MP3) players have been utilized in the management of chronic diseases such as asthma
      and diabetes to provide medication reminders and to provide alternatives to paper dairies for
      logging symptoms or other health-related data such as peak flow readings or blood glucose
      readings. We propose to design an application that will fully meet the recommended
      individualized Asthma Action Plan treatment plan as recommended by national guidelines and
      will also provide participants with medication reminders, education tips, and data
      logging/tracking capabilities.

    <description>The Child Self-Efficacy instrument is a 14 item validated questionnaire designed to measure the child's self-efficacy with regard to attack prevention and attack management. The child will be required to select one of 5 responses ranging from &quot;not at all sure&quot; (1 point); &quot;a little bit sure&quot; (2 points); &quot;fairly sure&quot; (3 points); &quot;quite sure&quot; (4 points) to &quot;completely sure&quot; (5 points). Total score range from 14-70. The higher score represent a greater degree of self-efficacy. The Cronbach's α reliability = 0.75. The child self-efficacy questionnaire will be administered at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the end of the intervention (post-intervention).</description>

    <measure>Asthma Control Test™ Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Control Test™ (ACT) is a 5 question health survey used to measure asthma control in individuals 12 years of age and older. The total sum scores range from 5-25. Higher scores mean that asthma is more controlled. The ACT is an efficient, reliable, and valid method of measuring asthma control, with or without, lung functioning measures such as spirometry. ACT helps identify and detect asthma patients who are not well controlled. ACT scores were examined pre- and post-intervention. A score total of 19 or less means asthma may not be well controlled. The timeframe is during the past 4 weeks. The scale range for Question 1 is &quot;all the time&quot; (1) to &quot;none of the time&quot; (5); Question 2 range: &quot;more than once a day&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 3 range: &quot;4 or more nights a week&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 4 range: &quot;3 or more times per day&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 5 range: &quot;not controlled at all&quot; (1) to &quot;completely controlled&quot; (5).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 12 and ≤ 17 years.

          -  Mild to severe persistent asthma or poorly controlled asthma. If a child has used a
             preventive medication in the past, but reports no use of the medication in the prior 3
             months, we will assess severity.

          -  Children not using a preventive medication at baseline: We will assess for mild
             persistent to severe persistent asthma. Any one of the following, during the prior 4
             weeks (as defined by parent interview) will determine severity:

          -  An average of &gt;2 days per week with asthma symptoms

          -  &gt;2 days per week with rescue medication use

          -  ≥2 nights per month awakened with nighttime symptoms

          -  Minor limitation of activity

          -  ≥2 episodes of asthma during the past year that have required systemic
             corticosteroids.

          -  Children using a preventive medication at baseline: We will assess for poorly
             controlled asthma. Any 1 of the following, during the prior 4 weeks (as defined by
             parent interview in the waiting room) will determine control:

          -  An average of &gt;2 days per week with asthma symptoms

          -  &gt;2 days per week with rescue medication use

          -  ≥2 nights per month awakened with nighttime symptoms

          -  Some limitation of activity

          -  ≥2 episodes of asthma during the past year that have required systemic
             corticosteroids.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant underlying respiratory disease other than asthma (such as cystic fibrosis
             or chronic lung disease) that could potentially interfere with asthma-related outcome
             measures.

          -  Significant co-morbid conditions (such as moderate to severe developmental delay, i.e.
             special education classroom or diagnosis) that could preclude participation in an
             education-based intervention.

          -  Inability to speak or understand English (child or parent).

          -  Children in foster care or other situations in which consent cannot be obtained from a
             guardian.

          -  Prior enrollment in the study.

        <description>The Child Self-Efficacy instrument is a 14 item validated questionnaire designed to measure the child's self-efficacy with regard to attack prevention and attack management. The child will be required to select one of 5 responses ranging from “not at all sure” (1 point); &quot;a little bit sure&quot; (2 points); &quot;fairly sure&quot; (3 points); &quot;quite sure&quot; (4 points) to “completely sure” (5 points). Total score range from 14-70. The higher score represent a greater degree of self-efficacy. The Cronbach’s α reliability = 0.75. The child self-efficacy questionnaire will be administered at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the end of the intervention (post-intervention).</description>

        <title>Asthma Control Test™ Scores</title>
        <description>The Asthma Control Test™ (ACT) is a 5 question health survey used to measure asthma control in individuals 12 years of age and older. The total sum scores range from 5-25. Higher scores mean that asthma is more controlled. The ACT is an efficient, reliable, and valid method of measuring asthma control, with or without, lung functioning measures such as spirometry. ACT helps identify and detect asthma patients who are not well controlled. ACT scores were examined pre- and post-intervention. A score total of 19 or less means asthma may not be well controlled. The timeframe is during the past 4 weeks. The scale range for Question 1 is &quot;all the time&quot; (1) to &quot;none of the time&quot; (5); Question 2 range: &quot;more than once a day&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 3 range: &quot;4 or more nights a week&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 4 range: &quot;3 or more times per day&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 5 range: &quot;not controlled at all&quot; (1) to &quot;completely controlled&quot; (5).</description>
