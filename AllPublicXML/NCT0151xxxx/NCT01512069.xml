  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life style interventions that promote exercise and a healthy diet, which have the potential
      to improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL), may be particularly appropriate for cancer
      survivors. The previous studies suggested that a key strategy to implement sustainable
      healthy behavior and improve health was providing appropriate feedback and promoting
      self-efficacy. Web-based program enables to provide the feedback in a timely manner on a
      daily basis, to continue the healthy behaviors.

      Therefore, the investigators developed a web-based, stage-matched Exercise and Diet Planning
      program, and whether the program can promote significantly greater changes in behavioral
      outcomes [goal of exercise (energy expenditure of aerobic exercise ≥ 12.5 kcal/kg/week) and
      diet (intake of vegetables ≥ 5 serv/day and intake of fruit ≥ 1 serv/day)], stage of changes
      for exercise and diet, psychosocial outcomes (HRQOL, fatigue, anxiety and depression) and
      self-efficacy in implementing goal of exercise and diet among breast cancer survivors in
      Korea was examined.

      Hypotheses were following:

        1. Survivors of a group participating in a web-based, stage-matched Exercise and Diet
           Planning program (hereinafter called the 'intervention group') will show a more advanced
           stage of change for exercise and diet compared to survivors in the control group.

        2. The intervention group will show a higher proportion of attaining goal of exercise (or
           higher level of energy expenditure of aerobic exercise) compared to the control group.

        3. The intervention group will show a higher proportion of attaining goal of diet (or
           higher level of diet quality) compared to the control group.

        4. The intervention group will show a better HRQOL level compared to the control group.

        5. The intervention group will show a better self-efficacy level compared to the control
           group.

        6. The intervention group will show a lower fatigue level compared to the control group.

        7. The intervention group will show less anxiety compared to the control group.

        8. The intervention group will show less depression compared to the control group.

      The purpose of the study was to develop a web-based, stage-matched Exercise and Diet Planning
      program and to examine effects of the program on implementation of exercise and diet,
      self-efficacy, HRQOL, fatigue, anxiety and depression among breast cancer survivors.

      All participants were recruited from two tertiary university hospitals and the National
      Cancer Center in Korea.

The program is 12-week program, provides tailored information on the exercise and diet based on the stage of motivational readiness of TTM. The program is designed to allow to plan a regular exercise of 12.5 MET per week and to recommend to eat number of portions from six food groups for balanced diet tailored to individual's BMI, ideal body weight, and calories needed per day. The program provide the feedback based on the achievement of goals of the behaviors.</description>
