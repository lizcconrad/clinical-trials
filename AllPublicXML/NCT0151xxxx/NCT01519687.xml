  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      levotofisopam in patients with hyperuricemia and gout, and (2) to evaluate the effect of
      treatment with levotofisopam on serum urate levels in these patients.
