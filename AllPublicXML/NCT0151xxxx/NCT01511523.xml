      A research study of a compound containing vitamin E, silymarin and carnitine, three over the
      counter supplements. The investigators hope to learn if the new supplement can safely and
      successfully treat fatty liver disease or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).

             research, diagnostic or treatment purposes.

          2. Positive test at screening for anti-HAV IgM Ab, HBsAg, anti-HBc IgM Ab, or anti-HIV
             Ab.

          3. History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease
             other than NAFLD (e.g., hemochromatosis, viral or autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's
             disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, alcoholic liver disease, and/or toxin exposure).

          4. Females who are pregnant or breast feeding.

             g/L) in males at screening.

          7. Any patient with a baseline increased risk for anemia (e.g., thalassemia, sickle cell
             anemia, spherocytosis, history of gastrointestinal bleeding) or for whom anemia would
             be medically problematic.

          8. Patients with history of severe psychiatric disease, including psychosis and/or severe
             depression, characterized by a suicide attempt, hospitalization for psychiatric
             disease, or a period of disability as a result of psychiatric disease must have a
             psychiatric evaluation at screening to ensure the patient is now stable and the
             patient must agree to have continued monitoring by a mental health specialist at least
             every 4 weeks during the study.

          9. History of immunologically mediated disease [(e.g., vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia,
             inflammatory bowel disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lupus erythematosus,
             autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma, severe psoriasis (defined as affecting &gt; 10%
             of the body, where the palm of one hand equals 1%, or if the hands and feet are
             affected), rheumatoid arthritis requiring more than intermittent nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory medications for management, etc.

         10. Patients with evidence of decompensated liver disease including but not limited to
             ascites, esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy.

         11. History of any systemic anti-neoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment (including
             supraphysiologic doses of steroids and radiation) 6 months prior to the first dose of
             study drug or the expectation that such treatment will be needed at any time during
             the study

             hypoalbuminemia, ascites, and bleeding from esophageal varices are conditions
             consistent with decompensated liver disease.

         13. One or more of the following conditions: (1) poorly controlled hypertension, OR (2)
             screening or baseline blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg for systolic OR (3) screening or
             baseline blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure.

             without stent placement, etc.) as confirmed by a cardiologist will be permitted. In
             addition, patients with documented or presumed unstable coronary artery disease,
             stable or unstable cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease, or second or
