  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment, including difficulty with solving problems, planning, attention,
      or recalling information, can be a significant problem for individuals with Parkinson's
      disease. Even mild cognitive difficulties can lead to worse functioning, quality of life,
      depression, and difficulty for caregivers. Thus, ideally treatment at this stage would
      improve both cognitive symptoms and some of the other problems associated with these
      symptoms.

      Despite the fact that mild cognitive impairment is a serious problem for Parkinson's disease
      patients little is known about how best to treat it. This study is a 24-week clinical trial
      to see if a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug, the Exelon (rivastigmine)
      Patch, is useful in treating mild cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease.
      Currently, the Exelon (rivastigmine) Patch is FDA-approved for the treatment of mild to
      moderate dementia in Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease patients.

      This study has 2 phases. Each phase will last 10 weeks and there will be a 4-week break
      between the 2 phases. Thus, you will be enrolled in the study for a total of 24 weeks. Over
      the course of the 24-week period we will schedule to see you in-person 6 times and check-in
      with you on the telephone 4 times, 2 times during each phase.

      Phase I

      Screening (may be the same day as the baseline visit) - Research personnel will determine if
      you are eligible to participate in this study.

      Visit 1 - Baseline Visit, Start Study Medication

      Phone Call 1 - Check in to see how you are feeling after starting the study medication

      Visit 2 - 4 Weeks after Baseline, Increase Study Medication if tolerated

      Phone Call 2 - Check in to see how you are feeling after increasing the study medication

      Visit 3/ Phase I Termination Visit - 10 Weeks after Baseline (Phase I Termination Visit)

      4 Week Break (no study medication)

      Phase II

      Visit 4/ Phase II Baseline - 14 Weeks after Baseline, Start Study Medication

      Phone Call 3 - Check in to see how you are feeling after starting the study medication

      Visit 5 - 18 Weeks after Baseline, Increase Study Medication

      Phone Call 4 - Check in to see how you are feeling after increasing the study medication

      Visit 6/Phase II and Study Termination Visit - 24 Weeks after Baseline

      Visits 1, 3, 4, and 6 will last for about 2 ½ hours and visits 2 and 5 about 30 minutes. The
      'check in' phone calls will last approximately 5-10 minutes.

      After 24 weeks, your study participation will be over.

It will also be administered in the clinical trial at baseline and the final visits of each phase as a secondary outcome measure of global cognition. Scores on the MoCA range from 0-30 with 26-30 indicating normal global cognition.</description>

          <title>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study- Clinical Global Impression Change (ADCS-CGIC)</title>
          <description>The ADCS-CGIC is the most commonly used measure of global change in dementia psychopharmacology studies. This assessment is a measure of change, thus it is not appropriate for baseline administration and only administered at the end of phase visit.
The scale rates total improvement on a 7 point scale:
= Very much improved
= Much improved
= Minimally improved
= No change
= Minimally worse
= Much worse
= Very much worse
A participant scoring a 1 or 2 is considered a responder on the CGI scale.</description>
          <population>Please note this study utilized the crossover design (i.e. participants were exposed to two phases of treatment, one with placebo and one with Exelon patch). The data are comparing differences in treatment groups. Over the course of this study 2 participants discontinued study participation.</population>
