    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending
      multiple-dose study of VIA-3196 to evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
      of VIA-3196 in Healthy Subjects. Study dosing is organized into cohorts corresponding to
      escalating doses of VIA-3196 or matching placebo. Subjects will be dosed daily for 14 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Healthy, non-smoking, males and females between the ages of 18 and 55 years of age
             (inclusive).

          -  If female, the subject is of non-child bearing potential (i.e., surgically [bilateral
             oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or tubal ligation] or naturally sterile [&gt;12 consecutive
             months without menses]). Verify by FSH at screening as appropriate.

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  LDL cholesterol â‰¥ 110mg/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of thyroid disorder or abnormal thyroid function tests at screening. Repeat
             testing is allowed once at the discretion of the Investigator. - History of
             unexplained syncope.

          -  History of hepatobiliary disease; or AST, ALT or direct bilirubin greater than the
             upper limit of reference range at screening.

          -  Positive screening test for HIV antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C
             antibody.

          -  Abnormal screening ECG: including machine-read QTc &gt;450 msec (confirmed by manual over
             read), QRS &gt;110 msec, intermittent bundle branch block, frequent premature atrial or
             premature ventricular contractions, or any rhythm other than normal sinus rhythm which
             is interpreted by the Investigator to be clinically significant.

          -  History of sensitivity to a similar study drug (e.g., Karo Bio KB2115 or Metabasis
             MB7811), or a history of important drug or other allergy (except for untreated,
             asymptomatic seasonal allergies at time of dosing) unless deemed not clinically
             significant by the Investigator.

          -  History of sensitivity to thyroid medication.

          -  History of asthma, or intolerance to beta-blockers.

          -  Use of acetaminophen within 7 days before dosing and throughout the study.

          -  History of regular use of tobacco or nicotine containing products within the past 6
             months.

          -  Positive urine drug screen or alcohol test at screening or Day -1.
