  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognosis for many carcinomas, including ovarian carcinoma, is dependent on a complete
      surgical resection, also known as a R0 resection. At present, the ability to perform a
      complete resection with negative margins is limited by the surgeon's ability to palpate and
      visualize the tumor and its margins. Therefore, in order to reduce operative morbidity and
      costs while maintaining or improving surgical and oncologic outcomes, the investigators must
      develop technologies that improve visualization of the primary tumor and occult metastases,
      real time, during surgery. Recent research has demonstrated that the use of fluorescent
      probes that recognize cancer specific antigens can be used for this purpose when visualized
      using a prototype near-infrared multispectral imaging system.

      This investigation will determine if folate-FITC, a fluorescent probe that recognizes the
      folate receptor (present in &gt; 90% of ovarian cancers) can facilitate surgical resection and
      detect tumor nodules not visible to the naked eye.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity and specificity of intra-operative imaging using Folate-FITC for identification of ovarian cancer metastatic to the peritoneum and lymph nodes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>A maximum of 5 nodules less than 1cm in size will be identified in each patient with the naked eye and then visualized with the camera. The nodules will be biopsied after determining if they are fluorescent positive or negative (F+ or F-), and examined microscopically to confirm if carcinoma is present. Up to 5 F+ lesions that were not identified with the naked eye will also be biopsied and examined microscopically to determine if carcinoma is present. These data will establish the sensitivity and specificity of this technique using microscopic analysis as the gold standard.</description>
