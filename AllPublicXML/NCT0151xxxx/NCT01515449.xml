      The aim of the project is to ascertain the pre and intra operative predictors of poor
      outcomes in total knee replacement.

      It is known that surgical outcomes are good in the majority following a Sigma knee at 5
      years. 3% have persistent pain. Is it possible to predict these patients? Is it possible to
      make a determination as to which of the 3 outcome measures ((1) American Knee Society Score;
      (2) SF12 Oxford 12 and (3) Complications) is most appropriate to use and when is the most
      appropriate time to use it

    <description>A prospective database was set up in October 1998. Patient details were collected preoperatively, intra operatively and immediately post operatively. Patients are then followed up in a dedicated knee clinic at 6 months, 18 months, 3 years and 5 years. Data such as SF12 and the American Knee Society Score was done at each visit</description>
