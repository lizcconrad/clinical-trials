      Background:

        -  Opioid-withdrawal symptoms include runny nose, body aches, chills, sweating, and
           diarrhea. Many people have these symptoms when trying to stop using opioid drugs.
           Long-acting opioids like methadone and buprenorphine are used to help people stop using
           other opioids, but these drugs can cause the same withdrawal symptoms. There are no
           non-opioid drugs that are approved specifically to treat those symptoms.

        -  Pioglitazone is a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes. In a research study, the drug
           allowed heroin users to decrease their methadone dose faster without much discomfort,
           and stay abstinent from heroin. Researchers want to learn more about how pioglitazone
           helps treat opioid withdrawal symptoms.

      Objectives:

      - To test whether pioglitazone can reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who will be using buprenorphine to treat opioid
      dependency.

      Design:

        -  This study will last up to 17 weeks. Participants must come to the study clinic every
           day for at least 13 weeks.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           answer questions about drug use habits, and provide blood and urine samples.

        -  Participants will take buprenorphine daily for 7 weeks. For the first 3 weeks, the dose
           will be increased to a level that should help stop the use of opioids. For the next 4
           weeks, the dose will be decreased. Blood, urine, and breath samples will be collected at
           different study visits. Participants will also fill out questionnaires about mood, drug
           craving, and withdrawal symptoms.

        -  After 1 week on buprenorphine, participants will start the study pill (pioglitazone or a
           placebo) every day. They will take the study pill for 13 weeks.

        -  During the treatment period, participants will have drug counseling once a week for 30
           minutes.

        -  Some participants have other tests as part of this study. These tests include functional
           magnetic resonance imaging scans to look for changes in brain activity and giving
           samples of cerebrospinal fluid to study brain chemistry.

        -  Participants will have a final followup phone call 3 weeks after the last clinic visit.

      Background:

      Some individuals successfully maintained on buprenorphine or methadone are appropriate
      candidates for dose tapering and transition to medication-free follow-up care. For such
      individuals, the physical discomfort of the dose taper can be a barrier to a successful
      transition. Recent data suggest a novel approach: the FDA-approved diabetes medication
      pioglitazone (Actos), which activates the gamma (g) subtype of
      peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Pioglitazone acts not only in peripheral
      tissue, but also in brain regions associated with drug tolerance and withdrawal. In animal
      models, pioglitazone prevents signs of opioid withdrawal. In a small, preliminary open-label
      clinical study, opioid-maintained outpatients given pioglitazone were remarkably successful
      in transitioning comfortably to a medication-free state, after prior unsuccessful attempts
      without pioglitazone. These initial data provide proof of principle and indicate that
      pioglitazone merits evaluation in a randomized-controlled study.

      Scientific goals:

      (1) To determine whether, compared to placebo, pioglitazone increases successful completion
      of an opioid agonist/antagonist taper in patients who are physically dependent on opioids.
      (2) To determine the neural mechanisms by which such an effect may occur.

      Participant population:

      A total of up to 120 opioid-dependent participants (80 evaluable) will be enrolled. Evaluable
      participants are defined as those who are randomized to one of the two main experimental
      groups (pioglitazone or placebo). Target enrollment will include 25% women and 70% minorities
      (mostly African-American).

      Experimental design and methods:

      The study will be a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with two treatment groups (40 per
      group): pioglitazone (45 mg oral daily) and placebo. The study will last up to 10 weeks. All
      participants will receive 27 days of buprenorphine/naloxone (referred to hereinafter as
      buprenorphine) - 14 days of stabilization and a 13-day taper. Pioglitazone/placebo will be
      initiated in week 2 and continue for 5 weeks (3 weeks concurrently with buprenorphine and 2
      weeks without). Participants will have two follow-up assessments: a clinic visit (week 7 or
      one week post-pioglitazone/placebo) and a phone follow-up (week 10 or 4 weeks
      post-pioglitazone/placebo). Participation will be conducted as a combination of outpatient
      and inpatient portions: first two weeks (pre-buprenorphine taper) as outpatients; 18 days on
      an inpatient unit (JHBC CRU) during and for approximately 5 days after the buprenorphine
      taper; and 10 daily visits and two follow-up visits outpatient. Throughout the study,
      participants will receive weekly individual counseling, including case management to prepare
      for post-study treatment. Data on opiate-withdrawal symptoms and craving will be collected
      daily. Data on self-reported drug use, with urine specimens for drug testing, will be
      collected three times weekly. A subset of participants will undergo functional
      magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic-resonance spectroscopy (MRS): one training
      session in the mock scanner and two scanning sessions that will occur at the end of the first
      week of buprenorphine and during the second week of the buprenorphine taper. Another subset
      of participants (largely overlapping with the subset who undergo fMRI/MRS) will undergo one
      lumbar puncture so that we can measure levels of neurotransmitters, metabolites, and
      proinflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At the lumbar-puncture visit, blood
      will also be drawn so that we can compare analyte levels in CSF and blood. At the end of the
      study, all participants will be offered assistance to transfer to another treatment program,
      either drug-free treatment or opioid-agonist treatment (OAT). The primary outcome measures
      will be opioid-withdrawal severity as measured on the SOWs and COWs. Secondary outcome
      measures will include overall proportions of opioid-negative urines, proportions of
      participants needing adjunct medications, time to resumption of opioid use following
      discharge from the residential unit, status at follow-up, and (in the subset of participants
      who agree to undergo lumbar puncture) CSF levels (and corresponding blood levels) of
      proinflammatory cytokines and other analytes, which we hypothesize will predict outcome and
      thereby clarify pioglitazone s mechanism of action. In the subset of participants who agree
      to undergo fMRI/MRS and lumbar puncture, we will attempt to determine the neural mediators of
      pioglitazone s therapeutic effects, or (if pioglitazone is not effective) to determine
      predictors of treatment outcome. Post-treatment outcome measures are expected to be affected
      only indirectly by pioglitazone; we anticipate that pioglitazone will reduce withdrawal
      symptoms, enhance initial abstinence during the buprenorphine taper, and address possible
      protracted withdrawal.

      Benefits to participants and/or society:

      Participants will receive buprenorphine taper and drug counseling. There may be incidental
      benefits from the buprenorphine and counseling, because they are likely to reduce
      participants' use of opioids and risk of infectious diseases such as HIV or hepatitis B and
      C.

      Risks to participants:

      Participants may experience side effects from pioglitazone and/or buprenorphine/naloxone and
      are likely to experience some discomfort from opioid withdrawal. The subset of participants
      who agree to undergo lumbar puncture and fMRI/MRS may experience side effects from those
      procedures.

          8. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 or higher

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for the fMRI portion of the Study:

        Exclusion from the MRI component of the study will be based on the criteria outlined below.
        Participants who do not qualify or who do not agree to participate in the fMRI portion of
        the study will not be excluded from the main study. Exclusion criteria will be assessed
        during screening under NIDA-IRP screening protocol 06-DA-N415. Participants will be
        excluded from the fMRI portion of the study if they:

          1. are left handed. Justification: Some of the neural processes assessed in this protocol
             may be lateralized in the brain. In order to reduce potential variance, participants
             will be required to be right-handed. Assessment tool(s): Edinburgh Handedness
             Inventory.

          2. over the age of 55 years. Justification: Many cognitive processes change with age. In
             addition, the likelihood of difficult-to-detect medical abnormalities such as silent
             cerebral infarcts increases with age. Therefore, older individuals, defined as those
             over 55, will be

             excluded from the present study.

          3. have certain implanted devices (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial
             joints, metal pins, surgical clips or other implanted metal parts), body morphology,
             or claustrophobia. Justification: Implanted devices may increase the risk of MRI
             scanning and/or adversely affect the quality of the data; body morphology may prevent
             optimal positioning in the scanner and thus affect the quality of the data;
             participants with claustrophobia may find the MRI scan too unpleasant and may exhibit
             excess movement that will adversely affect the quality of the data. Assessment
             tool(s): Prospective participants will fill out an MRI screening questionnaire and
             undergo an interview with an MR technologist. Questions concerning suitability for
             scanning will be referred to the MR Medical Advisory Investigator. Prospective
             participants will be questioned about symptoms of claustrophobia and placed in the
             mock scanner during their first visit to assess for possible difficulty tolerating the
             confinement of the scanner and for ability to fit into the scanner.

          4. have conditions restricting their ability to lie flat for several hours (such as
             coagulopathies, superficial or deep vein thrombosis, or musculoskeletal
             abnormalities). Justification: MR scanning sessions require participants to lie flat
             on their backs and remain perfectly still for approximately two hours. Therefore,
             conditions that would make that difficult (e.g. chronic back pain, significant
             scoliosis) or dangerous (e.g. familial hypercoagulability syndrome, history of
             thrombosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment tool(s): History and physical examination
             by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with a trial of lying in the mock scanner
             to assess comfort.

          5. are cognitively impaired or learning disabled. Justification: Cognitive impairment and
             learning disabilities may be associated with altered brain functioning in regions
             recruited during laboratory task performance. Assessment tool(s): History of placement
             in special education classes as a consequence of serious learning problems and not
             solely as a consequence of behavioral problems, assessed during the History and
             Physical screening assessment.

          6. have HIV or Syphilis. Justification: HIV and syphilis can each have CNS sequelae,
             introducing unnecessary variability into the data. Assessment tool(s): Oral HIV
             followed by blood test if oral test is + and Syphilis Treponemal Test (STT) without
             history of adequate treatment.

          7. regularly use any medications that would alter CNS function, cardiovascular function,
             or neuronal-vascular coupling. This includes prescription medications (e.g.,
             antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, barbiturates),
             over-the-counter medications (e.g., cold medicine), or herbal medications (e.g., Kava,
             Gingko biloba, St. John s wort). The only exceptions are the study medications.
             Justification: The use of these substances may alter the fMRI signal and/or neural
             functions of interest. Assessment tool(s): History and comprehensive urine drug
             screening to detect antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants,
             and barbiturates.

          8. have any current or prior neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, those
             listed in the main exclusion criteria. Justification: Neurological diseases alter CNS
             function and, possibly, the neuronal-vascular coupling that forms the basis of the
             fMRI signal. Assessment tool(s): History and physical examination by a qualified IRP
             clinician, adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, urine drug screening for anticonvulsants not
             disclosed by history.

          9. have any other major medical condition that in the view of the investigators would
             compromise the integrity of the data. Justification: Many illness not explicitly
             covered here may alter important outcome measures. Assessment tool(s): History and
             physical examination by a qualified IRP clinician and CBC, urinalysis, NIDA chemistry
             panel (liver function tests, electrolytes, kidney function). Determination of
             exclusionary status will be based on laboratory values outlined in Table I for the
             main study, but the MAI will retain discretion to exclude participants from the
             fMRI/MRS secondary study based on less extreme lab results. After the screening
             process has been completed, the MAI will take into account all data collected in order
             to decide if there is an existing medical illness that would compromise participation
             in this research.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for the lumbar-puncture portion of the study

          1. Bleeding diathesis/coagulopathy

          2. Platelet count &lt;50,000 and INR (International Normalized Ratio) greater than or equal
             to 1.5, or on Warfarin (coumadin)

          3. Evidence of intracerebral mass based on history, neurologic exam, or papilledema on
             fundoscopic exam

          4. Clinically significant lumbar spine disease by history, e.g. degenerative disk
             disease, ankylosing spondylitis or previous lumbar surgery

          5. History of abnormal cranial CT scan or MRI scan, suggesting the possibility of
             increased intracranial pressure
