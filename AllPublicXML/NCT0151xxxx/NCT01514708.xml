      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to the influenza vaccine
      (AdimFlu-S), as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) at 4 weeks post immunization in
      pregnant women in compliance with the requirements of the current European Union (EU)
      recommendations for the evaluation of the immunogenicity for a new formulation of a licensed
      flu vaccine (CPMP/BWP/214/96). Besides, the vaccine safety will also be evaluated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint will be the seroprotection rate which is defined as the proportion of subjects with HAI titer ≥ 1:40. The other immunogenicity endpoints include seroconversion rate and geometric mean folds increase in HAI titer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immunogenicity profile was assessed before vaccination, 4 weeks after the vaccination and at the end of gestation period. Moreover, the HAI titer of the cord blood was also measured and compared with the maternal blood sample.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be the seroprotection rate which is defined as the proportion of subjects with HAI titer ≥ 1:40. The other immunogenicity endpoints include seroconversion rate and geometric mean folds increase in HAI titer. Immunogenicity profile will be assessed before vaccination, 4 weeks after the vaccination and at the end of gestation period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary endpoint is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles including the presence or absence of the pre-specified reactogenicity events and other serious/non-serious adverse events of the AdimFlu-S.</measure>
    <time_frame>The safety information is collected from the day of vaccination to 8 weeks after the delivery.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety outcomes include immediate reactions at the time of vaccination, solicited local and systemic reactions for 7 days, unsolicited adverse events until the first post-vaccination serum collected (Day 28), and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest until 8 weeks after the delivery.</description>
