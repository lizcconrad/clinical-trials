  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG) has been used as an injectable filler for soft tissue
      augmentation in different parts of the body , such as face, breast , or even penis for more
      than a decade . However, there are never reports about the application of a large amount of
      PAAG in epicranial aponeurosis to change the contour of the upper cranium accompanied with
      leukocytopenia. This fancy application turned out to be a disaster for the women who suffered
      from leukocytopenia , widespread migration of PAAG, recurrent swelling of the affected
      tissues and temporal pain changing with the temperature and the facial expression .
