  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response in dialysis patents to each of
      the three influenza vaccine strains included in the licensed seasonal flu vaccine
      (Formulation 2011-2012).

    <textblock>
      The immune response to influenza vaccine was poor in dialysis population than general
      population. The investigators want to evaluate another booster vaccination can improve the
      immune response in dialysis population. All enrolled participants will be divided into 3
      groups: participants refused to receive vaccination, those receive either one (week 0) or one
      more booster vaccination (week 0 and week 3). The investigators will collect serum of
      participants 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks and 18 weeks post vaccination and evaluate the
      difference of immune response in these 3 groups.

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the seroprotection rate which is defined as the proportion of subjects with HI titer ≥ 1:40. MicroNT-ELISA assay will also be used to evaluate the immune response post vaccination. The immune response based on microNT-ELISA antibody titers would be reported as antibody titer ≥1: 40 or ≥ 1:160 respectively because no threshold of protective NT antibody titer is clearly defined by the international guidelines.</description>
