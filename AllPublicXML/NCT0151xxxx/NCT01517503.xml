  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effectiveness of Cognitive Therapy and Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy in a randomized controlled trial among patients with Major Depressive
      Disorder in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, the study will investigate whether each
      specific treatment approach is mediated by its proposed theoretical mechanism.

      The current study aims at investigating the effectiveness of Cognitive Therapy and Acceptance
      and Commitment Therapy in a randomized controlled trial among patients with MDD in routine
      clinical practice. Further, the study will investigate whether each specific treatment
      approach is mediated by its proposed theoretical mechanism. Patients have to meet diagnostic
      criteria for nonpsychotic MDD as determined by the Structured Interview for DSM-IV. Each
      client will receive either Cognitive Therapy or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy that will
      last between 16 to 20 sessions. Based on previous results, it is expected that both treatment
      forms will prove beneficial for the patients.
