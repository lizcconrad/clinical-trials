      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Dialectical Behavior
      Therapy (DBT) versus CAMS (Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality) -informed
      supportive psychotherapy on the risk of self-harm acts and suicide attempts in patients with
      self behavior and personality traits within the spectrum of borderline personality disorder.

      Hypothesis: The hypothesis is 16 weeks of treatment with Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
      after a defined manual has a higher efficacy than CAMS-informed supportive psychotherapy on
      self-harm acts, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, impulsiveness and
      consumption of hospital services in patients with symptoms within the spectrum of borderline
      personality disorder (BDP).

      Method: The investigators will include 160 patients in the randomized trial to investigate
      whether 16 weeks of DBT-treatment as a higher efficacy than CAMS-informed supportive
      psychotherapy on the risk of self-harm acts and suicide attempts in patients with self-harm
      behavior and personality traits within the spectrum of borderline personality disorder. The
      trial will meet strict criteria for high quality randomized trials, and will hopefully help
      to establish evidence for the treatment of this patient group at higher risk of later
      suicide. There will be performed follow up interviews after 16 weeks, 28 weeks and 52 weeks.
