      This is a two-part, Phase 1 open label, single-center, dose escalation study of KHK2898 as
      monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy
      or for whom no standard therapy is available.

      The study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, a standard 3+3 designed dose escalation
      phase, subjects will receive KHK2898, administered intravenously, once every 2 weeks. A
      treatment cycle will consists of total of two doses per cycle. Part 2 of the study will
      enroll subjects with squamous cell type tumor to receive KHK2898 at a dose to be determined
      following completion of Part 1.

      All subjects will receive study therapy until disease progression, the development of
      unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or Investigator
      decision, up to a maximum of six cycles (approximately six months). After six cycles of
      KHK2898 therapy, the subject may continue to receive the drug after discussion with the
      Sponsor and determination that the subject is experiencing a best response of at least stable
      disease (SD) and is not experiencing any unacceptable toxicities or dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs).

             chemotherapy; anti-cancer hormonal therapy other than LH-RH agonists/pure antagonists
             for prostate cancer, which are allowed to be continued if the subject has already been
             on one for at least 2 months at the time of enrollment; immunotherapies including
             other monoclonal antibodies, interferons, cancer vaccines, etc; targeted small
             molecule anti-cancer therapies; and radiation therapy (radiation therapy should be
