  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common cause for children seeking care in the Emergency Department (ED). Children
      with orthopedic injuries often require pain control when seeking emergency care. Despite the
      high prevalence of ED visits requiring pain control, pain is often poorly assessed and
      treated in ED settings. Currently, no standard of care exists for the management of this
      fracture-related pain in children discharged from the ED. Furthermore, discrepancies in
      analgesia administration to patients of various racial groups seeking emergency care have
      been documented but are poorly understood. No research currently exists comparing pain
      severity between upper extremity fractures requiring simple splinting to those treated with
      sedated reduction and splinting. Furthermore, there is no research regarding the prevalence
      of significant post-discharge pain nor the differences among ethnic and age groups treated in
      the ED.

      Research Questions:

      What is the prevalence of significant post-discharge pain in children treated for upper
      extremity fractures?

      Is there a difference in severity between those children requiring reduction versus simple
      splinting?

      Is there a difference in pain severity noted among different ethnic or age groups?

      Design This is a prospective, un-blinded, observational study that will include patients
      seeking treatment for an upper extremity fracture.
