    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average glycemic control over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test, was identified as less than 6.5 percent by the study-specific central laboratory used. Change from baseline in percentage of HbA1C was reported.</description>

    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average glycemic control over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test, was identified as less than 6.5 percent by the study-specific central laboratory used. Change from baseline in percentage of HbA1C was reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Less Than 6.5 Percent and Less Than 7 Percent Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Levels at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average glycemic control over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test, was identified as less than 6.5 percent by the study-specific central laboratory used and data are presented in categories of less than 6.5 percent and less than 7 percent.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Increase From Baseline Electrocardiogram (ECG) Data</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who met the criteria for increase from baseline in ECG data were reported. Criteria for increase from baseline data: PR interval (percent change of greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 25/50% [if baseline value was &gt;200 then percent change of &gt;25% counts; if baseline value was &lt;=200 then percent change of &gt;50% counts]); QRS complex (percent change of &gt;=50%); QT Fridericia's correction (QTcF) interval (change of &gt;= 30 to &lt;60 millisecond [msec], and change of &gt;=60 msec).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who met the criteria for increase or decrease in vital signs data were reported. Criteria for increase or decrease from baseline vital signs data: sitting systolic blood pressure (BP) of &gt;=30 millimeter of mercury (mmHg); sitting diastolic BP of &gt;=20 mmHg and pulse rate was based on investigator's discretion.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to 14 days after last dose of study treatment (up to 101 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 14 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

    <description>A hypoglycemic event was identified by characteristic symptoms or blood glucose levels. HAE was defined as 1 of the given definitions: Characteristic symptoms of HAE with no home glucose monitoring performed where clinical picture included prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous glucose; or characteristic symptoms of HAE with home glucose monitoring measurement =&lt; 70 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) using ACCU-CHEK plasma-referenced home glucometers or =&lt;74 mg/dL using International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) referenced ACCU-CHEK or central laboratory glucometers; or any laboratory glucose value, meeting the following criterion with or without accompanying symptoms: =&lt;49 mg/dL using ACCU-CHEK plasma-referenced home glucometers or =&lt;53 mg/dL using IFCC referenced ACCU-CHEK or central laboratory glucometers.</description>

        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average glycemic control over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test, was identified as less than 6.5 percent by the study-specific central laboratory used. Change from baseline in percentage of HbA1C was reported.</description>
