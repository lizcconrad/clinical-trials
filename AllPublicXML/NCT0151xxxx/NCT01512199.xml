  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study. In Phase 1b portion, subjects will know the treatment they are
      receiving . Subjects will receive U3-1287 with trastuzumab plus paclitaxel . The phase 1b
      portion will determine if adding U3-1287 to trastuzumab plus paclitaxel will be safe in
      subjects with metastatic breast cancer. In phase 2 portion, subjects will be blinded to the
      treatments they are receiving . Subjects will receive either trastuzumab plus paclitaxel with
      U3-1287 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and placebo.The phase 2 portion will determine if
      adding U3-1287 to trastuzumab plus paclitaxel will be safe and improve survival in subjects
      with metastatic breast cancer.
