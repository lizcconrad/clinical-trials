  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new flu vaccine which is injected into the skin instead of into the muscle has recently
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for vaccination of the general population
      including patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). This new vaccine has been shown to work as
      well as the vaccine which is injected into muscle when tested in people without atopic
      dermatitis. The primary endpoint of the study is to estimate the variance of the log fold
      change from baseline in HAI antibody titers for non-atopic controls and participants with
      atopic dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-), following administration of
      a single dose of the seasonal 2011-2012 Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single center, open-label, mechanistic study designed to determine the variance of
      the antibody response in non-atopic and ADEH- participants receiving a single dose of the
      2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine administered per label.

      Twenty non-atopic and 20 ADEH- (mild to severe AD) adults aged 18 to 64 years will be
      enrolled. Enrollment will be closely monitored to ensure that there is a similar distribution
      of non-atopic and ADEH- participants by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

      Eligible study participants will provide a pre-vaccination blood sample (Day 0) for
      assessment of baseline HAI antibody titers, cellular immune response, total IgE, and allergen
      sensitization, and will then receive a single injection of the 2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone®
      Intradermal vaccine administered per label. A subset of participants will also provide blood
      for microarray analysis at Baseline (Day 0) and will return to the clinic 3 and 7 days
      post-vaccination to provide additional blood for microarray analysis. All participants will
      return to the study site 28 days post-vaccination for a blood draw for HAI antibody titers
      and cellular immune response assays.

      Study participants will be followed for safety, including serious adverse events (SAEs),
      throughout the entire duration of the study and will be asked to record solicited AEs on a
      diary card (Days 0-7).

    <description>Fluzone® Intradermal trivalent vaccine is a clear-to-slightly opalescent, preservative-free suspension containing formaldehyde-inactivated &quot;split&quot; influenza viruses for intradermal delivery of 0.1 mL via an ultra-fine micro-needle. The vaccine is supplied as a single-dose, in a latex-free, pre-filled microinjection system. The active substance is prepared from influenza viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs.
Fluzone® Intradermal is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (US PHS) requirements and is formulated to contain HA of each of the following three influenza strains recommended for the 2011-2012 influenza season: A/California/07/2009 X-179A (H1N1)-like virus, A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.</description>

             of vaccination.

          -  Who have a chronic illness, including but not limited to, cardiac, renal, or
             auto-immune disorders, or diabetes, at a stage that could interfere with study conduct
             or completion, based on the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Who have a neoplastic disease or any hematologic malignancy, (excluding uncomplicated
             non-melanoma skin cancer and participants who have a history of neoplastic disease and
             have been disease free for at least five years).

          -  Who have participated in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical
             device, or a medical procedure in the four weeks preceding the study vaccination or
             who plan to participate in another clinical trial during the present study period.

          -  Who have any skin disease other than AD that might compromise the stratum corneum
             barrier (e.g., bullous disease, psoriasis, cutaneous T cell lymphoma [also called
             Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary syndrome], dermatitis herpetiformis, Hailey-Hailey, or
             Darier's disease).

          -  Who have received blood or blood-derived products that might interfere with the
             assessment of immune response in the past 3 months prior to vaccination or who plan to
             receive such products during the study period.

          -  Who have received previous vaccination (Fluzone® or another vaccine) against influenza
             in the past 6 months prior to vaccination.
