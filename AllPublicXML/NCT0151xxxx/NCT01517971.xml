    <textblock>
      This research trial studies biomarkers in predicting the risk of cancer returning after
      surgery in tissue samples of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Studying
      samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify
      and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer and predict how well patients will respond
      to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop and validate a clinically useful molecular prognostic signature based on
      ribonucleic acid (RNA)-expression arrays to accurately distinguish between good and poor
      outcome in patients with stage 1B non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (T2aN0M0) by predicting
      the risk of cancer recurrence after surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop and validate a clinically useful prognostic signature for stage 1A NSCLC
      (T1a-bN0M0) that accurately predicts the risk of post-operative cancer recurrence and is part
      of a prognostic classifier, which also includes histological, pathological, and demographic
      parameters as in the primary objective.

      II. To determine the effects on test accuracy of the histological subtype (adenocarcinoma
      [AC] vs squamous cell [SQA]) for each of the stage specific prognostic classifiers.

      III. To determine the relevant statistical features, including accuracy of predicting overall
      survival, cancer specific survival, and disease free survival at 3 and 5 years, for each of
      the prognostic classifiers validated.

      IV. To utilize the validated prognostic signatures and classifiers in stage 1B NSCLC to
      determine whether these can reliably predict good outcome among stage II NSCLC patients.

      OUTLINE:

      RNA extracted from archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for whole-genome expression by
      Affymetrix microarrays (Gene Profiling Array cGMP U133 P2) and reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Registration to CALGB-140202

          -  The subject population to be studied in this protocol includes patients selected from
             CALGB-140202; all such patients have signed a written informed consent document
             meeting all federal, state and institutional guidelines as part of entry into that
             trial; the CALGB does not require that a separate consent form be signed for this
             study

          -  All samples to be studied were obtained and stored as part of CALGB-140202; the
             material and data obtained from the patient's protocol record will be used to obtain
             appropriate clinical information; in no instance will the patient be contacted
             directly

          -  Tumor specimens need to have 40% tumor content to be included
