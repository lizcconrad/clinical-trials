  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosage based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      The main goal of this project is to assess whether a dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would
      alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
      without a significant degradation in post-meal glucose control.

      Each patient will be admitted twice to a clinical research facility. In one visit, patients
      will eat a morning meal accompanied with a matching insulin bolus (depending on the
      carbohydrate content of the meal) and glucose levels will be subsequently regulated using
      dual-hormone closed-loop system. In the other visit, patients will eat the same meal but will
      inject only a partial insulin bolus (not depending on carbohydrate content of the meal) and
      the remaining needed insulin will be delivered based on glucose sensor excursions as part of
      closed-loop operation. If post-meal glucose levels were indifferent between the two visits,
      then this would suggest that carbohydrate counting may not be necessary during closed-loop
      operation as the closed-loop system will give any remaining insulin needed to cover the
      glucose absorbed from the meal. Twelve subjects will be enrolled in this study.

             diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment and medical history (e.g. history of
             acido-ketosis, etc.); C peptide level and antibody determinations are not needed.

          -  The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months.

          -  Last (less than 3 months) HbA1c ≤ 12%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant nephropathy, neuropathy (especially clinically significant
             gastroparesis) or retinopathy as judged by the investigator.

          -  Recent (&lt; 3 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac
             surgery.
