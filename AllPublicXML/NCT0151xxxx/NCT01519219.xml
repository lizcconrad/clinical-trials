  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the trial is to assess the effect of radiation treatment on liver function as
      determined by indocyanine green extraction. The long term goal is to determine if individual
      assessment of liver function using the IC-Green method, either alone or in combination with
      other factors, will provide Radiation Induced Liver Disease (RILD) risk-estimates that are
      superior to the probabilistic method currently in use.

    <textblock>
      Following intravenous injection, IC-GREEN is rapidly bound to plasma protein, of which
      albumin is the principle carrier (95%). IC-GREEN is taken up from the plasma almost
      exclusively by the hepatic parenchymal cells and is secreted entirely into the bile. It
      undergoes no significant extrahepatic or enterohepatic circulation. Simultaneous arterial and
      venous blood estimations have shown negligible renal, peripheral, lung or cerebro-spinal
      uptake of the dye. Therefore, the serum clearance rate (determined from serial serum
      concentration measurements at various times after intravenous injection) can serve as a
      useful index of liver function.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Most subjects will have five IC-GREEN assessments. Graphical displays will be used to choose the form of a time-dependent model of IC-GREEN elimination. A mixed, possibly nonlinear model, with patient as random effect, will be fit to the data by the maximum likelihood principle. Profile confidence intervals for the parameters will be determined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in IC-green elimination after radiation therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using model parameters, a cumulative distribution function for IC-GREEN elimination at each time point will be determined from the patients who do not contract RILD. This will result in a smooth estimate of the IC-GREEN assay results, from which lower normal bounds (at, for instance, the fifth percentile) can be established.</description>
