  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in
      the WAS gene which encodes the WAS protein (WASP), a cytoskeletal regulator which is
      expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells.

      We expect to treat 8 patients with genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells
      that were collected from bone marrow and/or mobilized from peripheral blood, and transduced
      with a lentiviral vector encoding for WAS. The patients are selected according to disease
      severity (genetic mutation, WASP expression and clinical score), absence of a human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or adequate unrelated donor, age and clinical features. A
      conditioning regimen based on low doses of iv busulfan (non-myeloablative), Fludarabine and
      anti-CD20 antibody will be administered to the patients to make space in the bone marrow for
      gene corrected stem cells, deplete the lymphoid compartment of potentially autoreactive
      lymphocytes and prevent lymphoproliferative disorder. Patients with autoimmune manifestations
      could also receive ATG Thymoglobuline to target auto-reactive memory T lymphocytes. This
      reduced intensity conditioning schedule will provide less toxicity than current preparatory
      regimens, used in standard allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. The treated
      patients will be followed for 3 years and thereafter monitored for efficacy and safety for
      additional 5 years.
