      The purpose of this research study is to test a new type of counseling developed to decrease
      symptoms of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and improve health and well-being in women
      with these eating disorders. At this time, the most effective form of treatment for anorexia
      nervosa and bulimia nervosa is cognitive behavioral therapy. However, this form of treatment
      leads to a complete absence of symptoms in only about 50% of persons completing the treatment
      program. In this study we will test the effectiveness of a new form of counseling that
      focuses on identifying and building personal strengths and positive views of the self as the
      means to decrease eating disorder symptoms and improve health. This study will involve 150
      women between the ages of 18 and 35 years who currently have symptoms of anorexia nervosa or
      bulimia nervosa. To participate in this study, women must also be: 1) not pregnant, 2)
      without any other diagnosable mental disorder, 3) not currently taking medications for their
      eating disorder or other mental disorder symptoms, 4) not ill enough to require inpatient
      treatment for their eating disorder and 5) willing to refrain from seeking other treatment
      for their eating disorder for the duration of this study. Each participant will participate
      in a 20-week treatment program that includes nutritional counseling and medical care. Both of
      these forms of treatment are considered by the American Psychiatric Association to be
      essential parts of treatment for eating disorders and have been found help to reduce
      symptoms. In addition, participants will receive one of two types of counseling:

        1. Experimental counseling that focuses on building strengths and positive self-views

        2. Standard counseling that helps the participant identify and solve problems that are
           believed to contribute to their eating disorder symptoms.

      The type of counseling that a participant receives will be determined randomly. To determine
      whether the experimental counseling is effective, eating disorder symptoms, psychological and
      functional health will be measured before the treatment begins and three times after the
      treatment ends (immediately after treatment ends, 6 and 12 months later). The findings of
      this research study are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions
      to decrease eating disorder symptoms, and increase health and well-being in women with
      anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

    <description>SPI is a 20-week program with a one-hour individual psychotherapy session scheduled each week. The SPI is organized in three stages: 1) Stage 1 (Sessions 1-8) including assessment of the current and past ED history, collection of personal and family history, and identification of problems contributing to the ED; 2) Stage 2 (Sessions 9-16) aims include exploration of underlying emotional problems, increased self-disclosure and expression of feelings, and fostering independence; and 3) Stage 3 (Sessions 17-20) includes continued exploration of underlying problems and implications for future behaviors and termination.</description>
