  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed onset muscle soreness is defined as the sensition of pain and discomfort in skeletal
      muscles that occurs after eccentric muscle actions or strenuous exercise like a marathon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of clinical evidence which shows that noninvasive, nonpharmacologic
      pulsed electromagnetic fields have many clinical effects. Pulsed electromagnetic fields have
      shown to reduce pain in different groups of patients. This concerns patients with
      osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, distal radius
      fractures, pelvic pain and postoperative patients.

      A marathon is a muscular strain. Physiologic effects of a marathon involves muscular and
      connective tissue damage which initiates an inflammatory response as well as release of
      metabolic factors like lactate and free radicals, intracellular metabolites and by-products
      of proteolysis.

      The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of pulsed electromagnetic fields
      compared to placebo in reducing delayed onset muscle soreness in marathon runners.

    <description>Primary outcome of thigh pain during semi-squat during 5 days following the marathon showed a significantly lower pain among the active group compared to the placebo group.
The outcome was thigh muscle pain measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale during a squat of 90 degrees three times a day; when they woke up, at 12 pm and 8 pm.</description>

    <description>Every person received two active devices. The devices emitted 2-ms bursts of 27.12 MHz sinusoidal waves repeating at 2 bursts/s. Peak magnetic field intensity was 0.05 G which induced an average electric field of 10 mV in the tissue with an effect of 7.3 mW/cm3.</description>
