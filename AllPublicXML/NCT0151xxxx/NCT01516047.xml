  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate systemic exposure of abiraterone acetate in adult
      male patients with severe hepatic impairment and is being conducted to collect information
      that will support clinical dosing recommendations for this subpopulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance to study treatments),
      open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), single dose, 2-cohort
      study of abiraterone acetate in approximately 16 adult men. Participants will either have
      severe hepatic impairment (Cohort 1) or qualify for the control group with normal hepatic
      function (Cohort 2). This study will consist of a screening period followed by a 4-day
      open-label treatment phase and subsequently a 28-day follow up after the study dose of
      abiraterone acetate suspension. Patients will be admitted to the study center on Day -1, a
      single dose of study drug will be administered on the morning of Day 1, and patients will
      remain at the study center until completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic (PK; study of what
      the body does to a drug) blood sample collection in the morning of Day 4. Enrollment will
      begin sequentially with patients in the severe hepatic impairment cohort. Enrollment for
      Cohort 1 will be staggered in order to evaluate safety and tolerability. The study will not
      proceed if &gt;=Grade 3 toxicity or serious adverse events considered related to abiraterone
      acetate are observed. Additional patients may be enrolled if at least 8 patients in each
      cohort do not complete the required assessments, including the PK blood sample collections.
      The aim will be to treat the remaining patients in Cohort 1 at a suspension dose yielding an
      exposure equivalent to 1000 mg tablet in healthy individuals. If the dose is adjusted after
      Study Evaluation Team review, additional patients may be enrolled to ensure at least 8
      patients complete the study at the final dose. Once enrollment of patients in the severe
      hepatic impairment cohort is completed, the matched-control cohort will be dosed. Serial PK
      samples will be collected during the open-label treatment phase as detailed in the protocol.
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

             findings from medical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram and vital signs.

          -  Patients with hepatic impairment are required to be on medication and/or treatment
             regimen to treat their underlying hepatic impairment or medical conditions before
             dosing with study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants in the control cohort who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibodies will not be permitted to enroll in the study.

          -  Patients with hepatic impairment who have acute or exacerbating hepatitis, fluctuating
             or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function as indicated by widely varying or worsening
             of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment in the judgment of either
             the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor will be excluded from participating
             in the study.

          -  Patients with hepatic impairment taking antiviral therapy for treatment of active
             hepatitis infection at the time of screening, previously diagnosed with hepatocellular
             carcinoma, or who have a history of biliary sepsis within the past 2 years.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not have Gilbert's syndrome or &gt;= Grade
             3 hepatic encephalopathy where the patient lacks the capacity to provide informed
             consent as judged by the investigator. Mild or moderate hepatic encephalopathy that
             would not impede informed consent in the investigator's judgment is permitted.
