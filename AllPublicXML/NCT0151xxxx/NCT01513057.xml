      This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, single
      dose, crossover bioequivalence study in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fed
      conditions.64 healthy male adults were enrolled.A washout period of 07 days was maintained
      between the successive dosing days.One capsule containing mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg was
      administered orally with 240 mL water in sitting posture, after an overnight fast of at least
      10 hours in each period. This activity was followed by a mouth check to assess compliance to
      dosing. The subjects were not allowed to lie down for the first two hours after dosing.
