  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no general agreement about the ideal gas for pneumoperitoneum. CO2, now in common
      use, has not compared to N2O sufficiently to disclose which one has minimal &quot;physiological&quot;
      invasiveness characters. Assigned randomly to carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide group, the
      hemodynamic and respiratory parameters (heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, end-tidal
      CO2, minute ventilation, and O2 saturation) before pneumoperitoneum and during it were
      recorded. Pain, as perceived by patients, is measured 2, 4 and 24 hours after the procedure
      by visual analogue scale. Vomiting and use of analgesics and antiemetics were recorded and
      compared.
