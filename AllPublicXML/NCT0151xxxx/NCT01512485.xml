             fourteen units of alcohol per week [J Unit = 150 mL of wine, 360 mL of beer, or 45 mL
             of 40% alcohol]), or positive alcohol breath test at screening.

          -  Use of soft drugs (such as marijuana) within 3 months prior to the screening visit or
             hard drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP] and -crack) within 1 year prior to
