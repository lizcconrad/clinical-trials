  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metal-on-metal total hip replacement (MoM THR) has been targeted at younger patients with
      anticipated long-term survival since the bearing surfaces wear less than the traditional
      metal-on-plastic (MoP) replacements. However, the production of metal ions as a result of the
      wear is a concern because of the possible toxicity to cells. In Norwich England a number of
      different metal-on-metal implants have been trialed of which one, the Ultima TPS, has had
      very poor results. A total of 545 patients have had 652 MoM THRs with the Ultima TPS of whom
      more than 20% have now been revised. There is an ongoing MHRA program to screen for problems
      using MRI scans with a technique developed in Norwich. Investigations so far show massive
      corrosion in the implants with a catastrophic immune response causing death of cells. This
      may include death of bone leading to fracture. In a third of patients revised there has been
      pain but normal plain X-rays. In some patients without pain who have been screened there are
      abnormal changes on an MRI scan. We wish to investigate the immune cells in patients to find
      out why this has happened. The study will include patients coming for a new hip to act as a
      comparator, as well as those with a MoM THR and patients being revised with MoM THRs, and MoP
      THRs. We shall also investigate patients with other MoM THRs opportunistically.

      To characterize dendritic cell (DC) populations in MoM THR patients. Dendritic cells are
      cells that migrate from the circulating blood into tissues and mop up foreign material such
      as viruses with their abnormal surface makers (antigens)and metal debris, activating
      specialist white blood cells (such as T cells) that kill viruses and remove abnormal
      material.
