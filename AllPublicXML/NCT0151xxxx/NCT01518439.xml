  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inefficient cough is responsible of respiratory complications in neuromuscular patients which
      can lead to hospitalisation and can be life threatening. Techniques enhancing cough
      efficiency are successful in improving the clearance of bronchial secretions and help non
      invasive ventilation efficiency especially in case of acute respiratory failure. Combining
      mechanical exsufflation to the manual techniques of physiotherapy might enhance efficiency.
      Therefore the investigators want to compare cough efficiency under different techniques of
      instrumental and manual of cough assistance in order to determine the best combination to
      optimize cough flow.

      Hypothesis: Cough inefficiency in neuromuscular patients increases morbidity and mortality in
      case of airway infections and may lead to invasive ventilation. The use of techniques
      enhancing cough have been successful in improving the success of non invasive ventilation. We
      want to determine whether adding manual physiotherapist techniques to mechanical exsufflation
      improve cough efficiency and its ability to clear bronchial secretions.

      Objectives: To compare cough flows obtained with different combination of the use of
      increased inspiratory capacity technique, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation technique and
      manually applied pressures techniques.

      Method:open monocentric cross-over study (the patients are their own controls). Five
      combinations of cough increase techniques are compared Inclusion criteria: adult
      neuromuscular patients with a cough inefficiency at a stable state upon inclusion.

      As this is a pilot study, 20 patients from the home ventilation unit of the intensive care of
      the Raymond Poincare teaching hospital (Garches, France) will be included during the usual
      follow-up of chronic respiratory failure.
