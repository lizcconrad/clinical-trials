             same product for at least 30 days prior to the study start and use the same product
             throughout the duration of the study), transdermal or implanted hormonal
             contraceptives}

          4. A confirmed clinical diagnosis of tinea pedis with lesions localized to the
             interdigital spaces or predominantly interdigital, but may extend to other areas of
             the foot. (the non-interdigital lesions should not be hyperkeratotic i.e.,
             characteristic of moccasin).

          5. The presence of tinea pedis infection, confirm by the observation of segmented fungal
             hyphae during a microscopic KOH wet mount examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant, or lactating or likely to become pregnant during the study.

          2. Any known hypersensitivity to oxiconazole nitrate or other antifungal agents.

          3. Patients with a past history of tinea pedis infections with a lack of response to
             antifungal therapy (i.e. recurrent tinea pedis, more than 3 infections in the past 12
             months, which were unresponsive to previous antifungal therapy).

          4. Participation in a research study in the past 30 days prior to
             screening/randomization.
