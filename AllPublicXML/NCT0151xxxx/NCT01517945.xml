      The purpose of this study is to customize and personalize an existing computer-based
      intervention program in order to help breast cancer survivors cope with fears of cancer

    <description>for AIM-Neutral and AIM-Meaning. This will involve development of AIM materials and assessments (based on the preliminary work conducted by Beard et al.70-73) that target fear of cancer recurrence through feedback from BCS (n=10). It will also involve training of the research staff in the assessments and AIM. This will accomplish Primary Aim 1.</description>

    <description>We will evaluate two versions of an 8-session AIM, one that includes threat and neutral stimuli (AIMNeutral; n=37), and one that includes threat and positive stimuli (AIM-Meaning; n=37), comparing them both to a computer placebo (CP) condition (n=37). Part 2 will allow us to assess the feasibility of the research procedures, the appropriateness of the psychological and physiological outcome measures, preliminary estimates of pre- and post-intervention effect sizes and reliable change estimates, and variables associated with any observed outcomes. This will accomplish Aims 2 and 3.</description>

    <description>This is a Center for Translational Science Center (CTSC)-funded intervention development and pilot clinical trial of a psychosocial intervention to address fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer survivors (BCS).

    <description>Part 1 will be used to develop &amp; refine the intervention &amp; assessment materials with 10 participants. We will adapt two previously validated CBM tasks, attention modification &amp; interpretation modification to create two novel AIM programs (designated AIM-Neutral &amp; AIM-Meaning), each of which targets both attention &amp; interpretation biases for fear of breast cancer recurrence. Participants will complete the assessment battery &amp; 1 30-minute session of each version of the intervention (AIM-Neutral &amp; AIM-Meaning) &amp; will provide feedback about the recruitment procedures, stimuli, &amp; assessments. Part 2 will be a proof-of-concept, small scale, single-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of AIM. One hundred eleven participants will be randomized to receive either AIM-Neutral (n=37), AIM-Meaning (n=37), or computer placebo (CP; n=37). The AIM &amp; CP conditions will involve completion of 8 30-minute sessions Participants will be instructed to complete 2 sessions per week for a total of 4 weeks.</description>

        Breast cancer survivors will be recruited to the study. There are no physical recruitment
        sites outside of MSKCC. Participants may be patients who were treated at MSKCC or breast
        cancer survivors who were treated elsewhere and learned about the study through an
        advertisement. The study summary and research team contact information will be
        available/advertised in the community through MSKCC Connections,MSKCC Survivorship Program
        and the American Cancer Society website.

             study checklist signed by a physician for patients outside of MSK.

          -  ≥ 3 months post completion of breast cancer treatment (may be on hormone therapy, such
             as tamoxifen) with no history of recurrence or metastasis as confirmed by the medical

             as hallucinations, or sleep, stable and consistent enough in dosage and use of that
             medication so as to not result in a clinically significant change as determined by the

             not experienced a disease recurrence

          -  Per self-report or medical record review, since participating in Phase 1 or 2, have
