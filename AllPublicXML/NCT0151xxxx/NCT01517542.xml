  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide and the leading cause of death in Brazil.
      It is estimated that about 18 million people will have a stroke in 2015 and approximately one
      third of these resulting in death. The factors most important modifiable risk for stroke
      include high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, sedentary
      lifestyle and obesity. Acting on these risk factors can be reduced by 88% the risk of another
      stroke. Healthy eating is among the changes in lifestyle that are recommended for prevention
      and treatment of one of the main risk factors for stroke. Studies show that the adoption of
      the DASH diet can significantly reduce blood pressure and the result is even more significant
      in hypertensive patients, making this diet a new alternative in the prevention and treatment
      of hypertension and consequently stroke. Compliance therapy is a determining factor for
      success in the treatment of chronic diseases. Adherence to long-term treatment in developed
      countries is around 50% and in developing countries the rates are even lower. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of nutritional counseling in an adapted DASH style
      diet on body weight, glycemic control, blood pressure values and improved lipid profile
      compared to the usual diet without nutritional counseling in patients with stroke within the
      last 3 months. The hypothesis is that nutritional counseling with an adapted DASH style diet
      reduces cardiovascular risk factors compared with the usual diet without nutritional
      counseling in patients with stroke within 3 months. The stroke patients will be selected in
      the hospitalization or in the outpatient clinic of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre in a
      period up to 3 months after ischemic stroke. The patients will be randomized to one of the 2
      groups. In the first visit they will be submitted to a social class and international
      physical activity questionnaire and they will be submitted to a food frequency questionnaire,
      measures of weight, height, waist circumference, hip and neck, blood pressure and cholesterol
      and glucose measurements at the baseline, 30 days and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The main
      endpoints will be the change in the body weight, blood glucose, blood pressure values and
      lipid profile.
