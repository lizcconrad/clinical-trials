    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Ulthera® System for obtaining lift and
      tightening of the cheek tissue, reduction of jowling, and improving jawline definition and/or
      submental skin laxity when increased density treatment is applied.

      All enrolled study subjects will receive one full face and neck Ultherapy™ treatment. Pre-
      and post-treatment photos will be taken. Subjects will be required to return for follow-up
      visits at 60 days, 90 days, 180 days and 1 year following treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Overall Lifting and Tightening of Skin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin was completed by three masked assessors, completing a qualitative assessment of pre- and post-treatment photographs. Masked photo pairs of pre/post treatment photos of each treated subject were provided to each assessor. Each photo pair was consistent in lighting, position, focus. The visit interval of each photo was NOT marked. Each assessor's review was completed independently, with no input from others, assessing the photos for improvement. If improvement was seen, the blinded assessor was to choose the post-treatment photo. Categories of assessment included Improved, No Change, or Incorrect post-treatment photo chosen. The majority assessment among the 3 blinded assessors for each subject was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Aesthetic Improvement at 60 Days, 90 Days, 180 Days and 1 Year Post-treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 60 days, 90 days, 180 days and 1 year post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement was assessed based on Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) scores. The GAIS was completed based on a live assessment of the subject and a photographic assessment comparing post-treatment photos to baseline photos. The PGAIS was completed by a clinician assessor; SGAIS was completed by the study subject. The GAIS is a 5-point scale (1-5) describing an overall assessment as follows:
- Very Much Improved
- Much Improved
- Improved
- No Change
- Worse</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjects' Assessment of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>During Ulthera treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' sensory response to the Ulthera treatment exposures were recorded for each anatomical region treated using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (0-10), with 1 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain possible. Subjects rated pain for each transducer, in each treatment region. For statistical analyses, NRS scores were averaged for each transducer depth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction at 90 Days, 180 Days and 1 Year Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days, 180 days and 1 year post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subject satisfaction was determined by scores on a patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) completed at 90 days, 180 days and 1 year post-treatment. Subjects indicated how satisfied they were with their study treatment, i.e., Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied. Pre-treatment and post-treatment photographs were available for viewing at each follow-up visit interval. Subjects also had a mirror available for real time assessment, comparing their image in the mirror with pre-treatment and post-treatment photos.</description>

        <title>Improvement in Overall Lifting and Tightening of Skin</title>
        <description>Improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin was completed by three masked assessors, completing a qualitative assessment of pre- and post-treatment photographs. Masked photo pairs of pre/post treatment photos of each treated subject were provided to each assessor. Each photo pair was consistent in lighting, position, focus. The visit interval of each photo was NOT marked. Each assessor's review was completed independently, with no input from others, assessing the photos for improvement. If improvement was seen, the blinded assessor was to choose the post-treatment photo. Categories of assessment included Improved, No Change, or Incorrect post-treatment photo chosen. The majority assessment among the 3 blinded assessors for each subject was reported.</description>

        <title>Overall Aesthetic Improvement at 60 Days, 90 Days, 180 Days and 1 Year Post-treatment.</title>
        <description>Improvement was assessed based on Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) scores. The GAIS was completed based on a live assessment of the subject and a photographic assessment comparing post-treatment photos to baseline photos. The PGAIS was completed by a clinician assessor; SGAIS was completed by the study subject. The GAIS is a 5-point scale (1-5) describing an overall assessment as follows:
- Very Much Improved
- Much Improved
- Improved
- No Change
- Worse</description>

        <description>Subject satisfaction was determined by scores on a patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) completed at 90 days, 180 days and 1 year post-treatment. Subjects indicated how satisfied they were with their study treatment, i.e., Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied. Pre-treatment and post-treatment photographs were available for viewing at each follow-up visit interval. Subjects also had a mirror available for real time assessment, comparing their image in the mirror with pre-treatment and post-treatment photos.</description>

          <title>Subject Satisfaction at 90 Days, 180 Days and 1 Year Post-treatment</title>
          <description>Subject satisfaction was determined by scores on a patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) completed at 90 days, 180 days and 1 year post-treatment. Subjects indicated how satisfied they were with their study treatment, i.e., Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied. Pre-treatment and post-treatment photographs were available for viewing at each follow-up visit interval. Subjects also had a mirror available for real time assessment, comparing their image in the mirror with pre-treatment and post-treatment photos.</description>
          <population>Three (3) subjects were lost-to-follow-up. Two (2) subjects missed the 1 year visit.</population>
