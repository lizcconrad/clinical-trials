  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and anti-microbial
      effects of Arestin (minocycline HCl) 1 mg Microspheres in the treatment of subjects with
      peri-implantitis, when used in combination with mechanical debridement.

      The hypothesis of the study is that Arestin in combination with mechanical debridement is
      more effective in the treatment of peri-implantitis when compared to mechanical debridement
      alone. The primary efficacy measure will be the reduction of probing depth at Day 180 as
      measured at qualifying implant sites.
