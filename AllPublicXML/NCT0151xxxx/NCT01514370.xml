  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, monocentric, double blind, placebo controlled, two arm study.

      Curcumin is derived from the rhizomes of the plant Curcuma longa (common name, turmeric)
      belonging to the Zingiberaceae family found in South Asian countries, especially India which
      is the largest producer. BCM95 (bioCurcumin) is a combination of a Curcumin extract and oil
      to enhance the bio-absorbability in humans. BCM95 may enhance and prolong the antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory effects of the standard therapy maintaining a good safety profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects must experience at least one Gadolinium (GD) enhancing Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) lesion at the baseline visit or one Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapse in the last
      6 months before the screening visit.

      Randomization, in a 1:1 ratio, will be done with two arms:

      40 subjects with Interferon (IFN) beta 1 a 44 mcg TIW + Curcumin (BCM 95) and 40 subjects
      with IFN beta-1a 44 mcg TIW + placebo.

      The study will last 42 months: 18 months of enrolment and 24 months of treatment period.

      The study consists of 6 visits per subject: screening visit (Visit 0), baseline (Visit 1), a
      visit 3 months after baseline (Visit 2), 6 months after baseline (Visit 3), 12 months after
      baseline (Visit 4) and 24 months after baseline (Visit 5).
