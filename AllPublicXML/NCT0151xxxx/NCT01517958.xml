  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that ultrasonography of the newborn lung can be used as an
      effective diagnostic tool in neonates ≥ 28 weeks gestation with early symptoms of respiratory
      distress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress is a common reason for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) for both preterm and full term newborns. TTN and RDS are the two most common diagnoses
      associated with respiratory distress. Due to their similar clinical presentations, it is
      often difficult to differentiate the two diseases clinically. Currently chest radiography is
      used to differentiate between TTN and RDS, however, radiographic findings are not always
      definitively diagnostic.

      In preliminary studies, lung ultrasonography has been shown to be a useful tool in diagnosing
      both TTN and RDS. However, no one has looked at the use of lung ultrasonography in
      differentiating TTN from RDS in the neonatal population. We propose to do so in this study.

      Patients will be enrolled from neonatal admissions to the NICU with respiratory distress.
      Lung ultrasound will be performed on all enrolled subjects, looking for specific findings
      suggestive of either TTN or RDS. Data will be collected on gestational age, physical exam
      findings and level of respiratory support. Diagnoses will be recorded based on ultrasound
      findings. Accuracy of lung ultrasound diagnosis will be compared to that using radiographic
      chest radiography findings to evaluate if lung ultrasound is equivalent, or better than chest
      radiography in order to diagnose TTN versus RDS in this patient population.

    <description>The primary endpoint is to determine whether lung ultrasound is comparable or superior to chest radiography: (1) in making the diagnosis of RDS and TTN and (2) in differentiating between RDS and TTN.
Disease-specific lung ultrasound findings: (1) Double lung point in TTN and (2) lung white-out in RDS.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  gestational age ≥ 28 weeks

          -  symptoms of respiratory distress defined as:

          -  tachypnea (respiratory rate &gt; 60 breaths per minute)

          -  FiO2 requirement &gt;21%

          -  intercostal/subcostal retractions

          -  grunting and/or nasal flaring

          -  If clinically warranted, a chest x-ray will be done as part of the workup for
             respiratory distress; these patients with CXR will be included in the study.

          -  Inclusion criteria for the control group will be gestational age ≥ 28 weeks with no
             symptoms of respiratory distress (defined above).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  neonates with prenatally diagnosed structural cardiac disease

          -  major multiple congenital anomalies

          -  other causes of respiratory distress that are not RDS or TTN (e.g. pneumothorax, CCAM
             or pneumonia).
