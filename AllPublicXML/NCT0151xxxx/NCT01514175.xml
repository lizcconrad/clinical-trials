      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a single dose of
      intravenous ibuprofen compared to a single dose of ketorolac for the treatment of
      postoperative pain as measured by patient pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS).

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a single dose of
      intravenous ibuprofen compared to a single dose of ketorolac for the treatment of
      postoperative pain as measured by patient pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To compare amount of and time to rescue medication in the postoperative period between
           IV ibuprofen and IV ketorolac treatment groups.

        -  To compare time to mobility in the postoperative period between IV ibuprofen and IV
           ketorolac treatment groups.

        -  To compare time to discharge in the postoperative period between IV ibuprofen and IV
           ketorolac treatment groups.

        -  To compare the incidence of adverse events between IV ibuprofen and IV ketorolac
           treatment groups.

A corresponding volume of NS will be administered to the group randomized to ketorolac, at the same time to maintain the study blind.</description>
