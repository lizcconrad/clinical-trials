  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study hopes to determine whether or not platelet rich plasma therapy improves
      healing time of moderate to severe ankle sprain in comparison to standard of care therapy.

      The intention of this research project is to study a new treatment for severe ankle
      sprains.This new treatment is called Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy and involves
      injecting concentrated platelet's from a patient's own blood into the site of injury to aid
      healing. Platelets, aside from their clotting capabilities also serve a role in
      re-vascularization of tissue as well as collagen repair. PRP therapy has been used in sports
      medicine for treatment of chronic injuries but has yet to be proven effective in acute injury
      of a joint. The investigators are comparing treatment and placebo groups based on a
      subjective patient questionnaire and pain score administered on the day of injury and 2-3
      days and 8-10 days follow up.

    <description>50ml of blood drawn into a 60cc with 10cc of anticoagulant is processed using MAGELLANÂ® Autologous Platelet (Arteriocyte Medical Systems, Cleveland Ohio)to separate out approximately 3-6 cc of platelet rich plasma, which is mixed with 1 cc of 1 % Lidocaine (xylocaine) and 1 cc of 0.25 % Marcaine (bupivacaine) and injected into the site of injury under USG guidance.</description>
