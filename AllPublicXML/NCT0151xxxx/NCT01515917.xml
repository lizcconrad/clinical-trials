  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled study intended to examine the effects of the neutraceutical
      citicholine, together with omega-3 fatty acids, on a range of measures in individuals with
      concussive head injury, often referred to as traumatic brain injury, or TBI. The study will
      consist of three visits, during which participants will complete brain scans, a thorough
      testing battery and a clinical interview to assess mood and other diagnostic information
      relevant to the study.

    <description>Using baseline assessment measures gathered at Visit 1, assessments collected at Visits 2 and 3 will be used to determine whether the combined administration of neutraceuticals citicoline and omega-3 fatty acids will improve neurocognitive performance in individuals with TBI and substance abuse/dependence.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo MRI scanning designed to assess white matter microstructure and focal brain activation at Visit 1 (Day 0) and again at Visit 3 (Day 28) in order to determine whether the combined administration of neutraceuticals citicoline and omega-3 fatty acids result in changes to these brain indices in participants with TBI and substance abuse/dependence.</description>
