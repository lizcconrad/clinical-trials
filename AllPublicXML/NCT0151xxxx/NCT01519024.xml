  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Principles of motor control suggest that breast hypertrophy can lead to sensoriomotor
      alterations and impairment in body balance due to postural misalignment. The investigators
      conducted this study to evaluate the postural control with different sensorial information
      condition in women with breast hypertrophy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to the moment, changes caused by breast hypertrophy are described based on the alteration
      of body mass distribution leading to an impact of psychological and physical aspects.
      However, the investigators hypothesize that due to alterations in postural alignment,
      sensoriomotor inputs are also impaired and postural or motor control are ultimately
      compromised.

        The fourteen women for breast hypertropy group were recruited from the Department of
        Plastic Surgery and Department of Gynecology of Clinical Hospital, Faculty of Medicine,
        University of São Paulo, and the fourteen women of control group (without breast
        hypertrophy)was compound by women dwelling community.
