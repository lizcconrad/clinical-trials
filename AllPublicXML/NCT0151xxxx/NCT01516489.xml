  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-arm cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether patient financial
      incentives directly integrated into primary care can improve fecal occult blood test (FOBT)
      completion rates. We will recruit primary care patients at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs
      Medical Center (PVAMC) in 2 stages. In stage 1, we hypothesize that, compared to usual care,
      $5, $10, $20 incentives will each lead to a statistically significant increase in the rate of
      FOBT completion. We also hypothesize that there will be a direct dose-response relationship
      between the incentive amount and rates of FOBT completion. In stage 2, we hypothesize that a
      lottery-based incentive and a raffle-based incentive will both lead to a statistically
      significant increase in the rate of FOBT completion compared to a fixed payment incentive
      with an equivalent dollar per patient value.

    <description>There are 2 secondary outcomes. First, we will compare time to FOBT kit return by arm. Second, we will compare 30 day FOBT completion rates among previously non-adherent patients (i.e., individuals who had failed to complete a prescribed FOBT kit in the year prior to the start of the study) by arm.</description>
