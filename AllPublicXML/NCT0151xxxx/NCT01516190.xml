  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to look at the changes that occur in women who take part in exercise
      and Mind-Body programs between breast cancer diagnosis and breast surgery. The investigators
      will look at changes in stress, anxiety, mood and quality of life, to see if these types of
      short programs can make women feel better during this time. The investigators are also
      interested in looking at whether a short exercise or Mind-Body program leads to any changes
      in markers in breast cancer cells, such as their growth and death rates, or in blood hormones
      such as insulin, which have been linked to breast cancer development.

      Since the investigators do not know if these blood or tumor tests have any relationship to
      cancer recurrence, the investigators do not plan to share the results of these tests with you
      or your physician.
