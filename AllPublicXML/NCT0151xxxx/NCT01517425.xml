    <textblock>
      This research is being done to understand how changes in DNA may put people at risk for
      developing coronary artery disease. Stem cells will be made using cells from blood and/or
      skin biopsy samples. We are trying to understand which specific changes in DNA negatively
      impact a person's health.
