    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-center, open label, single arm, post-marketing surveillance study
      is to assess the safety of Travacom in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to beta-blockers, prostaglandins, or other
      intraocular pressure-lowering (IOP) medication and when use of Travacom is considered
      appropriate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension insufficiently responsive to betablockers,
             prostaglandins, or other intraocular pressure-lowering (IOP) agents and when the use
             of Travacom is considered appropriate.

          -  Discontinued use of all other ocular hypotensive medications prior to receiving the
             study medication for the entire course of the study.

          -  Mean IOP not greater than 36 mmHG in either eye.

          -  Read, sign, and date (or legal representative) the Informed Consent prior to the start
             of any study-related procedures.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential (not postmenopausal for at least one year or not
             surgically sterile) who are currently pregnant, have a positive result on the urine
             pregnancy test at Screening, intend to become pregnant during the study period, are
             breastfeeding, or do not agree to use an adequate birth control method to prevent
             pregnancy throughout the study.

          -  Chronic, recurrent, or severe inflammatory eye disease, such as scleritis, uveitis, or

          -  History of clinically significant or progressive retinal disease.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score worse than 20/80 Snellen.

          -  Bronchial asthma or related history that would preclude safe administration of a
             topical beta-blocker.

          -  Severe, unstable, or uncontrolled cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal disease or related
             history that would preclude safe administration of a topical beta-adrenergic blocking
             agent.

          -  History of spontaneous or current hypoglycemia or uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  Known medical allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor tolerance to any component of
             Travacom deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal Investigator.

          -  Use of any additional topical or system ocular hypotensive medication during the
             study.

          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to Screening
             visit.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
