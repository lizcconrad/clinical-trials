  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the present study is to evaluate in a cohort of patients with genotype 2/3 chronic
      hepatitis C, relapsers to a previous PEG-IFN + ribavirin therapy (alpha-2a or alpha-2b) the
      efficacy of PEG-IFNα-2a + ribavirin administered for 24 or 48 weeks. It will be evaluated
      whether 48 weeks of therapy may achieve better results compared to the standard duration (24
      weeks).

    Time elapsed to require permissions and a recent paper showed a high efficacy of a 48-week
    regimen in this setting. It seems non-ethical to start this trial

          -  Clinical or histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C

          -  HCV-RNA: positive

          -  Relapse (end-of-treatment HCV-RNA negativity and positivization within 6 months after
             therapy withdrawal) to at-least one previous treatment of PEG-IFN (alpha2a or alpha2b)
             + ribavirin which should have lasted at least for 80% of the 24 planned weeks with at
             least 80% of total planned dose of PEG-IFN and ribavirin administered.

          -  Normal values of total and direct bilirubin (with the exception of indirect bilirubin
             due to extrahepatic factors such as Gilbert syndrome; in these cases the levels should
             be less than 3 mg/dL).

             diabetes mellitus, glycated hemoglobin should be &lt; 8,5%.
