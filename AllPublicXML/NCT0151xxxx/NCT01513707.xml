      This is a prospective, multicenter, comparative, parallel-group, observational study. There
      will be 2 cohorts according to pre-transplant dialysis modality (hemodialysis or peritoneal
      dialysis). In each cohort, subjects will be observed for 12 months. Approximately, 1040
      subjects will be enrolled from 8 transplant centers.

      Subjects will be enrolled consecutively until the number of subjects in peritoneal dialysis
      group has been 260. It will take 2 years. In this period, the number of subject in
      hemodialysis group enrolled in this study will be 780. After finishing the observation of all
      subjects, to balance clinical and demographic baseline characteristics between the two
      groups, subjects will be selected in each cohort with 1:1 matched using propensity score
      method. And then primary and secondary endpoints will be compared between two groups.

      1. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 1.1. Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is:

      • To compare the incidence of composite outcomes (delayed graft function, functional delayed
      graft function, primary nonfunction, biopsy-proven acute rejection) of pre-transplant
      dialysis modality hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of first renal allografts at 1
      year posttransplant.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To compare the incidence of delayed graft function and functional delayed graft function
           of pre-transplant dialysis modality hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of
           first renal allografts at 1 year posttransplant;

        -  To compare the incidence of composite outcomes biopsy-proven acute rejection of
           pre-transplant dialysis modality hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of first
           renal allografts at 1 year posttransplant;

        -  To compare the incidence of primary nonfunction of pre-transplant dialysis modality
           hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of first renal allografts at 1 year
           posttransplant;

        -  To evaluate the effect of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis on graft function in terms
           of longitudinal change of eGFR calculated with abbreviated MDRD equation at Weeks 8, 16,
           24, 32, 40, and 48 after renal transplant;

        -  To compare the incidence and the duration of hospitalization after kidney
           transplantation of pre-transplant dialysis modality hemodialysis versus peritoneal in
           recipients of first renal allografts at 1 year posttransplant;

        -  To compare the graft loss and subject death rate of pre-transplant dialysis modality
           hemodialysis versus peritoneal in recipients of first renal allografts at 1 year
           posttransplant.

      1.2. Endpoints

      Primary endpoint:

        -  Composite outcome including;

             1. Delayed graft function (defined as the need for dialysis in the first week after
                transplantation)

             2. Functional DGF (defined as the absence of a decrease in serum creatinine level by a
                minimum of 10% per day during 3 consecutive days in the first postoperative week,
                not including patients in whom acute rejection, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, or
                both, developed within the first week

             3. Primary nonfunction (defined as the kidney never achieving function after
                transplantation)

             4. Biopsy proven acute rejection (defined as scute rejection, confirmed by allograft
                biopsy)

                Secondary endpoints:

        -  eGFR (calculated with abbreviated MDRD equation at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 after
           renal transplant)

        -  Hospitalization after kidney transplant (any cause, duration)

        -  Delayed graft function, functional DGF, Primary nonfunction, biopsy proven acute
           rejection (definition of each endpoint is described above)

        -  Graft loss (return to long-term dialysis)

        -  Subject death (any cause)
