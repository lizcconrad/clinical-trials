  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Ergot Dopamine agonists are meanwhile the drugs of first-choice in the treatment of
      Parkinson's disease. The receptor profile of the non-ergot dopamine-agonist piribedil is
      unique. In addition to agonistic effects on dopaminergic D2- and D3-receptors piribedil has
      adrenergic alpha-2A- and alpha-2C-receptors antagonisic properties. There is evidence from
      the literature that the antagonistic properties of piribedil are correlated with an
      improvement of cognitive function and vigilance parameters in parkinson's disease. The aim of
      the present non-interventional study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of piribedil
      during long-term therapy of patients with M. Parkinson under consideration of cognitive
      functions and quality of life.
