  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We evaluated the effect of two weeks of intensive supervised physical activity in serum
      fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels.

      Comparative and longitudinal study. Anthropometric and biochemical evaluation were done
      before, 1hr and 4hr after a bout of exercise and repeated after two weeks of daily supervised
      exercise. We studied sedentary young healthy women. A treadmill exercise test (following the
      Bruce's protocol) was done five times per week (from Monday to Friday) for two weeks. The
      Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the INCMNSZ performed all biochemical
      laboratory measurements using standardized procedures.

      <pre_assignment_details>In the initial visit, patients were instructed to keep unaltered their diet, lifestyle and physical activity. Basal daily physical activity was evaluated with a questionnaire. All participants were assigned to the intervention group.

        <population>The sample size was calculated using the formula for means for two-tailed comparisons. According to our previous report, we expected a minimal change of 80 ng/l of FGF21 after two weeks of physical activity. Using a SD of 160 ng/l with an alfa of 0.05 and a study power of 80%, a total of 60 subjects were calculated. All participants were analyzed.</population>

            <groups_desc>FGF21 was log transformed to approximate normality before analyses. Null hypothesis was Ho = Y1 (FGF21 level at baseline) = Y2 (FGF21 level after two weeks of exercising). Power calculation was 80% with 60 participants evaluated (one group). To evaluate the effect of exercise on clinical and biochemical parameters, we used the difference between final – basal levels (“delta”).</groups_desc>
