      This will be a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled parallel-group study to Replicate
      Efficacy of Nebulized Fluticasone Propionate (FP) in Adult Subjects with Partly Controlled
      and Uncontrolled Asthma. Individual participation will be approximately 16 weeks, including
      12 weeks of double-blind treatment.

      The primary outcome measure is FEV1 (Forced Expiry Volume in 1 second) and the secondary
      outcome measure is Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ),
      Nighttime awakenings and rescue medication usage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A signed and dated written informed consent form prior to the conduct of any study
             procedures

          2. Males and females between ≥ 18 and ≤ 60 years old.

          3. Non-smoker for at least 1 year prior to Visit 1, with a smoking history of no more
             than 10 pack-years (e.g., 1 pack [20 cigarettes] per day for 10 years).

        6.Ability to understand and comply with the protocol requirements (including completion of
        daily PEFR, PFT and ACQ), instructions and protocol-stated restrictions.

        7.Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at the
        screening visit. WOCBP include: any female who has experienced menarche and is not
        post-menopausal (defined as amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months), or has not
        undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal
        ligation). Women who are using acceptable contraceptive medications or devices to prevent
        pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) will be
        considered WOCBP.

        WOCBP must agree to avoid becoming pregnant for the duration of the study by using adequate
        contraception at study entry and throughout the trial. Examples of adequate contraception
        include the following:

          -  Norplant

          -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate injection

          -  Oral contraception

          -  Double-barrier method (e.g., condom and spermicide)

          -  Abstinence, with one of the above WOCBP will be advised to notify the Investigator of
             any changes in their pregnancy status or any change in contraceptive use.

             8.Agreement by subject to abide by the study protocol and its restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past or present disease, excluding asthma, which as judged by the investigator, may
             place the subject at increased risk of complications, interfere with study
             participation, or confound any of the study objectives These diseases include, but are
             not limited to cardiovascular disease, malignancy, gastrointestinal disease, hepatic
             disease, diabetes type I or uncontrolled diabetes, type II, renal disease,
             haematological disease, neurological disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease
             (including, but not confined to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, COPD,
             eosinophilic bronchitis or pulmonary fibrosis).

          2. An upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of Visit 1 and prior to
             Visit 2

          3. A history of hypersensitivity to the study drug or its components, including albuterol
             as rescue medication.

          4. History of illegal drug or alcohol abuse within the past 5 years.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women.

          6. Use of &gt; 8 inhalations per day of SABA on any two consecutive days from screening to
             randomization (Visits 1 and 2).

          7. Use of an investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to screening
