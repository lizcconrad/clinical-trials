      &quot;The impact on fluid loading after cardiac surgery by use of two different priming solution&quot;

      Fluid overloading with oedema formation is a regular finding following on-pump cardiac
      surgery and may contribute to postoperative organ dysfunction. Myocardial oedema has been
      reported to impair both systolic and diastolic function. An association between
      intraoperative fluid loading and postoperative adverse outcome has been demonstrated in
      cardiac patients.

      The investigators have experience with the use of both colloides and combination fluids
      (hypertonic saline/colloides) in several experimental studies (pigs). In one animal study the
      investigators used colloides as an additive to the CPB-prime. The investigators observed
      reduced fluid leakage and less total tissue water in several organs.

      The planned study includes patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass, and who have no
      co-morbidity. The patients will be randomized to receive either Tetraspan® (HES) or acetated
      Ringer`s solution in the CPB-prime. Accurate accounts of fluid additions, blood loss and
      diuresis will be kept. Determination of cardiac output (C.O.), intrathoracic blood volume
      (ITBV), extravascular lung water (EVLW) and global end diastolic volume (GEDV) will be
      monitored by use of the transpulmonary thermodilution technique PiCCO®plus system.

    <description>As a target of effect the investigators have chosen to study improvements for organ function.Indexed values for cardiac output(CI) measured by the PICCO system will be a parameter for heart function, andf lung function will be measured by EVLWI(extravascular lungwater index).paO2/FiO2-ratio and time spent in respirator.Additionally a strict account for fluid balance will be kept.</description>
