    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a depigmenting skin disease common. Vitiligo is caused by the disappearance of
      melanocytes in the epidermis. Vitiligo is the cause of disfigurement, psychological and
      social, that sounds a lot about the quality of life. Currently the standard treatment for
      vitiligo is ultraviolet ray (UV), but it only allows a 50% repigmentation of lesions in half
      of patients. The applications of autologous epidermal cells in the liquid phase is a
      promising new therapeutic approach of vitiligo.

      The main goal of this study is to compare prospectively the repigmentation of vitiligo
      lesions induced by application of autologous epidermal cells in liquid phase associated with
      light therapy and light therapy alone.

      Study's secondary goals: compare the applications of epidermal cells to phototherapy alone
      and phototherapy, in respect of:

        -  Obtain a repigmentation&gt; 70% (threshold considered aesthetically relevant)

        -  The occurrence of adverse events

        -  Patient satisfaction regarding the efficacy and safety of treatment

      MAIN CRITERIA

        -  Rates of repigmentation of the vitiligo lesions to 12 months

        -  The lesions of the layers defined by the investigator to Month 0, Month 3, Month 6 and
           Month 12 will be analyzed by an image analysis system managed by a computer.

        -  Digital photos is taken in order to illustrate the quantitative results above.

      SECONDARY CRITERIA

        -  Repigmentation&gt; 70% of the vitiligo lesions at 12 months

        -  Rates of repigmentation of the vitiligo lesions at 12 months

        -  Side effects: the frequency, severity and time of occurrence will be reported for each
           treatment. Side effects are classified into grades according to World Health
           Organization (WHO) criteria.

        -  Patient satisfaction of the effectiveness and tolerance will be studied using visual
           analogue scales graded from 0 to 10.
