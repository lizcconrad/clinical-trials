      Hypothesis: 3,4-Diaminopyridine base (3,4-DAP) improves Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
      (LEMS)-related weakness.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study were to confirm the safety and to test the efficacy of 3,4-DAP in
      the treatment of LEMS-related weakness.

      This was a phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal study in subjects
      with known clinically active LEMS who had been on a chronic stable dose of compassionate
      distribution Jacobus 3,4-DAP provided through FDA-approved individual investigator-held INDs.

    <intervention_model_description>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal study to assess the safety and efficacy of 3,4-DAP in subjects on a stable regimen of all LEMS-related treatments, including 3,4-DAP, for a minimum of 3 months prior to study entry. Subjects who met all study entry criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue their current treatment regimen (Group A, continuous 3,4-DAP) or tapered withdrawal from 3,4-DAP (Group B, taper to placebo).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The 3TUG time obtained 2 hours after the last dose of the withdrawal period (i.e., at time of theoretical &quot;peak drug effect&quot;) was compared to the average time-matched 3TUG tests performed during 2 days of baseline observation prior to randomization.
The study endpoint was a change of more than 30% in the final post-dose 3TUG during the withdrawal period and was based on blinded readings of video recordings of 3TUG tests.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 or over

          2. Ambulatory while taking 3,4-DAP, i.e. the patient was able to perform the timed up and
             go (TUG), either with or without an assistive device

             improvement in a LEMS-induced dysfunction after they take their first dose of 3,4-DAP
             in the morning [a patient who remains in bed past this point by choice may still be
             eligible]

          7. Stable regimen of all LEMS-related treatments for at least 3 months

          8. Stable daily regimen of other medications (prescription and over-the-counter) for a

             recent treatment is an exclusion)

          2. Clinically significant or poorly controlled condition that in the opinion of the study
             personnel might pose an unacceptable risk to the patient if entered into the study

          3. Respiratory failure requiring intubation while on 3,4-DAP with no precipitating event
             or medication

          4. Use of any investigational drug other than 3,4-DAP within the last 30 days

          5. Pregnant or lactating

          6. Current use of other aminopyridines (e.g.4-AP) or guanidine

          7. Did not display a sufficiently large response to 3,4-DAP during the baseline
             observation period in the CRU to detect a decline during withdrawal of 3,4-DAP
