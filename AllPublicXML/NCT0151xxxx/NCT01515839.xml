  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators primary objective is to acquire preliminary data on one-hundred former NFL
      veterans with at least one full year of professional service using brain SPECT imaging in
      order to assess the degree to which NFL football puts players at risk for traumatic brain
      injury (TBI). TBI severity shall be gauged via visual inspection by a clinician trained in
      neuroanatomy, and also by a statistical comparison of subjects' brains to an in-house
      proprietary database comprised of the brains of healthy subjects.

      The investigators secondary objective is to acquire additional data on these players such
      that investigators may establish causative factors and risks associated with said TBI.

      The investigators tertiary objective is to acquire data on subjects using various mental
      health metrics in order to determine the effects of TBI.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A concentration SPECT scan will be given to assess the changes in regional cerebral blood flow to the brain in our study participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>The SPECT scan is one day imaging exam. A follow up scan will be performed following a 2-12 month supplement intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>For the concentration study the subject will start the Conner's Continuous Performance Task, a 15-minute computer-administered test of attention, subsequent to the accommodation period. Three minutes into task performance 20 milliCuries of Tc-99m-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime will be injected through the catheter with attention to minimal disruption of the subject's attention task. The subject will proceed to completion of the attention task. The concentration scans will then be compared to a healthy brain subject normative database.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) will be used to assess the damage to neural networks in our study participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>The QEEG testing is one day exam. A follow up test will be performed following a 2-12 month supplement intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) testing in both the eyes open and eyes closed condition to measure the electrical activity patterns of the brain. Brain maps will be generated and compared against a normative database.</description>
