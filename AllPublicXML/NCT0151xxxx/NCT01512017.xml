      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open and paralleled positive control study for
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of Veloderm in treatment of split-thickness skin graft
      donor sites. The result implies that Veloerm can do it better than Vaseline gauze in
      accelerating and promoting wound healing of skin graft donor sites. The present study have
      indicated that high permeability of Veloderm dressing to oxygen and water vapor.

      The rational oxygen permeability of Veloderm dressing also provides a good environment for
      wound healing. Therefore, it can be as a temporary skin substitute in the case of missing
      epidermis to play a role, in order to provide an ideal environment for wound
      epithelialization. As regards safety, 1 adverse reaction occured in test group. It shows
      effusion under the dressing mild inflammatory infiltration on the wound edge. After the
      dressing was changed and the effusion was drained, the patient was relieved. As Veloderm
      dressing itself has no direct anti-inflammatory effects, clinical application as appropriate
      can plus other anti-infective drugs in accordance with patient conditions. In conclusion,
      Veloderm is a safe and effective dressing to accelerate the healing of donor sites in burn
      and plastic surgery. Veloderm can be used as a temporary skin substitute in case of damage of
      skin or loss of superficial epidermal (such as burns, wounds, abrasions, ulcers, sores and
      auto-graft donor areas).
