  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of Takeda's tetravalent dengue vaccine
      (TDV) (previously DENVax) administered subcutaneously in healthy adults and children. In
      addition the antibody response to the four dengue virus serotypes will be evaluated.

      The vaccine tested in this study was tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV). TDV was tested to
      assess safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults and children living in dengue endemic
      countries.

      The study enrolled 360 healthy participants. The study was conducted in 2 parts, Part 1 - age
      descending and and Part 2 - expansion - ages 1.5-11 years. Participants were allocated to one
      of the four age cohorts in Part 1 (21 to 45 years, 12 to 20 years, 6 to 11 years, and 1.5 to
      5 years) and expansion age cohort 1.5-11 years in Part 2. Participants were randomized in 2:1
      ratio and in 3: 1 ratio in Part 1 and 2 respectively to receive:

        -  TDV 0.5 mL SC injection

        -  Placebo (inactive solution) - this is a solution that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 37 months (including screening period). Participants made multiple visits to
      the clinic including a final visit at Day 1080.

    <description>Solicited systemic AEs (headache, muscle pain [myalgia], joint pain [arthralgia], eye pain, sensitivity to light [photophobia], tiredness [fatigue], body rash, nausea, were recorded in the participant's-diary along with vomiting [number of times]), and body temperature). Diary-recorded severity grades were based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Severity grades were: Mild (Grade 1): transient symptoms, discomfort noticed but was easily tolerated by the participant with no interference to normal daily activities. Moderate (Grade 2): marked symptoms, moderate interference with participant's daily activities. Severe (Grade 3): Considerable interference with participant's daily activities. The CTCAE severity grades for fever and vomiting were derived from the diary-recorded measurements of temperature level and number of episodes, respectively.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Solicited Local (Injection Site) Adverse Events (AEs) (Diary-Recorded) Following Either Vaccination Dose by Severity</title>
        <description>Solicited local injection site reactions were collected by subject diary and graded based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03 for pain [Grade 0 (no pain), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe)] and itching (pruritus) [Grade 0 (no itching), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (Severe]. Severity grade for redness (erythema) and swelling (edema/induration) were derived from recorded length of the longest diameter measurement using the FDA Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale of Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trial were Grade 0 (&lt;2.5 cm), 1 (mild: 2.5-5 cm), 2 (moderate: 5.1-10 cm) and 3 (severe: &gt;10 cm) and Grade 4 (Potentially Life-threatening: necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Solicited Systemic Adverse Events (AEs) (Diary–Recorded) Following Either Vaccination Dose by Severity</title>
        <description>Solicited systemic AEs (headache, muscle pain [myalgia], joint pain [arthralgia], eye pain, sensitivity to light [photophobia], tiredness [fatigue], body rash, nausea, were recorded in the participant’s-diary along with vomiting [number of times]), and body temperature). Diary-recorded severity grades were based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Severity grades were: Mild (Grade 1): transient symptoms, discomfort noticed but was easily tolerated by the participant with no interference to normal daily activities. Moderate (Grade 2): marked symptoms, moderate interference with participant’s daily activities. Severe (Grade 3): Considerable interference with participant’s daily activities. The CTCAE severity grades for fever and vomiting were derived from the diary-recorded measurements of temperature level and number of episodes, respectively.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The severity of all unsolicited AEs was evaluated by the Investigator (using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.03) as follows. Mild (Grade 1): Transient symptoms, discomfort noticed but was easily tolerated by the participant with no interference to normal daily activities. Moderate (Grade 2): Marked symptoms, moderate interference with participant's daily activities. Severe (Grade 3): Considerable interference with participant's daily activities.</description>

        <title>Seropositivity Rate to Each of the Four Dengue Serotypes at Day 120</title>
        <description>Seropositivity rate, defined as the percentage of participants seropositive, was derived from titers of dengue-neutralizing antibodies. Participants were classified by titer after Day 0 as seropositive or seronegative. Seropositive was defined as a MNT50 titre value of ≥10 for any serotype and seronegative was defined as titre value of less than (&lt;) 10 for all 4 serotypes. Seropositivity was assessed for the four dengue serotypes: TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3, TDV-4.</description>

        <description>Seropositivity rate, defined as the percentage of participants seropositive, was derived from titers of dengue-neutralizing antibodies. Participants were classified by titer after Day 0 as seropositive or seronegative. Seropositive was defined as a MNT50 titre value of ≥10 and seronegative was defined as titre value of less than (&lt;) 10. Seropositivity was assessed for the four dengue serotypes: TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3, TDV-4.</description>
