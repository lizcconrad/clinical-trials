  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled study with three parallel arms
      examining the effects of magnesium supplementation in the second trimester of pregnancy.

      Recent research has shown that supplemental magnesium can have beneficial effects, especially
      in overweight individuals. Not only do many people have a magnesium deficient diet, there is
      also evidence that magnesium can improve blood sugar levels. Due to the growing concern of
      obesity with pregnancy and its associated complications, such as diabetes and abnormal fetal
      growth, magnesium therapy could have novel and beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes.

      In this study, 60 overweight and obese pregnant patients in their first trimester will be
      enrolled and randomized. The first group (A) will receive oral magnesium citrate (300mg
      elemental Magnesium), group B will receive dietary counseling about following a magnesium
      rich diet from a nutritionist, and group C will receive a placebo (control). Blood and urine
      specimens will be collected at three time points during the pregnancy to analyze changes in
      levels of metabolic markers, inflammatory markers, and protein expression profiles. Fetal and
      maternal complications of pregnancy will be noted, including maternal weight gain. At
      delivery, patients will have a placental cord blood specimen and placental biopsy collected
      for gene expression patterns and further analysis.
