  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since people started taking HIV medications, illnesses related to AIDS have decreased, but
      other serious illnesses like heart disease (heart attacks) and certain kinds of cancer have
      increased. Studies show that HIV causes changes in the lining of the arteries and also causes
      inflammation (irritation) inside the body that may play a role in diseases like heart attacks
      and strokes. The levels of inflammation and artery lining health can also affect how well
      your brain works. These changes cannot be felt, but can be measured. Artery lining health can
      be looked at with a test that uses a blood pressure cuff on your arm to see how the artery
      responds when air is let in and out of the cuff. An ultrasound (machine that uses sound
      waves) is used to look at the artery during the test. This test is called Flow Mediated
      Dilation or FMD for short. Inflammation can be checked with blood tests (blood tests that
      measure this irritation inside the body that you cannot feel). HIV medications can improve
      the artery lining health and can partially lower levels of inflammation in the blood;
      however, these levels of inflammation may not be able to return back to normal.

      Pravastatin sodium is a medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for treating high cholesterol. Pravastatin sodium has also been able to improve the health of
      the lining of the arteries and lower the level of inflammation in people with other diseases,
      but has not been studied or approved for this purpose in people who have HIV. This research
      study will look at the effects of two types of medications used separately or together on the
      health of the lining of arteries and levels of inflammation in the blood: Atripla (a HIV
      medication) and pravastatin sodium. This study will also look at the effects of Atripla and
      pravastatin sodium on cholesterol levels, tests that measure how well you can think and
      calculate (tests of neurocognitive function), and at the effects of Atripla on the levels of
      pravastatin sodium in the blood.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection

          -  Willingness to defer initiation of ART for up to 24 weeks or statin therapy for up to
             12 weeks after study entry.

          -  CD4+ cell count &gt;500/mm3 within 60 days prior to study entry obtained at any
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

          -  No prior ART of more than 10 cumulative days with the following exceptions:

               -  Use of ART drugs as part of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) provided the
                  participant did not acquire HIV-1 infection from the event that required PEP.

               -  ART use during pregnancy that resulted in virologic suppression based on the
                  assay available at the time and was not complicated while on therapy either by
                  detectable HIV-1 RNA following suppression or the development of resistance.
                  Women who received ZDV monotherapy prior to the availability of viral load
                  testing will still be considered eligible as long as ZDV was not taken for more
                  than 12 weeks. ART must have been stopped within 4 weeks of delivery and cannot
                  have been received within 6 months of the A5292 screening visit.

               -  Receipt of ARV drugs while HIV-uninfected, with documentation of negative HIV-1

             to study entry. This includes all statin drugs, omega-3-fatty acids/fish oil (if dose
             &gt; 1 g/day), red yeast rice (any dose), and niacin products (e.g., niacin, nicotinic
             acid, vitamin B3; if dose of &gt;100 mg/day), in addition to those listed on the A5292
             PSWP.

          -  No ART within the past 30 days.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide
             informed consent.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, no medical, mental health or other condition that
             precludes participation.

          -  Certain laboratory values obtained within 60 days prior to entry, as indicated in
             section 4.1.10 of the protocol.

          -  Framingham Risk Score (FRS) greater than/equal to 10% OR FRS greater than/equal to 6%
             if hsCRP &gt; 3.0 mg/L OR participant has controlled type ll diabetes mellitus.

          -  No evidence of any exclusionary resistance mutations based on results from any
             genotype assay from any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.
             The result must either be available from previous testing or must be obtained prior to
             entry and have been reviewed by the site investigator. If a genotype is submitted, but
             for technical reasons cannot be completed, the participant will still be allowed to
             enroll, if otherwise eligible. (The protocol will not provide the resistance assay).
             An exclusionary resistance mutation is defined in section 4.1.12 of the protocol.

          -  Completion of the pre-entry FMD assessment.

          -  For women of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a
             sensitivity of ≤ 25 mIU/mL at screening and within 72 hours prior to study entry.

          -  Female study volunteers of reproductive potential include women who have not been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, (i.e., who have had menses within
             the preceding 24 months, or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization,
             specifically hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy).

          -  Contraception requirements-

               -  All subjects must agree not to participate in the conception process and if
                  participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to use
                  at least two reliable methods of contraception for 2 weeks before study
                  treatment, while receiving study treatment, and for 6 weeks after receiving study
                  treatment. As hormone-based contraceptives can affect coagulopathy biomarkers,
                  subjects who plan on using such a contraceptive during the study must be taking
                  the same product for at least 30 days prior to screening and be encouraged to
                  continue throughout the duration of the study, if medically feasible.

               -  Subjects receiving an EFV-based regimen must use a barrier method as one of the
                  two forms of contraception. Acceptable types of contraception include male or
                  female condoms (with or without a spermicidal agent), diaphragm or cervical cap
                  with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), and hormone-based contraceptive

          -  Female subjects who are not of reproductive potential or whose male partner(s) has
             azoospermia are eligible to start study drugs without requiring the use of
             contraceptives. Confirmation of the lack of reproductive potential is REQUIRED and
             written documentation or oral communication from a clinician or clinician's staff must
             be documented in source documents of either a physician report/letter, operative
             report or other source documentation in the patient record, discharge summary,
             laboratory report of azoospermia, or FSH measurement elevated into the menopausal
             range as established by the reporting laboratory.

          -  Ability and willingness to complete the neuropsychological tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.
