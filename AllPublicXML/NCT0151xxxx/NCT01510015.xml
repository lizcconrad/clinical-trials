    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of psychological and pharmacological treatment of regular
      users of cannabis and psychostimulants in a treatment center (Kfar Izun) in Israel. The
      participants will undergo psychological evaluation before and during treatment and follow up
      at 4 months. Ten participants will undergo brain imaging of the dopamine receptor D2 in order
      to evaluate the effects of treatment on dopamine turnover in the brain. A control group of
      psychiatric in-patients undergoing treatment for psychiatric illness with be recruited from
      Geha Hospital in Israel. It is predicted that successful treatment of regular users of
      cannabis will be resulted in improvement in anxiety, depression and psychotic symptoms as
      well as in upregulation of dopamine turnover in participants that will undergo brain imaging.

      There is a significant number of cannabis and psychostimulant users that experience psychotic
      episodes and require psychiatric treatment. This study evaluates the effects of psychological
      and pharmacological treatment of regular users of cannabis and psychostimulants in a
      treatment center (Kfar Izun) in Israel. The participants will undergo psychological
      evaluation before and during treatment and follow up at 4 months. Ten participants will
      undergo brain imaging of the dopamine receptor D2 using [I123] IBZM in Single Photon Emitted
      Tomography (SPECT) before and after treatment in order to evaluate the effects of treatment
      on dopamine turnover in the brain. A control group of psychiatric in-patients undergoing
      treatment for psychiatric illness with be recruited from Geha Hospital in Israel.
