  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies shows that reduced nervousness before anaesthesia may improve a course past
      anaesthesia. Therefore it is interesting to investigate how we can best help patients shortly
      before anaesthesia. A RCT with three intervention arms (with different personal support) and
      a control arm (with usual personal support) is therefore performed.

      Hypothesis: Nervousness is reduced by the new interventions compared to the usual help
      provided.

      All patients receive behavioral support the last half hour before anaesthesia, but at
      different times and provided by persons with different connection to the patients.

      The last two patients in all arms will be interviewed about their experiences with the help
      offered.

      Statistic will provide results in the quantitative part of the study and analysis and
      interpretation following ideas of the French philosopher Poul Ricoeur will provide results in
      the qualitative part of the study.
