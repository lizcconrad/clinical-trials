  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current management of elective bowel surgery typically involves performing a preoperative
      bowel preparation (&quot;bowel prep&quot;) in many instances; however, this practice is not
      standardized at most institutions. Over the years, bowel preps have been used in an attempt
      to decrease the risk of complications associated with gastrointestinal surgery. However,
      there is limited adequate data to support this clinical management in the pediatric patient
      population. The investigator plans to perform a prospective, randomized study of our
      pediatric surgical patients who will undergo an elective bowel resection or ostomy closure to
      assess if a bowel prep prior to surgical intervention affects their postoperative course. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate for differences that may alter and improve future
      management.

    <textblock>
      At CMH, our current approach to preoperative management for elective intestinal surgery is
      not standardized amongst our Pediatric Surgical attendings. There are seven different
      attendings, each of whom individually dictates if a patient is to undergo a preoperative
      bowel prep, and if so, which bowel prep will be used. This is no different than the majority
      of practices across the US, including adult and pediatric patient populations. The aim of
      this study, therefore, is to standardize our current management and assess if the presence or
      absence of a preoperative bowel prep has an effect on post-operative outcomes. The goal is to
      evaluate the effect of the bowel preparation not the surgical procedure itself.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All children, ages 3 months to 17 years, who will undergo an elective bowel resection
             or ostomy closure at CMH

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose operation was performed emergently, and hence a bowel prep was not
             possible preoperatively;

          -  If they necessitate a diverting proximal ostomy;

          -  If they have any known intra-abdominal infection preoperatively;

          -  If an intra-operative colonoscopy is necessary, and hence the patient must have a
             preoperative bowel prep.

          -  No patients with an underlying malignancy or immunodeficiency or with renal, metabolic
             or cardiac conditions will be included.

          -  No patients with known allergies to any medication used in the bowel preparation will
             be included.
