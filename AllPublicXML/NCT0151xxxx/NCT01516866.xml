  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a newer imaging technique, called
      18F-Sodium Fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography (PET). NaF is a tracer (dye) that is
      very sensitive for changes in bone. By using this tracer with positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, our ability to evaluate and measure changes
      in bone lesions could be greatly improved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at how repeatable the NaF PET scans are before treatment. Scans will also
      be performed after standard chemotherapy or hormone-directed treatment. This will allow
      evaluation of how the NaF PET scans change with the chemotherapy or hormone-directed therapy.
      In addition, NaF PET scans will be compared with standard computed tomography (CT) and bone
      scans, as well as prostate specific antigen (PSA). This information could be used to develop
      better ways to measure prostate cancer bone lesions. In turn, this could be used to better
      evaluate treatment effects of standard chemotherapy and other new drugs being developed to
      treat prostate cancer.

    <description>NaF PET/CT scan will be performed within 14 days prior to starting chemotherapy (antimicrotubule directed chemotherapy) or hormone-directed therapy (baseline #1). A portion of subjects (up to 20 subjects at each site, 60 subjects total) will have a second NaF PET/CT scan performed (baseline #2) within 1-8 days of the initial scan to see if measurements repeated over a short period of time are similar.</description>

    <description>Subjects who will be enrolled will be those who will be starting treatment (as part of standard of care or as part of another trial) with either a microtubule directed chemotherapy regimen (cohort A), or AR-directed therapy (cohort B). All subjects will have a baseline NaF PET/CT scan (baseline #1), performed within days prior to starting either chemotherapy or AR-directed therapy. A subset of subjects (up to 20 subjects per site, 60 total) will undergo a second NaF PET/CT scan (baseline #2) within 1-8 days of the initial scan to determine repeatability of NaF PET/CT scanning. Subjects in cohort A will undergo another NaF PET/CT scan at week 8 (+/- 1 week). Subjects in cohort B will undergo two additional NaF PET/CT scans at weeks 6 and 12 (+/- 1 week).</description>
