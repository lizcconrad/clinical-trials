  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fact that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well known efficacious intervention for
      children with anxiety disorders (AD) is undeniable. However, most children with AD have
      limited access to CBT. There is some controversial evidence on group CBT in AD involving
      families in treatment of their children and a published article on efficacy of a parent only
      group CBT for these children. Considering these data, the investigators hypothesized that
      teaching anxiety-fighting skills to parents of children with AD would diminish anxiety
      symptoms of both parents and children and improve family relational functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All children and their parents were interviewed using K-SADS-PL-Persian Version, a
      semi-structured diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnoses and assess possible
      comorbidities. All diagnostic assessments were conducted by a fellowship of child and
      adolescent psychiatry. Following assessment, once the participants reached twenty members,
      they were invited to complete child and parent self-report measures. The level of child
      functioning and family relationship functioning were also evaluated. Then they were randomly
      allocated to either parent training (N=20) or a 6 week wait-list (N=22) groups. During 2
      weeks after treatment the assessments were repeated and satisfaction ratings were collected
      for the intervention group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety (RCMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This self report questionnaire consists of 28 items assessing a child's chronic or trait anxiety and 9 items assessing social desirability or potential lying. The RCMA has achieved a high internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Depression Inventory (CDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This self report inventory has 27 items related to the cognitive, affective and behavioral signs of depression. The scale has high internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 42 item self-report instrument designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The DASS was shown to possess satisfactory psychometric properties.45-47 Parents completed this scale about their own negative emotional states</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This Scale was developed to be a more child-specific measure of functioning. This measure is currently used in diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of children's mental health problems to determine eligibility to receive mental health services and document treatment outcome status</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Consumer Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>25 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Post treatment, parents in the intervention group completed a satisfaction questionnaire to rate how useful the program was in controlling their own anxiety, in managing their child anxious behavior, in improving family relations, the likelihood they would attend the treatment program again if needed, and if they would recommend the program to others on a 1 (not recommend) to 7 (highly recommend) likert scale</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Home Version</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: 30 minutes]</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a parent report of psychopathology in children and adolescents. The scale consists of 25 items which generates five subscale scores (Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Inattention/Hyperactivity, Peer Problems and Prosocial Behavior) and a Total Difficulties Score. We used the SDQ Emotional Symptoms Scale (SDQ-Em) as a parent measure of child anxiety. SDQ has adequate internal consistency (Î±=0.37) and good test-retest reliability (r=0.62).42-44 The validity and reliability of SDQ has been confirmed in community samples of Iranian children and adolescents</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Relational Assessment of Functioning (GRAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: 15 minutes]</time_frame>
    <description>It provides a measure of the quality of functioning based on a review of three major areas: problem-solving, organization, and the emotional atmosphere. Available psychometric evidence suggests that clinician and even non clinician raters can achieve good to excellent reliability with only minimal training. The validity of the GRAF is supported by expected correlations with other measures of family and couple distress and functioning</description>
