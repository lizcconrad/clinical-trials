  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitrectomy is the common treatment for patients with macular edema secondary to epiretinal
      membrane. Recently, in eyes with diabetic macular edema or persistent macular edema following
      retinal vein occlusion, vitrectomy will be increasingly performed as an additional treatment
      modality. In eyes with impaired oxygen situation vitrectomy may improve the retinal oxygen
      saturation. However, little information is available about the oxygenation and the blood flow
      of the retinal vessels after vitroretinal surgery.

      Hypoxia is a the major trigger of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is in turn
      the most important factor for the development of macular edema. It is a major issue to
      improve the oxygen situation and the blood flow of the retina and there are just a few not
      satisfactory procedures available to overcome this problem. However, vitrectomy would be an
      adequate therapy for many of these diseases, and it would be an appreciated side effect of
      the treatment in almost every case.

      To investigate the influence of oxygenation and blood flow of the retina on clinical outcomes
      after a successfully 23 gauge vitrectomy in eyes with epiretinal membrane, persistent macular
      edema following diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion.
