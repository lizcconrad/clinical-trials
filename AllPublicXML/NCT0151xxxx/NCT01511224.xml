  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extensively and multi-drug resistant A. baumannii (AB) represent an emerging threat in
      hospitals locally and worldwide. There is lack of prospective comparative clinical data to
      guide optimal strategy for treating such infections. Since it remains unclear how to treat
      bacteremia caused by AB, the present study aims to enroll patients at multiple sites with
      extensively drug resistant Acinetobacter species bacteremia receiving different combination
      therapy to assess treatment outcomes and analyze risk factors associated with mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with AB bacteremia receiving antimicrobial therapy are eligible for this multicenter
      study. Antimicrobial agents are decided at the discretion of the attending clinical team.
      Clinical data to be collected include patient demographics (age, gender, underlying diseases,
      Pitt Bacteremia Score [20], duration of ICU stay and hospitalization before the day of first
      positive blood culture, central venous catheterization), antimicrobial agents on the day of
      bacteremia, regimens and durations of combination therapy after enrollment, and outcomes
      (sequential quantification change of blood A. baumannii polymerase chain reaction [PCR],
      survival at day 30 after enrollment, and adverse drug reactions of antimicrobial agents).
      Blood sample will be collected on the day of enrollment (Day 0), Day 1, 2, 3 and 7 for PCR
      quantification of A. baumannii and for genospecies identification. Primary end points are the
      interval from study enrollment to negative blood A. baumannii PCR and blood sterilization.
      Secondary end points are survival at 14 and 30-day after enrollment, adverse drug reactions
      of antimicrobial agents, and risk factors for survival at 30-day after enrollment. Inclusion
      criteria: 1. Adults &gt;16 years 2. With blood culture isolate(s) A. baumannii. 3. Informed
      consent gained. Exclusion criteria: 1. Second/repeat episodes of bacteremia 2. Patients who
      could not or did not receive antimicrobial treatment 3. Patient not admitted to hospital.
