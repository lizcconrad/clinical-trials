  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a correlation exists between the partial
      pressure of carbon dioxide existing within arterial blood and the gradient between inhaled
      and exhaled fractions of oxygen.

    <measure>Correlate the level of carbon dioxide within arterial blood to inspired and expired oxygen gradient.</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the levels of carbon dioxide found in the patient's blood to the amounts of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air that the patient inhales and exhales. If a relationship exists between the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen inhaled and exhaled by the patient, anesthesiologists will be able to use this relationship to adjust ventilators during anesthesia without having to take blood from an artery.</description>

        Adults age 18 to 65 scheduled for a surgical procedure that will last at least two hours

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 65.

          -  Scheduled for surgical procedure that will last at least 2 hours.

          -  Arterial cannulation is planned because of either the complexity of the surgery or
             patient comorbidity.

          -  At least two arterial blood gas analyses are planned during the surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No arterial cannulation is necessary or planned for the procedure.
