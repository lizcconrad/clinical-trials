  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to determine whether ulinastatin, urinary anti-trypsin
      inhibitor, attenuates cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-activated systemic inflammatory response
      in cardiac surgery with CPB.

      Serial measurements and analysis of several inflammatory cytokines (bactericidal permeability
      increasing protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α)as well as markers of cardiac
      injury, renal impairment and oxygenation profile will be performed to determine ulinastatin's
      efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Applying aortic cross-clamp (ACC) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for cardiac surgery
      produces variable systemic inflammatory reactions. As a common complication of those
      reactions, pulmonary dysfunction, which usually indicated by postoperative hypoxemia, is
      frequently associated with cardiac surgery employing CPB and has been used as a major
      predictor of morbidity and mortality.

      Circulating humoral and cellular factors are involved in the development of the systemic
      inflammatory reactions including organ dysfunction. So far, many studies analyzed the
      concentration of inflammatory marker (cytokine) to determine the degree of systemic
      inflammatory responses in various conditions.

      Ulinastatin has anti-inflammatory activity and suppresses the infiltration of neutrophils.
      Previous studies suggested ulinastatin's cytoprotective effect against ischemia-reperfusion
      injury in major organs and its inhibition of inflammatory marker production.

      The purpose of the present study is to determine ulinastatin's possible protective efficacy
      of in attenuating CPB-activated systemic inflammatory response regarding postoperative
      cardiac, renal and pulmonary dysfunction in cardiac surgery with CPB. Serial measurements and
      analysis of several inflammatory cytokines, such as bactericidal permeability increasing
      protein (BPI), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, as well as markers of
      cardiac injury, renal impairment and oxygenation profile, such as creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB),
      troponin I (TnI), C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial O2 tension /inspired O2 fraction
      (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), will be performed to this purpose.
