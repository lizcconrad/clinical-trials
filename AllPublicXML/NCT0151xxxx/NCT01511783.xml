    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study is to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of E2609 when
      administered to healthy elderly subjects.

Doses will be 25, 50, and 200 mg once daily by the oral route, each dose administered to a separate cohort (group) of subjects.
