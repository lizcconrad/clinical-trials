      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the behavior of intravitreal injection of of
      autologous bone marrow stem cells in patients with age related macular degeneration.

    <textblock>
      A prospective phase I/II, nonrandomized open-label study of agen related macular degeneration
      and Stargartd patients with best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 20/200.
      Standardized ophthalmic evaluation will be perform at baseline and at weeks 1, 4,12 and 24
      (Â±1) following intravitreal injection of 10 x 106 bone marrow stem cells/ 0,1ml . Three
      measures will be used to evaluate the short-term safety of intravitreal of bone marrow stem
      cells: 1) severe visual loss, defined as a drop in 15 letters on ETDRS visual acuity scale;
      2) decrease in ERG response; 3) decrease in 5 square degrees on visual field; secondary
      safety outcomes : 1) increase in intra-ocular inflammation defined herein as anterior chamber
      cells and flare higher than 3+ for more than 1 month after injection according to a
      classification described elsewhere ; 2) decrease in CMT more than 50um; 3)genesis of abnormal
      tissues (teratomas) or tumors; 4) qualitative changes in retinal or choroidal perfusion, like
      macular nonperfusion. Secondary outcome measures will be used to evaluate the short-term
      efficiency of intravitreal of Bone Marrow Stem Cells: 1) improvement in ERG response; 2)
      increase in visual field: 3) increase in CSMT &gt; 50um and not related to macular edemar or
      choroidal neovascularization; 4) increase &gt; 5 letters on BCVA

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female AMD and Stargartd patients 18 to 80 years old, inclusive.

          -  In either eye, diagnosis of geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization due to
             AMD

          -  ETDRS best corrected visual acuity of 60 letters or worse in the study eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Retinal disease other than AMD in study eye which, in the investigator's opinion, may
             pose a safety risk or interfere with the study.

          -  Choroidal neovascularization due to a cause other than AMD.

          -  In the study eye, media opacity that interferes with fundus imaging or is likely to
             require surgery during the study period.

          -  Any of the following treatments to the study eye within 14 days prior to dosing:
             ranibizumab (Lucentis), bevacizumab (Avastin), pegaptanib (Macugen), or other VEGF
             inhibitor; OR likely requirement for one of the above treatments within 14 days of
             LFG316 administration.

          -  Any of the following within 30 days prior to dosing: photodynamic therapy treatment in
             the study eye; extrafoveal or juxtafoveal thermal laser photocoagulation in the study
             eye; systemic or topical (ophthalmic) steroid use in the study eye; bacterial
             keratitis in the study eye; OR intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the
             fellow eye.

          -  Any of the following within 90 days prior to dosing: intraocular surgery (including
             cataract surgery) in the study eye; OR intravitreal or periocular corticosteroid
             injection in the study eye.

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical study, or use of any experimental
             treatment for AMD or any other investigational new drug within 12 weeks prior to the
             start of study treatment. Clinical trials solely involving over-the-counter vitamins,
             supplements, or diets will not exclude the patients from study participation.

          -  Any medical condition likely to interfere with the patient's participation in the
             study, or likely to cause serious adverse events during the study.
