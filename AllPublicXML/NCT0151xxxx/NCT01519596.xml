    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial that studies symptom-adapted physical activity
      intervention in minimizing physical function decline in older patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) undergoing chemotherapy. Physical activity may help decrease functional
      impairment and improve the quality of life in patients with AML undergoing chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a symptom-adapted, randomized behavioral
      intervention designed to improve physical function in older adults receiving chemotherapy for
      AML.

      II. To estimate the effect size of the physical activity intervention on change in an
      objective measure of physical function, SPPB (short physical performance battery).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the effects of the physical activity intervention on self-reported physical
      function, health-related quality of life, and symptoms (depression, distress, fatigue).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients participate in an orientation session introducing the exercise program and
      protocol, reviewing fundamental principles, and demonstrating each activity. Patients also
      receive educational materials to facilitate orientation and adherence. Patients are offered
      20-50 minute standard, intermediate, and/or low intensity physical activity sessions 5 days a
      week for 4 weeks. Patients also receive lifestyle-related counseling for 20-30 minutes once
      weekly.

      ARM II: Patients undergo usual care for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every two weeks for two months
      and then monthly until week 24.
