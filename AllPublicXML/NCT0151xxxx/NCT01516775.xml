  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fasting (according to ASA, ESA or institutional guidelines) is an important strategy to
      minimize the risk of regurgitation, vomiting and pulmonary aspiration during general
      anaesthesia; the effect of fasting time for clear fluid on gastric pH in children is goal of
      this study and can be investigated in children undergoing elective procedures in intubation
      anaesthesia without inconvenience or additional invasive procedure and hence without
      additional risk

      Hypotheses: Gastric pH is higher in children that drink until 1 hour before anaesthesia
      induction than in those that drink until 2 hours before anaesthesia induction
