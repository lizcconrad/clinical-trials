  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In January 2010 a new interdisciplinary clinic (STOMP) was created to provide care for
      children and adolescents with severe 'complex' obesity. As part of the program, a subset of
      adolescents undergo bariatric surgery. There is a paucity of literature evaluating outcomes
      of children and adolescents participating in a 'clinical' setting and even fewer reports of
      outcomes of severely obese pediatric patients. Previously, the investigators evaluated
      clinical outcomes of children with craniopharyngioma and hypothalamic obesity attending an
      outpatient interdisciplinary program at SickKids (The Comprehensive Care Clinic for Children
      with Central Tumours) and found significant benefit to those attending, including reduction
      of weight gain (or weight loss), improved psychosocial functioning, and increased care
      satisfaction. STOMP is a natural extension of this program, incorporating some core elements
      (e.g., interdisciplinary team, frequent visits, individualized care plans for
      medically-complex adolescents) and building on other aspects, such as increased psychosocial
      intervention; involvement of a &quot;key worker&quot; (nurse practitioner) to support families;
      provision of continuity of care with other health providers in all settings, community
      services and schools; a more diverse patient population; and group support sessions.
      Evaluation of the outcomes of this clinic is needed to inform best practice for children and
      adolescents with severe complex obesity

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to conduct an evaluation of the STOMP clinic as a model of care with
      a specific focus on: (i) patient outcomes (anthropometric, metabolic, and psychosocial); and
      (ii) care coordination and care satisfaction.

      Patient outcomes will be compared against baseline evaluation data over time, and to a
      control group of patients not enrolled in the program, but who expressed interest in the
      program and were unable to attend.

        STOMP Group: 12-17 years of age. Patients in the program have severe complex obesity which
        is defined as as children and youth who have a BMI &gt;95th percentile for their age and
        gender in addition to any one of the following: at least one significant obesity-related
        co-morbidity requiring specialty care (e.g. type 2 diabetes, hypertension), other
        co-existing chronic illness impacted by obesity (e.g. CNS tumor, post-organ transplant), or
        a BMI â‰¥99th percentile for their age and gender

        Control: Approximately 50% of attendees choose not to book into the program, for reasons
        including difficulty attending the frequent appointments due to distance or inability to
        leave work early. This population will serve as the control group for the evaluation. In
        addition, control participants will be recruited from the community through posters posted
        in the hospital.
