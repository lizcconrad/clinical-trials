    <textblock>
      Subjects who have minor, second degree burns may be enrolled in this study. Subjects will
      receive either Santyl ointment or bacitracin ointment to apply to the burn until it heals.
      Bandages will be used to keep the burn covered while it heals. Second degree burns generally
      leave a scar. Once the burn heals, lotion and an appropriate bandage will be used to try to
      minimize the appearance of a scar.

      The study hypothesis is that burns treated with Santyl will have a better scar appearance
      than burns treated with bacitracin.

      Subjects enrolled in this study will make once a week visits to the University of Kansas
      Medical Center outpatient burn clinic until the burn heals. The burn will be assessed for
      healing at these visits. Once healed, visits to the clinic will be every 1-3 months for up to
      1 year. At these visits, the appearance of the scar will be evaluated

             designated study staff member has explained the study procedures, risks, and contact
             information. For subjects not able to provide informed consent (e.g., minors), a
             parent or legally authorized representative must provide consent. Assent must be

          -  Have one or more acute burns which:

          -  • are thermal, chemical or electrical in etiology

          -  • in aggregate cover &lt;10% TBSA

          -  • are each equal to or less than 72 hrs old

          -  • are each no more than deep partial thickness (2nd degree)

          -  • are not visibly infected

          -  Able to take in oral fluids.

          -  Able to comply with the requirement for daily dressing changes, or have a caretaker

          -  Willing to make all required study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the test article or their
             components (e.g., known hypersensitivity to bacitracin).

          -  Embedded foreign bodies in the burn wound which cannot be immediately removed.

          -  The burned tissue includes or is within 1 cm of the eye or genitalia.

          -  Severe perioral burns.

          -  Airway involvement or aspiration of hot liquids.

          -  Suspicion of physical abuse.

          -  Burn wound requires a skin graft.

          -  Outpatient management of the burn wound is not appropriate.

          -  Participation in another investigational clinical study within thirty (30) days of the
             Screening Visit.

          -  Current or recent (&lt; 6 months) history of severe, unstable, or uncontrolled
             neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, hepatic, and/or renal
             disease or evidence of other diseases based upon a review of medical history that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude safe subject participation in the
             study.

          -  The Medical Monitor and / or Investigator may declare any subject ineligible for a
             valid medical reason.
