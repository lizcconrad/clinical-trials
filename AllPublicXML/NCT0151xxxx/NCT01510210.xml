  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the risk profile in patients with atrial
      fibrillation, which represents the degree of changes in the atrial tissue and which can help
      predict in which patients rhythm control will be successful. This risk profile will consist
      of a combination of underlying (heart) disease and risk factors, measurements obtained from
      echocardiograms, and circulating biomarkers. Ultimately this risk profile can be used to
      guide type of rhythm control therapy in individual patients with atrial fibrillation.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality.Identification of
      patients with atrial fibrillation that is difficult to treat may improve the outcome of
      rhythm control therapy. Left atrial size could be a useful tool to select patients that will
      benefit from rhythm control therapy.Beside echocardiographic parameters,atrial fibrillation
      has been also associated with circulating biomarkers in blood like collagen metabolism,
      inflammatory mediators,neurohumoral factors and proteins/proteomic profiles. Beside more
      accepted risk factors (myocardial ischemia, diabetes and pulmonary disease)other less
      well-known clinical factors (sleep apnea, alcohol or other intoxication abuse, excessive
      physical activity, esophageal problems and increased body mass index) may also predict the
      outcome of rhythm control.It likes also plausible that recurrent atrial fibrillation within
      one month after start of rhythm control are associated with a different risk profile than
      late atrial fibrillation recurrence.During this study we will try to identify patients with
      atrial fibrillation who are more or less likely to respond to rhythm control therapy.
