  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a 3D nuclear medicine imaging technique
      that is used extensively to study the heart and diagnose heart disease. There are three major
      limitations in SPECT imaging: attenuation or loss of signal, scattering of the signal in the
      patient tissues and resolution, where the signal gets blurrier the further the nuclear
      activity is away from the camera. New software, Evolution for CardiacTM, by GE Healthcare and
      new cameras with computed tomography (CT) decrease the time needed for images to be obtained
      while maintaining image quality. Evaluation is needed before they become standard of care.
