      This research looks for markers in the blood of people with spinal cord injury that may be a
      sign of injury severity, or serve as a clue to the degree of recovery. Investigators would
      also like to compare the marker profile of these patient with that of other neurological
      conditions such as stroke and Guillain-Barre syndrome.

      Patients participating in this trial will be those accepted to neuro-rehabilitation in Sheba
      medical center, Israel. They will join the trial at their arrival to the ward, no less than 2
      week after the beginning of their condition, but no later than 3 months.

      Patients will be examined by the research staff three times:

        1. At arrival, the patients will be neurologically examined and their functional abilities
           will be assessed. Blood will be drawn and sent to the lab.

        2. At 6 months after the beginning of the neurological condition the same will be repeated:
           the patients will be neurologically examined and their functional abilities will be
           assessed, and blood will be drawn and sent to the lab.

        3. The final examination will take place 1 year after the beginning of the neurological
           condition. This time only the neurological and functional abilities will be assessed
           without blood tests.

      The blood samples will be tested in the research lab. Then investigators shall compare the
      clinical findings with the laboratory findings, and see if any of the markers found reflect
      the injury severity or predict the recovery.
