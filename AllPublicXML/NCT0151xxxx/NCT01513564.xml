  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Convalescence after lumbar fusion is dependent on pain. In orthopaedic and abdominal surgery
      accelerated stay programs with optimized pain management enhance recovery.

      The objective is to evaluate the effect of a revised and optimized perioperative fast track
      program in lumbar fusion surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major spine surgery is usually associated with high postoperative pain scores and opioid
      requirements. Epidural analgesia has been reported to be an effective and safe method to
      control postoperative pain after spinal instrumentation surgery, but the overall effects of
      pain management on postoperative length of stay and recovery remains debatable.

      However, in a multimodal approach, including multimodal non-opioid analgesia to control
      postoperative pathophysiology and rehabilitation, complications and hospital stay have been
      reduced after arthroscopy, hip arthroplasty and knee arthroplasty, hip fractures and
      abdominal surgery and other procedures, when combined with an enhanced recovery program.

      The aim of the study is to assess the effect and safety of a combined analgesic regimen
      consisting of local anesthetic, intra-operative and post-operative continuous epidural
      analgesia and a single dose ketorolac together with a fast track rehabilitation program after
      360 degree lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis &lt; 2

    <description>The control group were supervised isometric passive and active exercises by a physiotherapist. On the second day patients were allowed to sit in a chair being instructed to a low intensity exercise training program with regard to back pain and fear of activity. From the third or fourth day stair training, low intensity exercise, daily walks and instruction in home training were allowed.
The intervention group received the same training program but with a faster program plus a higher intensity exercise-training program.</description>
