  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well tivantinib works compared to placebo in
      treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Tivantinib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) in men with minimally symptomatic or
      asymptomatic metastatic, castrate-resistant, chemotherapy-naïve prostate cancer treated with
      ARQ 197 (tivantinib).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate at 12 weeks in men with
      metastatic, castrate-resistant, chemotherapy-naïve prostate cancer treated with ARQ 197.

      II. To determine the radiographic response rate at 12 weeks based on Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria on computed tomography (CT) scans and stability of
      bone lesions on bone scan in castrate-resistant, chemotherapy-naïve prostate cancer treated
      with ARQ 197.

      III. To determine the proportion of patients who are progression-free at 12 weeks.

      IV. To assess safety and tolerability in patients treated with ARQ 197 using the National
      Institute of Cancer (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0
      grading of toxicities.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate markers of bone turnover. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression
      may crossover to Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.
