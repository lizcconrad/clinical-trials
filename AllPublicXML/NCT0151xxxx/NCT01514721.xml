      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy and tolerability of changing to DuoTrav®
      (Travoprost 0.004%/Timolol 0.5% BAK-free) from prior Xalacom® or Ganfort® fixed combination
      pharmacotherapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with uncontrolled
      intraocular pressure (IOP).

    <measure>Change in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score at final visit from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An OSDI questionnaire will be completed by the subject at the baseline visit and at the 12-week visit. For each visit, an overall OSDI score will be calculated using individual item responses, and the change in OSDI score from baseline will be calculated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, open-angle glaucoma, or pigment dispersion
             glaucoma in both eyes.

          -  On a stable IOP-lowering regimen of prostaglandin fixed combination (either Xalacom or
             Ganfort) within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  IOP between 19 and 35 mmHg at any time of day in at least 1 eye.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen; 1.0 LogMAR) or better in
             each eye.

          -  Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medication(s) prior to
             receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor tolerance to any component
             of DuoTrav® deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator.

          -  Corneal dystrophies in either eye.

          -  Risk of visual field or VA worsening as a consequence of participation in the study,
             in the investigator's best judgment.

          -  Any disease or condition that would preclude the safe administration of a topical
             beta-blocker, present a special risk to the subject, or interfere with optimal
             participation in the study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
