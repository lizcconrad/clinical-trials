    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled phase I dose escalation study of HCQ and RAD001 in patients with
      advanced renal cell carcinoma followed by a Phase II trial of RAD001 with HCQ. The target
      population are patients with one to three prior treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma.
      In the phase I portion a traditional 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximal
      tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose for HCQ in combination with RAD001 po 10
      mg/day.

      This protocol describes a multicenter phase I/II trial of RAD001 in combination with HCQ
      (phase I anticipated n=6-12) with a 35 patient phase II trial in patients with previously
      treated (1-3 prior regimens) advanced renal cell carcinoma. The preclinical rationale for
      this combination is extensive, the safety of HCQ combination strategies has been established,
      and effective autophagy PD, and PK assays are available to guide development. The practical
      advantage of combination with HCQ is that this drug is off patent, commercially available,
      and is IND exempt. The institutions involved have combined 11 clinical protocols open for
      accrual involving HCQ, so regulatory approval will be rapid. There are no competing HCQ
      protocols for advanced renal cell carcinoma. As described in the sample size justification we
      are setting a high threshold to consider RAD001 + HCQ active since there are many competitors
      and other potential rational combinations. The 35 patient sample size is designed as a 2
      stage phase II trial that will guide the go/no-go decision regarding the conduct of a
      followup randomized study to definitively prove efficacy. The primary (6 month PFS) and
      secondary outcomes (response rate, toxicity rates, correlative endpoints) will be analyzed
      for the entire group, and for patient populations stratified by number of prior therapies.
      The phase I portion of this trial is anticipated to be short, based on our experience from
      other HCQ trials. As a safety measure we have included intermediate dose levels which will
      only be used if there are Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). Since we have seen responses at
      lower doses of HCQ in other trials, and because frequently over months HCQ dose is lowered
      from Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) doses in many trials because of nausea and anorexia, we
      would like to have some data on renal cell patients treated at the lower dose levels. If
      there is activity demonstrated at lower doses, this would be informative for dose
      modification decisions in patients treated on the dose expansion. The patient population for
      this trial, including the phase I dose escalation portion is advanced renal cell carcinoma
      with 1-3 prior treatments.
