      Detailed Description : The study was conducted as an open-label, randomized, single-dose,
      2-way crossover, relative bioavailability study performed on 16 healthy adult male
      volunteers. A total 15 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study. In each period,
      subjects were housed from the mornings dosing until after the 72-hour blood draw. Single oral
      200 mg doses were separated by a washout period of 21 days.
