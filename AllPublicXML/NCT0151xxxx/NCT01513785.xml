  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of traditional triple therapy has been decreased to such an unacceptable level
      as 70% in many areas. The study is based on the hypothesis: the most important factors which
      influence the effect of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication included acid suppression
      intensity and sensitivity of antibiotics. So the investigators chose dual therapy because it
      is simple and verified to be useful. Rabeprazole, as a new proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is
      reported to be less susceptible to the influence of genetic polymorphisms for CYP2C19. So it
      has a greater and faster acid suppression effect compared to other PPIs. Amoxicillin is one
      of effective antibiotics to H. pylori with few side effects. The antibiotic resistance of
      Amoxicillin is no more than 3% in China. The purpose of our trial is to evaluate and compare
      the efficacy and safety of dual therapy regimens with different doses of Rabeprazole for
      initial treatment of H. pylori infection.

      The current recommended triple regimen for H. pylori treatment provides unacceptable low
      success rates because of high antibiotic resistance and poor compliance. Dual therapy had
      been used before and can be modified to get good eradication rate. The aim of our trial is to
      evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of dual therapy regimens for initial treatment
      of H. pylori infection. A total of forty patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and H. pylori
      infection were randomized to receive either Rabeprazole 10 mg b.i.d. and Amoxicillin 1000 mg
      t.i.d., for 14 days (R10A), or high-dose Rabeprazole 20 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) and
      Amoxicillin 1000 mg three times a day (t.i.d) (R20A) for 14 days. H. pylori strains were
      isolated and antibiotic resistance was measured by the twofold agar dilution method. H.
      pylori eradication was assessed by 13C-urea breath test at 4 weeks after treatment.
