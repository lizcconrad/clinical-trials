  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare blood vessel and hormone differences between women who have a history
      of a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia or high blood pressure, and women who have a
      history of uncomplicated pregnancy in the last 10 years. The investigators hypothesize that
      postpartum women with history of preeclampsia will have altered blood vessel function and
      abnormal hormone levels compared with postpartum women with history of uncomplicated
      pregnancy.

      This study will take place over the course of 2 weeks. Each subject will be assessed on a
      fixed low-salt diet and a fixed high-salt diet. Subjects will have 2 non-invasive blood
      vessel imaging tests and fasting blood draws.
