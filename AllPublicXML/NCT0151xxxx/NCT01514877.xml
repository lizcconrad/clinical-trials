      The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and toxicity of icotinib combined with WBRT
      in treating patients with multiple brain metastases from NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 25-40% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is
      one of the primary reasons resulting in treatment failure and the death. Whole-brain
      radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard approach to the treatment of multiple brain
      metastases from NSCLC. Regardless of the treatment of brain metastases by WBRT combined with
      systemic chemotherapy,outcomes of NSCLC with brain metastases are still very poor. Epidermal
      growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) can pass through the
      blood-brain barrier and show promising antitumor activity against brain metastases from
      NSCLC. Icotinib shows nearly the same effect as gefitinib in advanced NSCLC patients failed
      with chemotherapy.

    <description>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, have shown efficacy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastases (BM). Icotinib is a new first generation EGFR-TKI. We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotinib in combination with whole brain radiotherapy （WBRT） in Chinese NSCLC patients with BM and investigated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/ plasma concentrations of icotinib.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive whole brain radiotherapy therapy 30Gy over 10 fractions and icotinib will be administered at the beginning of whole brain radiotherapy in doses of 125 mg thrice per day until disease progression or undue toxicity.</description>
