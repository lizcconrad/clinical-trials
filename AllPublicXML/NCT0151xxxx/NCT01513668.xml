      The purpose of this study is to compare single-dose oral bioavailability of acetaminophen 650
      mg extended release geltabs (containing acetaminophen 650 mg) of OHM Laboratories, USA
      (subsidiary of Ranbaxy) with Tylenol extended release geltabs (containing acetaminophen 650

      The study was conducted as open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single dose, crossover bioavailability study comparing acetaminophen 650 mg
      extended release gel tabs (containing acetaminophen 650 mg) of OHM Laboratories (subsidiary
      of Ranbaxy) with Tylenol 8 Hour 650 mg extended release gel tabs (containing acetaminophen
      650 mg) of Mc Neil, Consumer &amp; Specialty Pharmaceuticals in healthy, adult, human, male
      subjects under fed condition.

      The treatments were assigned to the study subjects according to SAS generated randomization
      schedule. Each subject received a single oral dose either Test or Reference product in each
      period with 240ml of water at ambient temperature, 30 minutes after start of a high-fat high
      calorie breakfast during each period of the study under supervision of a trained medical
      officer.

      During the course of study, the safety parameters including vital signs, physical
      examination, medical history, clinical laboratory and safety tests (haematology, biochemical
      parameters) were assessed and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology &amp; biochemical
      parameters) were performed again at the end of the study.
