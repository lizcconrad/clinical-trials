    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of telaprevir, given
      with pegylated-interferon-alfa-2a (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV) in the treatment of
      hepatitis C in patients infected with both chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV-1) and human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (both participant and investigator know the name of the medication
      given at a certain moment), single-arm, multicenter study in HCV treatment-naive and
      treatment-experienced patients infected with both chronic HCV-1 and HIV-1 to determine the
      efficacy and safety of telaprevir given with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV. The study will consist
      of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase up to 48 weeks, and a follow-up
      period of 24 weeks. All patients will receive 12 weeks of treatment with telaprevir given
      with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV. At week 12 telaprevir dosing will end and patients will
      continue on Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV. The total treatment duration in this study will be 24 or
      48 weeks depending on the patient's prior HCV treatment status, liver disease status, and
      individual on-treatment virologic response in this study (equal response guided therapy). The
      maximum total duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be
      approximately 76 weeks (screening included). Approximately 150 patients infected with both
      chronic HCV-1 and HIV-1 are planned to be enrolled.
