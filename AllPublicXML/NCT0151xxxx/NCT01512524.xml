  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the long-term impact of hormonal deficiency on Quality of
      Life (QoL) in a large group of moderate and severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, when not leading to mortality, is a major cause of morbidity
      in early adulthood.

      Recent studies have demonstrated a previously unappreciated association between Severe
      Traumatic Brain Injury and endocrine dysfunction.

      The current trial aims at evaluating the quality of life 18 months post-trauma and
      associating this outcome to growth hormone levels.
