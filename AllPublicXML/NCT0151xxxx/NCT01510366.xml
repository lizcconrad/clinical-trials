    <textblock>
      Based on pre-clinical trial and phase 1 and phase 2 clinical data and principle of GCP, the
      objective of phase Ⅲ clinical trial is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Inactivated
      Poliomyelitis Vaccine made from Sabin Strains(Sabin IPV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Sabin IPV was manufactured with poliovirus type 1, 2, 3 Sabin strains and Vero cells by
      microcarrier culture in 550 liter bioreactors. The virus suspension was harvested,
      ultra-concentrated, purified and inactivated with formalin. The D Ag contents of Sabin IPV
      were type 1 30DU, type 2 32DU, type 3 45DU /0.5ml/per dose.

      Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine (Salk strains) was manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur D Ag
      contents /0.5ml/per dose were type 1 40DU, type 2 8DU, type 3 32DU.

      This is a randomized, blind phase 3 clinical trial. Total 1200 infants (ages 60 days to 90
      days) were selected, randomized to two groups (Sabin IPV and Salk IPV, each group n=600),
      infants in each group will be vaccinated with three doses of either Sabin IPV or Salk IPV
      respectively, one month apart.
