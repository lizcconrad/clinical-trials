  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the effect of a 5-day HFD supplemented with specific fatty acids on
      gastrointestinal transit, appetite, food intake and substrate utilization. Another novel
      aspect of this chapter was examining whether a subsequent 5-day period was sufficient to
      reverse the effects of high-fat feeding on the aforementioned parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-fat (HF) diets of as little as three days have been shown to accelerate GI transit. This
      study aimed to assess if 5-day HF supplemented diet varying in fatty acid composition were
      sufficient to accelerate GI transit, appetite responses and substrate utilisation and whether
      a 5-day deadaptation period to a HF diet would reverse the responses induced by adaptation to
      a HFD.

      The study will be conducted in a randomized, single-blinded manner in 24 healthy subjects.
      Three 5-day interventions will each followed by a test trial. In the first intervention
      period (CON), normal diet was supplemented with low-fat (LF) milkshakes (272 kcal, 6 g fat).
      The second and third interventions will involve repeating previous diet along with HF (1082
      kcal, 96 g fat) or LF milkshakes respectively. The three high-fat supplement groups that
      subjects will be randomized to are as follows: (1) olive oil (90 g oil), (2) olive oil + n-3
      EPA/DHA fish powder blend or (3) olive oil + macadamia oil blend.

      The effect of 5-day HF diet (daily milkshake supplement: 1082 kcal, 96 g fat) on gastric
      emptying and mouth to caecum transit time of a high-fat test will be measured using the 13C
      octanoic acid breath test and H2 inulin breath test respectively for six hours
      postprandially. During this time course, measurements of subjective appetite sensations by
      visual analogue scale and substrate utilization by indirect calorimetry were also collected.
      Subsequently, food intake will be measured using an ad libitum buffet meal.

    <time_frame>within the first 6.5 hours after ingesting high-fat test meal</time_frame>
    <description>13CO2 breath samples were taken every 15 minutes for six hours. Breath samples for measurement of 13CO2 were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry and results were expressed relative to Vienna-PeeDee Belemnite. 13CO2 values were expressed as the excess amount in the breath above baseline and converted into moles. This was then fitted to a GE model developed by Ghoos et al. 1993. For all the data, r2 coefficient between the modeled and raw data was calculated and r2 &gt; 0.95. Latency phase (Tlat) and ascension time (Tasc) from Schommartz et al. 1998.</description>

    <description>Satiety was measured using a 150mm VAS to detect changes in hunger, thirst, desire to eat, tiredness, fullness and cold. Variables thirst, tiredness and cold were used to distract volunteers from analysis of their satiety status. This was taken before breakfast, after breakfast, every 30 minutes throughout the six hours and following the buffet meal.</description>

    <description>After six hours volunteers were given access to a buffet meal and instructed to eat ad libitum. The buffet meal consisted of a 21 different types of foods and contained a wide variety of foods of varying macronutrient. Foods were covertly weighed before and after presentation and the difference converted to macronutrient intake using food tables or manufacturers' data.</description>

The CON and LF milkshake supplements are identical (272 kcal; 6 g fat). The basic control (CON) or LF milkshake (that the oil was added to) was: 275 g semi skimmed milk, 25 g chocolate milkshake mix, 15 g dried skimmed milk, 1 g xanthan gum. This was made up to 580 ml with still water.
High-fat milkshake supplements were consumed daily for five days before a test trial. 90 g olive oil added to the supplement for the purpose of the HF intervention phase.</description>
