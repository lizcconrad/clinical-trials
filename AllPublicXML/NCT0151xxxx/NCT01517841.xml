  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand what prevents chronic kidney disease patients from
      making a timely decision about dialysis modality options. This understanding will allow us to
      develop and implement interventions to assist patients in this turning point so that they can
      make the right decision for them in a timely enough manner so that each patient can start
      dialysis in the safest and best way for them. 200 later stage chronic kidney disease patients
      (20% or less of kidney function remaining) will be asked to participate in the study with the
      goal of having 150 patients participate in the study.

      Hypotheses:

        1. 50 % of patients will have made a modality decision when interviewed and patients in the
           action stage of behavior will be more likely to make a modality selection than patients
           in earlier stages of behavior change. Barriers to modality selection will act at several
           levels including patient, provider and health system level and will vary by behavioral
           stage of change

        2. 10-15% of patients might choose home dialysis. Knowledge, self efficacy in terms of CKD,
           education, and income will likely be barriers to home dialysis choice.
