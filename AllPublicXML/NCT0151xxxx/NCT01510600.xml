      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with high-risk
      neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To establish telomere length measurement by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
           (qPCR) as an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) detection method in
           neuroblastoma (NB).

        -  To determine the frequency of ALT in high-risk NB and the characteristics of ALT+ NB.

        -  To establish C-circle (extra-chromosomal telomeric DNA circles) level as a marker of ALT
           activity in NB.

        -  To evaluate the prognostic significance of ALT in NB.

        -  To evaluate the utility of the C-circle assay for the detection of circulating tumor DNA
           in NB patients with an ALT+ tumor.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and serum samples are analyzed for telomere length
      measurement, frequency, and C-circle levels by PCR. Results are then compared with patients'
      age at diagnosis and outcomes including survival data (event-free and overall survival).

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Snap-frozen neuroblastoma (NB) tumors collected at diagnosis (Objectives 1 to 3)

               -  High-risk stage 3 or 4 NB AND MYCN non-amplified, i.e., exclude stage 4 infants
                  who are not high-risk

                    -  Up to five high-risk (&gt; 18 months, unfavorable histology) stage 3/MYCN
                       non-amplified tumors

               -  Patients preferably treated on protocol COG-A3973 or similar protocols with
                  myeloablative therapy

               -  At least 3 years of follow-up for those with no event (current evidence suggests
                  that ALT+ NBs often relapse late, i.e., 2 years or longer from diagnosis)

          -  NB tumor DNA collected at diagnosis (Objectives 2 &amp; 3)

               -  High-risk stage 3 or 4 NB as for Objective 1, except for MYCN status

               -  Stage 4 tumors are preferred; may include up to seven high-risk stage 3 tumors
                  with similar distribution of MYCN-amplified and non-amplified tumors

          -  Frozen serum from NB patients (Objective 5; 2nd stage of project)

               -  Paired serum obtained at diagnosis from patients with ALT+ or ALT- tumors
                  identified in Objective 2

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Not specified
