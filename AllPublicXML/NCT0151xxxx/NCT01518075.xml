      In the investigators' knowledge there are no data about the impact of non invasive mechanical
      ventilation on the breathing-swallowing interaction.

      Our main objective is to evaluate breathing-swallowing interaction in Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients hospitalized in intensive care unit for an acute
      exacerbation, and evaluate the impact of using non invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In healthy subjects previous studies showed that most swallows started during expiration and
      were followed by expiration, a pattern believed to contribute to airway protection during
      swallowing. However In healthy individuals, the occurrence of inspiration after swallows was
      increased by hypercapnia or application of an inspiratory elastic load.

      In a previous study the investigators have demonstrated that patients with neuromuscular
      disorders exhibited piecemeal deglutition leading to an increase in the time needed to
      swallow a water bolus, as well as occurrence of inspiration after nearly half the swallows.
      These abnormalities which increased with the decreasing of respiratory muscle performances
      may explain feeding difficulties. However in tracheostomized patients who could breathe
      spontaneously, piecemeal deglutition and swallowing time per bolus were diminished by the use
      of mechanical ventilation.

      In the investigators' knowledge there are no data about the impact of non invasive mechanical
      ventilation on the breathing-swallowing interaction.

      The investigators' main objective is to evaluate breathing-swallowing interaction in Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients hospitalized in intensive care unit for an
      acute exacerbation, and evaluate the impact of using non invasive mechanical ventilation
      (NIV)

    <description>Evaluation of breathing - swallowing interaction without non invasive mechanical ventilation. Patient breath spontaneously.
Measurements of respiratory and swallowing parameters were monitored using respiratory inductive plethysmography. Swallowing was monitored noninvasively. Two bolus sizes were used, (5, 10 ml), in random order. Five sets of two boluses were studied, taking care not to use the same bolus size twice consecutively. The study participants were blinded to bolus size.</description>
