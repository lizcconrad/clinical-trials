    <textblock>
      The Valvuloplasty Scoring Balloon First-in-Man study is a prospective, single arm, two phase,
      observational registry to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Valvuloplasty Scoring
      Balloon Catheter for the treatment of critical aortic valve stenosis.

      Phase 1 will enroll patient who are scheduled to undergo open surgical aortic valve
      replacement and will have the Valvuloplasty Scoring Balloon delivered to their stenotic
      aortic valve through a standard aortotomy and deployed immediately prior to valve
      replacement.

      Phase 2 will enroll patients with aortic valve stenosis who are deemed to not be suitable
      candidates for elective surgical aortic valve replacement and in whom the investigational
      Valvuloplasty Scoring Balloon will be used as a stand-alone Valvuloplasty procedure or
      &quot;bridge&quot; to trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgery.
