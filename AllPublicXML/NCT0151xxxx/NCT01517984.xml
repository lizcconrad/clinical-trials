  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare how well transplanted kidneys work and the response of people's immune
      systems as tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), is withdrawn. In addition, this
      research study will evaluate whether reducing immunosuppression can decrease some of these
      side effects while still preventing rejection of the kidney.

    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is a treatment option for people with kidney disease. However, there
      is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it
      functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients take immunosuppression (anti-rejection)
      drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs are used to prevent
      the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney. All anti-rejection medications have
      unwanted side effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of slowly removing
      tacrolimus, a CNI.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Incremental IF/A Scores &gt;2 at 24 Months Post-Randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>IF/TA scores on protocol biopsies obtained at 24 months post-randomization will be compared to those obtained at the time of implantation for this measurement.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators were not able to assess this outcome, the effect of the intervention on interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA; on a 2-year graft biopsy) due to the study's premature termination by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) because of absence of equipoise on the basis of predetermined stopping rules.</description>

    <measure>Estimated GFR Using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Equation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-transplantation, 24 months post-transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a test to measure the level of kidney function. In this measure, the effects of tacrolimus withdrawal on long-term kidney function was assessed by comparing absolute 24 month eGFR (18 months post-randomization) and change in eGFR from 6 to 24 months (randomization to 18 months randomization). Lower numbers indicate poorer kidney function</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Acute Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 18 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Acute renal allograft rejection is defined as histological reading of borderline or greater determined by the local pathology laboratory. Participants suspected of having a rejection episode on the basis of clinical signs, symptoms, or on the basis of laboratory tests, had a renal ultrasound and underwent a renal transplant biopsy. Any detection of acute cellular rejection or acute humoral rejection resulted in participants in the 'Randomized to Tacrolimus Withdrawal' group to be restarted on tacrolimus and followed per the reduced follow-up schedule of events.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Allograft Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 18 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Allograft survival is defined as participants who did not need to be re-transplanted or placed on dialysis due to the failure of their allograft transplantation during the course of this study.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With New Donor Specific Antibodies (DSAs)</measure>

    <description>Donor specific antibodies are antibodies that are directed against antigens expressed on donor organs. These antibodies can result in an immune attack on the transplanted organ, increasing risk of graft loss and/or rejection.</description>

          <description>These participants were enrolled into the study and received a living-donor kidney allograft transplant. Participants were given an induction therapy with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (1.5-2.0 mg/kg daily for 5 days) and treated with a regimen of mycophenolate mofetil (target dose of 1000 mg twice daily), prednisone (no less than 5 mg/day or 10 mg every other day) and tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg twice daily, adjusted to target trough levels of 8-12 ng/ml in first 3 months post-transplant, 5-8 ng/ml thereafter). Participants were followed for up to 8 months and deemed ineligible for randomization or terminated for other reasons.</description>

Participants were followed for 6-8 months then randomized to tacrolimus withdrawal. Following randomization these participants had their dose of tacrolimus withdrawn gradually over three to four months, with complete withdrawal occurring no later than four months. Participants were followed up to 18 months after being randomized.</description>

          <title>HLA mismatch</title>
          <description>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein – or marker – found on most cells in your body and is used to match you with a donor for your bone marrow or cord blood transplant. The best transplant outcome happens when a patient’s HLA and donor’s HLA closely match. There are at least 8 HLA markers that are typically compared prior to transplantation. A mismatch of greater than three indicates that there is a potential for a poorer outcome than a better HLA match between donor and recipient.</description>

          <description>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus, and is a concern when a person has a weakened immune system, such as during transplantation. Once infected with CMV, your body retains the virus for life. CMV can spread from donor to recipient during transplant and dormant CMV in the recipient could become active following transplantation due to weakened immune system. CMV positive recipients have a higher likelihood for incidence of CMV disease and allograft loss.</description>
