  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coloplast A/S has developed a new ostomy device in 8 versions.

      The primary objective of this investigation is to assess and compare the degree of leakage
      when using the 8 different devices.

      The secondary objective is to investigate several performance and safety parameters of the
      various devices.

      The aim of the primary and secondary objectives is to acquire more knowledge about the
      performance of the newly developed device and inspiration for their further development, if
      needed.

      Given that the investigation is exploratory, pass/fail criteria are not relevant. The
      investigation result will provide knowledge useful for continued decision-making/device
      development.

      The investigation is designed as a non-blinded, controlled, exploratory investigation that
      includes a total of 30-40 Danish ileostomy users.

      Each subject will test a maximum of 4 convex devices in two rounds of each 4 weeks. Each
      device will be tested for 7 (Â± 2) days.
