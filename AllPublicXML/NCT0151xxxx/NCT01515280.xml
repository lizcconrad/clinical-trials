      The aim of this study is to have those patients taking part in the Clinical trial-: A
      Multicentre, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Pivotal Study of the Efficacy and Safety of
      Oral Theobromine in the Management of Cough. Complete the Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire
      (HARQ) at randomisation and repeat the questionnaire at the end of the 14 day treatment
      period. The investigators hope to demonstrate a clinically significant change in HARQ scores
      of at least 16 points from before and after treatment. Furthermore the investigators would
      hope to show a significantly improved HARQ score in patients on the BC036 arm of the study
      compared to the placebo arm.
