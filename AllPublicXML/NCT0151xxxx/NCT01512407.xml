  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesise that the use of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) after liver resection
      in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can eradicate residual cancer cells in the liver
      and thus improve survival. The aim of this study is to compare the survival of patients
      undergoing liver resection plus post-operative TACE versus liver resection alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      However, recurrence is common after surgery and most occurs in the liver. Transarterial
      chemoembolisation (TACE) is an effective palliative treatment for HCC. It involves the
      infusion of chemotherapeutic agent admixed with iodised oil followed by embolisation of the
      hepatic arterial flow using small particles. This procedures allows application of smaller
      dose of chemotherapy concentrated to the liver and thus is well tolerated with minimal side
      effects. We conduct a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of using TACE after
      hepatectomy in HCC patients.
