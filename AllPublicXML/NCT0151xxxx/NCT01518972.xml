      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug prazosin is effective for the
      treatment of alcohol dependency and symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Alcohol dependence (AD) is a biologically, genetically based disease, yet the
      majority of clinically accepted treatments are behaviorally or psychosocially based. PTSD and
      alcohol use disorders (AUDs) commonly co-occur. This comorbidity is associated with more
      severe clinical impairment, shorter times to relapse, more treatment recidivism, overall
      greater use of treatment services, and greater treatment costs.

      Neuropharmacology of alcohol and prazosin: Emerging pre-clinical evidence shows that
      noradrenergic systems are involved in brain processes relevant to AD, such as arousal,
      reinforcement, and stress responsivity. However, virtually no work to date has attempted to
      translate this knowledge into clinically effective biological interventions. The
      investigators have adopted the novel, promising strategy of reducing adrenergic activity by
      blocking noradrenaline binding to post-synaptic alpha-1 receptors via the non-selective,
      alpha-1 antagonist, prazosin. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that prazosin decreases
      reinstatement of alcohol consumption, and preliminary clinical data suggest that prazosin
      reduces alcohol use in humans with AD and reduces PTSD-related nightmares and other symptoms,
      though it has not been tested in individuals with comorbid AD and PTSD. Prazosin, FDA
      approved to treat hypertension, typically has few side effects, and is inexpensive.

      Design: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants: 60
      individuals with both AD and PTSD (25% women) with stated goal to abstain from alcohol use.

      Intervention: Either prazosin titrated per study protocol or matched placebo for 6 weeks with
      Medical Management (MM) based on the COMBINE Study procedures and a final study visit two
      weeks after medication discontinuation.

      Measures: The primary outcomes are alcohol use during the 12-week medication phase of the
      study and reports of craving during the same time period. Daily, prompted Interactive Voice
      Response (IVR) telephone monitoring will be done throughout the 8-week study to assess the
      primary outcomes and to provide information on affect and medication adherence. Such daily
      monitoring provides more accurate reports of alcohol use than standard retrospective outcome
      measures. Analyses: Hierarchical linear modeling to test for main effects of prazosin+MM
      versus placebo+MM on alcohol use and PTSD symptoms over time, and to evaluate whether
      reductions in PTSD mediate the effect of prazosin.

      Findings to date: The investigators have enrolled 30 participants and the 19 who met all the
      initial screening criteria were randomized overall. Since the last continuing review the
      investigators have enrolled 24 and randomized 15. Of the 24 participants enrolled, five are
      veterans and four of these has been randomized. Since the last continuing review, there have
      been two serious adverse events . In each case the institutional review board (IRB) review
      determined they were probably unrelated to the study. Enrollment continues.

      Public health implications: There is a paucity of safe, tolerable, inexpensive, and
      efficacious drugs currently available for the treatment of AD and PTSD. Should the
      investigators find that prazosin leads to reduced alcohol use and PTSD symptom severity
      relative to placebo, clinicians will have an additional tool to help people with PTSD who are
      dependent on alcohol to make crucial changes in their lives.
