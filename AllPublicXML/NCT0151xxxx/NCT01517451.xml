      This will be a Phase I/II study evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of a combined
      regimen of 7.25 Gy every other day fractions to a total dose of 36.25 Gy (total of 5
      fractions) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 4 months total.

    <description>This will be a Phase I/II study evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of a combined regimen of 7.25 Gy every other day fractions to a total dose of 36.25 Gy (total of 5 fractions) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 4 months total, greater than or equal to 1 month prior to SBRT (stereotactic body radiation therapy). This choice of daily dose is based on the prior published experience showing safety and efficacy of hypofractionated regimens.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed, locally confined adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Patient must fit D'Amico intermediate risk criteria by clinical stage (T2b-T2c), PSA
             (prostatic specific antigen) (10-20 ng/mL), and/or Gleason score (Gleason 7).

          -  The patient has decided to undergo external beam radiation as treatment choice for his
             prostate cancer.

          -  Signed study-specific consent form prior to registration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stage T3-4 disease.

          -  Gleason 8 or higher score.

          -  PSA &gt; 20 ng/ml.

          -  IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) &gt; 15

          -  Clinical or Pathological Lymph node involvement (N1).

          -  Evidence of distant metastases (M1).

          -  Radical surgery for carcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Previous Chemotherapy, unless intervention was greater than 5 years from beginning
             treatment for current prostate cancer.

          -  Previous pelvic radiation therapy.

          -  Previous or concurrent cancers other than basal or squamous cell skin cancers or
             superficial bladder cancer unless disease free for at least 5 years.

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  Major medical or psychiatric illness which, in the investigator's opinion, would
             prevent completion of treatment and would interfere with follow up.

          -  Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within one year from consultation,
             or other major vascular risk factor which would prevent a patient from receiving
             appropriate androgen deprivation therapy.11

          -  Liver function tests (LFTs) greater than twice the upper limit of normal.
