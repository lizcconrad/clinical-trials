      This research is being done to study the effect of taking flax seed oil and fish oil on blood
      lipids in vegetarians following the Hallelujah Diet. Omega 3 fats are important to our health
      and we want to see how effective both flax seed oil and fish oil are in raising your Omega 3
      Score (higher is better). The Omega 3 Score is one of many indicators that may show your
      personal risk of dying suddenly from a heart attack.

      This study is being conducted to compare the response of individuals to flax seed oil or fish
      oil, measured by blood lipids. Especially the amount of the long chain omega 3
      polyunsaturated fats EPA and DHA will be tested. An omega 3 score for whole blood will be
      measured. The omega 3 score is the percent sum of omega 3 fats in the blood.

      The hypothesis is that 5 grams of fish oil will increase the amount of EPA and DHA in a
      person's blood to a protective level, and that 30 grams (2 tablespoons) of flax oil will not
      change the blood levels of EPA significantly and not change the blood concentrations of DHA
      at all, even for a person consuming a low omega 6 oil diet and following a vegan diet high in
      fruits and vegetables.

      Most of the testing of flax and fish oil has not been done in vegans. This trial will extend
      this testing to this subpopulation.
