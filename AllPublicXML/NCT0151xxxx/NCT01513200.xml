  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase 1 randomized, double-blind crossover trial enrolling approximately 12
      healthy volunteers to assess whether intravenous (IV) UFH and IV Bendavia administered
      together have any significant impact on the pharmacodynamic effects of UFH and the
      pharmacokinetics of Bendavia.
