    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2b, randomized, open-label, prospective, multicenter study comparing
      treatment with INNO 206 to doxorubicin in subjects with metastatic, locally advanced, or
      unresectable soft tissue sarcomas who have not been previously treated with any chemotherapy
      except potentially as adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and no evidence of tumor
      recurrence has occurred for at least 12 months.

      One hundred five subjects will be enrolled and randomized 2:1 to receive either INNO-206 or
      doxorubicin. INNO-206 at a dosage of 350 mg/m2 (doxorubicin equivalents of 260 mg/m2) will be
      administered as a 30 minute IVI on Day 1 of each cycle to approximately 70 subjects.
      Doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) will be administered to approximately 35 subjects on Day 1 of each
      cycle. An individual cycle of therapy will be defined as a 3-week (21-day) period. Cycles
      will be repeated every 3 weeks. Multiple cycles may be administered until the subject is
      withdrawn from therapy or until a maximum of 6 cycles are administered. Overall response
      rates as well as individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will be determined
      using RECIST 1.1.[28] Time-to-event endpoints, including PFS and OS will be assessed using
      the Kaplan Meier method.[30] Evaluation of 4- and 6-month progression-free survival will also
      be performed. Toxicity (adverse events) will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0
      (published 28 May 2009).
