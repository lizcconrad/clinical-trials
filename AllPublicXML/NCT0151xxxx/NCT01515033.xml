    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate: 1) the effects of continuous exercise
      training and interval exercise training on end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PETCO2)
      response during graded exercise test in patients with coronary artery disease; and 2) examine
      the effects of exercise training modalities on the association among PETCO2 at ventilatory
      anaerobic threshold (VAT) and indicators of ventilatory efficiency and cardiorespiratory
      fitness in patients with coronary artery disease.

    <textblock>
      End-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PETCO2) is a noninvasive index considered to be a good
      indicator in evaluating the ventilation/perfusion relationship in patients over a wide range
      conditions. Variations in PETCO2 have been shown to reflect changes in both cardiac output
      and pulmonary blood flow in animals and humans under constant ventilation. In this regard, it
      has been shown that patients with cardiac disease have an abnormally low PETCO2 during
      exercise, especially those with an impaired response of cardiac output during exercise
