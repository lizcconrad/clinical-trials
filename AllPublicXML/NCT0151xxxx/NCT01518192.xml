      Background:

        -  While doxycycline is a standard antibiotic for treatment of erythema migrans in Europe
           as well as in the USA, the effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of adult
           patients with erythema migrans has been assessed only in the USA where the causative
           agent of Lyme disease is Borrelia burgdorferi, but not in Europe where the main
           etiologic agents are B. afzelii and B. garinii.

        -  Controversy exists over the significance and even the existence of post-Lyme disease
           symptoms because of the high rate of similar background symptoms in the general
           population.

      Purpose:

      The two main purposes of this European, prospective clinical trial in which doxycycline and
      cefuroxime axetil are compared in the treatment of adult patients with erythema migrans and
      which included a control group to address the significance of post-Lyme disease symptoms are:

        -  To assess and compare the effectiveness of doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil in the
           treatment of erythema migrans using clinical and bacteriological criteria
           (noninferiority testing approach), and

        -  to compare the frequency of post-Lyme disease symptoms in adult patients treated for EM
           with antibiotics and the frequency of similar symptoms in control subjects without Lyme
           disease.

      Sample size

      Decisions were based on the following:

        1. Number of patients with erythema migrans treated with doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil
           was determined assuming no difference in treatment outcome will be detected
           (non-inferiority testing).

        2. The decision for a larger sample sizes than needed for 1. was done with the intention to
           evaluate the secondary outcome measure, i.e., to assess the difference between the
           frequency of new or increased symptoms in patients treated for early Lyme disease and
           the occurrence of the same symptoms in control subjects.

             1. We assumed that the outcomes in the two treatment groups will be comparable and
                that the patients could be combined for further analysis.

             2. To obtain a control group from the same geographical area, each patient was asked
                if she or he had a family member or friend who was within 5 years of her or his age
                and who was without a history of Lyme borreliosis. These persons were approached by
                a short written explanation of the investigation, containing also a request for
                their participation. We assumed that we will be able to get a corresponding control
                person not for all but for approximately 80-90% of patients.

             3. Under the assumption that approximately 15% of an estimated 200 patients would have
                new or increased symptoms at &gt;6 months after enrollment into the study, a control
                group of 165 subjects would be sufficient to detect a &gt;10 percentage point lower
                rate of new or increased symptoms in controls compared with patients at the 0.05
                level (2-sided) with &gt;90% power. To comply with drop outs at different time points
                we assessed that 280 patients and 230 controls should be included at baseline.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Medical explanation besides Lyme disease of the symptoms in patients was based on history and physical examination, therefore some other medical explanations might have been missed. With regard to controls this was even more likely.</limitations_and_caveats>
