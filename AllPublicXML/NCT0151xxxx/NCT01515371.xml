    <description>Subject to receive one injection of either 2.5U, 5U or 7.4U of IncobotulinumtoxinA.
For three dose stages: solution prepared by reconstitution of powder with 0.9% Sodium Chloride (NaCl), reconstitution volume 8 ml, 4 ml and 2.7 ml per 50U vial, respectively, resulting in a concentration of 6.25 U/ml, 12.5 U/ml and 18.5 U/ml. Injection volume is 0.4 ml for all three dose stages. Mode of administration: unilateral soft palate injection.</description>
