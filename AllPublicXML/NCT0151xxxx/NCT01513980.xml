  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the introduction of large-scale
      telemonitoring of patients with COPD produces benefits in terms of improved health-related
      quality of life and reduced access to hospital facilities. In addition, the trial evaluates
      the economic and organisational impact of the new services, and examine their acceptability
      by patients and health professionals.

      The study is designed to evaluate the impact of telemonitoring on the management of COPD
      compared with outpatient usual care. From a clinical point of view, the trial will allow to
      investigate how telemonitoring contributes to improve COPD patients health-related quality of
      life and reduct the access to hospital facilities (re-hospitalizations, bed-days,
      specialistic and ER visits) and the anxiety about health conditions. A cost-effectiveness and
      cost-utility analysis will be carried out in order to determine if and how telemonitoring
      helps to limit the healthcare expenditure. The evaluation will deal also with organizational
      changes and task shift due to telemonitoring introduction and patients and professionals
      perception towards the service.

    <description>Patients are equipped with a telemonitoring kit composed by a portable wrist-clinic device for clinical parameters measuring and a gateway device for data transmission.
The patient can monitor pulse-oxymetry and heart rate with a frequency set by the clinician in the personalised treatment plan. Data are transmitted to a regional eHealth centre where a group of operators keeps these information under control and alert the reference clinician in case of worsening of symptoms. CAT questionnaire is monthly administrated by phone to the patients</description>

    <description>A nurse is in charge of data collection during home visits with a frequency set by the lung specialist depending to the patient clinical conditions. The nurse uses portable biomedical devices to measure pulse-oxymetry, heart rate, spirometry and if scheduled an arterial blood gas test. Data are transmitted to the clinician who checks them on his laptop in the hospital and completes the visit with the medical report.</description>
