    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if an investigational vaccine for Streptococcus pneumonia
      disease (V114) has comparable safety, tolerability, and antibody response to Pneumococcal
      Polysaccharide Vaccine (Pneumovax 23) and 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (Prevnar
      13) when administered to healthy adults 50 years of age or older.
