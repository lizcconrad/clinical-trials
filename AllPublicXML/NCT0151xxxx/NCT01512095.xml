    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and United States of America (USA). The aim of this trial
      is to examine the bioequivalence (assessment of the expected biological equivalence of two
      pharmaceutical drug products with identical active ingredient) of Norditropin® versus
      Nutropin AQ® in healthy adult volunteers.
