      The primary goal of the trial is to show that optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology
      can be used to effectively screen for diseases of the eye including glaucoma, macular
      diseases and keratoconus. Glaucoma is a disease that causes permanent vision loss and is
      usually accompanied by increased eye pressure. Macular diseases affect sharp, central vision.
      Keratoconus is a disease that affects the cornea (clear surface covering the colored part of
      the eye).

      The identification of many eye diseases would significantly benefit from earlier detection
      than is available with typical eye exams. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging
      technology that can perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging of tissue structure in real
      time. It is similar to ultrasound B-mode imaging, except that OCT measures the intensity of
      reflected light rather than sound waves.

    <description>The primary goal of the trial is to show that OCT technology, specifically the FDA cleared iVue, can be used to effectively screen for glaucoma, macular diseases and keratoconus. The rate of detection of these diseases detected using OCT will be compared to the rate of detection by the physician's exam.</description>

    <description>The OCT system scans a beam of light across the eye to take a picture. OCT imaging does not touch the eye. This is a test that is performed using an FDA approved system, and is regularly used to take pictures of the back of the eye.</description>
