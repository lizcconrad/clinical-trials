  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and most effective oral dose
      combinations of sorafenib and irinotecan in pediatric patients with solid tumors, i.e.
      relapsed or refractory.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor of several targets felt to be important in tumor growth
      and angiogenesis, has been well studied and shown promising clinical results in adult cancer
      patients and the Maximum Tolerated Dose or MTD has been determined in pediatric patients.
      Irinotecan is known to be effective and is widely used in pediatric malignancies. The
      combination of sorafenib with irinotecan is of interest as these agents have different
      mechanisms of action. In addition, the combination has been evaluated in adult patients and
      deemed tolerable without alterations in the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile at the MTD. The
      trial we are proposing also offers the advantage of being a completely oral regimen, adding
      convenience and cost effectiveness. Given these considerations, if the sorafenib/irinotecan
      combination proves tolerable in phase I studies and shows efficacy in phase II studies, it
      would be an attractive combination to incorporate into existing chemotherapy regimens for
      pediatric cancer.

                  monitored at least weekly, or as defined by the local standard of care, until it
                  is stable.

                  receiving anti-hypertensive medications or well controlled on antihypertensive
                  medications for one week. Blood pressure will be recorded as the average of 2
                  measurements separated by at least 2 minutes. If the second value is more than 5
                  mmHg different from the first, continued measurements should be made every 2
                  minutes until a stable value is attained. The recorded value should be the
