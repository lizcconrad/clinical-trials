  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the significant benefits of herpes zoster vaccine (HZV), vaccination rates remain
      low. Electronic medical records (EMR) can serve as a practical strategy to better facilitate
      the application of preventative health care, such as increasing immunization rates. A new
      care model that can increase the herpes zoster vaccination rate, as well as other
      preventative health services, is warranted. The objective of this study is to investigate if
      the functions of an EMR, in combination with a pharmacist as part of the care team, can
      improve the herpes zoster vaccination rate.

    <description>The EMR generated a list of patients aged 60 or older without HZV documentation. Patients were categorized into two subgroups based on activated electronic patient portal (EPP) status. Randomized patients from each subgroup received an informational packet regarding shingles and the HZV by either the EMR or USPS mail, depending on EPP status. A pharmacist reviewed the medical chart of interested patients to assess if the HZV was clinically indicated; eligible patients were mailed a HZV prescription.</description>
