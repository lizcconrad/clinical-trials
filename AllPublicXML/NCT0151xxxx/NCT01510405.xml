  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have characterized in preclinical Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) models
      the proteomic expression profile associated with exposure to Aurora and Polo-like kinase
      inhibitors. The identification of proteomic expression patterns in patients with NSCLC would
      be an important step in defining the possible role of these agents as potential targeted
      therapies for this clinically important disease. This study proposes to evaluate resected
      non-small cell lung cancer specimens for these proteomic expression profiles.
