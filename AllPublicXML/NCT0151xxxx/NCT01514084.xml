  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial lacerations are commonly treated in the emergency department. The nature of the injury
      leads to a great deal of concern about the long-term cosmetic appearance of the wounds.

      Research Questions

        1. What is the association between wound characteristics, wound management in the ED,
           patient satisfaction in the ED, and patient-rated cosmetic appearance of sutured wounds?

        2. Is there a difference noted among ED providers with different levels of training?

        3. Is there an association between initial satisfaction scores and wound outcome?

        4. Is there an association between short term and long term wound scores?

      Design This is a non-randomized, prospective, observational study of patients who present to
      the ED seeking treatment for facial laceration repair.
