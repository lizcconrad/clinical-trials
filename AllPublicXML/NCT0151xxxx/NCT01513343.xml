  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of a scientifically-based,
      culturally competent seven-session parent directed, obesity prevention program focused on
      parental feeding strategies that support young children's self-regulation of intake.

    <textblock>
      The intervention program was developed and piloted. Expected outcomes: At the end of the
      intervention program, it is expected that parents in the intervention group will: 1) use more
      child-centered and less parent-centered feeding directives; 2) be less likely to show an
      indulgent and more likely to show an authoritative feeding style; 3)show lower scores on
      restriction and pressure to eat and higher scores on monitoring; and 4) demonstrate higher
      levels of food knowledge. Children in the intervention group are expected to: 1) show more
      willingness to try new foods, and 2) show increased self-regulation of energy intake. At the
      end of the interventions, children are expected to show greater consumption of fruits and
      vegetables (including consuming a wider variety of fruits and vegetables). All effects are
      expected to continue through the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, although the effects sizes will
      diminish. Although we do not expect effects on BMI after 6 weeks, we expect to see decreases
      in children's BMI percentiles by the 6- and 12-month follow-ups for the intervention groupâ€”
      especially for the top 25% of the BMI percentile range. No parental BMI effects are expected.
