  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An audio-assisted self-triage kiosk in the Pediatric Emergency Department (ED) is expected to
      significantly reduce triage times, without any sacrifice of the quality of information that
      would be obtained by nurse-initiated triage.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rapid evolution of consumer based information technology patients have the
      opportunity to become collaborative partners in their care. In addition, by bridging
      information gaps and improving workflow efficiency, continuity of care is optimized and the
      potential risk for error is reduced. Triage time for kiosk self-triage and nurse-initiated
      triage will be compared in terms of 1) triage time; 2) accuracy of medical history obtained;
      and 3) patient satisfaction.

    <description>To check for accuracy of medical history information, two RAs approached enrolled parents during the course of their ED visit in the individual patient examination rooms. The RAs conducted a brief face-to-face interview with parents and verified information from the nursing triage summary sheet (for non-kiosk users) and the printout of history sheet from the kiosk users, noting any discrepancies on a Discrepancy Rating Scale. All historical discrepancies were categorized into three groups: major discrepancy, minor discrepancy and no discrepancy.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon completion of triage.</time_frame>
    <description>Custom survey with 4 items capturing satisfaction with Understanding, Ease of Answering Questions, Respect for Privacy, and Overall Feelings. For each item, the lowest possible score was 1 and the highest possible score was 6. For Understanding, the lowest actual score was 2 and the highest actual score was 6. For Ease of Answering Questions, the lowest actual score was 2 and the highest actual score was 6. For Respect for Privacy the lowest actual score was 3 and the highest actual score was 6. For Overall Feelings, the lowest actual score was 3 and the highest actual score was 6. For the (unweighted) average of all 4 items, the lowest possible score was 1 and the highest possible score was 6. The lowest actual score was 3.5 and the highest actual score was 6.0.</description>

        <title>Accuracy of Medical History</title>
        <description>To check for accuracy of medical history information, two RAs approached enrolled parents during the course of their ED visit in the individual patient examination rooms. The RAs conducted a brief face-to-face interview with parents and verified information from the nursing triage summary sheet (for non-kiosk users) and the printout of history sheet from the kiosk users, noting any discrepancies on a Discrepancy Rating Scale. All historical discrepancies were categorized into three groups: major discrepancy, minor discrepancy and no discrepancy.</description>

        <description>Custom survey with 4 items capturing satisfaction with Understanding, Ease of Answering Questions, Respect for Privacy, and Overall Feelings. For each item, the lowest possible score was 1 and the highest possible score was 6. For Understanding, the lowest actual score was 2 and the highest actual score was 6. For Ease of Answering Questions, the lowest actual score was 2 and the highest actual score was 6. For Respect for Privacy the lowest actual score was 3 and the highest actual score was 6. For Overall Feelings, the lowest actual score was 3 and the highest actual score was 6. For the (unweighted) average of all 4 items, the lowest possible score was 1 and the highest possible score was 6. The lowest actual score was 3.5 and the highest actual score was 6.0.</description>
