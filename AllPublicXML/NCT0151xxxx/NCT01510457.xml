    <textblock>
      The patients are asked to take part in this study because you have chronic pain as a result
      of knee osteoarthritis. This study is done to investigate the pain relieving effects of the
      study drug Savella (milnacipran HCl) for people who experience chronic osteoarthritis pain.
      The purpose of this research is to look at how the study drug can be used to benefit people
      who experience osteoarthritis knee pain. This is a phase IV study done to study the safety
      and effectiveness of the drug. At this point the drug is already approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for people with fibromyalgia but it has not yet been approved for people
      with knee osteoarthritis.

      If you are in this study, you will be placed in one of two study groups: one group will
      receive the study drug and one will receive a placebo. You will be assigned a study group by
      chance using a process similar to the flip of a coin.

      At the first visit (week one) we will review and sign the informed consent, obtain your
      medical health history, and conduct a brief physical exam. You will also complete several
      questionnaires about your pain. You will be assessed for your eligibility to participate in
      this study. If you are eligible, we will conduct some physical and sensory tests and collect
      a blood sample. The physical tests include a stair climb, 6-minute treadmill test and a
      1-minute sit to stand test. The sensory tests allow us to understand your perception of
      various stimuli such as vibration, light touch, pinprick, heat, cold, hot pain, and cold
      pain. At the end of the first visit you will be given an electronic diary to record your pain
      throughout the study. We will also ask you to wear a device in a T-shirt, similar to an
      accelerometer, that will be used to record your sleep quality and physical activity for 2
      days.

      At the second (week two) and third visits (week nine) you will be asked to complete the same
      questionnaires, physical and sensory tests as during the first visit. You will also have to
      wear the t-shirt with the device for 2 days after each visit.

    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at 2 visits over 11 weeks: Visit 1 and Visit 3.</time_frame>
    <description>The MPQ-SF is a well-validated pain measure that permits separation of the sensory and affective components of pain, which are added together to compute a total score. The scale ranges from 0-45 (0=no pain, 45=the most pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PamSys Actigraph Data</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after visit 3</time_frame>
    <description>We used a body worn sensor (PAMSys™, Biosensics, LLC, MA)(25-27) embedded in a comfortable t-shirt at the sternal level. Participants wore the PAMSys after the visit for 48 hours. The device provides values related to subjects spontaneous physical activity including percentage of time standing and walking. These variables provide different indexes of participants' level of activity and activity organization, and were reported by subjects with KOA pain as relevant.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at 2 visits over 11 weeks: Visit 1 and Visit 3.</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety scores were collected at least two data points. The Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS) is a scale from 0 - 100, where 0 = no anxiety and 100 = the most anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Disability Index (PDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at 2 visits over 11 weeks: Visit 1 and Visit 3.</time_frame>
    <description>The PDI is a seven-item, validated instrument that assesses perceived disability in seven key life areas. It provides a total disability score, and is an indirect measure of self efficacy. The Pain Disability Scale is a scale from 0 - 70, where 0 = no Disability and 70 = the most Disability.</description>

    <measure>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale CESD-10 (CES-D 10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at 2 visits over 11 weeks: Visit 1 and Visit 3.</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D 10 is a 10-item questionnaire that has been validated for the assessment of depressive symptomatology. The Depression Scale is a scale with a sum score from 0 - 30, where 0 = no Depression and 30 = the most Depression.</description>

    <measure>Pain Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at 2 visits over 11 weeks: Visit 1 and Visit 3.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Visual Analogue Scale from 0-100 (0= no pain, and 100= most pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Diary Entries With Pain, Fatigue and Functioning Scores Three Times a Day</measure>
    <time_frame>electronic diary entries with pain, fatigue and functioning scores were completed three times a day during week 1 and week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Averages of daily diary outcomes were taken over the first and last week of the trial (week 1 and week 11) to compare pre and post treatment. diary was filled out 3 times a day and asked subjects to rate pain at rest, pain when walking, and fatigue on a scale 0-10 (0=none, and 10=the worst)</description>
