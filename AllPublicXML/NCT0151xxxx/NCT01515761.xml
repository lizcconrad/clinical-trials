      The primary objective is to determine if lead positioning in the lateral wall of the left
      ventricle in patients meeting criteria for cardiac resynchronization therapy plays a role in
      determining myocardial function and affects the severity of mitral regurgitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6 month, multi-centered, blinded, randomized study. Approximately 60 patients will
      join this study. Two groups, based on lead position, will be studied with thirty (30)
      patients randomized into each group.
