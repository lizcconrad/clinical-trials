  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The body produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) about every 2 hours. GnRH travels
      through the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates the gland to produce
      hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones stimulate the testicles or ovaries. The
      testicles produce testosterone and develop sperm. The ovaries produce estrogen and prepare
      for ovulation. Normal estrogen and testosterone levels are required for puberty. Some people,
      however, have either low levels or total lack of GnRH. This can cause problems with puberty
      and fertility. Researchers want to study people with low or no GnRH to better understand how
      it affects puberty and fertility.

      Objectives:

      - To study disorders of GnRH production.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adult men and women at least 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.

        -  Adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will have tests to look at their hormone levels. Blood samples may be
           collected after taking different drugs, including insulin and cortisone. A 24-hour urine
           sample will be collected.

        -  Participants will have imaging studies to look at bone and brain development. They will
           also have ultrasounds of the kidneys, abdomen, and reproductive organs.

        -  Tests of smell and hearing will be used to look for abnormalities in these senses.

      The key initiating factors for reproductive development remain among the great mysteries of
      pediatric and reproductive endocrinology. The onset of puberty is initiated by pulsatile
      secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. GnRH secretion is
      fully active during the neonatal period, quiescent throughout most of childhood, and is
      reactivated at the time of puberty to induce sexual maturation and subsequent fertility. The
      neuroendocrine events leading to increased GnRH secretion and the resultant onset of puberty
      remain largely unknown.

      Isolated deficiency of GnRH results in the rare clinical syndrome of idiopathic
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), where decreased secretion of GnRH results in impaired
      gonadotropin secretion. The resultant hypogonadism presents with delayed, incomplete, or
      absent sexual maturation. In addition, non-reproductive phenotypes of this spectrum have been
      identified in some individuals, including anosmia, auditory defects, skeletal and renal
      anomalies. More severe syndromic forms of IHH have also been associated with rare congenital
      malformations, such as the Bosma arhinia microphthalmia (BAM) syndrome.

      Defining the physiology of GnRH is critical to understanding the clinical heterogeneity of
      isolated GnRH deficiency, particularly in light of emerging gene discoveries that elucidate
      genotype-phenotype correlations. Careful human phenotyping of patients with mutations in
      genes known to cause IHH has provided insight into developmental pathways involved in the
      ontogeny of GnRH neurons, but the neuroendocrine regulation of this system is not well
      understood.

      Here, we propose the addition of the NIH as the second site to an existing protocol at
      Massachusetts General Hospital to phenotypically characterize subjects with IHH, including
      severe syndromic forms. We plan to admit males and females 14 years of age or older with
      clinical signs suggestive of IHH for comprehensive phenotyping to include neuroendocrine
      profiling via an LH pulsatility study, as well as identification of other non-reproductive
      findings. Combining our effort with the established protocol and recruitment mechanisms at
      MGH will allow us to maximize the number of subjects with this rare disorder that can be
      evaluated.

      This protocol will utilize the disease model of IHH to increase our understanding of the
      physiology of GnRH secretion, including the neuroendocrine regulation of GnRH pulsatility, as
      well as other unknown aspects of GnRH biology, which may be illuminated through the
      non-reproductive characteristics of these patients. Examining the baseline characteristics of
      subjects with isolated GnRH deficiency will reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying
      the reawakening of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis at puberty, providing
      opportunities for new diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic interventions for disorders of
      puberty and fertility.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Since hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare condition, with an incidence of 1/10,000 to
        1/86,000 for isolated GnRH deficiency (34, 35), this protocol remains open to enrollment so
        that we may study all subjects that are both qualified and interested in participating.

        Males or females who are greater than or equal to 14 years old with clinical findings of HH
        as outlined above will be included. In certain circumstances, a patient under the age of 14
        years may be considered for baseline evaluation if there is sufficient evidence suggestive
        of HH, such as any two of the following: anosmia, history of cryptorchidism or
        microphallus.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -Because HH represents a spectrum, where associated clinical findings may provide
        phenotypic clues to the assessment of inheritability and underlying physiology, exclusion
        criteria are very limited:

          -  Patients who have additional pituitary deficiencies, effectively ruling out isolated
             GnRH deficiency, whether these deficiencies are congenital or acquired (e.g. secondary
             to malignancy, infection, or irradiation).

          -  Patients who are taking medications known to cause HH, such as corticosteroids or
             continuous opiate administration.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
