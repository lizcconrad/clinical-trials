      Background:

      - Currently, there is no standard method to study suicide risk in youth with developmental
      delays or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID). Youth with DD/ID are often excluded from studies
      that are used to develop these methods. As a result, most current suicide risk assessments
      have not been tested for use with people with DD/ID. Researchers want to develop an effective
      suicide risk screening tool for children and adolescents with DD/ID.

      Objectives:

      - To develop a suicide risk screening tool for young adults with DD/ID.

      Eligibility:

        -  Young adults between 12 and 21 years of age who have DD/ID and are in mental health
           counseling.

        -  Participants will be in counseling at Surrey Place Centre, a community health center in
           Toronto, Canada.

      Design:

        -  Participants will fill out questionnaires during a 1-hour meeting with a therapist. The
           questions will ask about mood and current feelings, including whether the participant
           has been thinking about or planning to hurt or kill him or herself now or in the past.
           Other questions will ask about participants' understanding of death in general.

        -  Parents of participants may also fill out a questionnaire. It will ask about how the
           participant has been feeling. It will also ask whether the parent has noticed any signs
           that suggest suicidal thoughts or actions, now and in the past.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol. However, participants can
           receive counseling through the regular Surrey Place Centre services.

      Objective:

      Currently, no gold standard is available for evaluating suicidal thoughts and behaviors in
      individuals with developmental delay or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID). Moreover, youth
      with DD are often excluded from instrument validation studies. Therefore, there is a paucity
      of sufficiently adapted and validated clinical suicide risk assessments for use with clients
      with DD/ID. The main objective of this study is to develop and assess the efficacy of a
      suicide screening tool for child and adolescent clients with DD/ID. More specifically:

      Aim 1: To modify the Risk of Suicide Questionnaire (RSQ) in order to create a suicide
      screening tool for a pediatric mental health population with DD/ID.

      Aim 2: To determine the feasibility of a suicide screening tool, (developed in Aim 1) to
      detect suicide risk in pediatric clients with DD/ID presenting to a community health center
      for mental health reasons.

      Study population:

      The NIMH is collaborating with Surrey Place Centre, a community health center in Toronto,
      Canada. The study population will be Surrey Place Centre clients, ages 12 and older,
      diagnosed with DD/ID, currently accessing individual mental health counseling. There will be
      no exclusion based on gender or race.

      Design:

      This will be a prospective instrument development study. Potential participants will be
      identified by research assistants (RAs) and therapists. Following informed consent and assent
      procedures, therapists will administer the Risk of Suicide Questionnaire Intellectual
      Disability Patient (RSQ-ID-Patient), and the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Child Version
      (SIQ-CV) to clients, and the RA will have the parents/guardians complete the Risk of Suicide
      Questionnaire-Intellectual Disability-Parent (RSQ-ID Parent). Three months after client
      participation, therapists will fill out a Therapist Follow-up Questionnaire.

      Outcome measures:

      Primary outcome measures include the RSQ-ID Patient, and the SIQ-CV, along with the RSQ-ID
      Parent. Secondary outcome measure is the Research Assistant Evaluation Form and the Clinician
      Follow- up Form.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        participation and must have attended at least 3 therapy appointments.

        Clients must have an IQ score betwen 55 and 75 (a range considered to &quot;mild developmental

        writtent assent. In order to receive services at Surrey Place Centre, clients must have a
        designation of &quot;developmental delay&quot; with and IQ score or range. If they do not have an IQ
        Score or DD designation, they undergo assessment at intake. Therefore, each client will
        have an IQ score recorded prior to study recruitment.
