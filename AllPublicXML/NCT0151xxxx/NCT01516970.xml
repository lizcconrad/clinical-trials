  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the rate of early discontinuation from
      randomized Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for any reason
      other than confirmation of the negative HIV infection status of the index person in patients
      receiving HIV PEP for at least 28 and a maximum of 30 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), open-label (all people involved
      know the identity of the intervention), active-controlled (patients are assigned to either a
      recognized effective treatment or the study medication), parallel-group (each treatment group
      will be treated at the same time), multicenter study comparing DRV/r PEP (DRV/r administered
      with 2 NRTIs selected at the discretion of the investigator) to standard of care PEP (as per
      German-Austrian guidelines) in patients at risk of HIV infection due to HIV exposure through
      occupational injury and non-occupational exposure. This study consists of screening period,
      treatment period and a follow up period. HIV PEP will be administered for a total of at least
      28 days and maximum of 30 days during treatment period, including any prestudy HIV PEP
      initiated before screening. Approximately 318 patients will be screened and enrolled to
      ensure that at least 131 patients are randomly assigned to receive DRV/r PEP or standard of
      care PEP. Safety will be evaluated during the entire study period. Data relating to a
      patient's functional impairment in conjunction with HIV PEP will be collected on Day 1 as
      baseline data, and further on Days 14 and 28 as well as at Month 3.

    <description>Number of participants with early discontinuation from randomized HIV PEP for any reason other than confirmation of the negative HIV infection status of the index person in participants receiving HIV PEP for at least 28 days and a maximum of 30 days was assessed. Per protocol (PP) population included all participants in modified intention-to-treat (mITT [defined as all participants who were assigned to receive randomized HIV PEP and were not discontinued due to confirmation of the negative HIV infection status of the index person]) excluding participants with: No indication for HIV PEP; Initiation of PEP &gt;72 hours after injury; Discontinuation of HIV PEP due to confirmation of HIV negative status of index person and if index person bears resistant virus against HIV PEP components prescribed; incorrect HIV PEP; no intake of medication.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined to be non-treatment-emergent if the onset date of the AE was clearly before the date of first HIV PEP administration, otherwise it is considered treatment-emergent.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Developed Detectable HIV Antibodies</measure>

    <description>Seroconversion rate of HIV antibodies while receiving HIV PEP evaluated as the percentage of participants who developed detectable HIV antibodies (defined as positive) and percentage of participants who had not developed detectable HIV antibodies (defined as negative). Per protocol (PP) population included all participants in mITT (defined as all participants who were assigned to receive randomized HIV PEP and were not discontinued due to confirmation of the negative HIV infection status of the index person) excluding participants with: No indication for HIV PEP; Initiation of PEP &gt;72 hours after injury; Discontinuation of HIV PEP due to confirmation of HIV negative status of index person and if index person bears resistant virus against HIV PEP components prescribed; incorrect HIV PEP; no intake of medication.</description>
