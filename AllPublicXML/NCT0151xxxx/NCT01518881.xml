  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, single-center, placebo-controlled, single-blind, first-in-human,
      single-ascending dose study with additional multiple-ascending dose cohorts in healthy male
      and female volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 56 healthy adult (male and female) subjects will participate in this study, in
      two stages. In Stage 1, the Single-Ascending Dose (SAD) phase of the study will have up to
      six cohorts with 4 subjects (3 receiving TKM-100201 and 1 receiving saline placebo) in each
      cohort. Additional cohorts may be enrolled if a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not
      established after the initial six cohorts. In Stage 2, the Multiple-Ascending Dose (MAD)
      portion of the study will have up to three cohorts with four subjects (3 receiving TKM-100201
      and 1 receiving saline placebo) in each cohort. Additional cohorts may be enrolled if a
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not established after the initial three cohorts.

If there are any adverse events (changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vitals and/or infusion reactions) during these monitoring periods, the Independent Safety Committee, will discuss the dosing of the remaining subjects.
Before proceeding to the next dose cohort, the Independent Safety Committee will evaluate whether dose escalation will be permitted based on demonstration of adequate safety and tolerability.</description>

             and sign the informed consent document at screening. The informed consent document
             will be written in English, therefore the volunteer must have the ability to read and
             communicate in English.

          3. Completed the screening process within 14 days prior to dosing.

          4. Healthy male and female volunteers 18 to 50 years of age, inclusive, at the time of

             assessments, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory assessments, and by general
             observations. Any abnormalities or deviations outside the normal ranges for any of
             clinical testing (laboratory tests, ECG, vital signs) can be repeated at the
             discretion of the Investigator(s) and judged to be not clinically significant for
             study participation.

          7. Adequate hepatic, renal, hematologic and clotting function as defined by total
             bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum
             creatinine, D-dimer and International normalized ratio (INR) within normal range as

               -  have a documented history of ovarian failure; or

                  volunteers that are surgically postmenopausal must provide documentation of the
                  bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy prior to Day 1 dosing to be eligible for
                  participation in the study; or

               -  Women of childbearing potential (FSH â‰¤40 mIU/mL) must have negative serum hCG at
                  screening, a negative urine pregnancy test prior to the first study treatment,
                  and must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods (two separate
                  forms of contraception, one of which must be an effective barrier method, or be
                  non-heterosexually active, or have a vasectomized partner) from screening
                  throughout the duration of study treatment and for 1 month after the last
                  administration of investigational product.

             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic or
             allergic disease at screening or medication for comorbidity which, in dialogue between
             the Investigator and Medical Monitor would preclude subject participation in the
             clinical trial.

          2. Reports an uncontrolled psychiatric disorder or neurologic disease or seizure disorder
             not controlled by medication.

             the study.

          9. Recent treatment with alternative therapies which, in the view of the Investigator(s)

         18. Reports a history of clinically significant allergies including food or drug
             allergies.

         19. Demonstrates a positive drug or alcohol screen.
