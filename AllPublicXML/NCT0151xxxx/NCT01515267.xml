  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is evaluated in every echocardiographic examination
      either by visual estimation (eyeballing) requiring high level of training and expertise
      and/or by manual tracing of the endocard from which EF is calculated (manual biplane method
      (MBP)). This procedure is subjective and time consuming. The objective of this study is to
      compare the performance of LVivoEF software system to the measurements obtained by the
      routinely used methods.

      LVivoEF is a decision support system (software) for automated global left ventricle (LV)
      systolic function evaluation from echocardiographic examinations. LVivoEF technology is based
      on a novel image processing algorithm for LV edge detection and ejection fraction (EF)
      evaluation. LVivoEF provides fully automated measurements of the left ventricle (LV) from two
      apical views the four chamber (4CH) and the two chamber (2CH).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Patients referred to an echocardiographic examination. The patients will be
             consecutive until 30% of patients with normal LV function are enrolled. After that
             only consecutive patients with abnormal LV function will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Examinations in which more than one third of the endocard is not visible in a plane
             (2CH/4CH)

          -  Patients with Left bundle branch block (LBBB)
