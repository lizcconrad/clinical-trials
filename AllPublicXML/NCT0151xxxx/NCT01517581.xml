  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      White and brown adipocytes differ in their expression of hormones, cytokines, and
      inflammatory factors, and they modulate different biological functions. While white adipose
      tissue (WAT) serves as the primary site of energy storage, brown adipose tissue (BAT) instead
      metabolizes fat to produce heat and regulate body temperature. BAT is likely present in all
      humans, but the low prevalence of BAT depiction in adults and elderly subjects has hindered
      longitudinal assessments of the relation between BAT activity and WAT. Under typical imaging
      conditions, BAT is detected more frequently in children and teenagers than in adults with
      malignancy. Since most children with cancer have significantly shorter treatment courses and
      greater survival rates compared to adult patients, the investigators have the ability to
      examine the relation of repeated measures of body composition and BAT by selecting pediatric
      patients. In this study, the investigators will longitudinally examine whether BAT activity
      is related to changes in weight and the amounts of SAT, VAT, and abdominal muscle in children
      successfully treated for pediatric cancer.
