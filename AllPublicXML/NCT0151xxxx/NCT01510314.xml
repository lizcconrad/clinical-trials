  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical symptoms of septic complications (SC) (responsible for the majority of morbidity
      in colorectal surgery) become apparent only 5-7 days after the operation, whereas the
      efficacy of treatment depends on early diagnosis. By detecting such complications early it
      could be possible to reduce their severity, the length of hospitalisation, repeat colostomy
      and the number of readmissions. Our team has shown that C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 125 mg/L
      at postoperative day 4 (D4) was a predictor of SC in this context. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a
      marker of sepsis currently used in intensive care, but its use in the follow-up of elective
      surgery, particularly colorectal surgery, has not been fully evaluated.

      The aim of this study is to compare the ability of CRP and PCT to detect SC as early as
      postoperative day 2 (D2) (intra-abdominal or systemic SC, such as those defined by the CDC)
      after elective colorectal surgery.

      Adult patients about to undergo elective colorectal surgery with anastomosis will be included
      once they have given their written informed consent. Levels of CRP and PCT will be measured
      the day before the surgery, then at D1, D2, D3 and D4. The clinical data (temperature,
      recovery of bowel movement, pain, pain on palpation) will be recorded daily. Imaging
      examinations will be performed at the discretion of the surgeon; the only obligation will be
      to perform a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT-scan if CRP at D4 &gt; 125 mg/L with no other
      clinical anomalies. The discriminating ability (measured by the area under the ROC curve) of
      CRP at D2 was 0.653 in our previous study. An improvement of at least 0.1 will be necessary
      to show the superiority of PCT over CRP in clinical terms and with regard to the cost.
