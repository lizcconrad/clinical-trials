    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to assess patterns of fMRI cortical activation with
      spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in patients with neuropathic leg pain and therefore define
      cortical correlates, as well as to investigate cortical representations of pain and pain
      relief and the interactions therein, in the setting of neuropathic leg pain and SCS.

      The main objective is to define, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the effects of
      spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on cortical and subcortical BOLD effects in patients with
      neuropathic leg pain. Our hypothesis is that SCS will demonstrate a consistent pattern of
      BOLD activation that will correlate with symptomatic improvement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-55 years at time of enrollment.

          -  Have previous implantation of thoracic epidural Medtronic Restore Ultra, Prime
             Advanced and Restore Advanced SCS in place for the treatment of CPRS-type 1 or chronic
             refractory neuropathic leg pain following FBSS. The implantation must be 3 or more
             months prior to enrollment.

          -  Patient must have reported significant pain improvement (&gt;50%) following implantation
             of the SCS.

          -  Have consistently reproducible pain relief (&gt; 50%) within 10 minutes of switching SCS
             from an OFF state to an ON state (with &quot;optimal&quot; parameters - see below).

          -  The SCS battery is implanted in the buttocks region.

          -  Unilateral or bilateral extremity pain.

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Contraindication to MRI such as: SCS lead in the cervical epidural region Cardiac
        pacemaker Intracranial aneurysm clips, metallic implants or external clips within 10mm of
        the head Metallic foreign metals within the orbits Pregnancy; (urine pregnancy test will be
        done to confirm) Claustrophobia

          -  Pattern of response to spinal cord stimulation Inconsistent response of pain to spinal
             cord stimulation Long interval (&gt; 10 minutes) before pain relief following switching
             SCS from an OFF state to an ON state (with &quot;optimal&quot; parameters) - long &quot;washout&quot;
             period Lack of significant pain improvement (&lt; 50%) following implantation of SCS

          -  Positive history of significant brain lesions or pathology including:

          -  Prior ablative neurosurgery

          -  History of large vessel strokes or brain tumors

          -  Psychological Screening
