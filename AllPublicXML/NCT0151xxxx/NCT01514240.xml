    <description>For the primary efficacy variable &quot;Remission after 8 weeks of treatment&quot;, Crohn's Disease Activity Index CDAI scores was used to determine the patient's response. Remission for this study is defined as a CDAI score of ≤150. A patient who drops out without any remission before week 8 was considered as a nonresponder (no remission) for this analysis. A patient who drops out before Week 8, but was in remission at the time of dropout, was considered in remission after dropout in this analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>2 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score is calculated based on the data collected in the diary card. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 600, a higher scores indicating more severe disease. The target population of total CDAI score 180 to 400 is defined mild to modarate active Crohn's disease. Total CDAI score 150 less or equal is evaluated as a remission.
Patients are asked to fill the following items in the diary card (from the morning in preceding day to the morning in current day). (1) Number of liquid or very soft stools (2) Abdominal pain rating (none, mild, moderate, severe) (3) General well-being (generally well, slightly under par, poor, very poor, terrible) (4) Body temperature (if a patient feels fever) (5) Intake of loperamide or other opiates for diarrhoea. The data for the calculation of CDAI score in diary card is then transcribed by the investigator(s) into the eCRFs at each clinical visit.</description>

    <time_frame>2 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a standard measure of HRQL in Crohn's disease patients (Guyatt G et al 1989). The validated Japanese version of the IBDQ was used in this study (Hashimoto H et al 2003). The IBDQ contains 32 questions; each with seven possible answers ranging from 1 to 7, where 7 is the most favourable. Ten questions are related to bowel symptoms, five to systemic symptoms, twelve to emotional function, and five to social function. The corresponding answers will be added to form four subscores and a total score: bowel function score (10 - 70), systemic symptom score (5 - 35), emotional function score (12 - 84), social function score (5 - 35) and the total score (32 - 224), with higher scores indicating more favorable outcome.</description>

The IBDQ contains 32 questions; each with seven possible answers ranging from 1 to 7, where 7 is the most favourable. Ten questions are related to bowel symptoms, five to systemic symptoms, twelve to emotional function, and five to social function. The corresponding answers will be added to form four subscores and a total score: bowel function score (10 - 70), systemic symptom score (5 - 35), emotional function score (12 - 84), social function score (5 - 35) and the total score (32 - 224), with higher scores indicating more favorable outcome.</description>

        <title>Remission After 8-week of Treatment</title>
        <description>For the primary efficacy variable “Remission after 8 weeks of treatment”, Crohn’s Disease Activity Index CDAI scores was used to determine the patient’s response. Remission for this study is defined as a CDAI score of ≤150. A patient who drops out without any remission before week 8 was considered as a nonresponder (no remission) for this analysis. A patient who drops out before Week 8, but was in remission at the time of dropout, was considered in remission after dropout in this analysis.</description>

        <description>Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score is calculated based on the data collected in the diary card. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 600, a higher scores indicating more severe disease. The target population of total CDAI score 180 to 400 is defined mild to modarate active Crohn’s disease. Total CDAI score 150 less or equal is evaluated as a remission.
Patients are asked to fill the following items in the diary card (from the morning in preceding day to the morning in current day). (1) Number of liquid or very soft stools (2) Abdominal pain rating (none, mild, moderate, severe) (3) General well-being (generally well, slightly under par, poor, very poor, terrible) (4) Body temperature (if a patient feels fever) (5) Intake of loperamide or other opiates for diarrhoea. The data for the calculation of CDAI score in diary card is then transcribed by the investigator(s) into the eCRFs at each clinical visit.</description>

        <title>Change in Observed CDAI Scores From Baseline to Weeks 4</title>
        <description>Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score is calculated based on the data collected in the diary card. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 600, a higher scores indicating more severe disease. The target population of total CDAI score 180 to 400 is defined mild to modarate active Crohn’s disease. Total CDAI score 150 less or equal is evaluated as a remission.
Patients are asked to fill the following items in the diary card (from the morning in preceding day to the morning in current day). (1) Number of liquid or very soft stools (2) Abdominal pain rating (none, mild, moderate, severe) (3) General well-being (generally well, slightly under par, poor, very poor, terrible) (4) Body temperature (if a patient feels fever) (5) Intake of loperamide or other opiates for diarrhoea. The data for the calculation of CDAI score in diary card is then transcribed by the investigator(s) into the eCRFs at each clinical visit.</description>

        <title>Change in Total IBDQ Scores From Baseline to Weeks 2</title>
        <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a standard measure of HRQL in Crohn's disease patients (Guyatt G et al 1989). The validated Japanese version of the IBDQ was used in this study (Hashimoto H et al 2003). The IBDQ contains 32 questions; each with seven possible answers ranging from 1 to 7, where 7 is the most favourable. Ten questions are related to bowel symptoms, five to systemic symptoms, twelve to emotional function, and five to social function. The corresponding answers will be added to form four subscores and a total score: bowel function score (10 – 70), systemic symptom score (5 – 35), emotional function score (12 – 84), social function score (5 – 35) and the total score (32 – 224), with higher scores indicating more favorable outcome.</description>

          <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a standard measure of HRQL in Crohn's disease patients (Guyatt G et al 1989). The validated Japanese version of the IBDQ was used in this study (Hashimoto H et al 2003). The IBDQ contains 32 questions; each with seven possible answers ranging from 1 to 7, where 7 is the most favourable. Ten questions are related to bowel symptoms, five to systemic symptoms, twelve to emotional function, and five to social function. The corresponding answers will be added to form four subscores and a total score: bowel function score (10 – 70), systemic symptom score (5 – 35), emotional function score (12 – 84), social function score (5 – 35) and the total score (32 – 224), with higher scores indicating more favorable outcome.</description>

          <title>Change in IBDQ Scores From Baseline to Weeks 10 - Bowel Function</title>
          <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a standard measure of HRQL in Crohn's disease patients (Guyatt G et al 1989). The validated Japanese version of the IBDQ was used in this study (Hashimoto H et al 2003). The IBDQ contains 32 questions; each with seven possible answers ranging from 1 to 7, where 7 is the most favourable. Ten questions are related to bowel symptoms, five to systemic symptoms, twelve to emotional function, and five to social function. The corresponding answers will be added to form four subscores and a total score: bowel function score (10 – 70), systemic symptom score (5 – 35), emotional function score (12 – 84), social function score (5 – 35) and the total score (32 – 224), with higher scores indicating more favorable outcome.</description>

          <title>Change in IBDQ Scores From Baseline to Weeks 10 - Systemic Symptom</title>
          <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a standard measure of HRQL in Crohn's disease patients (Guyatt G et al 1989). The validated Japanese version of the IBDQ was used in this study (Hashimoto H et al 2003). The IBDQ contains 32 questions; each with seven possible answers ranging from 1 to 7, where 7 is the most favourable. Ten questions are related to bowel symptoms, five to systemic symptoms, twelve to emotional function, and five to social function. The corresponding answers will be added to form four subscores and a total score: bowel function score (10 – 70), systemic symptom score (5 – 35), emotional function score (12 – 84), social function score (5 – 35) and the total score (32 – 224), with higher scores indicating more favorable outcome.</description>

          <title>Change in IBDQ Scores From Baseline to Weeks 10 - Emotional Function</title>
          <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a standard measure of HRQL in Crohn's disease patients (Guyatt G et al 1989). The validated Japanese version of the IBDQ was used in this study (Hashimoto H et al 2003). The IBDQ contains 32 questions; each with seven possible answers ranging from 1 to 7, where 7 is the most favourable. Ten questions are related to bowel symptoms, five to systemic symptoms, twelve to emotional function, and five to social function. The corresponding answers will be added to form four subscores and a total score: bowel function score (10 – 70), systemic symptom score (5 – 35), emotional function score (12 – 84), social function score (5 – 35) and the total score (32 – 224), with higher scores indicating more favorable outcome.</description>

          <title>Change in IBDQ Scores From Baseline to Weeks 10 - Social Function</title>
          <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a standard measure of HRQL in Crohn's disease patients (Guyatt G et al 1989). The validated Japanese version of the IBDQ was used in this study (Hashimoto H et al 2003). The IBDQ contains 32 questions; each with seven possible answers ranging from 1 to 7, where 7 is the most favourable. Ten questions are related to bowel symptoms, five to systemic symptoms, twelve to emotional function, and five to social function. The corresponding answers will be added to form four subscores and a total score: bowel function score (10 – 70), systemic symptom score (5 – 35), emotional function score (12 – 84), social function score (5 – 35) and the total score (32 – 224), with higher scores indicating more favorable outcome.</description>
