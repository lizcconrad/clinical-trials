        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Generally healthy women, of non-child bearing potential, between the ages of 18 and 65
             years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 35.0 kg/m2; and a total body weight between 50 kg
             (110 lbs) and 120 kg (265 lbs) inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, psychiatric, or neurologic, disease. Subjects
             with asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing will not be excluded.

          -  Women of childbearing potential.

          -  History or diagnosis of ocular disease or conditions that would confound the
             assessment of ocular safety, such as diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, severe wet or dry
             AMD.
