  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if follow-up by a pharmacist over the telephone
      improves adherence and short term clinical outcomes in the patient with atrial fibrillation
      prescribed an oral anti-arrhythmic medication. This study will also identify the reasons
      people stop taking their anti-arrhythmic therapy. A pharmacist will provide medication
      counseling about their anti-arrhythmic therapy, then will follow-up by telephone on a monthly
      basis to assess adherence over one year.
