  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual morbidity (visual acuity and/or visual field deficit) must be taken into account
      during neurosurgical procedures for lesions near the optical pathways. Part of this morbidity
      is due to surgical manipulation. There is no validated tool for intraoperative visual
      monitoring and few publications have studied this issue.

      In a preliminary work based on analysis of these publications, we defined technical,
      anaesthetic and analytical parameters in order to optimise intraoperative visual evoked
      potentials monitoring. These parameters are special devices used for transpalpebral
      stimulation, complete intravenous anaesthesia without halogen or nitrous oxide, and pertinent
      analysis criteria of visual evoked potential (VEP). We suppose that these improvements will
      increase reliability of intraoperative VEP.

      This genuine optimised monitoring in France, set up in association with Metrovision company,
      should help increasing intraoperative VEP reliability as a monitoring tool for visual
      pathways function.

      In this study, we assess the predictive value of relevant intraoperative variations of VEP
      (more than 50% variation of latency and amplitude) on the visual prognosis at six months
      after surgery The visual assessment consisting of a visual field, a visual acuity, and the
      performance of pattern transient VEP, will be performed by an ophthalmologist before surgery,
      and at three and six months after surgery. An electroencephalogram with photostimulatory
      lighting will be used in pre-operative and will validate the absence of photo-induced
      epilepsy risk.

      During the intervention, VEPs associated to an electroretinogram will be performed by a
      neurosurgeon trained to the use of these tools by Metrovision company:

        -  Under general anaesthesia, but before any surgery.

        -  During the surgery, at predetermined surgical times (while performing the craniotomy or
           the sphenoid opening, at various times during the perioptic lesion dissection, after the
           lesion resection, when closing).
