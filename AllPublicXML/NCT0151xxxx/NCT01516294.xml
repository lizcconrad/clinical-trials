      activity and lesion size at 12 months.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, interventional clinical trial in which subjects will receive 16 Gy
      of IRay treatment and Lucentis, followed by Lucentis treatment as needed to evaluate the
      efficacy of IRay treatment in patients with PCV as determined by the change in the proportion
      of lesion activity and lesion size at 12 months.

    <description>The Oraya IRay stereotactic radiotherapy device will be used to deliver a 16 Gy dose of radiation to the macula. The radiotherapy will be delivered in a single session utilizing three sequential beams, each depositing 5.3 Gy at the macula through calculated scleral entry points, crossing the pars plana region of the eye, and overlapping at the same region of the macula.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with PCV, naïve or previously treated with Lucentis injections and
             Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using Visudyne.

          -  Must have a total lesion size of &lt;12 disc areas and a PCV lesion with the greatest
             linear dimension of &lt;6 mm, but not greater than 3 mm from the center of the fovea to
             the furthest point on lesion perimeter (determined by ICG).

          -  The distance from the center of the fovea to the nearest edge of the optic disc should
             be not less than 3 mm. (This distance is confirmed by Oraya software prior to
             treatment.).

          -  Must have provided informed consent, documented it in writing, and have been given a
             copy of the signed informed consent form.

          -  Must be willing and able to return for scheduled visits for the 2-year duration of the
             study.

          -  Must be at least 50 years of age.

          -  Women must be post-menopausal ≥1 year or surgically sterilized, or a pregnancy screen
             must be performed prior to the study and a reliable form of contraception, approved by
             the investigator, must be maintained during the study.

          -  Must have best corrected visual acuity of 75 to 25 letters (inclusive) in the study
             eye and at least 20 letters in the fellow eye (if both eyes meet all the study
             criteria, then the eye with the worst vision should be selected as the study eye).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CNV due to causes other than AMD or PCV, including ocular histoplasmosis syndrome,
             angioid streaks, multifocal choroiditis, choroidal rupture, or pathologic myopia
             (spherical equivalent -8 diopters).

          -  A globe axial length of &lt;20 mm or &gt;26 mm.

          -  Evidence of diabetes or with retinal findings consistent with diabetic retinopathy or
             retinopathy for any other cause.

          -  Hypertension that is not controlled with anti-hypertensive medication.

          -  Prior or concurrent therapies for age related macular degeneration or PCV, including
             submacular surgery, subfoveal thermal laser photocoagulation (with or without
             photographic evidence), or transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT).

             visit.

          -  Intravitreal device in the study eye.

          -  Concomitant disease in the study eye which might interfere with the effect of
             assessment of the study treatment, including uveitis, acute ocular or periocular
             infection, retinal vasculopathies (including retinal vein occlusions, etc.) or
             intraocular pressure &gt;30 mmHg uncontrollable with medications.

          -  History of rhegmatogenous retina detachment, optic neuritis or intraocular tumors in
             the study eye.

          -  Inadequate pupillary dilation, significant media opacities, or other conditions in the
             study eye, including cataract, which may interfere with visual acuity or the
             evaluation of the posterior segment. Subjects likely to need cataract surgery during
             the 1 year study period should also not be enrolled.

          -  Known serious allergies to fluorescein or indocyanine green dye used in angiography.

          -  Subjects must not have subretinal hemorrhage or Retinal Pigment Epithelium tear
             involving the center of the foveal avascular zone.

          -  Known sensitivity or allergy to Lucentis, or any other drug used in the study, such as
             topical anesthetic, cycloplegic mydriatics, or lubricating eye gel.

          -  Contraindication or sensitivity to contact lens application (i.e. corneal dystrophies
             and recurrent corneal erosions). 16. Currently receiving chemotherapy, having
             completed a course within the 90 days preceding study enrollment, or expecting to

          -  Current participation in another PCV drug or device clinical trial.

          -  History of use of drugs with known retinal toxicity, including: chloroquine (Aralen -
             antimalarial), hydroxychloriquine (Plaquenil - antimalarial), phenothiazines
             (Thorazine, Stelazine, Mellaril, Prolixin, Trilafon, etc., - tranquilizing
             antipsychotic medications) and these patients are exhibiting signs of retinal
             toxicity.

          -  Concurrent use of systemic anti-VEGF agents.

          -  Any other condition, which in the judgment of the investigator would prevent the
             subject from granting consent or completing the study, such as dementia, mental
             illness (including generalized anxiety disorder, claustrophobia, etc.), or inability
             to position in the device (due to musculoskeletal problems, etc.).

          -  History of other significant, uncontrolled disease including cardiovascular, nervous
             system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine or gastrointestinal, metabolic
             dysfunction, any clinical finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or
             condition that contraindicates the use of intravitreal ranibizumab or that might
             affect interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk
             for treatment complication
