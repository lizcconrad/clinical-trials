    <textblock>
      Today, no non-verbal auditory stimuli that assess mental processing are available in Israel.
      The goal of this study is to make available a validated set of auditory stimuli in Israel. We
      created a computerized Hebrew version of the Montreal Affective Voices (MAV). The MAV is a
      novel tool for assessing mental processing. The MAV consists of 90 nonverbal affect bursts
      corresponding to nine different emotions (such as anger, fear, happiness etc.) recorded by
      ten different actors. The uniqueness of these affective bursts is that they do not contain
      verbal context, but rather express affective moods using the vowel /a/ (as in &quot;apple&quot;). In
      this study, the investigators will verify the new Hebrew version of MAV in healthy control
      groups. Next, the investigators will compare the mental processing ability in young vs. old
      population, using the MAV test. In addition, the investigators will assess mental processing
      in two pathologic study groups (Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder) using the MAV
      test. The investigators intend to use the MAV tool in future research in Parkinson's disease
      and depression.
