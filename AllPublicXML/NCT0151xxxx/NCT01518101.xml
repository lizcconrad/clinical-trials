  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics or
      analogs, which rely on the gastrointestinal hormones that are part of the incretin system for
      the treatment of T2DM, provide a therapeutic alternative to common oral antihyperglycemic
      agents (eg, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones). Although GLP-1 analogs and DPP-4 inhibitor
      medications are effective, there are differences between these products, including method of
      administration (injectable versus oral). Previous studies have shown that patients prefer
      additional oral agents over injectable agents because of fear of injections and the desire to
      avoid them. Patient preference is both clinically and financially important, as it can have
      long-term implications in terms of patients' motivation and insight into their disease state
      and its treatment, which might have a direct impact on the patient's compliance and treatment
      adherence. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the proportion of T2DM patients
      preferring oral anti-diabetic treatment with vildagliptin + metformin versus an injectable
      anti-diabetic treatment with liraglutide after 4 weeks of treatment with each medication.

    <description>The TSQM -9 is a psychometrically measure of the major dimensions of patients' satisfaction with medication. It provides scores on 3 scales: effectiveness (3 items), convenience (3 items) and global satisfaction (3 items).</description>

    <measure>Number of patients responding to subjective reasons of preference to each treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Individual patient preference will be assessed by a two-choice question. Patients will also be asked to specify the reason for preference. A specific questionnaire for the preference reasons will be provided.</description>

    <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>
