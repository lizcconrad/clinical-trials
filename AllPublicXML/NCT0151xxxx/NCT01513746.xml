      The purpose of the study is to investigate how people with type 1 diabetes experience and
      manage their diabetes, eating, and weight. Summary of the Study: If you choose to
      participate, you will complete a set of questionnaires and a structured interview. You will
      then wear a continuous glucose monitor and use your cell phone to answer study questions for
      a period of 3 days. The questions come in the form of regular phone calls between the hours
      of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Each call takes only a minute or two to complete. You will also
      be asked to call in and answer study questions at other times during the day, especially
      after eating. The study involves a minimum of 2 clinic visits to Duke. Participants who live
      greater than 1.5 hours from Duke can be approved to take part in the study by phone/Skype.
      Participants will receive and return study materials through the mail.

      Eating disorders (ED) are far more prevalent among individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
      than the general population. Yet what accounts for the increased prevalence of ED in T1D, and
      how to effectively treat these patients is unknown. ED in T1D is dangerous. T1D patients with
      ED not only engage in behaviors common among non-diabetic ED patients (like binge eating),
      but also might omit insulin to prevent weight gain. The goal of this study is to understand
      the psychophysiological precipitants to ED behavior among T1D patients.
