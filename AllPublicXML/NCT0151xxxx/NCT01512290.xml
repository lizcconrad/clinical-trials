  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a characterising symptom of schizophrenia. In the
      majority of patients, these AVH respond well to antipsychotic medication. Yet, a significant
      minority continues to experience frequent AVH despite optimal pharmacotherapy. The number of
      alternative treatment options for this medication resistant group is currently low and most
      of them focus on coping with the hallucinations. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in
      contrast, is a non-invasive technique of influencing cortical excitability. This technique
      has the potential to actually decrease the frequency and severity of medication resistant
      hallucinations.

      Several previous studies have assessed efficacy of low frequency rTMS, with contradicting
      results. A previous large study by the investigators group could not demonstrate efficacy of
      low frequency rTMS. A new stimulation protocol using theta burst rTMS (TBS) could provide a
      more effective therapeutic option.

      Objective: The present study aims to examine the efficacy of TBS on the severity of AVH.
      Study design: The objectives are tested in a randomized double blind placebo-controlled
      trail.

      Study population: 60 patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
      schizophreniform disorder or psychosis not otherwise specified with frequent auditory verbal
      hallucinations will be included.

      Intervention: The participant will receive either 10 TBS treatments or 10 placebo treatments
      consisting of 900 pulses each with a 30 minute interval on the left temporoparietal area,
      distributed over 5 treatment days. Stimulation will be at 80% of the motor threshold.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: the main study parameter is the change in the severity of
      the AVH. The secondary study parameter is the number and severity of adverse events.

The change in score on the Auditory Hallucination Assessment Scale (AHAS; Frederick, 2000), the PSYRATS (Haddock et al., 1999) and the total score on the PANSS item 3 (Kay et al. 1987), the item concerning the severity of the hallucinations, after one week of treatment end one month after treatment will be used for this outcome.</description>
