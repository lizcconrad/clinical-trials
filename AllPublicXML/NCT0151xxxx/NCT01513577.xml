  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Convalescence after lumbar surgery is dependent on the extensiveness of the surgical
      procedure. Minimal invasive techniques in lumbar spine surgery are reported to achieve
      excellent clinical results with less pain, morbidity and disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve lumbar fusion when there is no need for decompression of the neural structures a
      posterior midline approach and a left anterior retroperitoneal approach is used. The
      retroperitoneal anterior approach to the lumbar spine offers some benefits compared with the
      posterior approach. Dural injury and epidural scarring can be avoided, and an interbody
      fusion graft can be placed with minimal risk to the nerve roots. However, the extensive
      posterior midline approach with extensive muscle dissection is necessary to place the
      pedicular screws.

      A report of a follow-up period of 2 years of a randomized trial of minimal invasive insertion
      of pedicular screws and rods in lumbar fusion.

    <description>The control group received posterior fixation with pedicle screws through a midline approach. Through the approach bone was harvested from the right posterior iliac crest. Before closure of the posterior approach an epidural catheter and a drain was placed.</description>

    <description>The intervention group received posterior fixation through 6 percutaneous stab incisions with the use of the sextant system. Through a separate 3-4 cm long incision, bone was harvested from the right posterior iliac crest. After decorticating the transverse processes through the stab wounds, the bone graft was placed with a 10 ml cut syringe. An epidural catheter was placed at the end of the posterior procedure.</description>
