    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study of alisertib in East Asian patients (eg,
      patients from countries including but not limited to Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South
      Korea) with either relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors or lymphomas for which no
      effective standard treatment is available.

    <description>Alisertib will be given orally twice daily for 7 consecutive days followed by a 14-day rest period (cycle length = 21 days). If, at the end of 14 days of rest, all alisertib-related toxicities (except alopecia) have not resolved to less than Grade 2, the cycle will be extended to a maximum of 28 days (ie, additional 7-day rest period). Patients will continue to receive repeated cycles of alisertib treatment for as long as their disease has not progressed and they have not experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity.</description>

          -  Treatment with nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, rituximab, alemtuzumab, or other
             unconjugated antibody treatment within 42 days (21 days if clear evidence of
