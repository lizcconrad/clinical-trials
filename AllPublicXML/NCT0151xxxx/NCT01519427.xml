  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well selumetinib and Akt inhibitor MK2206 works in treating
      patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma who failed prior therapy with vemurafenib or
      dabrafenib. Selumetinib and Akt inhibitor MK2206 stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet know whether giving selumetinib and
      Akt inhibitor MK2206 together is an effective treatment for advanced melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency of objective clinical responses by RECIST 1.1 for these
      melanoma patients who have previously progressed on selective BRAF inhibitors when treated
      with MEK inhibitor, AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate plus Akt inhibitor, MK-2206.

      II. To further characterize toxicities of both regimens in these patients who have progressed
      after BRAF inhibitor therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. With required fresh pretreatment biopsies on all patients, we plan to characterize the
      molecular state (genetic and proteomic) associated with BRAF inhibitor resistance. This may
      include an analysis of pathway activation, PI3/Akt or MAP kinase pathway; loss of expression
      of PTEN, secondary mutations in BRAF, other mutations in the MAP kinase pathway (NRAS, KRAS,
      HRAS, CRAF, MEK), activation of other RTKs (amplification, over expression, phosphorylation).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and Akt inhibitor
      MK2206 PO once weekly.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.
