    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia beginning before 18 years is a clinical entity not well known because of its
      low incidence and difficulties in the clinical diagnosis.

      However, in the investigators clinical practice, due to the specialization of the
      investigators service, the investigators are led to hospital to receive important feel active
      of patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV text
      revision (DSM IV-TR) precose schizophrenia.

      The work of us team on the theme of the relationship between Pervasive Developmental
      Disorders and precose Schizophrenia led us to hypothesize that a number of children in care
      in the medical and educational institutes, hospitals and day shelters therapeutic part-time
      symptoms of schizophrenia or a line real early diagnosis of schizophrenia undervalued or not
      diagnosed.

      The main goal is to estimate the prevalence of dissociative disorders in a population of
      children in care institutions and medical education in child psychiatry in hospitals and
      others structures.
