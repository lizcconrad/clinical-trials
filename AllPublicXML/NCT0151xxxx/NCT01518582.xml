      This is a prospective clinical study to assess the performance of the prosthesis according to
      a composite success criterion. The clinical and functional results and the patient's quality
      of life up to 24 months of follow-up will also be recorded.

      Granvia-c is a device NOT FDA-approved and NOT under investigation in the USA.

      Anterior cervical arthrodesis has been widely used to treat the degenerative cervical spine.
      Although the results of ACDF are generally in the good to excellent range, interbody fusion
      of the cervical spine after cervical discectomy, aside from causing restriction of neck
      movements, also accelerates degeneration of adjacent disc levels because of the increased
      stress from fusion. Long-term radiographic follow-up of patients with anterior cervical
      fusion has demonstrated degenerative changes in the non-fused segments of the spine including
      disc space narrowing and osteophyte formation.

      To conclude, fusion provokes a functional overload of the discs bordering the fusion that is
      directly correlated to the number of fused levels. Radiographic observations show a greater
      mechanical stress on the discs, especially in the arthrodeses involving more than one level.

      Artificial discs were designed to replace the entire intervertebral disc and to preserve the
      physiological motion of the operated level. Several prostheses with different concepts were
      commercialized. Published clinical studies reported a preserved motion and improved clinical
      results (Neck Disability Index, Pain Visual Analogic Scale, Quality of Life).

      The cervical disc prosthesis GRANVIA®-C was designed to replace the intervertebral discs of
      the cervical spine, to restore the disc height and to restore segmental motion.

      A prospective clinical study has been set up to evaluate the performance of the prosthesis

      Granvia-c is a device NOT FDA-approved and NOT under investigation in the USA.
