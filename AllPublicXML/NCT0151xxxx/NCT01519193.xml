    <textblock>
      Street children and children of vulnerable families in conflict or former conflict regions
      are often exposed to multiple traumatic events and situations in which they are forced to
      engage in violent behavior. The Narrative Exposure Therapy for violent offenders (NETvo) aims
      to reduce both PTSD symptoms and aggressive behavior. It helps the children to anchor fearful
      experiences and positive emotions linked to violent behaviour in the past. Additionally,
      visions for the future are developed in order to foster successful reintegration into
      society.

    <description>During NETvo the client, with the assistance of the therapist, constructs a chronological narrative of his whole life with a focus on exposure to traumatic stress and also on perpetrated violent acts. Empathic understanding, active listening, congruency and unconditional positive regard are key components of the therapist's behavior who asks in detail for emotions, cognitions, sensory information, and physiological reactions, linking them to an autobiographical context. Positive emotions and cognitions reported for violent acts are linked to the respective past. During four sessions the most important traumatic experiences and perpetrated violent acts are processed. In the fifth session plans and ideas for the future are developed to assist the children to reintegrate themselves into society.</description>
