      The purpose of this research study is to screen healthy African American and Caucasian
      persons for specific differences in genes that control how fats are processed in the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy African American and Caucasian persons will be screened for specific differences in
      genes that control how fats are processed in the body. Persons with the needed genotypes will
      be added to a database of healthy persons who may be asked to join a larger study comparing
      differences in diet on lipid metabolism and inflammatory biomarkers as well as future
      studies. A key hypothesis for the larger study is that variations in genes involved in lipid
      metabolism play a role in determining levels of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (LC-PUFAs).

      A small saliva sample for screening purposes will be collected. If documentation from a
      personal physician of blood glucose and lipid levels are unavailable, we will collect a small
      tube (10-12 ml) of blood to determine these measurements.
