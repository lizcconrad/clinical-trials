  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a prospective study of a widely used bowel preparation
      regimen (polyethylene glycol 3350 + a sports drink) on pediatric patients who undergo a
      colonoscopy performed by the pediatric gastroenterology service at WRAMC/WRNMMC between 1 Sep
      2010 and 31 Dec 2011. This study will involve the following: determine efficacy of the
      cleanout, assess tolerability and acceptance of the regimen, determine an appropriate
      duration to complete the regimen and assess for any electrolyte changes or side effects.

      Purpose: It is hoped that by determining acceptability, safety and efficacy of this widely
      used short course, single-dose bowel preparation regimen, pediatric gastroenterologist can
      have a standardized bowel preparation for colonoscopy that will be acceptable to pediatric
      patients and their parents.

      Research Design: This study is a prospective medication trial. It will utilize laboratory
      data to detect any electrolyte changes, a patient questionnaire to assess an acceptable
      duration, tolerance and side effects of the regimen. Efficacy of the cleanout will be
      assessed using a published standardized bowel preparation scale by the endoscopist at the
      completion of the colonoscopy.

      Methodology /Technical Approach (including the number of subjects to be studied.): We
      estimate that 50 patients aged 8-18 years old military dependents who are undergoing a
      colonoscopy by the Pediatric Gastroenterology service at WRAMC/WRNMMC will be enrolled in the
      study between 1 Sep 2010 and 31 Dec 2011.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female DEERS-eligible dependent military health care beneficiaries age 8 to
             18 years old evaluated by Pediatric Gastroenterology service at WRAMC and are
             scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy between 1 Sep 2010 - 31 Dec 2011 and do not meet
             exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 8 years or greater than 18 at time of procedure

             surgeries.

          -  Oral aversion or other feeding disorder.

          -  Inability to drink large amount of liquids.

          -  Aspiration risk.

          -  Renal disease or pre-cleanout electrolytes outside normal range.

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease.

          -  Allergy to food coloring or polyethylene glycol 3350.

          -  Inpatient or emergency colonoscopy.

          -  Current nasogastric tube in place.

          -  Known Pregnancy. Urine pregnancy test will only be completed on day of colonoscopy for
             all females age 14 and older per current standard anesthesia protocols. There have
             been no known reported animal or human studies that report the fetal effects of using
             polyethylene glycol. Per FDA, it is labeled as a category C drug in pregnancy.
             However, two studies , have reported successful treatment of constipation during
             pregnancy using polyethylene glycol solutions and did not find any significant effects
             or safety issues
