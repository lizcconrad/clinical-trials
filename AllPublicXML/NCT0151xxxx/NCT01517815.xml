  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight patients are susceptible to develop acute complications when they are admitted in
      an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Severe infection can be associated with cardiovascular failure
      ('shock&quot;) and is associated with 35-50% mortality. One of the key issue to cure infection is
      to administer antibiotics. However, under dosing antibiotic is one of the main reason that
      explain treatment failure. There are very few data concerning particularities of antibiotic
      dosing in critically ill, overweight, patients. The aim of the present study is to describe
      the pharmacokinetic of two main antibiotics (doripenem and piperacillin/Tazobactam) in both
      overweight and non overweight critically ill patients presenting a septic shock. The
      investigators hypothesis is that usual dose for those antibiotic may be accurate in non
      overweight patients but is not in overweight patients.

      N=52 patients divided in 4*13 patients (13 per antibiotic and per group, overweight or non
      overweight).

      Overweight is defined by a weight over 120kg. Antibiotic chosen by the intensivist in charge
      of the case. Doripenem 1g/8h with a 4h IV infusion whatever the patient's weight.
      Piperacillin/Tazobactam 4g IV (1h) and then 16g/24h IV continuously whatever the patient's
      weight.

      Piperacillin/Tazobactam plasma dosage: after the first dose and then every 12h. Doripenem
      plasma dosage: after the first dose and then twice a day, at peak and residual value.

      Usual plasma and urine samples for urea, creatinine, electrolytes, platelets and bilirubin
      each 24h.
