  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine a nurse case management model for
      patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a Danish
      municipality, and is performed in order to evaluate the use of case management as a tool in
      achieving integrated, quality and cost-effective care for this group of patients.

      The main objectives are to evaluate how case management influences on hospital admissions,
      mortality, quality of life and self care, as well as to compare costs and cost-effectiveness
      of case management vs. usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Case management is being implemented as a health service strategy that should contribute to
      maximize health outcomes within a cost-constrained environment. Evaluations of case
      management in Danish settings are sparse, and so far no Danish studies have evaluated the
      cost-effectiveness of case management.

      This study is performed as a RCT, and the study focuses exclusively on patients with COPD.
      The patients will be enrolled and randomized after being referred to rehabilitation at the
      local rehabilitation center in Aalborg municipality, Denmark. 150 patients will be randomly
      assigned to two groups of 75 patients each. Participants in the control group will receive
      usual care, whereas patients assigned to the interventional group will receive case
      management besides their usual care. Each patient will be followed for 12 months. Patients in
      both groups will fill out questionnaires at baseline and 12 months. The data register system
      &quot;Health - Planning and Quality&quot; in the Northern Region of Jutland will be used to determine
      health care services and costs.

    <description>The investigators will obtain 2 measurements from each patient and are therefore able to evaluate the change in Qol from baseline to end of study (1 year in total). Both generic (EQ-5D, SF-12) and disease-specific questionnaires (Sct. George Respiratory questionnaire, SG-RQ) will be used.</description>

    <description>The cost-effectiveness analysis will examine and compare the cost of health care resources and health outcomes between the two groups. The costs will include all health care utilization during the 1 year of follow-up.
Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) is the preferred measure for cost-effectivenes analysis. QALYs will be calculated based on the EuroQol (EQ-5D).</description>

    <description>The patients who are randomized to the intervention group will be assigned to case management.

    <description>Patients, who are randomized to the intervention group, will receive case management from a trained and experienced nurse. The case manager will carry out following tasks:
Formulation and implementation of care plans together with the patient
Monitoring of individual status and care plan effectuation
Overall coordination between health care providers
Support to the patient and their caregivers during times of transition related to health status and environmental changes (e.g. hospital to home)
Regular telephone consultations and home visits
Promote disease-self management through coaching</description>
