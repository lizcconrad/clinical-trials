      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled recombinant
      human GM-CSF in individuals with hereditary Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP) due to
      partial dysfunction of the GM-CSF receptor.

    <description>Participants will receive inhaled rhGM-CSF (Sargramostim, Leukine) at the dose of 250 mcg one time per week for 12 weeks. Following an interim safety evaluation, participants may be entered into a second 12 week treatment period where participants will receive either 250 mcg or 500 mcg once weekly. At the end of any treatment period, participants will be followed for 12 additional weeks in the absence of inhaled rhGM-CSF to evaluate safety and efficacy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of PAP caused by bi-allelic mutations in CSF2RA or CSF2RB associated with
             impaired GM-CSF-R-alpha or GM-CSF-R-beta function, respectively, resulting in reduced
             but non-zero GM-CSF signaling

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent / assent as necessary

          -  Clinically stable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of a disorder of surfactant production caused by bi-allelic
             mutations in ABCA3, SFTPB, or SFTPC

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of autoimmune PAP caused by a high level of GM-CSF autoantibody

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of secondary PAP caused by an underlying clinical disorder known
             to be associated with the development of PAP, e.g., inhalation of silica or titanium;
             myelodysplasia and others

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent in the 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to GM-CSF or other yeast-derived
             products

          -  History of asthma or other reactive airways disease

          -  Known active, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection

          -  A serious medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator or data and
             safety monitoring committee, would make the patient unsuitable for the study
