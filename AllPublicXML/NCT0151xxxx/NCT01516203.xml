    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the early bacterial activity (EBA) from day 0 to day
      14 of Astra Zeneca Drug (AZD5847) at four different doses and schedules (500 mg once daily,
      500 mg twice daily, 1200 mg once daily, and 800 mg twice daily) in subjects with
      newly-diagnosed sputum smear positive pulmonary TB. A total of 75 subjects will be enrolled,
      with 15 randomized to each AZD5847 study arm or standard treatment with Rifafour. Duration of
      drug treatment is 14 days.

    <textblock>
      This is a study of early bactericidal activity (EBA) in treatment-na√Øve patients with active
      pulmonary tuberculosis. This prospective, randomized, open-label study that will compare the
      effect of monotherapy with each of four dose levels of AZD5847 to that of an active control
      (Rifafour administered orally once daily) on the concentration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      (M. tb) in expectorated sputum (colony-forming units per mL of sputum). Daily quantitative
      sputum cultures will be performed during treatment and analyzed by investigators who will be
      blinded to the assigned treatment. The duration of therapy will be 14 days in order to
      support an assessment of early bactericidal activity (days 0-2) and sterilizing activity
      (days 3-14). Because of the risk of emergence of drug resistance in TB patients treated with
      a single active drug, regulatory and ethical requirements restrict monotherapy to a maximum
      duration of 14 days (EMEA Draft TB Guidance 2008). The study will utilize a standard design
      and will thus support comparison with other marketed and investigational antimycobacterial
      agents (Donald and Diacon 2008). The primary aim of the study is to assess the EBA 0-14 of
      AZD5847 at four different doses and schedules (500 mg once daily, 500 mg twice daily, 1200 mg
      once daily, and 800 mg twice daily) in subjects with newly-diagnosed sputum smear positive
      pulmonary TB. The secondary aim is to assess the EBA 0-2 and EBA 2-14 of AZD5847 at the above
      doses.
