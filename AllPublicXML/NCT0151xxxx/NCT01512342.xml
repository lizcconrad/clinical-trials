  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the lack of evidence in support of pacing self-management for patients with chronic
      fatigue syndrome (CFS), it is examined whether physical behavior and health status of
      patients with CFS improve in response to a pacing self-management program. The effects of
      pacing will be compared with those observed when applying relaxation therapy to patients with
      CFS.

      Given the lack of evidence in support of pacing self-management for patients with chronic
      fatigue syndrome (CFS), it is examined whether physical behavior and health status of
      patients with CFS improve in response to a pacing self-management program. The effects of
      pacing will be compared with those observed when applying relaxation therapy to patients with
      CFS.

      According to the power calculation, 36 patients fulfilling the 1994 Centre for Disease
      Control and Prevention criteria for the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) will be
      randomized to either 3 weeks of pacing activity self-management or relaxation therapy. Both
      treatment groups will receive 3 weekly sessions spread over 3 consecutive weeks. All
      treatments will be delivered by occupational therapists or physiotherapists. One treatment
      session lasts for about 45 minutes each.

      Outcome measures include the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Medical
      Outcomes Short Form 37 Health Status Survey (SF-36), Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), CFS
      Symptom List and autonomic activity at rest and following 3 activities of daily living
      (writing a standardized test on a laptop computer, ironing, and climbing 26 flights of
      stairs). For measuring autonomic activity, the Nexus 10 device (Mind Media, the Netherlands)
      will be used. Skin conductance, body temperature, heart rate, blood volume pressure and heart
      rate variability will be measured continuously in real time during a 2 minutes period, with
      the patient sitting on a chair (back supported and hands resting on legs). Electrodes will be
      placed on the left hand in all patients.

    <description>The SF-36 assesses functional status and well-being or quality of life. The SF-36 has been documented to have reliability and validity in a wide variety of patient populations and it is the most frequently used measure in CFS research.</description>

    <measure>the change in Ckecklist Individual Strength (CIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline (week 1) and post-treatment (week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The CIS aims at assessing the subjective fatigue experience, concentration difficulties, motivation and physical activity. Higher scores on the CIS correspond to severe fatigue, many concentration difficulties, problems with motivation and a low level of physical activity. Its psychometric properties are well established.</description>

    <description>The CFS Symptom List is a self-reported measure for assessing symptom severity in CFS patients. In order to assess the severity of the symptoms included in the CFS Symptom List, visual analogue scales (100 mm) are used. Psychometric work supporting the use of the CFS Symptom List has been published.</description>

    <description>The pacing self-management program focussed on teaching the patient to estimate their current physical capabilities prior to commencing an activity. In order to appropriately pace activities (daily activities and exercise bouts), CFS patients were learned to estimate their current physical capabilities prior to commencing an activity, keeping in mind the regular fluctuating nature of their symptoms. The activity duration used within the program was less than that reported by the patient so to account for typical overestimations made by the patient. Each activity block was interspersed with breaks, with the length of this break equating to the duration of the activity.</description>

    <description>Relaxation therapy comprised of education about the role of stress in CFS biology, and the opportunities stress management provides to handle this issue. Patients were then taught how to apply stress management techniques like Jacobson relaxation skills, Schultz relaxation skills, visualization, etc.</description>
