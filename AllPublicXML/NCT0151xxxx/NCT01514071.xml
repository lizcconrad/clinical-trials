  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is difficult for Pediatric Emergency Department providers to recognize clinically
      significant head injuries that are likely to require neurosurgical intervention or close
      monitoring from those that can be safely discharged.

      Research Question How do a combination of education and an animated picture depicting the
      PECARN CT Head Injury rules impact compliance to these rules and reduce unnecessary head CT
      scans?

      Design This is a within subject, repeated measures study design.

    <description>An animated picture depicting the key elements of the PECARN CT scan head injury rules will be explained. The picture will &quot;pop-up&quot; when a provider selects the order set for a CT scan due to head injury. Providers will need to select a box stating the patient either &quot;meets criteria&quot; or &quot;does not meet criteria&quot; in order to close the animated picture window.</description>
