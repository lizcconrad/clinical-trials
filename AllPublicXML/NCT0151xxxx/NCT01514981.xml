  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine that no significant safety issues will be
      identified following a single dose of AMG 761 in asthma subjects that would preclude further
      development of AMG 761.

          -  Immunizations up to date, with a minimum of tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (td/Tdap),
             pneumococcal (polysaccharide), influenza (during flu season) and H1N1 (where and when
             available) vaccinations, as determined by the principal investigator

             treatment in an emergency room, hospitalization, or an episode treated with oral
             corticosteroids in dosage of at least 5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for ≥ 1 week)
             during the 6 months prior to enrollment
