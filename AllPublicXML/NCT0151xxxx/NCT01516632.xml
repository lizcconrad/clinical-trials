    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a text messaging-based smoking cessation program called SMS (Stop
      My Smoking) USA. It was tailored for the unique needs and smoking habits of young adults. The
      investigators hypothesized that those in the SMS USA intervention would be significantly more
      likely to be quit at 6-months compared to the attention-matched control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About one in four young adults are current smokers. Although over half report the desire to
      quit or cut down, quit rates in this age group have remained stagnant in the last ten years.
      Text messaging may represent a compelling intervention delivery method for smoking cessation
      for young adults because it is a medium they have widely adopted. Cell phone interventions
      also are unique because of their 'always on' capability - interventions are never far from
      the young adult's reach and they are received automatically instead of requiring the
      participant to initiate contact in order to receive the information. Dr. Ybarra, along with
      Drs. Holtrop and Graham, have developed SMS Turkey, an innovative behavioral intervention
      that uses text messaging to deliver CBT-based smoking cessation information to participants
      daily. Successful use of text messaging to deliver smoking cessation programs has been
      reported by Rodgers and colleagues in New Zealand and a replication study they are leading in
      the United Kingdom. These data provide optimism for the feasibility of text messaging-based
      smoking cessation programs in the United States. Using qualitative methods to inform design
      and content, and quantitative methods to assess the feasibility of the program, we propose to
      design and test SMS (Stop My Smoking) USA, a cell-phone based smoking cessation program for
      young adults ages 18-25. This innovative smoking cessation program uses technology widely
      adopted by young adults, an under-targeted population, to deliver a proactive, cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT)-based intervention. Our multidisciplinary team of researchers brings
      together expertise in Internet health and the design of tailored smoking cessation
      interventions.

    <description>Continuous abstinence is defined as 5 or fewer cigarettes smoked since one's quit date. The question was asked based upon West et al., 2005: &quot;Have you smoked at all, even just a puff, since [insert quit date]?&quot; If yes, the respondent will be probed for how many cigarettes were smoked. Responses will be categorized into one of three options: A) No, not a puff; B) 1-5 cigarettes; C) More than 5 cigarettes.
Self-reported cessation is confirmed by a significant other.</description>

    <description>Intervention participants receive text messages daily pre-and post-quit. Everyone receives messages 14 days prior to the Quit day, and through the day after Quit. Then, participants are 'pathed' to particular messages based upon their self-reported smoking status at Day 2 and Day 7 post quit, respectively. Those who are successful at quitting receive messages aimed at relapse prevention whereas those who have slipped receive messages aimed at getting the person to recommit to quitting and trying again.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited nationally through online advertisements (e.g. Craigslist) between May 3, 2011 and August 4, 2011. Smokers expressed their interest by completing an online screener form, which was then e-mailed to the project coordinator.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 1,916 people who expressed interest, 585 (31%) were eligible for the study. Of these 585, contact was not made with 49% (n = 284). Fifteen percent (n=90) declined to participate. 211 eligible participants consented to participate and were randomized into the study. 47 terminated after randomization (i.e. did not complete enrollment process)</pre_assignment_details>

Stop My Smoking (SMS) USA is a text messaging–based smoking cessation program tailored to the experiences of young adult smokers. Content was tailored based on participant's stage of quitting (i.e. pre-quit, quit day, early-quit, late-quit, relapse).

        <title>Continuous Abstinence at 3-months Assessed in Accordance With the NIH Behavior Change Consortium's Recommendations</title>
        <description>Continuous abstinence is defined as 5 or fewer cigarettes smoked since one's quit date. The question was asked based upon West et al., 2005: &quot;Have you smoked at all, even just a puff, since [insert quit date]?&quot; If yes, the respondent will be probed for how many cigarettes were smoked. Responses will be categorized into one of three options: A) No, not a puff; B) 1-5 cigarettes; C) More than 5 cigarettes.
Self-reported cessation is confirmed by a significant other.</description>

          <title>Smoking Cessation Text Messaging</title>
          <description>6-week smoking cessation program delivered via daily text messages. Stop My Smoking (SMS) USA is a text messaging–based smoking cessation program tailored to the experiences of young adult smokers. Content was tailored based on participant's stage of quitting (i.e. pre-quit, quit day, early-quit, late-quit, relapse). Based on the typical trajectory, content paths were created for participants based on whether or not they were smoking 2 days after quit day; and again at 7 days after quit day. The intervention group had access to Text Buddy (another person in the program that a participant was assigned to so they could text one another for support anonymously and Text Crave (immediate, on demand messages aimed at helping the participant through a craving).</description>

          <title>Attention-Matched Control Group</title>
          <description>Control group participants received a text-messaging program that was similar to the intervention program on the number of text messages received per day across the 6 weeks. Message content was aimed at improving one’s sleep and exercise habits within the context of how it would help the participant quit smoking. Messages were not tailored based on quitting stage (e.g., Pre-Quit vs. Early Quit) nor were Text Buddy and Text Crave components available to this group.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The main limitation of the study is its small sample size. Also, it is unclear how young adult smokers recruited on Craigslist compared with young adult smokers who would be recruited through other ways.</limitations_and_caveats>
