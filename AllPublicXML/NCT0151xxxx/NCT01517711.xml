  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a six-week pilot study testing the efficacy of tramadol extended-release (ER) for
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Men and women aged 21-55 years with combat-related PTSD
      (n = more than 20) or PTSD resulting from a civilian trauma (n = fewer than 20) will be
      recruited. Blinded tramadol ER will begin with a 100 mg daily dose for the first week, with
      an option to increase to 200 mg/day for the 2nd week. Dose adjustments, using a range of
      100-300 mg tramadol ER per day (or 1 to 3 placebo tabs), are permitted thereafter. The
      primary hypothesis is that tramadol ER 100 to 300 mg every morning for 6 weeks will reduce
      the symptoms of PTSD relative to placebo. The primary outcome measures will be PTSD symptoms
      as rated by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Clinicians Global Impressions
      scale at baseline and weeks one, two, four, and six. Assignment to blinded medication arms
      will be stratified to ensure equivalence of the two arms (men and women, military and
      civilian trauma).

    <description>Tramadol hydrochloride Extended Release(ER) will be supplied as tablets of Ultram® ER 100mg. Tramadol ER (100-300mg) or matching placebo will be self-administered by oral route every morning (with or without food) for 6 weeks. Patients will be instructed to take it the same way (either with food or without food) each time they take their dose. Each patient will be provided with 1 week supply of Tramadol ER or matching placebo on visits 2 (week 0) and 3 (week 1) and 2 weeks supply on visits 4 (week 2) and 5 (week 4).</description>
