  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel preparation is a major determinant of colonoscopy and colorectal surgery. Polyethylene
      glycol electrolyte solutions (PEG-E) are the most commonly used laxatives in China. However,
      a significant number of patients, especially those constipated patients, failed colonoscopies
      due to poor bowel cleaning. Inadequate preparation may also lead to missed colonic lesions.
      The study is based on the hypothesis: itopride hydrochloride, a prokinetic agent, its dual
      role as dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and acetylcho-linesterase inhibition make it an
      appropriate adjuvant for bowel preparation. It was reported to promote colonic peristalsis,
      shorten colonic transit time and accelerate propulsion of colonic luminal contents through
      inhibition of M3 receptor and dopamine D2 receptors in vitro and in vivo. So this study is to
      determine the efficacy, tolerance and safety of high dose of itopride, when given in
      different times before administration of PEG-E, for colonic preparation in patients with
      chronic constipation.

      Colonoscopy is a reliable procedure for the investigation of colonic and distal terminal
      ileum disease. The diagnostic accuracy of colonoscopy is dependent on visualization of the
      colonic mucosa; hence an appropriate bowel preparation is essential for the examination.
      Despite multiple lavage were used throughout the years, the suboptimal cleaning level have
      been reported vary from 10% to more than 20% and up to one-third of incomplete or failed
      colonoscopies can be ascribed to poor bowel preparation. So it is important for us to search
      a new regimen for bowel preparation.

    <description>the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS): the colon was divided into 3 broad segments: the right side (the cecum and ascending colon), the middle section (the hepatic ﬂexures, transverse colon and splenic ﬂexures), and the left side of the colon (the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum). Each region of the colon receives a score from 0 to 3 as summarized in table 1, score 0 was considered poor preparation while score 3 indicated good cleaning quality. And these segment scores are summed for a total BBPS score ranged from 0 to 9.</description>
