    <textblock>
      Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) accounts for about 10% of Congenital Heart Disease. Surgical
      treatment in PDA is associated with higher rate of complication than pharmacologic treatment.
      Efficacy of Ibuprofen is shown in preterm and low birth weights newborn with PDA. Studies in
      term neonates after the first days of birth are rare. The aim of current study is to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of oral Ibuprofen in term 20-28 days old newborn referred to
      Bandarabbas children' hospital in 2011.
