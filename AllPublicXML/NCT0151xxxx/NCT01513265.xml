  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether a clinical pharmacist using the RASP list (RASP
      = Rationalisation of home medication by an adjusted STOPP-list in older patients; STOPP =
      Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions) can optimise the
      drug use in elderly inpatients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older persons take on average multiple drugs. As people age, there is an apparent increase in
      pharmacodynamic sensitivity to different making the patient more prone to experience side
      effects. Alterations in body composition and concomitant changes in pharmacokinetic
      parameters can also result in a higher risk for adverse drug events. All these factors make
      the older person, notwithstanding the heterogeneity of this population, more vulnerable for
      the negative consequences of polypharmacy.

      Polypharmacy is a cause of negative clinical outcomes but it still remains unclear which
      intervention or set of interventions should be used to optimize the prescription of
      pharmacotherapy in the elderly patient. Therefore, the investigators developed the RASP (RASP
      = Rationalisation of home medication by an adjusted STOPP-list in older patients; STOPP =
      Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions), a list as tool to
      reduce polypharmacy adapted to Belgian national prescribing tendencies within geriatric
      wards. Content and reliability of the RASP have been validated and the investigators aim to
      further study the impact of the systematic implementation of this RASP on geriatric wards in
      a prospective cluster randomized controlled trial.
