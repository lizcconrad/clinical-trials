  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to test the effect of prolonged therapy (24 weeks) with isosorbide
      dinitrate Â± hydralazine on arterial wave reflections (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints
      include left ventricular (LV) mass, fibrosis and diastolic function) and exercise capacity
      (assessed via the 6-minute walk test) in patients with Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection
      Fraction (HFPEF). We will also test the hypothesis that the reduction in arterial wave
      reflections induced by vasoactive therapy will correlate with the improvement in exercise
      capacity, LV mass, fibrosis and diastolic function. Finally, we will assess whether the
      hemodynamic response to an acute dose of sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) can predict the
      sustained changes in the reflected wave and other hemodynamic parameters in response to
      chronic vasodilator therapy.

             ports); (vii) Insulin pump; (viii) Metal shrapnel or bullet; (ix) Claustrophobia; (x)
             Extreme obesity rendering the patient unable to fit into narrow-bore scanners; (xi)
