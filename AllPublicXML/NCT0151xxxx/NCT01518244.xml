      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of changing to AZARGA®
      from prior COMBIGAN® pharmacotherapy in participants with open-angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension.

    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, exfoliative open-angle glaucoma, or pigment
             dispersion glaucoma in at least one eye (study eye).

          -  On a stable IOP (intra-ocular pressure) lowering regimen within 30 days of Screening
             Visit.

          -  IOP considered safe in both eyes in order to assure clinical stability of vision and
             optic nerve throughout the study period.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen; 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each
             eye.

          -  IOP between 19 and 35 mmHG in at least one eye (which would be the study eye) while on
             brimonidine/timolol fixed combination therapy.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of other primary or secondary glaucoma.

          -  History of ocular herpes simplex.

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry.

          -  Corneal dystrophies.

          -  Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, or uveitis in either
             eye. Blepharitis or non-clinically significant conjunctival injection is allowed.

          -  Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in study eye(s) less than three
             months prior to Screening Visit.

          -  Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in
             the study, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause.

          -  Use of systemic medications known to affect IOP which have not been on a stable course
             for 7 days prior to Screening Visit or an anticipated change in the dosage during the
             course of the study.

          -  Pregnant or lactating.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
