      The aim of the RAPID study is to assess the rapid onset of action of the 2 novel oral
      antiplatelet agents, Prasugrel and Ticagrelor, in 50 patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI with
      bivalirudin monotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI with bivalirudin (GP IIb/IIIa not
      allowed ) will be randomized to receive 60 mg Prasugrel loading dose (n= 25) or 180
      Ticagrelor loading dose (n= 25) before PPCI. The loading dose will be performed as soon as
      possible in the Emergency Room or in the Cath Lab. In the case of vomit in the 2 hours after
      drug loading dose a new loading dose will be administered. All interventions will be
      performed by the femoral approach according to current standards. The use of thrombectomy
      before infarct-related artery stenting, of everolimus eluting stent and of closure devices
      will be strongly encouraged. Bivalirudin will be administered as a bolus 0.75 mg/kg followed
      by 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion during PCI. After PCI a reduced bivalirudin infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h
      for 4 hours will be allowed. Dual antiplatelet therapy (100 mg aspirin associated with 5 or
      10 mg Prasugrel or 180 mg Ticagrelor) will be recommended for 12 months.

      Residual platelet reactivity will be assessed in all patients at baseline (time of loading
      dose), and after 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours by a point-of-care test VerifyNow bedside available in
      the Intensive cardiac care Unit. High residual platelet reactivity will be defined as a
      Platelet Reactivity Units (PRU) &gt; 240 by VerifyNow. At the same time point, Activated
      Clotting Time (ACT) will be also assessed. Follow-up will be performed by outpatient visits
      or telephone interviews at 6 months.
