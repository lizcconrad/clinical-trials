      Phase 1 study to describe pharmacokinetics of CP-690,550 in pediatric patients 2 to less than
      18 years of age with Juvenile Idiopathic Rheumatoid Arthritis (JIA).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, oral CP-690,550, multiple-dose (twice
      daily for 5 days [except Day 5 when only morning dose will be given]) study in pediatric
      subjects with JIA aged from 2 to less than 18 years. Baseline visit will occur within 1 month
      of the completion of the Screening Visit. The study will consist of three cohorts based on
      the age of the subjects, Cohort 3: 2 to less than 6 years, Cohort 2: 6 to less than 12 years
      and Cohort 1: 12 to less than 18 years. In each cohort, at least 8 pediatric subjects with
      JIA will participate in the study ensuring a total number of at least 24 pediatric evaluable
      subjects completing the PK period.

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5: Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is also influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated by non compartmental analysis (NCA) of PK data. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. It was calculated by dividing the given oral dose by AUCtau. AUCtau is the area under the plasma concentration time-curve from time zero to end of dosing interval.</description>

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment emergent AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

        <title>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</title>
        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is also influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated by non compartmental analysis (NCA) of PK data. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. It was calculated by dividing the given oral dose by AUCtau. AUCtau is the area under the plasma concentration time-curve from time zero to end of dosing interval.</description>
