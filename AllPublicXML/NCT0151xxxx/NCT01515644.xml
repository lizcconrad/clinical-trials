  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the effect of Infant formula with added Inulin will be compared with the effect
      of Infant formula without Inulin on the Bifidobacterium level in stool.

      It is expected that drinking Infant formula with added Inulin will result in higher
      beneficial bacteria level in stool compared to an Infant formula without Inulin.
