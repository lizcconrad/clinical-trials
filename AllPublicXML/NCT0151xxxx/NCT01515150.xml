    <textblock>
      Previous multicentre study NCT 01008488 indicates that a patient with CT-proven uncomplicated
      diverticulitis has a very low risk (1.4%) of developing severe complications such as
      perforations or abscesses. The question is whether or not hospitalization is necessary, and
      if patients in that case could return home without antibiotics.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if out-patients managements in uncomplicated colonic
      diverticulitis is possible without readmission or complications.

      At the emergency room all patients with computed tomography verified acute uncomplicated
      diverticulitis will be asked about participation in the study. If They accept the
      participation, They will be send home with pain relief medicine. Every morning a nurse from
      our colorectal unit call the patient asking about the condition. The patients will have a
      visit at the surgery unit within 10 days.
