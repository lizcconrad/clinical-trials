      Background:

      - Smoking is thought to cause changes in the brain that lead to addiction and craving.
      Smokers who try to quit experience nicotine withdrawal symptoms that include irritability,
      anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms make it difficult for people to stop
      smoking. Many people say that they continue smoking to help relieve these symptoms, often
      within the first week after trying to quit. Researchers want to study what is happening in
      the brain to cause these symptoms, which may help identify new ways to successfully quit
      smoking.

      Objectives:

      - To study nicotine withdrawal symptoms and brain function in smokers who stop smoking for 36
      hours.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day.
      Participants must be able to stop smoking for 36 hours on two occasions.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve three visits to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected, as well as breath samples to test for recent alcohol use.
           Participants will also fill out questionnaires and learn about the tests at the next two
           visits.

        -  Before each imaging visit, participants will stop smoking for 36 hours. Before one
           visit, participants will wear a nicotine skin patch. Before the other visit,
           participants will wear a placebo (dummy) patch with no nicotine. Participants will not
           be told which type of patch they are wearing. Participants will measure the level of
           carbon monoxide in their breath during both of these nonsmoking periods. They will also
           complete questionnaires about mood and cigarette cravings.

        -  Participants will have two study visits with imaging studies to measure brain activity.
           Each imaging visit will last about 9 to 10 hours. The visit will involve two separate
           1.5- to 2-hour scan sessions (a morning scan and an afternoon scan). These scan sessions
           will involve tests of concentration, memory, and reaction time. Other tests and
           questionnaires will also be completed outside of the scanner before and after the
           sessions.

      Objective

      The primary objective of the current protocol is to gain a greater understanding of the
      neurobiological mechanisms underlying acute nicotine withdrawal and contributing to the
      maintenance of, or return to smoking behavior among nicotine-dependent individuals, in the
      service of developing future smoking cessation treatments. The Nicotine Withdrawal Syndrome
      is a major cause of failed quit attempts in smokers, and targeting this time period for
      intervention may help improve smoking cessation outcomes.

      Study Population

      We will recruit treatment seeking and non-treatment seeking smokers, as well as matched
      non-smoker control participants.

      Design

      There are 3 arms included in this protocol, each of which aims to understand the neurobiology
      of the Nicotine Withdrawal Syndrome during the initial quit period, with the broader goal of
      increasing quit success rate in the future.

      Main Study: To understand (1) the acute neurobiological effects of nicotine withdrawal on
      treatment-seeking and non-treatment seeking smokers, (2) the long term neurobiological
      outcomes of varenicline treatment and smoking cessation counseling at 1, 6, and 12 months. We
      will recruit 85 treatment seeking and 35 non-treatment seeking smokers for a within (nicotine
      deprivation), between (treatment-seeking status) subjects randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled study.

      Motivational Interviewing Arm: (1) To increase motivation and preparation for smoking
      cessation treatment among individuals who express an interest in quitting smoking but are not
      currently ready to enter treatment, in the service of increasing quit success rate and (2) to
      understand the neurobiological basis of motivation to quit smoking, and the interaction
      between motivation to quit and mechanisms that underlie acute nicotine withdrawal. We will
      recruit 300 current smokers interested in quitting smoking, but not yet ready to set a quit
      date.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Arm: To understand the acute effect of tDCS on
      3 large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal, the Default
      Mode Network, the Executive Control Network, and the Salience Network. We will enroll 60
      non-treatment seeking smokers, with the expectation of 35 completers; and enroll 55
      non-smoking controls, with the expectation of 45 completers, for a double blind, sham
      controlled, randomized crossover study. Smokers will be studied in nicotine abstinence and
      nicotine sated conditions, as in the Main Study design.

      Outcome measures

      Primary outcome measures:

        1. Change in BOLD signal and FC related to task parameters, between drug (or tDCS)
           condition.

        2. Behavioral performance on each of the tasks assessing inhibitory control processes,
           reward responsiveness, amygdala, striatal, BNST reactivity, impulsive decision making,
           cue reactivity and working memory (e.g., reaction time, error rate, hit rate, reward
           bias).

        3. Self-reported craving, withdrawal symptoms and mood/affect

        4. Smoking abstinence as determined by self-reported tobacco use, urine cotinine, and
           breath CO.

      Secondary outcome measures:

        1. MRS for glutamate concentration.

        2. Plasma ACTH and cortisol.

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All Participants must:

          -  Be between the ages of 18-55. Be right-handed. Assessment tool(s): Edinburgh
             Handedness Inventory.

          -  Be in good health. Justification: Many illnesses may alter fMRI signals as well as
             cognitive processes and neural functioning. Assessment tool(s): Participants will
             provide a brief health history during phone screening, and undergo a medical history
             and physical examination with a qualified IRP clinician.

          -  Be free of active DSM-IV dependence, or dependence in partial remission, on alcohol or
             any drug except nicotine. Past active dependence is acceptable provided it is at least
             five years in the past and total time of active dependence did not exceed 4 years.
             Those with past dependence on any substance other than alcohol or marijuana may not
             have any current use (past 6 months) of the substance on which they were dependent.
             For individuals with past alcohol or marijuana dependence, current use of the
             previously dependent substance will be allowed providing they do not meet any current
             DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence, with the exception of tolerance.
             Justification: Dependence on other substances (drugs or alcohol) may result in unique
             CNS deficits that could confound results and introduce excessive variance. Assessment
             tool(s): The computerized SCID and clinical substance abuse/dependence assessment.
             While recreational/intermittent use of alcohol and/or marijuana will be tolerated in
             all participant groups, individuals will be excluded if they meet current or recent
             (within 5 years) DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for dependence on any substances. A
             positive drug test for marijuana will not be exclusionary as long as participants have
             not used in the 24hrs preceding the imaging visits. In the event of a positive drug
             test for marijuana, self-reports of current marijuana use will be used to
             differentiate intermittent/infrequent from chronic/frequent users. Given a possible
             link between marijuana use and psychosis (Ben Amar and Potvin, 2007) frequent users,
             defined as those using twice or more per week within the last month, will be excluded
             from participation.

          -  Be able to abstain from alcohol 24hrs before each of the imaging sessions and able to
             moderate their caffeine intake 12hrs before each session. Justification: Alcohol and
             caffeine modulate neural functioning in a way that would complicate data
             interpretation. Assessment tool(s): Self-report and breathalyzer.

          -  Must have a urine cotinine (NicAlert) level of 4 or higher and have been smoking
             consistently for at least one year. For lighter smokers (less than 10 cpd), this is
             defined as smoking at their current level or more for at least the past year
             (excluding any quit attempts in the last year). For heavier smokers (more than 10
             cpd), they must have been smoking at least an average of 10 cpd for at least the past
             year (excluding quit attempts).

          -  Be able to abstain from smoking for 36hrs on two occasions during the study.
             Justification: The present protocol will investigate the effect of acute nicotine
             withdrawal on affective, inhibitory control and decision making processes and their
             neurobiological correlates. Previous research suggests that a 36hrs deprivation period
             is appropriate to produce robust effects across these domains (Kozink et al., 2010a;
             McClernon et al., 2009b; VanderVeen, Cohen, Cukrowicz, &amp; Trotter, 2008). To isolate
             effects to nicotine-withdrawal (as opposed to tobacco withdrawal), participants will
             be required to abstain from smoking prior to both scanning session. They will be
             delivered nicotine during one abstinence period (non-deprived) via a dose-matched
             transdermal patch, and will wear a placebo patch during the other abstinence period
             (nicotine-deprived). Assessment tool(s): video recorded measurement of expired CO
             levels plasma nicotine levels.

          -  Agree to also participate in NIDA-IRP protocol 10-DA-N457.

        Treatment-seeking smokers will also have to meet the following inclusion criteria:

        -Be actively seeking treatment for smoking cessation and willing to engage in 12-weeks of
        treatment involving daily administration of Varenicline and weekly counseling sessions, as
        well as follow-up assessments at 1, 6 and 12 months following treatment onset.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All participants will be excluded if they:

          -  are not suitable to undergo an fMRI experiment due to certain implanted devices
             (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical
             clips or other implanted metal parts), body morphology, or claustrophobia.
             Justification: MR scanning is one of the primary measurement tools used in the
             protocol. Assessment tool(s): Prospective participants will fill out an MRI screening
             questionnaire and undergo an interview with an MR technologist. Questions concerning
             suitability for scanning will be referred to the MR Medical Safety Officer.
             Prospective participants will be questioned about symptoms of claustrophobia and
             placed in the mock scanner during their first visit to assess for possible difficulty
             tolerating the confinement of the scanner and for ability to fit into the scanner.

          -  have coagulopathies, history of, current superficial, or deep vein thrombosis,
             musculoskeletal abnormalities restricting an individual s ability to lie flat for
             extended periods of time. Justification: MR scanning sessions require participants to
             lie flat on their backs and remain perfectly still for approximately two hours.
             Therefore, conditions that would make that difficult (e.g. chronic back pain,
             significant scoliosis) or dangerous (e.g. familial hypercoagulability syndrome,
             history of thrombosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment tool(s): History and physical
             examination by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with a trial of lying in the
             mock scanner to assess comfort issues.

          -  have HIV or Syphilis. Justification: HIV and Syphilis both can have central nervous
             system (CNS) sequelae, thus introducing unnecessary variability into the data.
             Assessment tool(s): Oral HIV followed by blood test if oral test is + and STS+ without
             adequate prior treatment

          -  regularly use any prescription (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines,
             antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, barbiturates), over-the-counter (e.g., cold medicine)
             or herbal medication (e.g., Kava, Gingko biloba, St. John s wort) that may alter CNS
             function, cardiovascular function, or neuronal-vascular coupling. Justification: The
             use of these substances may alter the fMRI signal and/or neural functions of interest
             in the current study. Assessment tool(s): History and comprehensive urine drug
             screening to detect antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants,
             and barbiturates.

          -  have any current neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, seizure
             disorders, frequent migraines or on prophylaxis, multiple sclerosis, movement
             disorders, history of significant head trauma, or CNS tumor. Justification:
             Neurological diseases alter CNS function and, possibly, the neuronal-vascular coupling
             that forms the basis of the fMRI signal. Assessment tool(s): History and physical
             examination by a qualified IRP clinician, urine drug screening for anticonvulsants not
             disclosed by history. History of head trauma with loss of consciousness of more than
             30 minutes or with post-concussive sequelae lasting more than two days, regardless of
             loss of consciousness, will be exclusionary.

        The MAI who will also retain discretion to exclude based on a history of neurological
        illness that may compromise data integrity.

          -  have any current major psychiatric disorders to include, but not limited to, mood,
             anxiety, psychotic disorders, or substance-induced psychiatric disorders, or any
             current suicidal ideations or history of suicide attempts or currently under
             antidepressant or antipsychotic medication treatment. The MAI will reserve the right
             to exclude on the basis of psychiatric history not explicitly described in this
             criterion Justification: Psychiatric disorders involve the central neural system (CNS)
             and, therefore, can be expected to alter the fMRI measures being used in this study. A
             recent FDA communication (2/1/2008) indicates that there may be an association between
             varenicline and the worsening of current psychiatric illness even if the illness is
             currently under control. Assessment tool(s): Computerized SCID, Beck Depression
             Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scales and clinical
             interview confirmation by clinician.

          -  are cognitively impaired or learning disabled. Justification: Cognitive impairment and
             learning disabilities may be associated with altered brain functioning in regions
             recruited during laboratory task performance. Cognitive impairment may affect one s
             ability to give informed consent. Assessment tool(s): History of placement in
             special-education classes as a consequence of serious learning problems and not solely
             as a consequence of behavioral problems, assessed during the History and Physical
             screening assessment.

          -  have significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions. Justification: Such
             conditions may alter blood flow, the fMRI signal and other autonomic signals, and
             increase risks associated with nicotine patch use. Assessment tool(s): History and
             physical exam, including 12-lead EKG.

          -  have any other major medical condition that in the view of the investigators would
             compromise the safety of an individual during participation. Justification: Many
             illness not explicitly covered here may increase risk or alter important outcome
             measures. Assessment tool(s): History and physical examination by a qualified IRP
             clinician and CBC, urinalysis, NIDA chemistry panel (liver function tests,
             electrolytes, kidney function). The following lab values will result in exclusion from
             the study:

               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl

               -  White Blood Cell Count &lt; 2400/(micro)l

               -  Liver Function Tests &gt; 3X normal

               -  Serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl

               -  Urine protein &gt; 2+

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl

               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60ml/min

                    -  The MAI will retain discretion to exclude based on less extreme lab results.
                       After the screening process has been completed, the MAI will take into
                       account all data collected in order to decide if there is an existing
                       medical illness that would compromise participation in this research.

          -  pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. Females are instructed in the
             consent to use effective forms of birth control during the study period.
             Justification: study procedures and drugs used in the current protocol may complicate
             pregnancy or be transferred to nursing children. Assessment tool(s): Urine and/or
             serum pregnancy tests, and clinical interview. Urine pregnancy tests will be conducted
             at the beginning of each imaging visit.

        Treatment-seeking smokers will also be excluded if they:

          -  have moderate to severe renal impairment. Justification. Given that renal secretion is
             varenicline s major route of clearance, kidney impairment may result in higher
             systemic levels of the drug than intended. Per Pfizer s chantix insert, varenicline
             pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment in comparison
             to those with normal renal function, whereas individuals with moderate and severe
             impairment presented with varenicline levels 1.5 and 2.1-fold higher, respectively.
             Assessment tool(s): Estimated glomerular filtration rate. Renal insufficiency with
             estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation
             will be excluded.

          -  are diabetic. Justification. A recent case report describes multiple episodes of
             severe hypoglycemia experienced by a 51 year old Type-I diabetic after beginning
             varenicline treatment (Kristensen et al., 2008). The discontinuation of varenicline
             resolved any further hypoglycemic episodes. The safety of varenicline has not been
             investigated in patients with diabetes. Assessment tool(s): Casual plasma glucose
             testing. Individuals with glucose levels above 200 mg/dl may be further evaluated for
             diabetes using a fasting glucose test or be excluded.
