  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate magnetic resonance imaging as a biomarker of hepatic
      iron concentration (HIC). Excessive accumulation of iron in the body is highly toxic,
      specifically in the liver. Accurate, non-invasive assessment of HIC is needed for diagnosis,
      quantitative staging and treatment monitoring or hepatic iron overload.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive accumulation of iron in the body can result from abnormal intestinal absorption in
      hereditary hemochromatosis or repeated intravenous blood transfusions (ie: transfusional
      hemosiderosis). Excess body iron is highly toxic, and requires treatment aimed at reducing
      body iron stores. Measurement of body iron stores is critical for detection of iron overload,
      staging its severity and monitoring of iron-reducing therapies that are often extremely
      expensive (&gt;$40,000/year) and carry their own toxicities. MRI has been shown to be very
      sensitive to the presence of iron. The investigators have developed an MRI-based method for
      rapid iron quantification (for instance, whole liver in a single breath-hold). The purpose of
      this work is to validate this new method using the FDA-approved Ferriscan technique
      (Resonance Health, Claremont, Australia) as a reference standard.

    <description>Non-contrast MRI will be performed on each subject, at both 1.5T and 3.0T. Different MRI sequences (spin-echo and gradient-echo) will be used, with varying acquisition parameters (e.g., echo times, spatial resolution).</description>
