    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4 study to evaluate with Polysomnography (PSG) and subjective measures the
      effect of Rotigotine on sleep efficiency, maintenance, insomnia, nocturnal akinesia and
      night-time movement in bed, in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 4 of the Maintenance Period (up to 11 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Sleep Efficiency Index in percent is the ratio of total sleep time (based on Polysomnography recordings) to time in bed (period between &quot;lights off&quot; and &quot;lights on&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale Score Version 2 (PDSS2) to Day 1 of the Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 1 of the Maintenance Period (up to 7 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDSS is a scale to assess sleep and nocturnal disability in Parkinson's Disease during the previous 7 days, and is designed for self-completion by the subject. The updated version (PDSS2) contains 15 questions to be answered using a 5-point Likert scale, where 0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, and 4 = very often.
Thus, PDSS2 score ranges from 0-60, with higher scores indicating worse sleep and higher nocturnal disability. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates improved sleep and less nocturnal disability.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 1 of the Maintenance Period (up to 7 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS measures the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. The 8 items of this scale assess the probability of falling asleep in a variety of situations. Each item is scored by the subject using the following categories:
0 = would never doze, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, and 4 = high chance of dozing.
The ESS score ranges from 0 to 32, with higher values indicating a higher level of daytime sleepiness. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates a decrease in daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Sleep Period Time in Non-Rapid Eye Movement (Non-REM) Sleep to Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 4 of the Maintenance Period (up to 11 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Polysomnography (PSG) was performed for the 2 consecutive nights prior to Day 1 and the 2 consecutive nights prior Week 4 of the Maintenance Period.
Readings from the first night of the PSG will not be used for analysis as this is considered an adaptation night.
The subject was not allowed to sleep during the daytime on the day of a PSG reading. The PSG was recorded for a minimum of 6 h and a maximum of 8 h.
The sleep period time in stage 3 non-REM was derived from the hypnogram, based on Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electro-myogram (EMG), Electro-oculogram (EOG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG). Change from Baseline is calculated by:
(Stage 3 non-REM time (in minutes) at Baseline)- (Stage 3 non-REM time (in minutes) at Week 4 of the MP).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Nocturnal Akinesia, Dystonia, and Cramps Score (NADCS) to Day 1 of the Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 1 of the Maintenance Period (up to 7 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The NADCS assesses nocturnal akinesia, dystonia, and cramps using an ordinal severity scale. While a score of 0 = normal and 4 = maximal severity, subjects can also rate their symptoms with values of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5. The nocturnal akinesia score was used to evaluate motor performance while the dystonia and cramps score was used to evaluate pain. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

The subject was not allowed to sleep during the daytime on the day of a PSG reading. The PSG was recorded for a minimum of 6 h and a maximum of 8 h.
Sleep stages and time spent in each sleep stage were determined from EEG readings. WASO was calculated by:
(Time in bed (Period between &quot;lights off&quot; and &quot;lights on&quot;))-(Sleep time).</description>

The subject was not allowed to sleep during the daytime on the day of a PSG reading. The PSG was recorded for a minimum of 6 h and a maximum of 8 h.
The number of turnings in bed was determined via a postural sensor placed on the subject's chest.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale Score Version 2 (PDSS2) to Day 1 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>The PDSS is a scale to assess sleep and nocturnal disability in Parkinson’s Disease during the previous 7 days, and is designed for self-completion by the subject. The updated version (PDSS2) contains 15 questions to be answered using a 5-point Likert scale, where 0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, and 4 = very often.
Thus, PDSS2 score ranges from 0-60, with higher scores indicating worse sleep and higher nocturnal disability. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates improved sleep and less nocturnal disability.</description>

        <description>The ESS measures the subject’s general level of daytime sleepiness. The 8 items of this scale assess the probability of falling asleep in a variety of situations. Each item is scored by the subject using the following categories:
0 = would never doze, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, and 4 = high chance of dozing.
The ESS score ranges from 0 to 32, with higher values indicating a higher level of daytime sleepiness. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates a decrease in daytime sleepiness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Sleep Period Time in Non-Rapid Eye Movement (Non-REM) Sleep to Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>Polysomnography (PSG) was performed for the 2 consecutive nights prior to Day 1 and the 2 consecutive nights prior Week 4 of the Maintenance Period.
Readings from the first night of the PSG will not be used for analysis as this is considered an adaptation night.
The subject was not allowed to sleep during the daytime on the day of a PSG reading. The PSG was recorded for a minimum of 6 h and a maximum of 8 h.
The sleep period time in stage 3 non-REM was derived from the hypnogram, based on Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electro-myogram (EMG), Electro-oculogram (EOG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG). Change from Baseline is calculated by:
(Stage 3 non-REM time (in minutes) at Baseline)- (Stage 3 non-REM time (in minutes) at Week 4 of the MP).</description>
