  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paediatric rheumatisms represent a large group of inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases
      of the locomotion system. The annual rate incidence of children diagnosed with rheumatic
      disease in Switzerland (canton of Vaud) is 56.8 for 100'000 children. These children
      experience a chronic course of the disease impacting on their quality of life and family
      functioning. Their medical treatment is significant and may last for life. Caring for these
      children involves a multidisciplinary approach. Control of the disease and management of the
      symptoms becomes of foremost importance to minimise disability and pain. In addition to
      medical care, the supporting role of nurses in the care of children with rheumatic diseases
      and their family aims to limit the potential for further deformity, disability, and
      psychological complications. In particular, they play a key role in supporting the specialist
      team caring for patients with rheumatism disease, recognising poor disease control and the
      need for changes in treatment, providing a resource to patients on treatment options and how
      to access additional support and advice, and identifying best practice to achieve optimal
      outcomes for the patients and their family. Nurses also ensure the link between medical
      practitioner, other health providers, and family, thus play a key role in the follow-up care
      of the child and its family. Follow-up of children and their family can be ensured by regular
      telephone consultation (telenursing) made by experienced nurse specialists in rheumatology.
      However, the effectiveness of telenursing remains to be proven in children with chronic
      rheumatic diseases. The aim of this study is, therefore, to evaluate the effect of a
      telephone nursing intervention on the outcomes of family and children with rheumatism chronic
      disease.

      This randomised crossover, experimental longitudinal study will be carried out in the
      outpatient clinic of paediatric rheumatology of a tertiary referral hospital in canton of
      Vaud. The population will consist of children newly diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatologic
      diseases and one of their parent. The nurse-led intervention will consist of providing a
      monthly telephone call by a qualified and experienced nurse specialist in paediatric
      rheumatology and TN to ensure follow-up of the children and their family. The intervention
      will focus on providing affective support, health information, and aid to making decision.
