  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-site randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness of Trauma-Focused
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) as developed by Cohen, Mannarino &amp; Deblinger (2006)
      with a wait-list condition in a population of children aged 7-16 years who were exposed to
      traumatic events beyond the age of three years, at least three months ago, and developed
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Primary aims are to provide evidence that TF-CBT
      exceeds spontaneous remission of posttraumatic stress symptoms and to assess maintenance of
      treatment gains at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Secondary aims are to evaluate the
      effectiveness of TF-CBT in reducing other psychopathology and cognitive distortions of
      patients and caregivers and to explore moderators and mediators of treatment response. The
      trial will contribute to implement an evidence-based treatment for traumatized children
      across a variety of healthcare settings in Germany. The novel aspect is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of TF-CBT with a broad range of traumatized &quot;real-world&quot; patients in the
      context of the German mental healthcare system.

    <description>TF-CBT (see also HThttp://tfcbt.musc.eduTH) is a manualised intervention for traumatized children and adolescents 7 to 16 years old and their parent/caregiver. The primary components are summarized by the acronym PRACTICE: Parenting skills, Psychoeducation, Relaxation, Affect modulation, Cognitive processing, Trauma narrative, In vivo mastery of trauma reminders, Conjoint child-parent session, and Enhancing safety and future development. We will use the manual as provided by Cohen et al. and available in German. The treatment program will comprise 12 sessions with children and parents (partly separated, partly conjoined sessions) of 90 minutes each. The 12 sessions will be distributed over a duration of 16 weeks.</description>
