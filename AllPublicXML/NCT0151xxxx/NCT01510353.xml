  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of using a real time radiation exposure
      monitoring device on the patient and operator radiation exposure during cardiac
      catheterization. The hypothesis of the study is that use of a real time radiation exposure
      monitoring device during cardiac catheterization will decrease both patient and operator
      radiation exposure compared to no use of the monitoring device.
