  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a spinal anesthetic administered prior to the induction of
      general anesthesia will result in reduced need for pain medication and reduced postoperative
      pain, as well as reduced hospital stay following a total abdominal hysterectomy.

    <description>All patients will receive a preoperative multimodal analgesic regime:
Tylenol速 975mg per os
Naproxen速 500 mg per os
Patients will receive a spinal anesthetic with:
Bupivacaine 0.5% 10 mg
Fentanyl 10ug
Epidural Morphine 150ug
After the spinal, a general anesthetic will be induced using:
Midazolam 1 - 2 mg intravenously
Fentanyl 1 - 2 ug/kg intravenously
Propofol 1-3 mg/kg intravenously
Rocuronium 0.3 - 0.9mg/kg intravenously
followed by endotracheal intubation. Maintenance of anesthesia with sevoflurane, oxygen and air.
Intraoperative Morphine 0 - 0.3mg/kg or Fentanyl 0 - 7.5ug/kg to maintain MAP and heart rate within 20% of baseline.
Phenylephrine and Ephedrine can be used to support blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of baseline.
Dexamethasone 4mg and Ondansetron 4mg intravenously
Neostigmine 3mg and Glycopyrrolate 0.6mg intravenously Patients will receive a Morphine PCA to be initiated in the Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU).</description>
