    <textblock>
      The investigators tested whether pain decrease can be observed centrally with non-invasive
      brain imaging in CBP subjects receiving Lidoderm. The investigators first tested effects of
      5% Lidoderm patched in an open labelled trial. Next the investigators compared the effects of
      Lidocaine versus Placebo patches. Three time points were evaluated: baseline (before
      treatment) and 6 hours and 2 weeks after treatment. The latter trial was a 2 arm, double
      blind, placebo controlled trial, where participants either received Lidoderm or placebo
      patches, without cross over.

    <textblock>
      Previous data showed that Lidoderm patches that contain 5% Lidocaine applied to the affected
      area for a period of 1-2 weeks decreased chronic pain. We conducted a preliminary open-label
      trial in chronic back pain patients and found that the patients reported reduction in pain
      intensity and associated brain activity (measured with fMRI). As a next step, we conducted a
      double blind clinical trial where the drug was tested against placebo to determine whether
      the effects on CBP were mediated by a pharmacological mechanism. For this we obtained
      psychophysical measurements of pain and measures of brain activity using fMRI. Two scans
      after treatment (6 hour and 2 weeks after treatment) were conducted to observe the effects of
      short term and long term use.

      Brain activity was measured by the non-invasive method of functional imaging (fMRI), which
      enables examination of cortical blood flow during pain rating. These brain scans were
      acquired in chronic back pain patients while they rated their ongoing chronic pain using a
      finger span device. In a control task, each patient also rated the changes in the length of a
      bar n a screen (a visual control task). Anatomical scans were also acquired.

      The general design of the study was that CBP subjects were assesses with fmri for brain
      responses for ongoing pain at three time points. The initial (baseline) scan occurred after a
      minimum of 48 hour period during which the patients refrained from taking analgesic
      medication. The patients were next scanned at 6 hours after treatment and again after 2 weeks
      of continuous treatment. Subjects were randomised to placebo or Lidoderm (both Lidoderm and
      placebo patches were supplied by Endo Pharmaceuticals).

Data from 7 subjects was not analyzed due to failure to attend the repeat sessions for non specific reasons and data from 1 subject was excluded from analysis due to technical faults.

          <title>Pain Intensity on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) The Scale Had Values From 0-100, Where 0 Represents &quot;no Pain&quot; and 100 Was the &quot;Worst Pain Imaginable&quot;.</title>
          <description>the primary hypothesis was that the lidoderm 5% patch was expected to decrease pain intensity post treatment greater than placebo patch.
A lower value on the 0-100 scale is considered to represent less pain. Higher values represent more pain. Greater than 20%-30% decrease in pain is considered clinically meaningful.</description>
