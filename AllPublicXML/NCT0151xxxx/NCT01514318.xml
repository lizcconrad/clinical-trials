    <measure>Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 year</time_frame>
    <description>Standardized questionnaire used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. It assesses the pain, joint stiffness, physical, social &amp; emotional function of a person with osteoarthritis in determining the overall level of disability. The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). For each item, the possible range of scores is therefore 0-100. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 year</time_frame>
    <description>A tool for the evaluation of how a patient is doing after their hip is replaced. Based on a total of 100 points possible, each question is awarded a certain number of points based on how it is answered. Questions are further grouped into four categories. The first category is pain, the second category is function, third is functional activities and finally the physical exam results are tabulated, and based on your range of motion. The score is reported as 90-100 for excellent results, 80-90 being good, 70-79 fair, 60-69 poor, and below 60 a failed result.</description>

        <title>Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</title>
        <description>Standardized questionnaire used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. It assesses the pain, joint stiffness, physical, social &amp; emotional function of a person with osteoarthritis in determining the overall level of disability. The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0–20), two for stiffness (score range 0–8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0–68). For each item, the possible range of scores is therefore 0-100. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties.</description>

        <title>Harris Hip Score</title>
        <description>A tool for the evaluation of how a patient is doing after their hip is replaced. Based on a total of 100 points possible, each question is awarded a certain number of points based on how it is answered. Questions are further grouped into four categories. The first category is pain, the second category is function, third is functional activities and finally the physical exam results are tabulated, and based on your range of motion. The score is reported as 90-100 for excellent results, 80-90 being good, 70-79 fair, 60-69 poor, and below 60 a failed result.</description>
