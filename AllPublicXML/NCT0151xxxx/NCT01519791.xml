    <measure>Percentage of Subjects in Sustained Remission at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained remission is defined as a Disease Activity Score [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate] (DAS28[ESR]) &lt; 2.6 at both Weeks 40 and 52.
DAS28[ESR] is calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula:
0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x PtGADA, where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Joint Erosion Score to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Erosions were assessed in 16 locations per hand and 6 joints per foot. Erosions for each hand location were scored from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no erosion. Scores 1 to 5 may have included combinations of discrete erosion(s) and/or large erosions. Erosions for each foot joint were scored from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no erosions.
The maximum possible erosion score for all 32-hand joints was 160. The maximum possible erosion score for all 12 feet joints was 120. Thus, the maximum possible total erosion score for hands and feet was 280.</description>

Joint space narrowing for each location was scored from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating no narrowing. The maximum possible score for JSN in all 30 hand joints was 120. The maximum possible score for JSN in all 12 feet joints was 48. Thus, the maximum possible total JSN score for Hands and feet was 168.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study started to enroll subjects in January 2012.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 880 subjects were randomized. Three subjects were randomized in error, were not dosed, and withdrawn shortly afterwards as screen failures. Two of them were included in the Randomized Set 1 (RS1) only and one of these three subjects was conservatively excluded from any output. Therefore, 879 subjects are in RS1.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects in Sustained Remission at Week 52</title>
        <description>Sustained remission is defined as a Disease Activity Score [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate] (DAS28[ESR]) &lt; 2.6 at both Weeks 40 and 52.
DAS28[ESR] is calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula:
0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x PtGADA, where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Joint Erosion Score to Week 52</title>
        <description>Erosions were assessed in 16 locations per hand and 6 joints per foot. Erosions for each hand location were scored from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no erosion. Scores 1 to 5 may have included combinations of discrete erosion(s) and/or large erosions. Erosions for each foot joint were scored from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no erosions.
The maximum possible erosion score for all 32-hand joints was 160. The maximum possible erosion score for all 12 feet joints was 120. Thus, the maximum possible total erosion score for hands and feet was 280.</description>
