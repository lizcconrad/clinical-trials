  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of at least 1 dose of tapentadol IR
      50 mg and/or 75 mg versus placebo using the sum of pain intensity difference at 48 hours
      (SPID48) to measure analgesic effect in Korean patients with acute pain following
      bunionectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance like flipping a coin), double-blind
      (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tapentadol
      immediate-release (IR) 50 mg and 75 mg in patients who are undergoing bunionectomy (a
      surgical procedure to remove a bunion). This study was designed to be a similar study to the
      pivotal global study of PAI-3003/KF32 in order to bridge the results from the global studies
      and to show similarity in effect of tapentadol between Korean and Caucasian population which
      will allow extrapolation of the foreign clinical data of tapentadol into Korea. The study
      will be divided into screening period, surgical period, qualification period, and a
      double-blind treatment period. The study length, including the screening period, will be up
      to a maximum duration of 32 days. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3
      treatment groups (tapentadol IR 50 mg, tapentadol IR 75 mg or placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio.
      Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed during the study.

    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) Over 48 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity (PI) was assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. PID was the difference between baseline PI (prior to the first dose) and current PI at assessment. SPID was calculated as the time-weighted Sum of PID scores over 48 hours. Total score ranges from -480 (worst) to 480 (best) for SPID48. A higher value of SPID indicates greater pain relief.</description>

    <description>Response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a 30 percent or greater reduction in pain intensity from baseline to 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Pain intensity was assessed on a 11-point numerical rating scale from 0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-C is a 7-point scale that requires the patients to assess how much their illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. The response options are: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; and 7=very much worse. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

          -  Moderately or severely impaired hepatic function, or patients with abnormal alanine
             aminotransaminase or aspartate aminotransferase

          -  Clinical laboratory values outside acceptable limits for surgery in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  A clinically significant disease that in the investigator's opinion may affect
             efficacy or safety assessments

          -  Treated with anticonvulsants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants,
             neuroleptics, or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor within 2 weeks before

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) Over 48 Hours</title>
        <description>Pain Intensity (PI) was assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. PID was the difference between baseline PI (prior to the first dose) and current PI at assessment. SPID was calculated as the time-weighted Sum of PID scores over 48 hours. Total score ranges from -480 (worst) to 480 (best) for SPID48. A higher value of SPID indicates greater pain relief.</description>

        <title>Response Rate for 50 Percent or Greater Reduction in Pain Intensity at 12, 24, 48, and 72 Hours</title>
        <description>Response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a 50 percent or greater reduction in pain intensity from baseline to 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Pain intensity was assessed on a 11-point numerical rating scale from 0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Participants with no assessment at the given time point, who used an analgesic medication prior to the time point, or who had worse pain intensity at the time point compared to baseline were assigned a percent reduction of 0 percent.</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) Over 12, 24, and 72 Hours</title>
        <description>Pain Intensity (PI) was assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. PID was the difference between baseline PI (prior to the first dose) and current PI at assessment. SPID was calculated as the time-weighted Sum of PID scores over 12, 24, and 72 hours. Total score ranges from -120 (worst) to 120 (best) for SPID12, -240 (worst) to 240 (best) for SPID24, -720 (worst) to 720 (best) for SPID72.

        <description>Participants rated pain relief rated on 5-point categorical scale of 0-4 (0=none, 1=A little, 2=Some, 3=A lot, 4=Complete). Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) was calculated as the time-weighted sum of pain relief scores up to Hour 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Total score ranges from 0 (worst) to 48 (best) for TOTPAR12, 0 (worst) to 96 (best) for TOTPAR24, 0 (worst) to 192 (best) for TOTPAR48, and 0 (worst) to 288 (best) for TOTPAR72.

        <title>Sum of Pain Relief and Pain Intensity Differences (SPRID) Over 12, 24, 48, and 72 Hours</title>
        <description>Participants rated pain relief rated on 5-point categorical scale of 0-4 (0=none, 1=A little, 2=Some, 3=A lot, 4=Complete). Pain Intensity (PI) was assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. PID was the difference between baseline PI (prior to the first dose) and current PI at assessment. PRID is the sum of pain relief and PID at the same assessment time. SPRID was calculated as the time-weighted Sum of PRID scores over 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Total score ranges from -120 (worst) to 168 (best) for SPRID12, -240 (worst) to 336 (best) for SPRID24, -480 (worst) to 672 (best) for SPRID48, and -720 (worst) to 1008 (best) for SPRID72. A higher value of SPRID indicates greater pain relief.</description>

        <title>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) Score at 72 Hours</title>
        <description>The PGI-C is a 7-point scale that requires the patients to assess how much their illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. The response options are: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; and 7=very much worse. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

          <description>The PGI-C is a 7-point scale that requires the patients to assess how much their illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. The response options are: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; and 7=very much worse. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
