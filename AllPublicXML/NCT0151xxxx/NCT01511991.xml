  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine sevoflurane's dose-dependent effect on left
      ventricular (LV) function in cardiac surgery. The change of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of
      lateral mitral valve annular velocity at three different sevoflurane concentrations would be
      analyzed by using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)in cardiac surgery
      patients.

      Following data would be determined after 10 min-exposure to each dosage of sevoflurane with
      1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 inspired vol% (T1, T2 and T3, respectively) during remifentanil-based
      anesthesia (1.0 mcg/kg/min) for cardiac surgery (n=14):

        1. TDI of lateral mitral annulus at systole (S'), early filling (E') and atrial contraction
           (A')

        2. transmitral flow Doppler at early filling (E), atrial contraction (A), deceleration
           time;

        3. LV-ejection fraction (EF)

        4. bispectral index (BIS)

        5. phenylephrine-infusion rate

        6. other pressure derived hemodynamic parameters:heart rate; systolic, diastolic, and mean
           blood pressures; systolic, diastolic, and mean pulmonary artery pressures; central
           venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mixed venous O2
           saturation (SvO2), cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SVI)
