      Phase I / II, open, prospective, multicenter single-arm, Clinical Trial in two stages: in the
      first stage it will determine the optimal dose of the combination of pazopanib and interferon
      alfa-A2 in the treatment of patients with advanced renal carcinoma and a second stage that
      will determine the efficacy of this combination measured in terms of response rate.

             completion. Women of childbearing age should get a negative pregnancy test in urine or
             serum (minimum sensitivity 25 IU / L or equivalent units of beta fraction of human
             chorionic gonadotropin [β-HCG]) during the seven days prior to the randomization.
