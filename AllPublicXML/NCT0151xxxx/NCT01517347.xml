  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is one of the best, and sometimes the only,
      option for the treatment of leukemia. However, relapse rate was still the key question to
      influence the overall survival after transplantation, even in standard risk leukemia.There
      were good evidences that natural killer cells and T regulatory cells, which were expanded and
      stimulated by the application of IL-2, could mediate protection against GvHD while
      maintaining graft anti-tumor activity as a positive side effect. Meanwhile, it was found in
      our previous pilot study that low-dose IL-2 subcutaneous administration from 100 days for a
      prolonged period could be a safe and effective strategy to prevent relapse in acute
      lymphoblastic malignancy patients with high risk of recurrence after unmanipulated allo-HSCT.

      The study hypothesis:

      Prevention of relapse using low dose IL-2 following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      in patients with standard risk acute leukemia can

        -  reduce relapse rate

        -  improve survival

    <textblock>
      Standard risk patients over 15 years old(except Ph+ ALL, AML t(8;21) and T-ALL) undergone
      unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation following day 60 post-transplantation were
      randomized into treated group (with low dose IL-2 treatment) or controlled group (without any
      intervention post-transplantation). The end points were safety and clinical and immunologic
      response.Following time is 24 months.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      *To determine the feasibility and efficacy of administering an 6 course of subcutaneous IL-2
      in this patient population. [ Time Frame: 2 years ]

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      *To assess the immunologic impact of ultra-low dose subcutaneous IL-2 in patients after
      transplantation [ Time Frame: 2 years ] Estimated Enrollment:360 Study Start Date:Jan 2012
      Estimated Study Completion Date:Jan 2016

      Intervention Details Description:

      *Drug: Interleukin-2 Dose will vary depending upon when participant enters the trial: Given
      as a daily injection under the skin for 8 weeks.

      Detailed Description:

        -  Patients receive low dose interleukin-2(Daily 1×106 IU per square meter of body-surface
           area) on days 60 after unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation. Interleukin-2
           treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Participants will be seen periodically while they are receiving IL-2. Physical exams and
           blood tests will be performed weekly for the first two weeks and then every other week
           until the completion of 6 course therapy.
