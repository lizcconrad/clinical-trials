          4. Have moderate to severe facial rosacea.

          5. Have a Baseline Investigator Global Evaluation Score of 3 or 4.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mild facial rosacea (less than 8 inflammatory lesions on the face) or very severe
             rosacea (more than 50 inflammatory lesions)

          2. Patients with excessive facial hair (beards, sideburns, moustaches, etc.) that would
             interfere with the diagnosis or assessment of rosacea.

          3. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to Metronidazole, or other ingredients of the
             formulation.

          4. Use of oral retinoids (e.g. Accutane Â®) or therapeutic vitamin A supplements of
             greater than 10,000 units/day (multivitamins are allowed) within the 6 months prior to
             the baseline visit.

          5. Use of the following within 1 month prior to the baseline visit:

               -  Topical Retinoids to the face

               -  Systemic antibiotics known to have an impact on the severity of facial Rosacea

               -  Systemic Steroids

          6. The use of anticoagulant therapy within 14 days prior to baseline.

          7. The use of any antipruritics, including antihistamines within 24 hours of any study
             visits.

          8. History of blood dyscrasia.

          9. Ocular rosacea (e.g., conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis) of sufficient severity
             to require topical or systemic antibiotics.

         10. Any dermatological condition other than rosacea that in the Investigator's opinion may
             interfere with the evaluation of the Patient's rosacea (e.g., acne, psoriasis,
             dermatitis).

         11. Females who are pregnant, lactating or likely to become pregnant during the study.

         12. Significant history or current evidence of chronic infectious disease, system
             disorder, organ disorder or other medical condition that in the Investigator's opinion
             would place the study Patient at undue risk by participation.

         13. Any Patient (male or female) who has started, or changed hormonal therapy within 3
             months of the Baseline visit (this includes hormonal contraceptives).

             chemical facial skin peel or other significant cosmetic procedures within 2 months of
             the study start.

         15. Receipt of any drug as part of a research study within 30 days prior to dosing.

         16. Employees of the research center or Investigator.

         17. Previous participation in this study.
