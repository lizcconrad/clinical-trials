  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for early-stage breast cancer is breast-conserving surgery followed by
      adjuvant radiation therapy to the whole breast. This approach leads to low recurrence rates
      with a good cosmesis and provides an effective alternative to mastectomy. However, in most
      women receiving radiotherapy radiation dermatitis occur to some degree.

      Radiation dermatitis generally manifests within a few weeks after the start of radiation
      therapy. Its onset varies depending on the radiation dose intensity and the normal tissue
      sensitivity of individuals. As the cumulative dose of radiation increases the transient
      erythema occurring during the first weeks of radiotherapy may evolve into the more persistent
      erythema and to dry or even moist desquamation that reflects the damage to the basal cell
      layer and the sweat and sebaceous glands.

      There is currently no evidence that prophylactic treatments, beyond keeping the irradiated
      area clean and dry, are effective in reducing the incidence or severity of radiation
      dermatitis (Bolderston et al. 2006).

      However, together with other enzymes of the peroxidase pathway, SOD scavenges the superoxide,
      hydroxyl, and other oxygenated free radicals (Klug et al. 1972; Tainer at al. 1983). In
      physiological conditions, the production of free radicals (Monte &amp; Sacerdote 1994) and the
      action of antiradicals' enzymes is balanced. Following tissue injuries, either pathological
      or caused by agents such as radiation therapy, an excess production of free radicals is
      observed (Petkau 1986; Lorette &amp; Machet 2001). Furthermore, basal SOD is increased in breast
      cancer patients before radiation therapy as compared to controls (Seth et al. 2003), and
      decreases after radiotherapy (Ray at al. 2000). Hence, liposomal rhSOD applied during
      radiotherapy could be used to prevent the effects of free radicals and thus might protect the
      patient's skin from radiation-induced skin reactions.

      TREATMENT PLAN All patients receive APN201 and placebo at the same time. The irradiated
      region is divided vertically into two symmetric areas (left and right). One area is treated
      with APN201, the other area is treated with placebo in a double-blind fashion.

      Study treatment (APN201 and placebo) starts on the day of initiation of radiation therapy and
      continues until the end of radiation therapy to the whole breast (25 or 28 daily fractions to
      a total dose of 50.0 Gy or 50.4 Gy, respectively) (see schedule of assessments, section 5.1).

      Study treatment is stopped if radiation dermatitis of ≥ grade 2 occurs in one or both treated
      areas for ≥ 3 days AND a difference in the severity of radiation dermatitis of ≥ 1 grade is
      seen between the two treated areas. From that point in time the patient only receives the
      treatment that appeared to be beneficial and this treatment is applied to the whole
      irradiated region until completion of the 25th, respectively 28th, fraction.

      Treatment stops earlier in case of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or
      intolerability.
