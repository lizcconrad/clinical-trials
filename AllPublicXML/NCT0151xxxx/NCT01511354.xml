    <textblock>
      The need for certain components of food (i.e. protein) for critically ill children is not
      clear. It is important to have critically ill children fed adequately to prevent that their
      condition becomes worse or that recovery takes longer. Research methods used in the past to
      investigate the need for protein (Nitrogen Balance calculations), were not sensitive enough
      in severely ill children. The purpose of this study is to develop a new research method to
      determine the need for protein in severely ill children. In order to develop this new method,
      more information is needed on the way the body of these children uses protein in 24-hours. In
      the present study during 24-hours 8 children of age less than 18 years who are admitted to
      either the Pediatric ICU or the Cardiovascular ICU. Subjects will receive a standard
      nutrition, providing an age specific amount of protein (age ≤ 3: 2.52 protein g/kg BW.d; age
      4-6: 1.8 protein g/kg BW.d; age &gt; 10: 1.44 protein g/kg BW.d) via tube feeding. They will
      also receive a mixture of stable isotopes of amino to investigate protein behavior in the
      body (protein kinetics) both by infusion in their blood and together with the nutrition.
      Blood will be drawn every 60 minutes during the 24-hour period and the behavior of protein
      and the concentrations in blood of amino acids and urea will be measured. Urine will be
      collected to measure nitrogen balance. The investigators will compare the results of this
      nitrogen balance method with the results of the stable isotope method. PIM2, PRISM, SIRS
      criteria will be used to get information on the severity of illness of the subjects. Also
      body weight and length as well as body composition of the subjects will be measured at the
      start and after the 24-hour period. Body composition will be measured by Bioelectrical
      Impedance Spectroscopy. Endpoints of the study are net whole-body protein synthesis (protein
      balance), 24-hour pattern of protein balance, 24-hour urea production, 24-hour nitrogen
      balance, 24-hour contribution of arginine kinetics to whole body protein breakdown, 24-hour
      muscle protein breakdown, splanchnic amino acid extraction and plasma amino acid
      concentrations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Critically ill children with age less than 18 years at the time of enrollment

          2. Admitted to the Pediatric ICU or Cardiovascular ICU, with an expected stay of &gt;72
             hours

          3. One arterial line (or umbilical arterial line) and one multi-lumen central venous line
             (or two peripheral venous catheters) in place.

          4. Continuous total parenteral nutrition or continuous enteral feeding (e.g. via
             nasogastric, nasoduodenal, gastric, jejunal tube) with standard nutrition appropriate
             for age and weight expected during admission.

          5. No planned major changes or interventions (such as surgery) in the treatment and care
             of the patient from enrollment to completion of study period (end of 24-hour stable

          6. Hemodynamic stable condition (with or without continuous inotropic medication) defined
             as ≤1 boluses of volume resuscitation for hypotension in 24 hour.
