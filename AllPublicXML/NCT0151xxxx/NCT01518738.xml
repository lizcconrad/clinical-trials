      The purpose of this study is to understand whether attention training is effective in
      moderating mind wandering.

    <textblock>
      Our subjective worlds are built from those things in our internal and external environments
      that capture our attention. Environments can be ambiguous with respect to which objects are
      most important for our attention, and the characteristics of stimuli that allow them to
      dominate attention are thus of great interest. Self-relevant objects, such as internally
      generated experience (e.g. thought), may receive substantial attention, but research on this
      dimension has been hampered by the difficulty of measuring such objects experimentally. The
      proposed study seeks to make headway in this area using several behavioral (accuracy,
      response time, response pattern) measures, with the hypothesis that internally generated
      experience will vie for attention in a way reflected by behavior. Such research will extend
      previous work the investigators' lab has done studying stimulus parameters that influence
      attention, and as a whole may present a more complete picture of how objects and attention
      interact to shape our worlds.

    <measure>change in mind wandering frequency after intervention</measure>

    <description>mind wandering will be assessed with self-report to intermittent queries such as &quot;just now, was your attention on the present task or unrelated concerns?&quot; Frequency of endorsement will serve as a measure of frequency of mind wandering (ranging in units from 0 - 100% of the time).</description>
