  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled cross-over study to investigate
      the effect of GEn on cardiac repolarisation parameters compared with placebo and a positive
      control, moxifloxacin. Approximately 52 subjects will be recruited to the study and will take
      part in four dosing sessions. Subjects will receive, in a randomized order, a single dose of
      1200 mg GEn, 6000 mg GEn (supratherapeutic dose), 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control) and
      placebo. Twelve lead continuous ECG monitoring will be conducted from pre-dose to
      approximately 24 hours after dosing on Day 1 of each study session. The primary comparison of
      interest will be the mean change from baseline in the time-matched differences in QTcF
      between each GEn treatment and placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-period, randomized, active-and placebo-controlled, double-dummy, double-blind
      cross-over study to evaluate the effect of single doses of GEn on cardiac conduction
      parameters in healthy subjects.

      Screening will occur within approximately 28 days of the first scheduled dose of study
      medication. Each subject will participate in 4 dosing sessions at least one week apart. Prior
      to dosing in each period, the investigator will review the scheduled assessments to confirm
      the subject's suitability for the study including review of study entry criteria and
      lifestyle restrictions.

      All subjects will receive single doses of GEn 1200 mg, GEn 6000 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg and
      placebo in a randomized sequence.

      Dosing with moxifloxacin will be in the fasted state and GEn will be administered following a
      standard meal. A double dummy approach will be used to maintain blinding. Thus, on each
      dosing day, moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin placebo will be administered in the fasted state in
      the morning and GEn or matched placebo will be administered 2 hours later after a standard
      meal.

      During each treatment period, subjects will report to the clinical research unit the day
      before dosing (Day 1) and will remain until completion of the last assessment on Day 2.
      Twelve-lead ECGs including continuous Holter monitoring, clinical laboratory safety tests,
      vital sign measurements, physical examinations, adverse event reports, and pharmacokinetic
      samples will be collected throughout the study.

      In each study period, cardiac conduction will be measured using a 24-hour continuous 12-lead
      Holter monitor from the morning of Day 1 until the morning of Day 2. Extraction of the Holter
      monitor data in triplicate for analysis will begin on Day 1 at timepoints indicated in the
      Time and Events Table (Section 4.7). These timepoints were selected to cover the Cmax of both
      moxifloxacin and GEn. If no clinically significant abnormalities are noted, subjects will be
      discharged from the clinical research unit after the completion of all assessments on Day 2
      in each period. A minimum 7-day washout period will separate each treatment period. A
      follow-up visit will be conducted approximately 7 to 14 days after administration of the last
      dose of study medication in treatment period 4

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. A subject
             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for
             the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK
             Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures

          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40
             MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 147 pmol/L) is confirmatory].
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt
             will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish
             to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of
             HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of
             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
             of a contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the
             contraception methods listed in the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as
             determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to
             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree
             to use contraception until the follow-up visit is completed.
