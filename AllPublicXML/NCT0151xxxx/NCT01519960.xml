  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This parallel group, open label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pegasys
      (peginterferon alfa-2a) versus untreated control in children (age 3 years to &lt;18 years at
      baseline) with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B. Children without advanced fibrosis and
      without cirrhosis will be randomized 2:1 to treatment Group A, receiving Pegasys 45-180 mcg
      subcutaneously weekly for 48 weeks, or to the untreated control Group B. Children with
      advanced fibrosis will be assigned to treatment group C and receive 48 weeks of treatment
      with Pegasys. Children in the untreated control Group B who have not experienced
      seroconversion 48 weeks after randomization may enter the Switch Arm to receive 48 weeks of
      Pegasys treatment. This offer will be available for 1 year following 48 weeks from
      randomization. Anticipated time on study treatment is 48 weeks. All subjects will be followed
      up for 5 years after the end of treatment (A,C,Switch)/principal observation (B) period.

          <title>Group A: PEG-IFN Monotherapy Without Advanced Fibrosis</title>
          <description>Participants without advanced fibrosis were randomized and received peginterferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN) monotherapy for 48 weeks with a 24-week follow-up and an additional ongoing 4.5-year extended follow-up. Each dose of 45 to 180 micrograms (mcg) was based on body surface area (BSA) and given as a once-weekly subcutaneous (SC) injection for 48 weeks. BSA-based dosing was as follows: 0.51–0.53 square meters (m^2), 45 mcg; 0.54–0.74 m^2, 65 mcg; 0.75–1.08 m^2, 90 mcg; 1.09–1.51 m^2, 135 mcg; greater than (&gt;) 1.51 m^2, 180 mcg.</description>

          <title>Group B: Untreated Control Without Advanced Fibrosis</title>
          <description>Participants without advanced fibrosis were randomized and were evaluated for 48 weeks with a 24-week follow-up and an additional ongoing 4.5-year extended follow-up. As the study is open-label, participants did not receive any investigational or placebo treatment during the 48-week principal observation period (POP). For ethical reasons, participants in Group B had a reduced visit schedule (every 12 weeks) compared to participants in Group A through the end of 24-week follow-up. After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HBeAg Seroconversion at 24 Weeks After End of Treatment (EOT)/POP in Groups A and B</title>
        <description>HBeAg seroconversion was defined as loss of HBeAg and the presence of hepatitis B envelope antibody (anti-HBe). The percentage of participants with HBeAg seroconversion at 24 weeks after EOT/POP was reported. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was calculated by the Pearson-Clopper method.</description>

Each dose of 45 to 180 mcg was based on BSA and given as a once-weekly SC injection for 48 weeks.

As the study is open-label, participants did not receive any investigational or placebo treatment during the 48-week POP. For ethical reasons, participants in Group B had a reduced visit schedule (every 12 weeks) compared to participants in Group A through the end of 24-week follow-up. After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

            <description>Participants without advanced fibrosis were randomized and were evaluated for 48 weeks with a 24-week follow-up and an additional ongoing 4.5-year extended follow-up. As the study is open-label, participants did not receive any investigational or placebo treatment during the 48-week POP. For ethical reasons, participants in Group B had a reduced visit schedule (every 12 weeks) compared to participants in Group A through the end of 24-week follow-up. After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

As the study is open-label, participants did not receive any investigational or placebo treatment during the 48-week POP. For ethical reasons, participants in Group B had a reduced visit schedule (every 12 weeks) compared to participants in Group A through the end of 24-week follow-up. After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

        <description>Liver elastography was performed to assess elasticity and extent of hepatic fibrosis. The change in LSM from Baseline to each visit was averaged among all participants in expressed in kilopascals (kPa). Positive changes in LSM values corresponded to an increase in stiffness and hepatic fibrosis.</description>

As the study is open-label, participants did not receive any investigational or placebo treatment during the 48-week POP. For ethical reasons, participants in Group B had a reduced visit schedule (every 12 weeks) compared to participants in Group A through the end of 24-week follow-up. After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

            <description>Participants without advanced fibrosis were randomized and received PEG-IFN monotherapy for 48 weeks with a 24-week follow-up and an additional ongoing 4.5-year extended follow-up. Each dose of 45 to 180 mcg was based on BSA and given as a once-weekly SC injection for 48 weeks. BSA-based dosing was as follows: 0.51–0.53 m^2, 45 mcg; 0.54–0.74 m^2, 65 mcg; 0.75–1.08 m^2, 90 mcg; 1.09–1.51 m^2, 135 mcg; &gt;1.51 m^2, 180 mcg.</description>

            <description>Participants without advanced fibrosis were randomized and were evaluated for 48 weeks with a 24-week follow-up and an additional ongoing 4.5-year extended follow-up. As the study is open-label, participants did not receive any investigational or placebo treatment during the 48-week POP. For ethical reasons, participants in Group B had a reduced visit schedule (every 12 weeks) compared to participants in Group A through the end of 24-week follow-up. After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

As the study is open-label, participants did not receive any investigational or placebo treatment during the 48-week POP. For ethical reasons, participants in Group B had a reduced visit schedule (every 12 weeks) compared to participants in Group A through the end of 24-week follow-up. After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

As the study is open-label, participants did not receive any investigational or placebo treatment during the 48-week POP. For ethical reasons, participants in Group B had a reduced visit schedule (every 12 weeks) compared to participants in Group A through the end of 24-week follow-up. After completing the POP, the same PEG-IFN regimen administered in Group A was offered to participants in Group B who had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion. The offer remained for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit. From the time a given participant switched to PEG-IFN, he/she was no longer included in Group B.</description>

          <description>Participants without advanced fibrosis who did not receive treatment and had not experienced HBeAg seroconversion were allowed to switch to PEG-IFN monotherapy. Treatment was given over 48 weeks with a 24-week follow-up and an additional ongoing 4.5-year extended follow-up.

Because participants could switch from Group B to Group D for up to 1 year following the Week 48 visit, not all participants had reached FU Week 24 at time of analysis.</description>
