      1. Does a one-page American College of Physicians educational flyer about the pros and cons
           of prostate cancer screening sent to men within two weeks of their scheduled annual
           health examinations in a general medicine clinic result in a different rate of prostate
           cancer screening than among men who were not sent the flyer?

        2. Do patients find the flyer useful and understandable?

      Context: The use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer is
      controversial because of a lack of evidence that such screening saves lives when applied
      within a population and because such testing can lead to invasive downstream biopsies and
      aggressive treatment that is associated with a high risk of permanent side effects (e.g.
      impotence, incontinence). Almost all professional societies (American Cancer Society,
      American Urologic Association, American College of Physicians, United States Preventive
      Services Task Force) advocate that patients receive education and complete an informed
      decision-making discussion with their medical providers about the pros and cons of the PSA
      test, as well as their personal preferences, before proceeding with this test. Unfortunately,
      despite these recommendations, there is seldom sufficient time during clinic visits to
      achieve this goal.
