      Background:

      - People with motor neuron disorders have changes in the parts of the brain that control
      movement. Some tests that are currently used to study these changes are magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We don t know if MRI scans and TMS
      give the same results if done at different times in the same person. Researchers want to see
      if these tests produce different results if given to healthy adults on two separate
      occasions.

      Objectives:

      - To test the reliability of different tests of the brain used to study motor neuron
      disorders.

      Eligibility:

        -  &lt;TAB&gt;Healthy individuals at least 35 years of age who have no history of neurological
           disorders and take no medications.

        -  &lt;TAB&gt;Pregnant women may not participate.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.

        -  Participants will have two testing visits 1 to 6 months apart.

        -  The first visit will have three parts. The first part is a neurological exam to test
           strength, sensation, reflexes, and coordination of movement. The second part will be TMS
           tests. The third part will involve an MRI scan to study the parts of the brain that
           control movement.

        -  At the second visit, participants will have MRI scanning only.

      Objective

      The objective of the protocol is to determine the test-retest reliability of imaging
      techniques that measure the structural and functional integrity of the motor cortex in
      healthy subjects. Our goal is to determine whether such measures are sufficiently
      reproducible that they may be used to follow disease progression over time in patients with
      motor neuron disease. A second objective is to obtain age-matched normative data to provide
      reference values for studies examining the correlation of physiological and clinical
      measurements of motor function, cognitive testing, and plasma and spinal fluid biomarker
      measures with disease progression in patients with motor neuron disease.

      Study Population

      55 neurologically normal, healthy adults, age 35 or older

      Design

      Each subject will undergo several sessions of testing. The first testing session will consist
      of a clinical examination with measurements of movement speed. Subjects will undergo one
      session with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain, one session of cognitive
      testing, and three sessions of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, one to eighteen
      months apart. Subjects may opt-in for collection of blood and spinal fluid to provide
      controls for biomarker studies in motor neuron disease patients.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary outcome is the test-retest reliability of magnetic resonance imaging measurements
      of the motor cortex in individual subjects.
