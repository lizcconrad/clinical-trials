      This study is a prospective, interventional, open-label, multi-center early access program
      for the use of Ra-223 Cl2 in HRPC/CRPC patients diagnosed with symptomatic bone metastasis
      and to collect additional short and long term safety data on the product.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer

          -  Patients diagnosed with symptomatic progressive bone predominant metastatic CRPC/HRPC
             with at least 2 skeletal metastases on imaging with no lung, liver, and/or brain
             metastasis (lymph node only metastasis is allowed)

          -  Symptomatic is defined as either

               -  Regular (not occasional) use of analgesic medication for cancer related bone pain
                  (≥ level 1; World Health Organization [WHO] ladder for cancer pain), or

               -  Treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for bone pain (the EBRT
                  should be within the last 12 weeks before treatment)

          -  Progressive disease is defined either by:

               -  The appearance of new bone lesions. If progression is based on new lesion(s) on
                  imaging only without an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA), then PSA
                  values from 3 assessments within the last 6 months must be provided; OR

               -  In the absence of new bone lesions, 2 subsequent increases in serum PSA over
                  previous reference value, which should not be more than 6 months before
                  screening, each measured at least 1 week apart with the last PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL. (The
                  reference value time point 1, is defined as the last PSA measured before
                  increases are documented, with subsequent values obtained a minimum of 1 week
                  apart. If the PSA at time point 3 is greater than the PSA at time point 2, then
                  eligibility has been met. If the PSA at time point 3 is not greater than the PSA
                  at time point 2 but, the PSA value at time point 4 and/or time point 5 is greater
                  than the PSA at time point 2, the patient is eligible assuming that other
                  criteria are met).

          -  No intention to use cytotoxic chemotherapy within the next 6 months

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 6 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-2

          -  Adequate hematological, liver, and renal function

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x10^9/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x10^9/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL (100 g/L; 6.2 mmol/L)

               -  Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  Albumin &gt; 25 g/L *Any bone imaging techniques as per institutional standard of
                  care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within previous 4 weeks, or planned during the
             treatment period or follow-up

          -  Eligible for first course of docetaxel, i.e., patients who are fit enough, willing,
             and who are located where treatment with docetaxel is available

          -  Treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy within previous 4 weeks prior to screening, or
             failure to recover from adverse events (AEs) due to cytotoxic chemotherapy
             administered more than 4 weeks previous prior to screening (however, ongoing
             neuropathy is permitted)

          -  Prior hemibody external radiotherapy is excluded. Patients who received other types of
             prior external radiotherapy are allowed provided that the bone marrow function is
             assessed and meets the protocol requirements for hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil
             count, and platelets

          -  Received systemic therapy with radionuclides (e.g., strontium-89, samarium-153,
             rhenium-186, or rhenium-188, or radium-223 dichloride) for the treatment of bony
             metastases

          -  Other malignancy treated within the last 3 years (except non melanoma skin cancer or
             low-grade superficial bladder cancer)
