    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies how well giving dalteparin, lenalidomide, and
      low-dose dexamethasone together works in treating patients with previously untreated multiple
      myeloma. Anticoagulants, such as dalteparin, may help prevent blood clots from forming in
      patients being treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for multiple myeloma. Biological
      therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving dalteparin, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone together may be an
      effective treatment for multiple myeloma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To select a dose of Dalteparin to be used with Lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in
      future trials for patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma (MM), based on
      toxicity, selected biomarkers (M-spike, interleukin [IL]-6) related to response and other
      markers of coagulation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]),
      and time to progression (TTP) for this regimen at each of the two Dalteparin doses.

      II. To evaluate the safety profile of this regimen in untreated MM patients, at each of the
      two Dalteparin doses.

      III. To study the effect of Dalteparin alone, and in combination with
      lenalidomide/dexamethasone on serum biomarkers of multiple myeloma (MM) and thrombosis.

      IV. To explore possible associations between the ORR and incidence of venous thromboembolism
      (VTE) with serial syndecan-1, IL-6, tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), D-dimer, P-selectin
      levels.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive a
      prophylactic dose of dalteparin subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-28; lenalidomide orally (PO) on
      days 1-21; and low-dose dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      ARM II: Patients receive a therapeutic dose of dalteparin SC on days 1-21 and lenalidomide PO
      and low-dose dexamethasone PO as in Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with residual responding disease may receive 2
      additional courses. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3
      months for up to 2 years.
