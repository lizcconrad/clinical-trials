    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to see whether a tool that predict blood glucose and
      suggest therapy advices can help type 1 diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this study, we would like to assess the efficacy in keeping blood glucose in a safe
      range (70-180 mg/dL) of the second generation of a Glucose Predictive and Therapy Advisory
      system in diabetic patients treated by basal-bolus insulin regimens using pumps or multiple
      daily injections. We want to compare the time spent in safe range while using the predictor
      and advisor outputs and when the patient is not using them. This is a randomized controlled
      crossover trial. Patient will come for two admissions of 3 days, one with the DIAdvisor
      system fully activated, and one with the prediction and advice features disabled.

    <description>Glucose predictions and therapy advices will be displayed to the patient. Patients will be asked to follow the advices suggested by DIAdvisor system according to their own judgement. Patient will decide his need of insulin according to the results given by the HemoCue glucometer, CGM trends, glucose predictions as well as therapy advices. In case of any doubt with the predictions displayed or the advices suggested, the patients will be invited to ask study personal and/or the study physician for help.</description>
