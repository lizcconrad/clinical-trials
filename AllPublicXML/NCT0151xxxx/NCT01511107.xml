  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study whether, in young children with acute otitis media (AOM),
      shortening length of antibiotic treatment as a strategy for reducing antimicrobial resistance
      provides satisfactory clinical outcome. This is a Phase 2b multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 600 children aged 6 through 23 months
      comparing the efficacy of consistent reduced-duration antimicrobial treatment (5 days) with
      that of consistent standard-duration treatment (10 days) for each episode of AOM developing
      during a single respiratory season (October 1 through May 31).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be randomized at the enrollment visit and will have a telephone call
      in the course of therapy, and a subsequent visit at the end of therapy. Thereafter, they will
      be followed through the end of the respiratory season, and their parents will be encouraged
      to bring their child when concerned about a potential recurrence of AOM. At each recurrence
      subjects will receive the treatment regimen (either standard- or reduced-duration) to which
      they were randomized at study entry (consistent treatment strategy).

      The recruitment of eligible children with AOM of varying degrees of severity from various
      primary care practices in 2 separate geographic regions, i.e. Western Pennsylvania and
      Kentucky, representing urban, suburban and rural demographics will enhance generalizability
      of study findings and encourage translation to clinical practice.

TF is defined as substantial persistence or worsening of symptoms specifically attributable to AOM, or of otoscopic signs of AOM, after 72 hours from the time of randomization, such that additional antimicrobial therapy is deemed advisable. If a parent/legal guardian is unwilling to continue the assigned study product regimen, the participant will be categorized as TF. Should a participant be administered another systemic antibiotic while taking study medication or prior to Day 16, the participant will be considered a TF. Clinical success is defined as complete or substantial resolution of symptoms specifically attributable to AOM for 48 hours and of otoscopic signs of acute inflammation (bulging of the tympanic membrane (TM) or intense erythema), with or without persistence of middle-ear effusion, such that no additional antibiotic therapy is deemed advisable.</description>

    <description>The AOM-SOS scale measures seven discrete items: tugging of ears, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, diminished activity, diminished appetite, and fever. The parent rated each of these symptoms in comparison with the child's usual state, as &quot;none,&quot; &quot;a little,&quot; or &quot;a lot,&quot; with corresponding scores of 0, 1, and 2, and recorded the ratings in a diary. Each set of ratings was summed to obtain an AOM-SOS score as a measure of symptom burden. Total scores range from 0 to 14, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. For instances in which the participant was declared a treatment failure, scores are included up to, but not including the day of the failure. Otherwise, scores day 6 to day 14 are included.</description>

          <title>Acute Otitis Media Severity of Symptoms (AOM-SOS) Score</title>
          <description>The AOM-SOS scale measures seven discrete items: tugging of ears, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, diminished activity, diminished appetite, and fever. Parents are asked to rate these symptoms in comparison with the child’s usual state, as “none,” “a little,” or “a lot,” with corresponding scores of 0, 1, and 2. Thus, total scores range from 0 to 14, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. Children must have at least a total score of 3 at enrollment to qualify for the study.</description>

          <description>Susceptibility to penicillin was determined as follows: When minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was available , susceptible was defined as MIC &lt;0.1 µg/mL, intermediate as MIC 0.1 to 1 µg/mL, and resistant as MIC &gt;1 µg/mL. When MIC was not available, susceptible was defined as showing oxacillin disk zone size &gt;20 mm, intermediate as zone size 9 to 20 mm, and resistant as zone size ≤8 mm.</description>

        <description>Proportion of children initially diagnosed with AOM who experience treatment failure at or before the day 12-14 visit.
TF is defined as substantial persistence or worsening of symptoms specifically attributable to AOM, or of otoscopic signs of AOM, after 72 hours from the time of randomization, such that additional antimicrobial therapy is deemed advisable. If a parent/legal guardian is unwilling to continue the assigned study product regimen, the participant will be categorized as TF. Should a participant be administered another systemic antibiotic while taking study medication or prior to Day 16, the participant will be considered a TF. Clinical success is defined as complete or substantial resolution of symptoms specifically attributable to AOM for 48 hours and of otoscopic signs of acute inflammation (bulging of the tympanic membrane (TM) or intense erythema), with or without persistence of middle-ear effusion, such that no additional antibiotic therapy is deemed advisable.</description>

        <title>The Distribution of Children With a Nasopharyngeal (NP) Culture at Enrollment That is Negative for AOM Pathogens in Which the Follow-up NP Culture at Day 12-14 Yields a Nonsusceptible Pathogen</title>
        <description>AOM pathogens are defined as Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pn) or Haemophilus Influenzae (H flu). In the case of S pn, susceptibility to penicillin was determined as follows: When minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was available, susceptible was defined as MIC &lt;0.1 µg/mL, intermediate as MIC 0.1 to 1 µg/mL, and resistant as MIC &gt;1 µg/mL. When MIC was not available, susceptible was defined as showing oxacillin disk zone size &gt;20 mm, intermediate as zone size 9 to 20 mm, and resistant as zone size ≤8 mm. In the case of H flu, susceptible was defined as beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin E test MIC ≤1 µg/mL; nonsusceptible was defined as either beta-lactamase-positive or beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin E test MIC &gt;1 µg/mL.</description>

        <description>AOM pathogens are defined as Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pn) or Haemophilus Influenzae (H flu). In the case of S pn, susceptibility to penicillin was determined as follows: When minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was available, susceptible was defined as MIC &lt;0.1 µg/mL, intermediate as MIC 0.1 to 1 µg/mL, and resistant as MIC &gt;1 µg/mL. When MIC was not available, susceptible was defined as showing oxacillin disk zone size &gt;20 mm, intermediate as zone size 9 to 20 mm, and resistant as zone size ≤8 mm. In the case of H flu, susceptible was defined as beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin E test MIC ≤1 µg/mL; nonsusceptible was defined as either beta-lactamase-positive or beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin E test MIC &gt;1 µg/mL.</description>

        <description>An episode of AOM occurring after Day 16 will be considered a recurrence. Subjects seen after day 10 and categorized as clinical success who return for an interim/sick visit before day 17 and are found to have AOM will be categorized as a relapse.

The rate, expressed as a monthly rate, is calculated by dividing the total number of recurrences and relapses within 60 days of enrollment by the number of months of follow-up within 60 days of enrollment.</description>

        <description>The AOM-SOS scale measures seven discrete items: tugging of ears, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, diminished activity, diminished appetite, and fever. The parent rated each of these symptoms in comparison with the child's usual state, as &quot;none,&quot; &quot;a little,&quot; or &quot;a lot,&quot; with corresponding scores of 0, 1, and 2, and recorded the ratings in a diary. Each set of ratings was summed to obtain an AOM-SOS score as a measure of symptom burden. Total scores range from 0 to 14, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. For instances in which the participant was declared a treatment failure, scores are included up to, but not including the day of the failure. Otherwise, scores day 6 to day 14 are included.</description>
