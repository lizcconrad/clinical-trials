  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal death in the developing world. An
      important strategy in the prevention of deaths is the use of uterotonic drugs for PPH
      prophylaxis. Misoprostol has been recognized as an option for preventing PPH as it is
      economical, heat stable, has a long shelf-life, and can be taken orally.

      The investigators envisage that the use of self administered misoprostol after home births
      among mothers would be associated with a peri-partum fall in hemoglobin value of over 20%
      (the outcome of a fall of 2g/dl will also be tested in the pilot).

      The objective of the main study will be to assess the effectiveness and safety of antenatal
      administration of misoprostol tablets (600mcg) for self administration immediately following
      home delivery for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage. The objectives of the pilot study
      are to test the integrity of the study protocol, to test the randomization procedure, to
      assess the acceptability of the intervention, to test the logistics of follow-up, to test the
      data collection forms, to validate the quality of life questionnaire in this population and
      to determine the recruitment rate to help study planning.

    <description>To assess the safety of ante-natal distribution of misoprostol and its use by women at the time of their home birth, data will be collected on the number of women who report experiencing side effects (including shivering and fever), number of women who are transferred to higher level care, number of women who undergo surgical interventions, number of women who are given blood transfusions, number of maternal deaths, and number of neonatal deaths.
The exact outcomes as well as the power calculations will only be finalized once the pilot study is completed.</description>
