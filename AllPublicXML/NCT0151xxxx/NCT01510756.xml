      This is a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the activity of sorafenib in relapsed or refractory CLL
      patients with an iwCLL-WG indication to receive therapy.

      Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor, which targets the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling
      pathway as well as several receptor tyrosine kinases. It is FDA approved for the treatment of
      hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Preclinical studies in the investigators
      laboratory demonstrated that sorafenib is cytotoxic to CLL cells.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the overall response rate of Sorafenib in
      previously treated CLL patients. All patients will receive sorafenib at 400 mg twice daily
      continuously for three months and then assessed for response. Responding patients may elect
      to continue on treatment for an additional 9 months.

      The UCSD Moores Cancer is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the activity of
      sorafenib in relapsed or refractory CLL patients.

      Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation
      and tumor angiogenesis. It was initially selected based on inhibition of the serine/threonine
      kinases Raf-1 and wild-type B-Raf, which are pivotal components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
      signaling pathway. CLL cells derive survival support from their microenvironment, in part by
      activation of this pathway. Preclinical studies performed in our lab demonstrated that
      sorafenib was cytotoxic to CLL cells, including those from patients with more aggressive
      disease and from patients with chemotherapy (fludarabine) resistant disease.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate for evidence of anti-leukemic activity / clinical
      activity of sorafenib by assessing decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)/leukemia cell
      counts, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and leukemia infiltration of bone marrow and to assess
      the impact of sorafenib on the CLL B cells through corollary studies. Patients will continue
      treatment for up to 3 monthly cycles unless toxicity or progressive disease. Patients with
      noted stable disease (or better) in the absence of significant toxicity will be allowed to
      receive another 1-9 cycles of single agent sorafenib. All patients will be assessed for
      response following 3 cycles of treatment and/or following all therapy per iwCLL-WG 2008
      guidelines.
