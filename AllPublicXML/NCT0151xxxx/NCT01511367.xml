      This is a comparator study to assess safety and efficacy of Flutiform compared with
      Fluticasone pMDI and Seretide pMDI in paediatric asthma patients with moderate to severe
      persistent, reversible asthma.

      This is a study involving a 2-4 week run-in phase followed by a 12 week double blind
      treatment phase. During the run-in phase, all subjects receive Flixotide. In the treatment
      phase subjects will be randomised to one of the 3 treatment groups and will receive active
      Flutiform and placebo Flixotide or Active Seretide and placebo Flixotide or active Flixotide
      and either placebo seretide or placebo Flutiform. Efficacy will be assessed by lung function
      tests, asthma symptoms, sleep disturbance due to asthma and rescue medication use. Safety
      will be assessed by adverse events, lab tests, urinary cortisol and vital signs.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male and Female subjects 5 to &lt;12 years old.

          2. Known history of moderate to severe persistent reversible asthma1 for ≥ 6 months prior
             to the screening visit.

          3. Demonstrated FEV1 of ≥ 60% to ≤ 90% for predicted normal values (Polgar 1971) during
             the screening period following appropriate withholding of asthma medications (if
             applicable):

               -  No LABA use within 12 hours and/or no SABA use within 6 hours of the PFT

               -  No use of inhaled ICS-LABA asthma therapy within 12 hours of the PFT

               -  Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed on the day of screening

          4. Documented reversibility of ≥ 15% in FEV1 in the screening period

          5. Current use of an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma at a stable dose for at least 4
             weeks prior to the screening visit

          6. Inadequate asthma control on an ICS alone at a dose of ≤ 500 µg fluticasone
             equivalents/day, OR controlled asthma on an ICS-LABA combination at a ICS dose of ≤
             200 µg fluticasone equivalents/day

          7. Demonstrated satisfactory technique in the use of the pMDI and spacer device

          8. Can perform spirometry adequately

          9. Willing and able to enter information in the electronic diary with the help of a
             parent or guardian, if necessary and attend all study visits

         10. Willing and able to substitute pre-study prescribed inhaled asthma medication for the
             entire duration of the study

         11. If a female subject is post menarche a urine pregnancy test may be undertaken at the
             discretion of the investigator and the subjects' parent(s) /legal representative. This
             test must be negative.

         12. Written informed consent and assent obtained as per national law

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Near fatal or life-threatening (including intubation) asthma within the past year

          2. Hospitalisation or an emergency visit for asthma within the past 6 months

             laboratory tests, and physical examination that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             preclude entry into the study. &quot;Clinically significant&quot; is defined as any disease

             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study

             infection within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit

          9. Current smoking history within 12 months prior to the screening visit

         10. Current evidence of alcohol or substance abuse within 12 months prior to the screening
             visit

         11. Subjects who have taken β- blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrythmics, or potent
             CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole within 1 week prior to the screening visit

         12. Current use of medications, other than those allowed in the protocol, that in the
             investigator's opinion will have an effect on bronchospasm and/or pulmonary function

         13. Current evidence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to test medications or
             components

         14. Receipt of an Investigational medicinal product within 30 days of the screening visit
