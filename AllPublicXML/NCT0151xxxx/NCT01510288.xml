  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, and GVAX have
      demonstrated anti-tumor activity in prostate cancer. Pre-clinical studies with this
      combination have demonstrated potent synergy. The purpose of this study is to investigate,
      using a phase-I 3+3 dose escalation design followed by an expansion cohort, the safety and
      efficacy of combined treatment with GVAX and ipilimumab in castration-resistant metastatic
      prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A promising immunotherapeutic approach in prostate cancer is whole-cell vaccination.
      Irradiated allogeneic tumor cells expressing GM-CSF generate a long-lasting and specific
      anti-tumor immunity in preclinical models. Results from several phase I and II trials showed
      Prostate GVAX (GVAX) to be well tolerated and suggested improved survival. Cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a crucial immune checkpoint molecule that
      down-regulates T-cell activation and proliferation. Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal
      antibody (IgG1) that blocks CTLA-4, promotes antitumor immunity, and has been demonstrated in
      two phase III trials to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.
      Pre-clinical studies of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody in combination with GM-CSF secreting tumor
      cell vaccines demonstrated a potent synergy. In this phase I study the investigators examine
      in CRPC patients whether ipilimumab can be safely combined with GVAX. In addition, the
      investigators will treat an additional 16 patients at a dose level of 3•0 mg/kg to determine
      the safety profile and antitumor effects of GVAX and ipilimumab in patients with CRPC.

    The study was terminated because Cell Genesys stopped all activities for GVAX.

    <description>All patients receive a 500 million cell priming dose of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-transduced allogeneic prostate cancer cells (GVAX) intradermally on day 1 followed by bi-weekly intradermal injections of 300 million cells for a 24 week period. The vaccinations are combined with monthly intravenous administrations of ipilimumab. The dose-escalation part of this study will be performed using the standard 3+3 phase-I trial design. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of three; each cohort will receive an escalating dose of ipilimumab at 0•3, 1•0, 3•0 or 5•0 mg/kg. Sixteen patients will be treated in an expansion cohort with GVAX and 3•0 mg/kg ipilimumab.</description>
