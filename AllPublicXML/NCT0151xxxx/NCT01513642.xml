    <textblock>
      Although incentive spirometry is commonly used to avoid pulmonary complications in cardiac
      surgery patients, the breath-stacking technique has been proposed as an alternative to
      increase pulmonary volumes in the post-operative period.

      Objective: To compare inspiratory volume and electromyographic activity of respiratory
      muscles during breath stacking technique and incentive spirometry in patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery.

      The purpose of the present study are:

        1. to evaluate and compare the inspiratory volume during the course of Breath Stacking and
           Incentive Spirometry techniques in patients submitted to myocardial revascularization
           surgery.

        2. to compare the electromyographic activity of the scalene, sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and
           diaphragm muscles during both techniques.

    <description>To perform the BS maneuver, a silicone mask containing a one-way valve was attached to the patient's face. Once the mask was adjusted to allow only inspiration (the expiratory branch remained occluded), the patient was asked to make successive inspiratory efforts during 20 seconds.</description>
