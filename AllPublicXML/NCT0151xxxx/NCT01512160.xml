    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Score From 0 to 6 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR [6] was defined as the area under the pain relief (PR) curve through the first 6 hours after dosing. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoid rule with PR was assumed to be 0 at time=0. PR assessed on a 5-point categorical scale; 0 (none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete), at 15, 30, 45, minutes and at different time points during the study up to 6 hours post-dose. Total score range for TOTPAR [6]: 0 (worst) - 24 (best), higher value of TOTPAR indicated greater degree of PR.</description>

    <time_frame>15, 30, 45 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours, prior to RM</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was assessed on a categorical scale ranging from 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe). PID was calculated as pain intensity at baseline minus pain intensity at the respective post-baseline visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Score at 6 Hours and 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6, 0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was assessed on a categorical scale ranging from 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe). PID was calculated as pain intensity at baseline minus pain intensity at the respective post-baseline visit. The SPID at 6 and 24 hours was derived by calculating the area under the PID effect curve through the first 6 or 24 hours post-dose respectively. The AUC was calculated using the trapezoid rule. Total score range: -6 (worst) to 18 (best) for SPID 0-6, and -24 (worst) to 72 (best) for SPID 0-24. Higher value of SPID indicated greater degree of pain relief.</description>

    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Score From 0 to 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR [24] was defined as the area under the pain relief (PR) curve through the 24 hours after dosing. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoid rule with PR assumed to be 0 at time=0. PR was assessed on a 5-point categorical scale; 0 (none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete), at 15, 30, 45, minutes and at different time points during the study up to 24 hours post-dose. Total score range for TOTPAR [24]: 0 (worst) - 96 (best), higher value of TOTPAR indicated greater degree of PR.</description>

        <title>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Score From 0 to 6 Hours</title>
        <description>TOTPAR [6] was defined as the area under the pain relief (PR) curve through the first 6 hours after dosing. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoid rule with PR was assumed to be 0 at time=0. PR assessed on a 5-point categorical scale; 0 (none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete), at 15, 30, 45, minutes and at different time points during the study up to 6 hours post-dose. Total score range for TOTPAR [6]: 0 (worst) - 24 (best), higher value of TOTPAR indicated greater degree of PR.</description>

PID was calculated as pain intensity at baseline minus pain intensity at the respective post-baseline visit.

        <title>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Score From 0 to 24 Hours</title>
        <description>TOTPAR [24] was defined as the area under the pain relief (PR) curve through the 24 hours after dosing. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoid rule with PR assumed to be 0 at time=0. PR was assessed on a 5-point categorical scale; 0 (none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete), at 15, 30, 45, minutes and at different time points during the study up to 24 hours post-dose. Total score range for TOTPAR [24]: 0 (worst) - 96 (best), higher value of TOTPAR indicated greater degree of PR.</description>
        <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who had received at least 1 dose of study treatment and not received rescue medication of any type in the first 90 minutes following treatment administration. Missing TOTPAR values were imputed using LOCF.</population>

          <description>Standard 12-lead ECG was performed after the participant has rested quietly for at least 10 minutes in a supine position. ECG intervals included PR interval (time between the onset of atrial depolarization and the onset of ventricular depolarization), QRS interval (represented ventricular depolarization) and QT interval (time corresponding to the beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles) corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR interval).</description>
          <population>Safety analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. n=number of participants evaluable for this measure at specified time points for each arm group respectively.</population>
