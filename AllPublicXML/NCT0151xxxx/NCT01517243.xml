  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past 5 years, treatment for metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) has focused on
      agents directed at blocking tumor and vascular growth pathways. Sunitinib blocks the vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFr) and temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR). Both sunitinib and temsirolimus are FDA approved agents for mRCC.
      When agents like these are given together, the toxicity increases but they can be given
      safely, at full doses, sequentially. We hypothesize that alternating these agents will double
      the progression free survival (PFS) of the agents when given sequentially.

      SUMMARY: Alternating Targeted Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A
      Phase II Study of Alternating Sunitinib and Temsirolimus

      Patients with measurable metastatic renal cell carcinoma (any histology) are eligible. All
      patients will be treated as outlined below with sunitinib alternating with temsirolimus.

      Patients will be treated continuously, until evidence of progression of disease, or for up to
      two cycles following disappearance of all disease.

      A cycle is defined as:

      Sunitinib 50mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks followed by a two week rest Temsirolimus 25mg IV
      weekly for 4 weeks followed by a two week rest

    <description>To be assigned a status of partial response or complete response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. In the case of stable disease, follow-up measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6-8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic renal cell cancer with evaluable disease.

          -  Patients must be at least 2 weeks from their last immunotherapy, surgery or
             chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosureas) and recovered from all ill effects.
