  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if having children listen to the music of Wolfgang
      Amadeus Mozart (Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major, K. 448) will lessen the amount of spike
      discharges on his/her Electroencephalography (EEG). These spike discharges often occur during
      a 24 hour period in the EEG of a child with Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal
      Spikes (BCECTS), or Rolandic Epilepsy. Should there be a decrease in the amount of spike
      discharges after listening to Mozart's music, this information may lead to new understanding
      and possible treatments for epilepsy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male with BCECTS clinical history, and at least one seizure, as defined by
             the International League Against Epilepsy.

          -  EEG consistent with features of BCECTS: centrotemporal (rolandic) interictal spike
             discharges (ISDs) with otherwise normal background interictal EEG

          -  Screening neurological examination normal (by PI or other pediatric neurologist in the
             Division of Pediatric Neurology at MUSC)

          -  Age 5-12 years, inclusive

          -  On less than or equal to 2 anti-epileptic drugs (AED) [Range 0-2 AEDs]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently taking Clonazepam or other Benzodiazepines

          -  Inability to complete 12 hour admission and comply with study protocol

          -  Prohibited Therapy or Activities During Study Period: Use of computer or video games.
             Viewing of video tapes will be prohibited due to potential effect of music in videos
             on underlying process of study.

          -  Due to the confounding factor of probably suppression of IEDs after a clinical
             seizure, any subject experiencing a seizure of any duration 24 hours prior to
             beginning the study will be excluded from the study.

          -  For any subject experiencing a seizure during the study, data analysis will cease from
             that point onward.
