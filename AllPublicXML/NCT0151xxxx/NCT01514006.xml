    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible association between postoperative
      anaemia and functional outcomes the first 2 weeks after primary hip arthroplasty.

      The investigators hypothesise that patients with a higher degree of postoperative anaemia
      have impaired postoperative rehabilitation as measured by standardized functional outcome
      tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative anemia may impair postoperative rehabilitation due to anemia related symptoms
      such as fatigue or dizziness. Although, the impact of postoperative anemia on postoperative
      rehabilitation and function has previously been examined the results are conflicting.

      Patients undergoing fast-track hip arthroplasty (THA) are mobilized early and participate in
      physiotherapy during the admission but are discharged early (2-3) days postoperative.
      However, the ability to rehabilitate early after discharge has not been evaluated in relation
      to postoperative anemia.

      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the possible association between
      postoperative anaemia and functional outcomes the first 2 weeks after primary hip
      arthroplasty.

      The investigators hypothesise that patients with a higher degree of postoperative anaemia
      have impaired postoperative rehabilitation as measured by standardized functional outcome
      tests. Hb concentrations and functional outcome measurements will be performed
      preoperatively, at the day of hospital discharge and during a postoperative visit 12-16 days
      after surgery.
