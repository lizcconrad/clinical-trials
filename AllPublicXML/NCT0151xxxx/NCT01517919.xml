  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will systematically evaluate a training program in state-of-the-art behavioral
      change approaches and facilitation skills for peer leaders and a peer-led diabetes
      self-management support program designed to be conducted in community and clinic-based
      settings on an ongoing basis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In phase one we will develop and evaluate a theoretically-driven program to train peer
      leaders to facilitate longer-term empowerment-based interventions that, when led by health
      care professionals, have been associated with improved diabetes-related health and
      psychosocial outcomes.1-8 In phase two we will examine the impact of a sustained peer-led,
      empowerment-based self-management intervention on improving and maintaining diabetes-related
      health outcomes. We propose to develop and test the training and program simultaneously in
      two distinct cultural and linguistic communities with which the team already has strong
      working relationships and a track record of prior work: African-American (AA) adults in a
      community-based setting (Ypsilanti, Michigan) and Latino adults (Spanish- and
      English-speaking) in a clinic-based setting (Southwest Detroit). This will allow us to
      compare and contrast the translations of the training and program in these two different
      contexts and to better refine and understand effective methods and develop culturally
      tailored training and program materials in both English and Spanish.

    <description>The PLSM intervention is designed to improve and sustain participants' self-management and health-related gains associated with type 2 diabetes. The role of peer leaders is to provide support for (1) ongoing self-management efforts (including the 5-step &quot;action-planning&quot; process), (2) psychosocial and emotional adjustment, and (3) linkage to needed health care resources.
PLSM intervention will consist of three main components provided by the Peer Leaders: weekly self-management support sessions; outreach telephone contacts and inbound telephone call from participants.</description>
