    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, 2 parallel group, single dose study in healthy
      Japanese males to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability of single intravenous
      administration and single subcutaneous administration of GSK1550188. Serial blood samples for
      the determination of GSK1550188 concentration will be collected and safety assessments will
      be performed for each treatment group
