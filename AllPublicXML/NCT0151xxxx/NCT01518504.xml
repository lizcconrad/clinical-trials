  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of thoracic spine joint manipulation
      versus a sham intervention on active and passive shoulder flexion (elevation), external
      rotation, and internal rotation range of motion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals who have a primary complaint of shoulder pain often demonstrate deficits in
      glenohumeral and scapulothoracic mobility. Typically individuals will have limitations in
      shoulder range of motion, specifically, flexion (elevation) as well as external and internal
      rotation. Although the glenohumeral joint is the primary joint for shoulder motion adjacent
      joints such as the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, scapulothoracic, and thoracic spine
      also contribute to maximal shoulder motion. Limited shoulder motion may be a result of joint
      hypomobility, muscle inhibition, or pain. Typically interventions such as stretching and
      joint mobilization/manipulation are directed at the glenohumeral joint to improve shoulder
      motion, but little is known about interventions targeting adjacent sites which may also
      improve shoulder range of motion. This study will evaluate the effect of thoracic spine joint
      manipulation on active and passive shoulder range of motion.

    <description>To determine changes in shoulder active and passive range of motion following one of two intervention protocols. Changes will be measured by examining shoulder range of motion in three directions: Shoulder flexion, internal rotation and external rotation.
We hypothesize that the use of a thoracic spine joint manipulation will increase shoulder range of motion in flexion (elevation) as well as external and internal rotation to a greater degree than a sham mobilization.</description>

    <description>The subject will be in a prone position and the physical therapist will first identify the upper thoracic spine region. The physical therapist will then cross his or her hands and place them on opposite sides of the spinous processes using the pisiforms as the contact area. The subject will be asked to exhale and upon exhalation the physical therapist will apply a small amplitude, quick thrust at end of range.</description>
