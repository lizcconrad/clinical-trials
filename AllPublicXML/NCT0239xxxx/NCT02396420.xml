      The purpose of the study is to evaluate improvement in symptoms related to benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH) in men treated with prostate artery embolization (PAE) using Embosphere
      Microspheres.

      The study will evaluate improvement in symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia
      (BPH) in men with prostates larger than 90 grams treated with prostate artery embolization
      (PAE). Symptoms will be assessed utilizing the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to
      evaluate change from baseline at 12 months post PAE.
