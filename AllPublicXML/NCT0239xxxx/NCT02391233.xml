  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will rigorously evaluate the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of delivering a multimedia evidence-based intervention
      (WORTH) and streamlined HIV testing to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with Black/African-American (hereafter referred to as
      Black) women drug users in probation sites in New York City (NYC), compared to streamlined
      HIV testing alone. Repeated assessments will occur at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months post
      intervention. The primary outcomes will be to reduce cumulative incidence of biologically
      confirmed STIs (i.e., Chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomonas and the number of unprotected sex
      acts.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 420 drug-involved Black women at 5
      probation sites located in communities in NYC heavily affected by HIV and STIs. Eligible
      women will be randomly assigned to: (1) WORTH consisting of an individual evidence-based
      Streamlined HIV Testing session followed by a 4-session group-based multimedia HIV
      intervention (WORTH) or (2) an individual Streamlined HIV Testing session alone (Streamlined
      HIV Testing), which will serve as the comparison condition. Both conditions will be delivered
      by Fortune providers at the 5 sites. Self-reported data on behavioral outcomes will be
      collected from participants via audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI). Primary STI
      outcomes will be measured via biological assay for infection by Neisseria gonorrhea,
      trichomonas, and Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common STIs found among women in NYC. Women
      who meet eligibility criteria will undergo a pre-intervention assessment. This assessment
      will last approximately 60 minutes, consisting of demographic information, history of
      criminal justice involvement, drug and alcohol use and dependence, sexual and drug-related
      HIV behaviors, HIV treatment and care, intimate partner violence, depression and
      posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) , service utilization, and social support. Research
      assistants (RAs) will schedule repeated assessments with participants that will take place at
      baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Each participant will be asked to
      obtain one vaginal specimen for STI testing by inserting a sterile Dacron-tipped swab about
      2.5 inches or as far as comfortable into the vagina, rotating it for 15 to 30 seconds, and
      removing it. The vaginal swabs are placed into separate specimen transport packaging.

    <description>E-WORTH (Empowering African-American Women on the Road to Health) consists of 1 Streamlined HIV Testing session followed by 5 one-and-a-half hour group sessions that will be delivered by a probation provider at the probation site. The main multimedia components used in the E-WORTH: (1) Narrativity; (2) Skill acquisition using simulated video vignettes that provides instruction and demonstration of core skills (e.g., safer sex negotiation and problem-solving skills, technical condom use skills) using culturally congruent role models; (3) Individual interactive exercises and logs that are designed to enhance participant's recall of core knowledge and tracking of their individual progress in reducing risky behaviors and achieving risk reduction goals; and a (4) Facilitator interactive guide.</description>
