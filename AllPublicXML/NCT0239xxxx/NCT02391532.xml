      The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a twice daily intake of
      lozenges containing probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri on the prevalence and counts of oral
      Candida in senior residents living in nursery homes. The material consists of 215 elderly
      persons (range 60 to 102 years) living in 20 different nursery homes in the County of
      Kronoberg, situated in the southern parts of Sweden. The subjects were consecutively enrolled
      after informed consent consisting of verbal and written information directed to the
      individual as well as to their relatives. The study employed a double-blind randomized
      placebo-controlled design.
