  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation clearly increases exercise capacity, but its effect on physical
      activity in the home and community settings is less clear. It may take a longer time for this
      increase in physical activity to occur. It has been stated in an editorial that it takes 3
      months to train the muscles but 6 months to train the brain. The Investigators will first
      evaluate the change in physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation using
      state-of-the-science motion detectors, then Investigators will follow the trajectory of
      physical activity over the next several months.

      This study will follow physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation longitudinally
      over 48 weeks. Investigators will use a state-of-the-art accelerometer, to analyze minutes
      walking per day as the primary outcome, rather than vector magnitude units (VMU) or estimated
      steps per day. Investigators will explore potential factors influencing this important
      outcome, including baseline activity levels, demographic variables, changes in exercise
      capacity, psychological variables, and self-efficacy scores. Finally, Investigators will
      evaluate the rate of change (trajectory) in physical activity over approximately six months
      after pulmonary rehabilitation. There are limited data suggesting it takes time for the
      translation of increased exercise capacity into increased physical activity to occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults (≥ 40 years) with a primary clinical diagnosis of COPD

          2. A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.70 from spirometry performed within the preceding
             12 months (no specific FEV1 percent-predicted requirement, although we anticipate the
             FEV1 will average around 45% of predicted, based on previous studies of pulmonary
             rehabilitation)

          3. The patient was referred to pulmonary rehabilitation

          4. The patient is clinically-stable: no exacerbation in preceding 4 weeks

          5. Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea rating of at least 2 out of 5.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Disease severity or co-morbidity that would make the patient be at-risk for
             participation this study

          2. A significant movement disorder, such as hemiplegia, etc.

          3. Inability to read and comprehend the questionnaires, which will be in English

          4. A history of poor wound healing or chronic skin conditions that might predispose to
             local problems from wearing the DynaPort. (The DynaPort can be worn outside a thin
             garment, such as a tee shirt, and is relatively thin, without protruding parts.
             However, since the device may be worn overnight, and there is a remote risk of
             pressure problems, this exclusion criterion was added).
