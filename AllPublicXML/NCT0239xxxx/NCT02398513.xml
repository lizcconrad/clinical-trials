      The primary objective of this study is to define the pharmacokinetic of Regorafenib
      administered orally as a single agent in Chinese patients with advance solid tumors.

      The second objective include the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Chinese
      patents treated with Regorafenib

    <description>Patients enrolled in the study will start treatment with Regorafenib160 mg (given by four 40 mg tablets of Regorafenib) on Day 1 of the first week followed by 6 days off treatment (Cycle 0, single dosing period). After Cycle 0, Regorafenib 160 mg QD will be administered for 21 days, followed by 7 days off treatment. Treatment with Regorafenib will continue until the patient either progresses or meets one of the criteria for withdrawal prespecified in the study protocol.</description>
