      The purpose of the COPPER - B study is to assess the feasibility, safety, and initial
      efficacy of paclitaxel administration using the OPC for the prevention of restenosis in
      infrapopliteal de novo and restenotic lesions and occlusions using a novel catheter, the OPC.

    <description>Paclitaxel administration using the OPC for the prevention of restenosis in infrapopliteal de novo and restenotic lesions and occlusions using a novel catheter, the OPC. Subjects will be treated with the endovascular intervention selected by the treating physician in reference vessels ranging from 2mm to 4mm in diameter. Following the achievement of optimal interventional results (≤ 30 percent residual stenosis without stenting and without flow-limiting dissection) the OPC will be placed at the interventional treatment area and paclitaxel will be delivered to the treated segment.</description>
