  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are 1) to determine whether neuromuscular electrical stimulation
      (NMES) is effective in preventing loss of muscle mass and strength and 2) to observe the time
      variation of MLT and strength from preoperative day to hospital discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the amendment of June 2011, a twofold study setting was defined in order to recruit
      patients not only before, but also after cardiothoracic surgery. In sample A, patients were
      recruited before surgery. In sample B, patients were recruited after surgery. On
      postoperative day 1, randomization was performed for sample A and B separately. To ensure
      balance of the NMES and control groups with respect to disease severity, randomization was
      stratified by the SAPS II score on the first postoperative day. In the intervention group,
      the anterior muscles of both thighs were electrically stimulated from the first postoperative
      day until ICU discharge for a maximum of 14 days. In the control group, the electrodes were
      applied, but no electricity was delivered.The primary outcomes muscle layer thickness (MLT)
      and muscle strength were assessed from the first postoperative day to ICU discharge and at
      hospital discharge. All patients in sample A had an additional assessment of MLT and strength
      before surgery.

      All data are analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle with no imputation for
      any missing data. Linear mixed models are used to account for the repeated measurements per
      patient and to determine any fixed effects on MLT and MRC score.
