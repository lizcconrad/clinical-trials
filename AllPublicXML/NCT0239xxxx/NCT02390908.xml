  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is increasingly recognized as a key factor in morbidity and mortality among
      HIV-positive individuals and represents an important public health concern, given its
      associations with medication non-adherence, increases in viral load, poor immunologic
      outcomes (lower CD4 counts), drug resistance, lower health care utilization, comorbidities
      (HIV/viral hepatitis coinfection), and poor health outcomes overall. Adherence to HIV
      medications has a double public health benefit, both in terms of slowing disease progression
      and improving health outcomes among HIV-positive individuals and in helping to curb the
      sexual transmission of HIV. The objective of this study is to implement a multisite
      comparative effectiveness trial in real-world clinical settings with three intensities of
      treatment to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of an efficacious, theory-based
      behavioral intervention (PLUS) in improving ART-adherence and alcohol-related outcomes among
      HIV-positive individuals who drink alcohol at harmful or hazardous levels. The study is being
      conducted in collaboration between the Center for HIV Educational Studies and Training
      (CHEST) at Hunter College, CUNY and the Spencer Cox Center for Health at the Institute for
      Advanced Medicine, Mount Sinai Health System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol consumption at harmful or hazardous levels among HIV-positive persons exacerbates
      health problems and accelerates HIV disease progression. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has
      been the single most important treatment for people living with HIV to optimize viral
      suppression and slow disease progression. Adherence to ART has considerable public health
      implications, particularly given that optimal adherence decreases morbidity and mortality,
      decreases the potential for the development of drug resistant strains of HIV, and reduces HIV
      infectiousness. Project PLUS (Positive Living through Understanding and Support) was the
      first (and to our knowledge only) theory-based behavioral intervention, which integrates
      motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral skills training, to demonstrate
      significant improvements in viral load, CD4 cell count, and self-reported adherence among a
      racially and ethnically diverse sample of HIV-positive women and men enrolled in a randomized
      controlled trial, and the first intervention for hazardous drinkers to demonstrate any
      significant effects. A clinic-based replication is the crucial next step in studying the
      intervention's effectiveness in the real world when delivered by HIV clinic providers to
      their patients. In collaboration with medical providers at the Spencer Cox Center for Health
      at the Institute for Advanced Medicine, Mount Sinai Health System, the largest provider of
      HIV medical care in the New York City area, our goals are to better understand
      alcohol-related outcomes among HIV-positive persons over the lifespan and to conduct a
      multisite comparative effectiveness trial with three intensities of treatment—the PLUS
      intervention, an enhanced treatment as usual (eTAU) condition, and treatment as usual (TAU)
      condition—to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the PLUS intervention in reducing
      alcohol use and improving ART adherence, viral load, and CD4 counts among HIV-positive
      hazardous drinkers. This study has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful impact on
      the effectiveness of ART interventions for HIV-positive persons with problematic drinking.
