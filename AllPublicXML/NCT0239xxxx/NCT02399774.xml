      Leboride is a dental support device that was developed for reducing pain during active labor.
      It is made of an inert material, placed in the woman's mouth and does not disturb breathing,
      talking, or any other activity expected during labor. It is a single-use device, each user
      receives a new one.

      This study hypothesis is that the Leboride use can reduce pain during breastfeeding, by that
      improve women's breastfeeding experience, and increase breastfeeding rates.

      Dental support device is effective in increasing isometric force in different muscle
      contraction [1-7]. In 2009 an avant-garde study [8] found in a small cohort that dental
      support device during labor, can shorten the second stage and reduce obstetrical
      interventions such as operative delivery and cesarean section. In this stage the woman has to
      contract muscles in order to push the fetus through the birth canal.
