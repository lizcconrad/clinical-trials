  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, two-parallel-arm, controlled randomized clinical trial testing the superiority of
      Ofatumumab over Rituximab in maintaining steroid- and calcineurin-inhibitor-free disease
      remission in SD-INS.

      Eligible participants will enter a 1-month run-in period, during which instruction on urine
      collection and dipstick readings will be carefully reviewed, compliance assessed, and therapy
      with RAS inhibitors withdrawn and, in hypertensive children replaced by other
      anti-hypertensive drug.

      After run-in period, children will be randomized to either the intervention arm (Ofatumumab)
      or the comparator arm (Rituximab).

      After infusion of intervention or comparator, steroids will be maintained at initial dose for
      30 days and then tapered off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal.

      One week after the steroid withdrawal calcineurin inhibitors will be decreased by 50% and
      withdrawn within 2 additional weeks.

      All patients will be followed for up to 24 months. In case of relapses during the study (see
      outcome section for definition) patients will be treated with 60 mg/m2of prednisone p.o. in
      order to achieve remission. At remission, patients will be treated with another infusion of
      either Oftumumab or Rituximab, according to the initial randomization.

      After infusion of intervention or comparator, steroids will be maintained at initial dose for
      30 days and then tapered off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal.

      One week after the steroid withdrawal calcineurin-inhibitors will be decreased by 50% and
      withdrawn within 2 additional weeks. This strategy will be repeated to treat full relapses
      during the study.

    <description>Drug Name: Ofatumumab
Why: Anti-body/antigen interaction results in cell apoptosis and reduced CD20 positive cell related activities
Procedures: methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg infused in 30' IV diluted in 100 ml of normal saline (NaCl 0,9%); oral paracetamol 15 mg/kg ; cetirizine 0,4 mg/kg IV infused slowly in 5 ml of normal saline (NaCl 0,9%) prior to Ofatumumab infusion to reduce common reactions
How: Ofatumumab IV: 1500 mg/1.73m2 at 12 ml/hour in the first 30'. Thereafter, the infusion rate can be doubled every 30 minutes up to a maximum of 200 ml/hour.
When and how much: once; diluted in 1000 ml of normal saline.</description>

    <description>Drug Name: Rituximab (RTX)
Why: Anti-body/antigen interaction results in cell apoptosis and reduced CD20 positive cell related activities
Procedures: the same as for Ofatumumab Arm
How: Rituximab IV: 375 mg/m2; for dosage between 100 and 250 mg RTX will be diluted in 100 ml of normal saline and administered at 2 ml/h for the first 30'; 3 ml/h for the second 30'; 6 ml/h for the third 30'; 15 ml/h until the end. For dosage between 260 and 500 mg RTX will be diluted in 250 ml of normal saline and administered at 6 ml/h for the first 30'; 9 ml/h for the second 30'; 18 ml/h for the third 30'; 36 ml/h until the end. For dosage between 510 and 1000 mg RTX will be diluted in 500 ml of normal saline and administered at 9 ml/h for the first 30'; thereafter, the infusion rate can be doubled every 30 minutes up to a maximum of 72 ml/h.
When and how much: once; diluted in 100/250/500 ml of normal saline for dosage respectively between 100-250 mg, 260-500 mg, 510-1000 mg.</description>
