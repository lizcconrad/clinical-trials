  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major problem in children and
      adolescents. Clinical and biochemical evidence suggests that deficiencies of polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFA) could be related to ADHD. PUFAs are the major components of brain with
      important physiologically active functions.

      Aim: Study the relationship between omega3 blood values and ADHD clinical status.

      Methods: The investigators will recruit 30 children, who have been diagnosed with ADHD by a
      child psychiatrist. In addition the investigators will recruit a control group of 30 children
      without ADHD and related neuropsychiatric syndromes. Blood will be taken from all children.

      The ADHD children will be asked to consume omega3 capsules for 6 month. After 3 and 6 months,
      all children will undergo clinical examination and blood tests will be taken for omega3 index
      analysis. Blind frozen samples of isolated red blood cell (RBC) will be analyzed according to
      the omega3 index methodology.

      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major problem in children and
      adolescents. Clinical and biochemical evidence suggests that deficiencies of polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFA) could be related to ADHD. PUFAs are the major components of brain with
      important physiologically active functions.

      Aim: To investigate influence effects of omega3 dietary supplementation on ADHD symptoms and
      the measured blood values.

      Methods: The study will be authorized by the Ziv Helsinki Committee and the Ministry of
      Health. Written Informed consent will obtained from parents. The investigators will recruit
      30 children, who have been diagnosed with ADHD by a child psychiatrist. In addition the
      investigators will recruit a control group of 30 children without ADHD and related
      neuropsychiatric syndromes. Blood will be taken from all children.
