  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial using this product in patients for the management of pain after
      outpatient arthroscopic knee surgery. This is an open-label study and the two active
      ingredients are well known pharmacologic entities.

      The objective of this single center is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Oxycodone
      Extended Release (MNK-795) in postoperative pain following common musculoskeletal surgical
      procedures. Knee surgery being the most common surgery performed in the US, the investigators
      chose the model. The investigators also want to look at the flexible-dosing and titration
      which is the common way pain managed by clinicians. This is an open-label study of MNK 795 to
      be described in the procedures section.

      Primary endpoint:

      • Change in pain from baseline (before taking the first dose of study medication) measured on
      NRS

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Patient/Investigator Global assessment of treatment satisfaction

        -  Safety evaluation with adverse event monitoring
