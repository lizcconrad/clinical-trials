      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and the impact on physical performance and falls
      occurence among geriatric inpatients hospitalized in acute care unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Having developed many tools to determine fall risk of 65 years and older patients, Angers
      University Hospital plans to develop a corrective action to prevent the occurrence of falls
      in this population.

      This study aims to assess the feasibility of a physical activity program with 3 difficulty
      levels (depending on the patient's risk of falling): easy (low fall risk), moderate (average
      fall risk) and difficult (high fall risk).

      The implementation process should be simply and fastly applicable in practice for routine
      care by paramedics.

    <description>The participant must stay out of the bed 3 hours. This pre-required level prevents the occurrence of acute postural mismatch which can occur when elderly patients are bedridden and too long increases the risk of falling.
The participant stands standing in static equilibrium to a chair holding the back of it for 2 minutes. Depending on the patient's abilities, the exercise will be done on both feet or one foot.
The participant performs a transfer activity of sitting to standing repeated 5 times (FTSS test). According to the patient's abilities, the exercise will be done with physical assistance or not.</description>
