  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) omalizumab (Xolair) as an add-on therapy through 48
      weeks for treatment of H1 antihistamine refractory chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). After
      completing an initial 24-week open-label treatment period with omalizumab 300 milligrams (mg)
      every 4 weeks (Q4W), participants responding to omalizumab will be randomized at a 3:2 ratio
      (omalizumab:placebo) to either continue omalizumab or be transitioned to placebo for a
      further 24 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Clinical Worsening in CIU as Assessed by Urticaria Activity Score Over 7 Days (UAS7) (Clinical Worsening: UAS7 Greater Than or Equal to [&gt;/=] 12, Maintained for At Least 2 Consecutive Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization (Week 24) to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Urticaria activity score (UAS) is a composite diary-recorded score with numeric severity ratings (0=none to 3=intense) for the number of wheals (hives) per 24 hours and the intensity of the pruritus (itch). The total UAS score (sum of the wheal and pruritus scores) ranges from 0 to 6. Due to variations in chronic urticaria disease intensity, assessment of disease activity was based on a weekly (7 days) UAS score called UAS7, that is, the sum of the daily average UASs (average of morning and evening scores), ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. Clinical worsening in CIU was defined as UAS7 &gt;/=12 for at least 2 consecutive weeks post-randomization between Weeks 24 and 48.</description>

    <measure>Time to Clinical Worsening in CIU as Assessed by UAS7 (Clinical Worsening: UAS7 &gt;/=12, Maintained for At Least 2 Consecutive Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization (Week 24) to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS is a composite diary-recorded score with numeric severity ratings (0=none to 3=intense) for the number of wheals per 24 hours and the intensity of the pruritus. The total UAS score ranges from 0 to 6. UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UASs (average of morning and evening scores), ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. Time to clinical worsening in CIU was defined as the number of weeks from the first double-blind treatment to the first two-week interval with UAS7 &gt;/=12 for both weeks. If clinical worsening did not occur, time to clinical worsening was censored at the end of the last week for which the UAS7 score was not missing and less than (&lt;) 12, prior to last randomized dose + 4 weeks, or the first open-label transition dose, whichever was earlier. Median time to clinical worsening was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

    <description>The UAS is a composite diary-recorded score with numeric severity ratings (0=none to 3=intense) for the number of wheals per 24 hours and the intensity of the pruritus. The total UAS score ranges from 0 to 6. UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UASs (average of morning and evening scores), ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. Clinical worsening in CIU was defined as UAS7 &gt;6 for at least 2 consecutive weeks post-randomization between weeks 24 and 48.</description>

    <description>The UAS is a composite diary-recorded score with numeric severity ratings (0=none to 3=intense) for the number of wheals per 24 hours and the intensity of the pruritus. The total UAS score ranges from 0 to 6. UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UASs (average of morning and evening scores), ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. A negative change in score (Week 48 score minus Week 24 score) indicates improvement.</description>

          <description>Participants received open-label omalizumab treatment at a dose of 300 milligrams (mg) via subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 24 weeks.

After 24 weeks of open-label treatment, participants received randomized treatment with omalizumab 300 mg via SC injection Q4W for a further 24 weeks (up to Week 48). Participants, at the discretion of the investigator, could have been transitioned from blinded study drug to open-label omalizumab at a dose of 300 mg via SC injection Q4W if they experienced clinically significant worsening in their chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) (as judged by the investigator).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Clinical Worsening in CIU as Assessed by Urticaria Activity Score Over 7 Days (UAS7) (Clinical Worsening: UAS7 Greater Than or Equal to [&gt;/=] 12, Maintained for At Least 2 Consecutive Weeks)</title>
        <description>Urticaria activity score (UAS) is a composite diary-recorded score with numeric severity ratings (0=none to 3=intense) for the number of wheals (hives) per 24 hours and the intensity of the pruritus (itch). The total UAS score (sum of the wheal and pruritus scores) ranges from 0 to 6. Due to variations in chronic urticaria disease intensity, assessment of disease activity was based on a weekly (7 days) UAS score called UAS7, that is, the sum of the daily average UASs (average of morning and evening scores), ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. Clinical worsening in CIU was defined as UAS7 &gt;/=12 for at least 2 consecutive weeks post-randomization between Weeks 24 and 48.</description>

        <title>Time to Clinical Worsening in CIU as Assessed by UAS7 (Clinical Worsening: UAS7 &gt;/=12, Maintained for At Least 2 Consecutive Weeks)</title>
        <description>The UAS is a composite diary-recorded score with numeric severity ratings (0=none to 3=intense) for the number of wheals per 24 hours and the intensity of the pruritus. The total UAS score ranges from 0 to 6. UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UASs (average of morning and evening scores), ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. Time to clinical worsening in CIU was defined as the number of weeks from the first double-blind treatment to the first two-week interval with UAS7 &gt;/=12 for both weeks. If clinical worsening did not occur, time to clinical worsening was censored at the end of the last week for which the UAS7 score was not missing and less than (&lt;) 12, prior to last randomized dose + 4 weeks, or the first open-label transition dose, whichever was earlier. Median time to clinical worsening was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization (Week 24) to Week 48 in UAS7 Among Participants Who Received Total 48 Weeks Treatment With Omalizumab</title>
        <description>The UAS is a composite diary-recorded score with numeric severity ratings (0=none to 3=intense) for the number of wheals per 24 hours and the intensity of the pruritus. The total UAS score ranges from 0 to 6. UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UASs (average of morning and evening scores), ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. A negative change in score (Week 48 score minus Week 24 score) indicates improvement.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on participants in mITT population who received total 48 weeks of treatment with omalizumab. If UAS7 data was missing, last observation carry forward (LOCF) method was used post-Week 24 for the closest non-missing UAS7 data up to Week 48.</population>
