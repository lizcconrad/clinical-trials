  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A radical cystectomy + extended pelvic lymph node dissection is considered to be the
      treatment of choice for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Despite this
      aggressive treatment the outcome is poor and ultimately, 30% of the patients with ≥pT3 tumors
      develop a pelvic recurrence. One- and 2-years survival for patients developing a local
      recurrence after cystectomy is only 8% and 3% respectively, with a median survival of &lt;4
      months. For patients with lymph node recurrence prognosis is somewhat better, but
      nevertheless still disappointing with reported 1- and 2 years survival of 42% and 11%
      respectively. The investigators hypothesize that an earlier implementation of external beam
      radiotherapy (EBRT) i.e. in the adjuvant setting, will prevent local and lymph node
      recurrence and improve disease free- and overall survival as local recurrence is linked to
      the development of distant metastasis. Adjuvant EBRT was tested in a prospective randomized
      trial and resulted in a 20% increase in 5-year disease free survival. Despite those
      impressive results, severe intestinal toxicity rates hampered the enthusiasm to use adjuvant
      EBRT, till now. In the last decade, great technological advancements in EBRT planning, such
      as intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT), and positioning have been realised. This has
      resulted in a better coverage of the target volume while sparing normal tissue (mainly small
      bowel) and in a more precise delivery of the EBRT. Therefore, it is desirable to reconsider
      the use of adjuvant EBRT in selected MIBC patients.

      The investigators plan to perform a prospective phase 2 study including 76 patients.

      Radiation up to a median dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions will be delivered with IMAT to the
      pelvic lymph node regions. If there is a positive surgical margin, the operative bladder bed
      will be included in the radiation field. A simultaneous integrated boost to 64 Gy to the
      positive lymph nodes will be delivered. Pathological evaluation on cystectomy specimen
      includes: tumor stage and grade, area of necrosis (absolute and relative), micro vessel
      density, epidermal growth factor receptor.
