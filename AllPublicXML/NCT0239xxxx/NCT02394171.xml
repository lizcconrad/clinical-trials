  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health Is Power (HIP) was a community based health intervention designed to increase physical
      activity among women of color. It was funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute of
      the National Institutes of Health. The purposes of the study were (1) to determine whether a
      6 month, group cohesion intervention is more effective for increasing physical activity
      compared to a 6 month, group cohesion comparison targeting improving dietary habits (2) to
      determine whether residence in a neighborhood supportive for physical activity helped women
      maintain their physical activity from 6 to , and (3) to determine whether this effect was
      transculturally replicable.

      Objective Physical inactivity and poor dietary habits plague Americans as health challenges,
      with women of color most vulnerable to their detrimental effects. Individually focused
      interventions have not demonstrated lasting success, possibly due to the lack of focus on
      sustainable social and physical environment factors. Health Is Power (HIP) was a
      transcultural, community based, randomized controlled trial that investigated the
      effectiveness of a group cohesion intervention to increase physical activity in African
      American and Hispanic or Latina women in Houston and Austin, Texas and then tested whether
      women living in more supportive areas maintained their physical activity over time.
      Intervention development was guided by group dynamics principles anchored within an ecologic
      model. Women participated in three health assessments and a six month face to face
      intervention that included evidence-based behavioral methods - integrated into strategies to
      promote group cohesion - framed to account for environmental factors contributing to health
      disparities. Women participated in team building activities, environmental mapping exercises,
      and supervised walks or taste tests. Neighborhood contextual and environmental measures were
      measured to test ecologic factors that may contribute to behavioral maintenance.

    <description>Women completed a physical activity group cohesion intervention which included six content intensive intervention sessions over a 24 week period that focused on specific group dynamics team building strategies to increase physical activity. A small team structure was used for peer problem solving and support throughout the intervention. Teams were given weekly physical activity goals, with slowly increasing weekly minutes milestones to gradually meet recommended amounts of physical activity. Sessions included brief instructions, team-based activities, and discussion with the entire group lead by a trained health educator. The intervention sessions ended with the health educator leading the teams in a brisk 15-minute walk.</description>

    <description>Women completed a fruit and vegetable group cohesion intervention which involved six content intensive intervention sessions over a 24 week period that focused on specific group dynamics team building strategies to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. A small team structure was used for peer problem solving and support throughout. Teams were given weekly fruit and vegetable consumption goals at each session, with slowly increasing weekly servings milestones to gradually meet recommended amounts of fruit and vegetable consumption. Sessions included brief instructions, team-based activities, and discussion with the entire group lead by a trained health educator. The intervention sessions ended with the health educator leading the teams in a fruit and vegetable taste test.</description>
