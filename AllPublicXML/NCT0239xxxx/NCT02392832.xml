  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, massive scale-up of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual
      spraying (IRS), together with the introduction of artemisinin-combination treatments, have
      led to substantial reductions in malaria prevalence and incidence in African highlands.
      However, rising insecticide resistance and increased outdoor transmission have greatly
      hampered the effectiveness of ITN and IRS because the current indoor-based interventions do
      not target the outdoor-biting mosquitoes. Therefore, new supplemental interventions that can
      tackle outdoor transmission and pyrethroid insecticide resistance are urgently needed. The
      central objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
      EPA-approved long-lasting microbial larvicides in reducing malaria transmission and clinical
      malaria incidence in western Kenya highlands.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, massive scale-up of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual
      spraying (IRS), together with the use of artemisinin combination treatments, have led to
      major changes in malaria epidemiology and vector biology. Along with the significant
      reduction in overall malaria prevalence and incidence, extensive use of insecticides has
      created large selection pressures for resistance in the malaria vector populations and for
      potential outdoor transmission, which appears to be limiting the success of ITNs and IRS.
      Because IRS and ITN have little impact on outdoor resting and early biting vectors, outdoor
      transmission represents one of the most important challenges in malaria control. Therefore,
      new interventions that can augment the current public health measures to reduce outdoor
      transmission are urgently needed. Larval control has historically been very successful and is
      widely used for mosquito control in many parts of the world, except in Africa. Factors
      limiting the use of larvicides include high costs associated with frequent habitat
      re-treatment. Now a new US EPA-approved long-lasting formulation, potentially effective for 6
      months is available. The central objective of this study is to determine the effect of
      long-lasting microbial larviciding on the incidence of clinical malaria and reduction of
      transmission intensity. Our hypothesis is that addition of long-lasting microbial larviciding
      to ongoing ITN and IRS programs will lead to significant reductions in both indoor and
      outdoor malaria transmission and malaria incidence.

    <description>Human population for each site stratified into three age groups, under 5 years, 6-15 years and &gt;15 years, will be ascertained from our existing demographic database. Age group level aggregate morbidity data with number of clinical malaria cases without any identifiers will be obtained from local hospitals and clinics where the study residents seek treatment. This data is reported to the Ministry of Health of Kenya and hence, is publicly available.</description>

    <description>Malaria vector abundance is measured by the total density of An. gambiae, An. arabiensis, An. funestus and other Anopheles species capable of transmitting malaria, collected indoors and outdoors by the CO2-baited CDC light trap, 64 trap nights in each of indoor and outdoor environments per site per month. Malaria transmission intensity is measured by the sum of indoor and outdoor entomological inoculation rate (EIR).</description>

    <description>In 2015: Two sites each in Kakamega and Vihiga counties in western Kenya will be randomly selected and treated with larvicides (intervention) and the other two sites will serve as control (no-intervention). Temporary habitats will be treated with FourStar® controlled release granule formulation, semi-permanent habitats will be treated with 90 day briquettes, and permanent habitats with 180 day briquettes. No retreatment.
Starts from 2016, fourteen sites in each of the two study sites will be assigned to treatment or control by a block randomization method. The Bti treatment will be the same as in 2015. The retreatment interval will be 4-5 months. After the third treatment, no treatment will be performed for the next 8 months. After this, a cross over will be performed. Previous control sites will receive 3 rounds of the same LLML treatment at appropriate time intervals and previous treatment sites will not receive any LLMLs.</description>
