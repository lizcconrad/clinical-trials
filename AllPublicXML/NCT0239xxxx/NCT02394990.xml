  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised controlled trial of a new brief intervention with young (16-29)
      adult male patients who have a facial injury sustained as a result of interpersonal violence
      (fighting or assaults). It will be undertaken at the Maxillofacial outpatient trauma clinic
      at the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow. The major risk factors associated with facial
      injury in Scotland are male gender, young age, interpersonal violence and alcohol. Previous
      research with facial injury patients attending this clinic has shown that an Alcohol Brief
      Intervention (ABI) is effective in helping reduce alcohol consumption, so all patients are
      now offered ABI as standard practice. ABI is delivered by trained nurses from Addiction
      Services. This will not be withdrawn. In addition we wish to offer some patients a Violence
      Brief Intervention (VBI). This will be delivered by the same nurses who deliver the ABI. The
      study is randomised so only those selected at random will receive this extra intervention and
      all others will receive treatment as normal (ABI only). VBI is a short psychological
      intervention which uses Brief Motivational Interviewing (BMI) to encourage reflection of
      involvement in violence and consideration of strategies to avoid future violence. The
      intervention also compares participants' attitudes towards violence to those of their peers.
      The intervention takes about 15 minutes, and patients will be involved for an additional
      30-45 minutes longer than normal when they attend the clinic, including consent and baseline
      data collection. Patients will be followed up by telephone at 1, 3 and 6 months, and asked a
      suite of questions which will take approximately 15 minutes on each occasion. We wish to
      determine whether a VBI of this type has any effect on attitudes to violence or propensity
      for involvement in violence or on reinjury, examined through self report measures and
      routinely collected health and criminal justice data at 12 months post intervention.
