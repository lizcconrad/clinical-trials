    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential molecule in the body that decreases with aging and causes
      reductions in vascular, movement (&quot;motor&quot;) and cognitive functions. This study will determine
      if daily oral supplementation (3 months) with a compound that increases NO in the body, i.e.,
      sodium nitrite, improves vascular, motor and cognitive function in older adults. The project
      also seeks to provide insight into the biological reasons (mechanisms) by which
      supplementation with sodium nitrite improves physiological function in older adults. Overall,
      this research will provide scientific evidence supporting the use of sodium nitrite for
      preserving physiological function and preventing clinical disease and disability with aging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Age 60-79 years. Women will be confirmed as postmenopausal (either natural or
             surgical) based on cessation of menses for &gt;1 year.

               -  Ability to provide informed consent

               -  Score &gt;22 on the mini mental state exam (MMSE) to allow a broad range of normal
                  and mildly-impaired cognitive abilities, but function adequate to understand and
                  complete trials (214)

               -  Baseline brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) &lt; 7%Δ (rationale: non-invasive
                  screening to ensure exclusion of subjects with exceptionally high baseline
                  endothelial function(215))

               -  Blood pressure (BP) &gt;100/60 mmHg for past 3 mo (rationale: blood pressure below
                  100/60 mmHg may elevate the normally small risk of hypotension with sodium
                  nitrite treatment)

               -  Ability to perform motor and cognitive tests (e.g., can rise from a chair, walk
                  for 2 min, climb 10 stairs)

               -  Willing to accept random assignment to condition (older adults)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • High dietary nitrate intake or current nitrite supplementation; hypersensitivity to
             nitrates or nitrites

               -  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or blood methemoglobin &gt;2%

               -  Current smoking

               -  Having past or present alcohol dependence or abuse, as defined by the American
                  Psychiatry Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

               -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2 (FMD measurements can be inaccurate in severely
                  obese patients)

               -  Chronic clinical diseases (e.g., coronary artery/peripheral
                  artery/cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney disease requiring
                  dialysis, neurological disorders or diseases that may affect motor/cognitive
                  functions [multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, polio, Alzheimer's disease,
                  dementia or other brain diseases of aging]), except hypertension and
                  hyperlipidemia.

               -  Regular vigorous aerobic/endurance exercise (&gt;3 vigorous bouts/week)

               -  Not weight stable in the prior 3 months (&gt;2 kg weight change) or unwilling to
                  remain weight stable throughout study (rationale: recent weight change or weight
                  loss can influence vascular function and small metabolite signature(216))

               -  Current treatment or recent cessation (&lt; 3 mo) of hormone replacement therapy.

               -  Moderate or severe peripheral artery disease (ankle-brachial index &lt;0.7)(183)

               -  A graded exercise test will be performed by all subjects, if there is physician
                  concern or an adverse event, the subject will not participate in a maximal oxygen
                  consumption test (this will be determined in accordance with stated
                  contraindications for exercise testing provided by the American Heart
                  Association)(217)

               -  Claustrophobia, metal implants, etc., affecting feasibility and/or safety of the
                  fMRI scanning.
