  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown poor immune response to conventional influenza vaccines in
      HIV-infected individuals. This study was conducted expecting the more potent immunogenicity
      of intradermal vaccine compared with conventional intramuscular vaccine in HIV-infected
      adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the 2011/2012 pre-influenza season, three vaccines were used in HIV-infected adults
      (18 to 60 years): inactivated intramuscular vaccine (Agripal), reduced-content intradermal
      vaccine (IDflu9μg) and standard-content intradermal vaccine (IDflu15μg). Serum
      hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies and INF-γ ELISpot assay were measured at the time
      of vaccination and 1 month after vaccination. Adverse events were recorded for 7 days.
