    <textblock>
      Patients in Clopidogrel therapy alone or in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (Dual
      Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) presenting with a hip-fracture represent the surgeon with the
      dilemma of putting the patient at risk of a major blood loss during and after surgery, or
      putting the patient at risk of a thromboembolic event after surgery. The investigators
      hypothesize that the risk of a major blood loss in patients that are still under the effect
      of Clopidogrel or DAPT during or after hip-fracture surgery is relatively low. The
      investigators have conducted a retrospective observational study on hip-fracture patients to
      test this hypothesis.

        A total of 356 patients were included in the final analysis. Out of this group we
        identified 36 patients taking Clopidogrel. 24 of these were in DAPT. 12 patients were in
        Clopidogrel therapy alone. The indications for treatment were: CNS thrombosis (n=14);
        Unstable Angina (n=8); Peripheral Atherosclerosis (n=3); Myocardial Infarction (n=2);
        Insertion of stent &gt;24 months earlier (n=1); and Unknown indication (n=8). All patients had
        their treatment discontinued on admission.

        All analyzed patients were operated within 24 hours of admission (n=356).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients operated with short intramedullary nail for hip-fractures, in the study
             period. (1st of Jan. 2011-31st of Dec. 2013)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients operated &gt;24 hours after admission, patients in other forms of
             anticoagulation medication except acetylsalicylic acid (including vitamin K
             antagonists, dipyridamole, dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban), missing data on
             blood loss in patient chart, missing blood samples in the first 4 days and
             extra-national patients (follow up not possible). Patients operated on both sides
             during the inclusion period were only included with data on their latest operation.
