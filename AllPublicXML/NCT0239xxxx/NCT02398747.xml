  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      continuous and/or intermittent dosing of AZD2014 when given orally to patients with advanced
      solid malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre study of AZD2014 administered orally in Japanese patients
      with advanced solid malignancies. The study design allows an evaluation of each cohort with
      intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. In this study, a minimum of
      3 and a maximum of 6 evaluable patients will be enrolled in each cohort; approximately 24
      evaluable patients in total. The total number of patients enrolled will depend upon the
      number of screen failures, number of cohorts and number of evaluable subjects.

      Safety, preliminary efficacy and PK (single and multiple dose) are evaluated in this study.

      Patients will receive a single dose of AZD2014 on Day 1 (to allow assessment of single dose
      PK), then after a minimum of 48 hours washout period continuous or intermittent twice daily
      dosing of AZD2014 will be initiated. The washout period of 48 hours may be extended depending
      on emerging data from previous cohorts.Doses and schedules to be evaluated will be agreed by
      AstraZeneca and the Safety Review Committee (SRC).
