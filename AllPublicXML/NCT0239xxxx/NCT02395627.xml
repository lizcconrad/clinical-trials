    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized two arm trial, using Simon's 2-stage design, in ER+
      patients with therapy resistant breast cancer to test the optimal sequence and dosing of
      epigenetic immune priming in hormone therapy resistance breast cancer. A third arm (Arm C)
      will include ER-negative patients who will follow the concurrent priming, but exclude
      tamoxifen. The two arms all include vorinostat, TAM and pembrolizumab to evaluate

        -  Sequential priming - begin pembrolizumab in Cycle 1 (Arm B and Arm C) and,

        -  Concurrent priming with maximal dosing of both epigenetic and immune modulators- begin
           pembrolizumab on day 1 in Cycle 2 (Arm A)

      Unique aspects of this study:

      This is the first study to look at the response of hormone therapy resistance breast cancer
      to epigenetic immune priming. It is also the first study to look at the combination of an
      HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat), an anti-estrogen (tamoxifen) and a PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab
      in pre or postmenopausal patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer with progression on
      multiple prior therapies.

      Recent preclinical studies have further suggested that epigenetic priming may be even more
      effective in ER-negative tumors that do not respond to immune check point inhibitors or have
      low PD-1/PD-L1 expression. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that Vorinostat can
      increase PD-1 and PD-L1 expression.

      In a third arm the study will evaluate the role of epigenetic priming in tumors that are
      ER-negative.

             months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopia would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

             provided in Appendix 5.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because vorinostat, tamoxifen and PD-1 are
             drug classes with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with vorinostat, tamoxifen and PD-1 inhibitors.
