      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a 6-week nutrition, movement,
      and mindfulness program (M³ Program) for youth with a recent diagnosis of psychosis. Program
      effects on metabolic and mental health outcomes compared to wait-list control will also be
      assessed. Participants will be 15-25 years of age, and have a recent diagnosis of psychosis.
      Twenty participants and their study partners (20 study partners) will be equally divided into
      two cohorts. Participants will sign up for one of the two series on a rolling enrollment
      basis until both of the program date frames are filled. Participants that signed up for the
      second series will serve as a wait-list control; outcomes from the participants in the first
      series will be compared to this group. M³ will be a combination of didactic and experiential
      training. The course will meet once-a-week for six weeks. Participants will learn how to
      prepare healthy snacks and meals, make healthy choices when eating out, and interpret food
      packaging and labels. They will also learn about different forms of mindfulness exercises and
      movement, such as yoga, martial arts, and a Japanese style of drumming. Feasibility will be
      assessed throughout the program.

    <time_frame>6 and12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A rating scale to measure positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The QSANS-QSAPS assessment is administered by a trained health professional and takes 30 to 45 minutes to complete.</description>

    <measure>Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A measurement of 'hardiness', or one's ability to successfully cope with stress. The scale draws on a number of resilient characteristics, including patience, tolerance to negative affect, sense of humor, commitment, recognition of limits to control, engaging the support of others, and adaptability. The CD-RISC contains 25 items and asks subjects to rate how they felt over the past month on a Likert-type scale. Total score range is 0 - 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of resiliency.</description>

    <measure>Quality of LIfe - SF12</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>: The SF-12 is a 12-item validated shortened version of the SF-36 and was designed to provide a health related quality of life measure that was quick and easy to administer in large population studies. The SF-12 contains a subset of the 12 items from the SF-36 and information from this subset of questions is used to construct a physical and mental component summary score.</description>
