      This is comparison trial comparing human amniotic membrane to standard wound care for non
      healing diabetic foot wounds over a 12 weeks period
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, stratified, randomized, comparative, parallel group, Multi-center
      clinical trial comparing the proportion of ulcers completely healed by use of amniotic
      membrane graft (Amnioband)versus the standard protocol of wound care in diabetic patients
      with a diabetic foot ulcer with adequate arterial perfusion, for wound healing to the
      affected limb. The investigators will compare the proportion of ulcers completely healed by
      the amniotic membrane graft protocol of care to the standard protocol of care in the
      management of indolent diabetic ulcers at 6 weeks. In addition the investigators will compare
      the proportion of healing at 4 weeks, 12 weeks and, the mean time to healing, and the cost
      effectiveness of the two protocols of care. Mean time to healing will be measured by wound
      tracings.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients age 18 or older.

          2. Patient is willing to provide informed consent and is willing to participate in all
             procedures and follow up evaluations necessary to complete the study.

          3. Patient's ulcer must be diabetic in origin and larger than 1 cm2.

          4. Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes
             mellitus per ADA).

          5. Ulcer must be present for a minimum of four weeks before enrollment randomization,
             with documented failure of conventional ulcer therapy to heal the wound.

          6. A two week run-in period will precede enrollment/ randomization in the trial to
             document the indolent nature of the wounds selected.

          7. Additional wounds may be present but not within 3 cm of the study wound.

          8. Wound must be present anatomically on the foot as defined by beginning below the
             malleoli of the ankle and be neuropathic in origin.

          9. Patient's ulcer must exhibit no clinical signs of infection.
