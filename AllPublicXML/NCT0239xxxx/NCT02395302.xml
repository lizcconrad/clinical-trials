    <textblock>
      Subjects with a chronic venous leg ulcer will participate in a 2 week run in phase using
      standard of care multi-layer bandaging before receiving 4 weeks of treatment using a
      pneumatic compression device. Subjects will be seen in clinic weekly for an evaluation,
      complete symptom and quality of life questionnaires.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire that was completed after receiving four weeks of treatment from a dual action pneumatic compression device. Questions listed below:
The device was comfortable to wear during Sustained Compression Mode.
The device was comfortable to wear during Intermittent Compression Mode.
The noise from the device was not bothersome.
The device was easy to put on.
The device was easy to take off.
The device was easy to use.
The device was light-weight and portable.
The use of the device helped my wound heal faster.
I would use the device again on another wound in the future.
Since using the device, my quality of sleep has improved.
It was a burden to come to the wound care clinic for my dressing changes.
The use of the device did not restrict many of my normal activities.
The device was cumbersome and interfered with my mobility.
I was able to work while being treated with the device.</description>
