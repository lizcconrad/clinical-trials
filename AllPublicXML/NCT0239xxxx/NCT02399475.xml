  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated TSH in the setting of normal thyroid
      hormone levels, is a common diagnosis in the elderly. The purpose of this study is to examine
      the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in men and women aged 70 years and older with
      persistent subclinical hypothyroidism. To evaluate the mechanism behind this condition,
      participants will undergo thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulation testing at 3 visits:
      baseline and while taking two different thyroid hormone preparations, levothyroxine and
      liothyronine. The investigators will also assess physiologic responses to these two different
      thyroid hormone medications to help us understand how the thyroid works in advanced age.
