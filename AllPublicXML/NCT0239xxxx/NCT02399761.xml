      Parents of newborns will be invited to test if their newborns are affected with Aromatic
      L-amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency. The routine newborn screening dried blood spots
      sample will be used to test if 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) concentration elevates. If positive of
      screening test, further confirmation tests including physical examination and for mutation.
      Genetic counseling and treatment option will be provided, too.
