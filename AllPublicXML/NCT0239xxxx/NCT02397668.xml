      To demonstrate the proof of principle and initial clinical safety of the CorMatrix ECM
      Tricuspid Valve and increase the efficiency of the device development process by identifying
      appropriate modifications to the implant procedure or the device.

      CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. has developed a device for heart valve replacement, the
      CorMatrix® ECM® Tricuspid Valve, which can be implanted to replace dysfunctional tricuspid
      heart valves. This Early Feasibility Study is proposed to obtain initial insights into the
      ability to successfully implant the Tricuspid Valve, the clinical safety of the device, and
      whether the device performs its intended use.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with a regurgitant or absent tricuspid valve including those patients having
             concomitant cardiac procedures

          2. Patient/authorized legal guardian understands the nature of the procedure, is willing
             to comply with associated follow-up evaluations, and provides written informed consent
             and the pediatric patient (if applicable) provides written assent (if able) prior to
             procedure

          3. Patient/patient's authorized legal guardian is geographically stable (or willing to
             return for required study follow-up) and understands and is willing to fulfill all of
             the expected requirements of this clinical protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Tricuspid annulus too small (&lt; 12mm) to accommodate the CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve

          2. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;= 30%

          3. Mean pulmonary pressure &gt;= 50mm Hg

          4. Emergency cardiac procedureor patient requires mechanical cardiac support (e.g.,
             balloon pump, ECMO)

          5. Acute myocardial infarction within 7 days of enrollment unless cardiac enzymes have
             returned to normal

          6. Patients with a single ventricle where the CorMatrix Tricuspid Valve would be the
             systemic AV valve

          7. Documented primary coagulopathy or platelet disorder, including thrombocytopenia
             (absolute platelet count &lt;60k)

          8. Documented evidence of intrinsic hepatic disease (defined as liver enzyme values (AST,
             ALT or total bilirubin) that are &gt; 5 times the upper limit of reference range within
             30 days of enrollment, except in association with acute decompensation as determined
             by the Investigator)

          9. Documented evidence of significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt; 3.0mg/dl) or
             on any form of dialysis at time of screening

         10. Patient with an infection treated with antibiotics &lt; 7 days prior to enrollment

         11. Stroke within 90 days prior to enrollment, or a history of cerebral vascular disease
             with significant (&gt; 80%) extra cranial stenosis (patients with CVD history documented
             by a carotid Doppler study)

         12. Known cancer (cancer-free &lt; 1 year; does not include non-metastatic basal cell
             carcinoma or cervical carcinoma) and/or undergoing treatment including chemotherapy
             and radiotherapy

         13. Hematological disorders (e.g., aplastic anemia) or patients taking bone marrow
             suppressant drugs

         14. Patients with a planned lead or wire through the CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve
             following implant. Note: No wires or leads should be inside the CorMatrix ECM
             Tricuspid Valve following implant. Alternative ways of placing leads are not
             exclusions (e.g. epicardial)

         15. Psychiatric or behavioral disease (including drug or alcohol abuse and antisocial
             disorder) that is likely to impair compliance with the study protocol

         16. Known sensitivity to porcine materials

         17. Contraindication to anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy (ASA and/or Plavix)

         18. Patients who are pregnant (method of assessment Investigator's discretion)

         19. Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly impact the treatment or outcome of the current study, without CorMatrix
             written approval
