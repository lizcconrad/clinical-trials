      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adults (aged ≥ 18 years)

        Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a B-cell lymphoma that has progressed in spite of
        prior treatment, and for which additional effective standard therapy is not available

        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2

        Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic, and coagulation laboratory assessments

        Must give written informed consent to participate in this study before the performance of
        any study-related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A primary lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS) or known lymphomatous involvement of
        the CNS

        Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the
        absorption of CPI-1205, including any unresolved nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that is
        CTCAE grade &gt;1

        Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, H2 antagonists, or antacids

        Achlorhydria, either documented or suspected on the basis of an associated disease (e.g.,
        pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, or certain gastric surgical procedures)

        Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of the
        following:

          -  Acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris ≤ 6 months prior to starting study drug

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure

          -  QTcF &gt; 470 msec on the screening ECG

        Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (patients with rate-controlled atrial fibrillation are not
        excluded)

        A past medical history of other clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g.,
        uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension or history of poor compliance
        with an antihypertensive regimen)

        Any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition that could
        compromise participation in the study (e.g., clinically significant pulmonary disease,
        clinically significant neurological disorder, active or uncontrolled infection)

        Systemic anti-cancer treatment or radiotherapy less than 2 weeks before the first dose of
        CPI 1205

        before the first dose of CPI-1205

        Treatment with an investigational small molecule less than 2 weeks before the first dose of
        CPI-1205.

        Treatment with a therapeutic antibody less than 4 weeks before the first dose of CPI-1205.

        Treatment with medications that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4

        Treatment with medications that are inducers of CYP3A4 enzymes

        Treatment with medications that are known to carry a risk of Torsades de Pointes

        Pregnant or lactating women

        Women of child bearing potential and men with reproductive potential, if they are unwilling
        to use adequate contraception while on study therapy and for 3 months thereafter
