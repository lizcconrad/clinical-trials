      This is a multi-center long-term open-label non-comparative study to assess changes in
      carotid and aortic atherosclerosis in patients being treated with lomitapide. Patients from
      countries in the EU, the US and Canada who are being treated with lomitapide and are enrolled
      in The Lomitapide Observational Worldwide Evaluation Registry (LOWER), will be invited by the
      LOWER enrolling physician to participate in this substudy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        • Adult patients (age ≥18 years) who are enrolled in LOWER

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a prior history of carotid angioplasty, carotid stenting, or carotid
             atherectomy

          -  Patients with a contraindication to MRI examination (i.e., brain aneurysm, implanted
             neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker, pacemaker wires or defibrillator,
             prosthetic heart valves, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body, or other implanted
             body)

          -  Patients who have undergone a coronary stenting procedure in the preceding three weeks
             prior to enrollment

          -  Patients prone to claustrophobia or known anxiety disorders that will interfere with
             the ability to acquire quality MRI scans

          -  Patients with an implanted insulin pump

          -  Patients with metal shrapnel or bullet wounds

          -  Patients with a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40 kg/m2 (since it may be difficult to
             position comfortably with the MRI scanner)

          -  Patients who work with metal lathes (unless an orbit x-ray performed prior to the
             enrollment MRI scan has been done to rule out metal fragments in the eye)
