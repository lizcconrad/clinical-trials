  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Abraxane™
      (nab-paclitaxel) that can be given in combination with capecitabine and radiation therapy to
      patients with pancreatic cancer. The safety of this drug and drug combination will also be
      studied.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of nab-paclitaxel based on when you join this study. Up to 3 dose levels of
      nab-paclitaxel will be tested. About 3-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will
      receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of nab-paclitaxel is found.

      You will receive standard doses of radiation therapy and capecitabine.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive nab-paclitaxel by vein over about 30 minutes 1 time each week for 5½ weeks
      (5 doses total).

      You will receive radiation therapy 1 time each day on Monday through Friday for 5½ weeks (28
      doses) and capecitabine by mouth 2 times each day. You will receive a separate consent form
      that describes radiation therapy, capecitabine, their risks, and additional dosing
      instructions (for capecitabine).

      Study Visits:

      Each week that you have radiation therapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will fill out the questionnaire.

        -  If you are taking phenytoin, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the amount
           of phenytoin in your blood.

        -  If you are taking blood thinners, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check how
           well your blood clots.

      At one time during this study, leftover tumor tissue from a previous biopsy will be collected
      to test if there is a certain type of protein (SMAD4) in the tissue that may predict if the
      disease will come back. Depending on your SMAD4 status, the study doctor may be able to
      predict where in your body (either in the pancreas or in a different part of your body) the
      disease may come back.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking nab-paclitaxel, radiation therapy, and capecitabine for up to 5½
      weeks. If the disease appears to get better after the end-of-treatment visit (described
      below) you may be able to continue taking nab-paclitaxel 1 time each week, unless the disease
      appears to get worse.

      You will no longer be able to take nab-paclitaxel if the disease gets worse, if intolerable
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit.

      End-Of-Treatment Visit:

      About 4-6 weeks after you finish radiation therapy, you will have an end-of-treatment visit.
      At this visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you are taking phenytoin, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the amount
           of phenytoin in your blood.

        -  If you are taking blood thinners, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check how
           well your blood clots.

        -  You will have a CT scan of your chest and either an MRI or CT scan of your abdomen to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  You will fill out the questionnaire.

      Follow-up Visits:

      You will have study visits every 3 months +/- 1 month. At each study visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan of your abdomen and a chest CT to check the status of
           the disease.

      If the study doctor thinks that the tumor(s) can be removed, you will have surgery. You will
      be given a separate consent form that will describe the type of surgery you will have and its
      risks.

      This is an investigational study. Nab-paclitaxel and capecitabine are both FDA-approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Radiation therapy is delivered
      using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. It is considered investigational to
      give capecitabine and nab-paclitaxel together for pancreatic cancer. The study doctor can
      explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response (CR) — complete disappearance of clinical evidence of a tumor. Radiographically equivocal lesions must remain stable or regress.
Partial response (PR) — 50% or greater decrease in the sum of products of the longest perpendicular diameters of measured lesion compared to baseline.
Stable disease (SD) — no significant change in disease status. Lesion may show a &lt;50% decrease in sum of products of longest perpendicular diameters or an increase of &lt;25%.
Progressive disease (PD) — a 25% increase in area of a lesion &gt;2 cm2 or a 50% increase in size if area of lesion was 2 cm2. Appearance of new lesions constitutes progressive disease. Comparisons of tumor size made with previous smallest measurement in participants who have attained a partial response or with baseline measurements in participants with stable disease. Tumor progression also defined as significant clinical deterioration that cannot be attributed to treatment or other medical conditions.</description>

    <description>Phase I study and a standard 3+3 design used to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) dose of Abraxane with Radiation Therapy and Capecitabine. Up to 3 dose levels of Abraxane tested. First group of participants receive lowest dose level. Each new group receives a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This continues until highest tolerable dose of Abraxane is found. Once MTD identified an expansion cohort of 12 patients enrolled.
Starting dose of Abraxane 50 mg/m2 by vein weekly Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 by mouth twice a day only on days of radiation. Radiation Therapy delivered at a dose of 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions 1 time each day on Monday through Friday for 5½ weeks.
