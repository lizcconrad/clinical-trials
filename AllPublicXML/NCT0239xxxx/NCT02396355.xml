  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The enumeration of T lymphocytes positive for the CD4 antigen is used to determine the immune
      status of patients with, or suspected of developing, immune deficiencies such as AIDS. The BD
      FACS Presto™ is an investigational automated system for in vitro diagnostic use in performing
      the direct enumeration of CD4 absolute count, CD4 percentage of lymphocytes, and hemoglobin
      (Hb) concentration in human whole blood.

      This is a prospective study to determine the relative bias between the investigational BD
      FACS Presto system and the predicate BD FACS Calibur with BD Tritest system in their
      determination of absolute CD4, % CD4, and Hb concentrations.

        The study will enroll specimens from children 0-12 years and adolescent or adult patients
        13 years of age or greater. Enrolment of children in the study is expected to satisfy the
        binning (stratification) requirements since relative lymphocytosis and higher CD4+
        lymphocyte counts are normal in children less than 5 years of age.
