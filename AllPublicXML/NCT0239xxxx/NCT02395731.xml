    <textblock>
      This Center for Medicare and Medicaid funded health care innovation award will implement the
      MIND at Home dementia care coordination program (called MIND at Home-Plus) through two
      community-based service agencies (Jewish Community Services, Johns Hopkins Home Care Group)
      to rapidly improve the ability of 600 dually eligible older adults with dementia in the
      Baltimore region to remain at home while improving care quality, enhancing quality of life,
      and reducing total health care costs. MIND at Home participants receive an in-home needs
      assessment followed by up to 18 months of care coordination aimed at filling unmet needs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The demonstration project has 3 major tasks which will be implemented in concurrent,
      iterative phases: (1) implement MIND-Plus in 2 community-based health service agencies to
      rapidly improve the ability of 600 community-living dually eligible older adults with AD in
      the Baltimore region to remain at home while improving care quality, enhancing quality of
      life, and reducing total health care costs associated with institutional care or
      hospitalization; (2) develop a replicable model for nationwide diffusion of the MIND program
      through a web-based certification package designed to prepare for implementation, build
      work-force capacity through training certification modules, and provide automated
      self-monitoring and quality improvement tools; and (3) develop and test a detailed payment
      model that takes a blended approach and includes provider care management fees with provider
      performance incentives from division of shared savings.

      The investigators hypothesize that the MIND-Plus dementia care coordination program will (1)
      rapidly improve health &amp; care quality and reduce total health care costs among
      Medicare-Medicaid dually eligible community-living older adults with AD, (2) drive health
      care system transformation by creating a new CMS financed benefit that would shift the hub of
      dementia care coordination to well-trained, dementia competent, interdisciplinary teams based
      in community health agencies, (3) achieve a sustainable payment model that produces
      significant net savings and incentives provider performance. This &quot;shovel ready&quot;
      community-based model is expected to improve outcomes within 6 months and save an estimated
      net-saving of $12.5 million by over 3 years.

    <description>MIND at Home-Plus is a home-based, care coordination that focuses on persons with dementia living at home and their family caregivers. Its goal is to help persons age in place safely while increasing quality of life. Delivered over 18 months, MIND-Plus systematically assesses and addresses unmet care needs of persons with dementia and their caregivers which are known to be linked to poor health and quality of life outcomes, and that put people at risk for long term care placement. The needs addressed in the MIND program cover a wide range of care domains, ranging from home and medication safety, to cognitive and behavior symptoms management, meaningful activities and legal considerations. The care team made up of a memory care coordinator, nurse, occupational therapist, and physician.</description>
