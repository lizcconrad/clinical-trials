      The primary objective of this study is to determine if there are significant interactions
      between oral lorcaserin treatment concurrent with 20 and 40 mg intravenous (i.v.) cocaine
      infusions by measuring adverse events (AEs) and cardiovascular responses including heart rate
      (HR), blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiogram (ECG) (including QTc).
