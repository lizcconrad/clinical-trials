  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigates computer based cognitive rehabilitation and training using the N-back task with
      a Visual Search task as an active control. The overall purpose is to provide (further)
      evidence about the efficacy (or lack of efficacy) of the N-back task and to find points of
      convergence and divergence between patients with acquired brain injury and non-impaired
      subjects.

    <description>The N-back task required patients to monitor a continuous sequence of stimuli (in this experiment audio and visual stimuli). Press a button if the current stimulus is the same as that shown N back in the sequence. N increases if performance is good and decreases if performance is poor.
Subjects train for 20 days, 12 blocks a day, 20+N trials per block. That is 240 blocks in total. A minimum of 10 blocks per day counts as a successfully trained day.</description>

    <description>The Visual Search task consists of a NxN array of shapes. Press the button if a certain target stimulus is present in this array. N increases if performance is good and decreases if performance is poor.
Subjects train for 20 days, 12 blocks a day, 20+N trials per block. That is 240 blocks in total. A minimum of 10 blocks per day counts as a successfully trained day.</description>
