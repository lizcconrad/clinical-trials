  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-117 when
      administered in combination with docetaxel in participants with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TAK-117 administered alone and
      in combination with docetaxel at the RP2D in participants with locally advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being evaluated in this study is called TAK-117. TAK-117 is tested in combination
      with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      This study consisted of 2 phases:

        -  Phase 1b - dose escalation phase

        -  Phase 2 - expansion phase.

      The study enrolled 14 patients with NSCLC who have been treated with multiple prior lines of
      therapies will be enrolled for Phase 1b. The participants will receive docetaxel (36 mg/m^2)
      intravenous (IV) and TAK-117 tablets, orally administered, once daily in 21-day dosing
      cycles. The TAK-117 dose will be escalated until recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is
      determined.

      Each part of the adaptive Phase 2 portion of the study is designed as a stand-alone,
      randomized study evaluating PFS as the primary efficacy measure in a total of 60 participants
      between the 2 treatment arms: TAK-117 plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone. An event-driven
      analysis of PFS will be performed after each part of Phase 2. On the basis of the PFS
      analysis of the preceding part of the study, the study may be stopped for efficacy or
      futility, or proceed to the next part. However, Phase 2 of the study was cancelled.

      Study drug will be administered in 21-day dosing cycles. During each phase of the study,
      participants will be treated with a maximum of 9 cycles of either docetaxel alone or
      docetaxel plus TAK-117. Subsequently, participants treated with docetaxel plus TAK-117 may
      continue to receive TAK-117 monotherapy until progression of disease, occurrence of
      unacceptable toxicities or death.

      The maximum duration of treatment for participants will be 12 months unless it is determined
      that a participant would derive benefit from continued treatment beyond 12 months.
      Participants will continue to be followed after discontinuation of study drug to collect PFS
      and OS data. Participants may withdraw from therapy at any time.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted in North America. The overall time to participate in
      this study is up to 24 months.

        <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date randomization to the date of first documented progressive disease (PD) or death as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria. PD is defined as 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions for measurable neoplastic disease.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.
