  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of etrolizumab compared with placebo during induction and
      maintenance treatment of moderate to severely active CD in participants who are refractory or
      intolerant to corticosteroids (CS), immunosuppressants (IS), or anti-tumor necrosis factors
      (anti-TNFs) or have inadequate response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF-IR). Participants
      who enroll on the basis of refractory or intolerance to CS and/or IS may have been previously
      exposed to anti-TNFs or be naïve to anti-TNFs. The study period will consist of Screening
      Phase (up to 35 days) plus (+) 14-week Induction Phase + 52-week Maintenance Phase + 12-week
      Safety Follow-up Phase. At Week 14 (end of Induction Phase), participants achieving decrease
      of 70 points in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) from baseline (CDAI-70 response)
      without the use of rescue therapy will continue to the Maintenance Phase.

          -  Intolerance, refractory disease, or no response to CS, IS, or anti-TNF therapy within
             5 years from screening. Participants who have not previously demonstrated inadequate
             response or intolerance to one or more anti-TNF therapies are eligible to participate
             in the study provided they are intolerant or refractory to CS or IS therapy

          -  Use of effective contraception as defined by the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of, or current conditions affecting the digestive tract, such as ulcerative
             colitis, indeterminate colitis, fistulizing disease, abdominal or perianal abscess,
             adenomatous colonic polyps not excised, colonic mucosal dysplasia, and short bowel
             syndrome

          -  Planned surgery for CD

          -  Ileostomy or colostomy

          -  Has received non-permitted inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapies (including
             natalizumab, vedolizumab, and efalizumab, as stated in the protocol)

          -  Any prior treatment with ustekinumab within 14 weeks prior to randomization

          -  Chronic hepatitis B or C infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active or
             latent tuberculosis (participants with prior history of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin [BCG]
             vaccination must pass protocol-defined screening criteria)

          -  Sinus tract with evidence for infection (e.g., purulent discharge) in the clinical
             judgment of the investigator. Fistulas related to CD are not exclusionary

          -  Any prior treatment with anti-adhesion molecules (e.g., anti-mucosal addressin cell
             adhesion molecule [anti-MAdCAM-1])

          -  Any major episode of infection requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics &lt;/=8
             weeks prior to screening or oral antibiotics &lt;/=4 weeks prior to screening. Treatment
             with antibiotics as adjunctive therapy for CD in the absence of documented infection
             is not exclusionary

          -  Hospitalization (other than for elective reasons) within 4 weeks prior to
             randomization
