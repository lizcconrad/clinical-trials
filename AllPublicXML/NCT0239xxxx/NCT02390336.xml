  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of mobilization with movement, also referred to as a Mulligan mobilization, has
      not been studied in patients with hip osteoarthritis, subsisting questions about the possible
      effects in this population. The aim of this randomized controlled study is to compare the
      immediate effects of Mulligan mobilization with movement technique of pain, range of motion
      and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mulligan original theory for the efficacy of a Mobilization With Movement (MWM) is based on
      the concept associated with a &quot;positional joint failure,&quot; which occurs due to injury and may
      lead to a change in the joint alignment and hence its biomechanical resulting in symptoms
      such as pain, joint stiffness or weakness. To perform the MWM technique it is required to
      implement many criteria. During execution is applied an maintained accessory glide in order
      to correct the positional fault, while a physiological movement or action that usually caused
      the pain is performed actively or passively. A key component for the MWM is that pain should
      always be reduced and / or eliminated during application.

      All study participants will be submitted to an initial assessment protocol to determine the
      intensity of pain, the range of motion (ROM) in flexion and internal rotation of the hip and
      the collection of physical function parameters. After that, the intervention will be
      performed for each group, and then the re-evaluation will be carried out (final evaluation),
      pain intensity, ROM and physical function tests..

    <description>For the MWM group, the investigator applied two techniques of mobilization with movement: one for flexion and one for medial rotation of the hip. With the hip in flexion, a stabilizing belt was placed on the medial side of the participant's thigh closest to the joint interline. The belt was placed around the pelvic region of the physical therapist, keeping a perpendicular direction to the participant's thigh. Maintaining a side slip, it was carried out a passive movement of 1) hip flexion (3x10) and 2) medial hip rotation (3x10) by the physiotherapist throughout painless amplitude.</description>
