  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of Serum Institute of India Limited (SIIL) is the development of a recombinant urease
      C-deficient listeriolysin expressing BCG vaccine strain (VPM1002) as a safe, well tolerated
      and efficacious vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) for residents in endemic areas and persons
      at risk in non-endemic areas. The new vaccine should be at least as potent as the current
      strain and should be safer than BCG.

      The preceding phase-IIa trial was the first investigation of VPM1002 in newborn infants in a
      high burden setting in South Africa. The vaccination of HIV-unexposed infants with VPM1002
      indicated again safety, tolerability and immunogenicity sufficient to proceed in HIV-exposed
      infants.

      The current study is a multiple site trial in South Africa to evaluate safety and
      immunogenicity in HIV-unexposed and -exposed newborn infants.
