    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis, as
             defined by a PGA score of 2 or 3 on both feet, AND moderate to severe tinea cruris, as
             defined by a PGA score of 2 or 3

          -  Subjects with a mycological diagnosis of tinea pedis AND tinea cruris confirmed by the
             detection of fungal hyphae on a microscopic KOH wet mount

          -  Subjects must be in good general health and free of any disease that might interfere
             with study evaluations

          -  Subjects with the ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all
             scheduled visits and successfully complete the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant and/or nursing or planning a pregnancy during the
             course of the trial

          -  Subjects who are immunocompromised

          -  Subjects who have a recent history of or currently known drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Subjects with a history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to imidazole compounds,
             proton pump inhibitors or the inactive components of Luliconazole Cream 1% or
             omeprazole

          -  Subjects with a life-threatening condition within the last 6 months

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          -  Subjects who are unable to communicate or cooperate with the investigator

          -  Subjects using medications for treatment of tinea pedis and/or tinea cruris (see
             investigator for length of time prior to study start)

          -  Subjects receiving concomitant drugs that are known to inhibit and/or induce CYP2C19
             and/or CYP3A4; or that interact with omeprazole

          -  Because of the potential for drug interaction with luliconazole, administration with
             medications that are known to be substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19
             should be carefully monitored
