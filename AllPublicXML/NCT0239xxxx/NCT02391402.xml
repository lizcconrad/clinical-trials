  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Cognitively Augmented
      Behavioral Activation (CABA), a new hybrid treatment for Veterans diagnosed with comorbid
      mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study's
      specific goals are to determine whether: 1) CABA reduces PTSD symptoms in Veterans with
      mTBI/PTSD, 2) CABA reduces cognitive-related functional impairment in Veterans with
      mTBI/PTSD, 3) CABA results in improvements in depression symptoms, cognitive functioning, and
      quality of life in Veterans with mTBI/PTSD; and 4) CABA is an acceptable treatment for
      Veterans with mTBI/PTSD. The overall goal is to develop an evidence-based manualized
      treatment for comorbid mTBI/PTSD that can be readily implemented in Veterans Health
      Administration (VHA) treatment settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans historically exhibit high rates of comorbid mTBI/PTSD. Given the comorbidity and
      neuropsychiatric symptom overlap of these disorders, it can be difficult to determine whether
      problems and disruptions in functioning are due to mTBI, PTSD, or both. Hence, it is
      challenging for providers to know how to prioritize these patients' clinical issues and how
      to effectively treat them. Currently, there are no evidence-based treatments for comorbid
      mTBI/PTSD. Further, it is unclear to what extent existing treatments for each disorder can be
      adherently and effectively implemented for the other. As such, most current treatment
      recommendations suggest a holistic or integrated approach to treatment for comorbid mTBI/PTSD
      targeting symptoms and functionality rather than underlying etiology. Investigators are
      proposing a treatment for comorbid mTBI and PTSD that directly targets daily functioning and
      quality of life.

      The study design makes use of the convergent availability of resources at the two
      participating Veterans Administration Health Care Systems in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle,
      Washington to conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of CABA. The study will recruit a
      total of 192 Veterans less than or equal to 55 years of age, 96 participants at each site,
      enrolled at participating VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) who are diagnosed with both mTBI and
      PTSD. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the CABA or Treatment as
      Usual (TAU) group. Participants in the CABA group will receive the CABA intervention during
      the first 14 weeks of their participation in the study, whereas TAU participants will
      continue to receive TAU (usual care in a PTSD specialty treatment clinic, but no CABA) during
      their participation in the study. Both groups will undergo evaluations at baseline, 7 weeks
      (mid-treatment), 14 weeks (post-treatment), and 39 weeks (6 month follow-up). During their
      study participation, all participants will continue to receive their usual medical care.

    <description>CABA uses Behavioral Activation (BA) to identify meaningful goals and activities while learning cognitive skills to aid in working toward those goals. Early sessions of CABA focus on learning about mTBI, PTSD, and lifestyle skills that can improve thinking abilities and mood. Cognitive skills taught each week include internal and external skills to help manage problems with memory, attention, and regulation of thinking processes. Investigators and patients will spend a part of each session applying the cognitive skills to managing real life situations and getting patients active in the service of personal goals.</description>

    <description>Treatment as Usual (TAU) is the usual care that patients would normally receive at the VA. TAU care involves psychotherapy (counseling) provided by a specialist in the treatment of PTSD.

Beyond this, the specific approach will be determined by the patient and his/her provider and may include skills for managing PTSD and/or a chance for the patient to &quot;process&quot; his/her traumatic experiences. Additional treatments may be offered to patients, such as group classes and medications. TAU care may also include additional evaluation and/or treatment of mTBI, provided by the usual care offered in Portland or Seattle's respective neuropsychology clinics. Treatment for mTBI includes individual or group sessions, and is based on clinical need.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veterans 55 years of age enrolled at participating VA sites able to provide informed
             consent.

          -  Diagnosis of PTSD based on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale.

          -  Positive screen on the Structured Interview for Collecting Head Trauma Event
             Characteristics as per the VA/Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline
             for Management of Concussion/mTBI; AND endorsed any of the Neurobehavioral Symptom
             Inventory (NSI) cognitive symptoms items (items 13-17).

          -  English speaking, able to travel to the primary care clinics weekly for 10 sessions
             and for the follow-up assessments, and willing to refrain from the initiation of
             additional mental health treatment during the first 3 1/2 months of the active phase
             of treatment if they are assigned to the CABA condition.

          -  Willingness to participate in audio-recorded sessions. (for treatment adherence)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of moderate or severe substance (alcohol) use disorder using DSM-5
             criteria within the past 30 days.

          -  Individuals with other psychiatric diagnoses will not be excluded except for bipolar
             disorder and psychotic disorders (requirement to refrain from additional treatments
             might be harmful).

          -  Veterans with a history indicated by medical record review of a diagnosis of moderate,
             severe, or penetrating TBI, or self-reported history on the Structured Interview for
             Collecting Head Trauma Event Characteristics of TBI with Post-Traumatic Amnesia (PTA)
             greater than 24 hours or loss of consciousness (LOC) greater than 30 minutes.

          -  Active suicidal intent indicating significant clinical risk, which would suggest that
             a treatment specifically targeting this intent was indicated. Clients who report
             suicidal ideation without imminent risk will be admitted into the study.

          -  Initiated psychotropic medication, including Prazosin, within 4 weeks or changed
             dosage within 2 weeks prior to the first assessment, as this would make it difficult
             to determine which treatment contributed to change in the CABA condition;
             additionally, started or changed dosage of sleep medication or low dosages of
             tricyclic antidepressant or trazodone for pain or sleep within 1 week prior to the
             first assessment. Participants could be reconsidered for eligibility after stability
             on medication was achieved. Enrollees will be asked to hold the doses of the current
             medications stable over the course of enrollment (though changes in medications after
             enrollment will not exclude them from on-going participation).

          -  Auditory or visual impairments that would compromise ability to participate or
             benefit.
