  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial of a new treatment for prostate cancer that is a type of vaccine
      that could be a new way to treat cancer. A vaccine that could alert the immune system to the
      presence of cancer cells in the body may enable the immune system to target and kill those
      cells effectively. This vaccine is intended to work by making the immune system kill cells
      that have a special protein (called 5T4) that is present on the surface of cancer cells. The
      vaccine is made up of two recombinant viruses (&quot;ChAdOx1&quot; and &quot;MVA&quot;) that have been designed
      to produce the 5T4 protein and have been modified so that they are weakened and cannot
      reproduce themselves within the body like normal viruses. Once injected into the body, these
      viruses make the 5T4 protein and help the body's immune system to learn to target this
      protein and destroy cancer cells.

      This is a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of
      ChAdOx1.5T4-MVA.5T4 vaccination regime. It is evaluated in neo-adjuvant setting in low and
      intermediate risk localised prostate cancer patients who have either decided to have their
      prostate removed or are stable on active surveillance.
