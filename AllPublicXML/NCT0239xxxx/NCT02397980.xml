  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if behavioral intervention for dementia
      caregivers will decrease caregiver burden in caregivers of patients with dementia. This
      multicenter, randomized trial will be conducted with 80 dementia caregivers, who will be
      randomized into two groups. One group consists of 40 participants who will receive behavioral
      intervention and 40 who will not receive intervention (waitlist control). The waitlist
      control group will be also provided the same intervention after the intervention group has
      completed the intervention. The behavioral intervention consists of 90-min-session a day with
      an interval of two weeks for 2 months. The primary outcome measures are the changes in scores
      of Zaret's Burden Inventory and Philadelphia Geriatric Center for Moral Scale (PGCMS).

      This multicenter, randomized trial will be conducted with 80 dementia caregivers, who will be
      randomized into two groups. One group consists of 40 participants who will receive behavioral
      intervention and 40 who will not receive intervention (waitlist control). The waitlist
      control group will be also provided the same intervention after the intervention group has
      completed the intervention. The behavioral intervention consists of 90-min-session a day with
      an interval of two weeks for 2 months. The intervention program includes not only the
      knowledge of dementia and how to manage behavioral problems of patients with dementia but
      also individual psychological counselling about caregiver's distress. The primary outcome
      measures are the changes in scores of Zaret's Burden Inventory and Philadelphia Geriatric
      Center for Moral Scale (PGCMS). Secondary outcomes are changes in scores of neuropsychiatric
      inventory and Korean -instrumental Activities of Daily Living of patients as well as
      depression scores of caregivers.
