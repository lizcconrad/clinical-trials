    <textblock>
      To obtain arterial access for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) the cardiologist can choose between the femoral artery and the radial
      artery. In the University Medical Center Groningen the femoral artery is commonly used. After
      intervention the puncture site is closed with an arteriotomy closure device (ACD). Patients
      after radial access receive a pressure bandage at the puncture site, usually the Terumo (TR)
      wrist bandage.

      The bedrest period for patients with an ACD is 1 hour after diagnostic cardiac
      catheterization and 2 hours after PCI. After the bedrest period patients are discharged 1
      hour after diagnostic procedures or 4 hours after PCI. This to observe potential bleeding
      complications after the procedure. In patients with radial access, the TR bandage will be
      removed according to current protocol after 4 hours and additionally 1 hour observation is
      required. Several cardiologists have the intention to use the radial artery more frequent for
      cardiac catheterization or PCI. In a meta-analysis radial access is related to a 73% decrease
      in major bleeding complications compared to femoral access. Also there are no significant
      differences in MACE. Even so there are no differences in success percentage for cardiac
      catheterization or PCI and admission time is shorter for radial access (Am Heart J. 2009
      Jan;157(1):132- 40). Admission time for diagnostic cardiac catheterization at the short-stay
      unit is in case of femoral access with an ACD approximately 2 hours. For patients after
      radial access post procedural admission time is approximately 5 hours. To guarantee patient
      throughput, uniformity of care and more efficient use of capacity of the short-stay unit,
      patients after radial access should not have a longer hospital admission time than patients
      after femoral access. Carrington et al. (J Interv Cardiol. 2009 Dec;22(6):571-5) have shown
      that it is safe to deflate the TR wrist band faster than four hours.

      Objective of the study:

      To describe the differences in safety, patient comfort and admission period after diagnostic
      cardiac catheterization through radial access, between the current protocol and the protocol
      of fast desufflation by Carrington et al.
