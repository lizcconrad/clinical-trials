    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare effects of erlotinib and pemetrexed as maintenance
      therapy for lung adenocarcinoma. Primary Outcome is the progression free survival (PFS).
      Based on prediction of different potential benefit groups, this study may help the oncologist
      to optimize and improve the maintenance therapy plan for lung adenocarcinoma.
