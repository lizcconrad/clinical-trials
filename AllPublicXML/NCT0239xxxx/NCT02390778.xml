      The objectives of the study were: To (1) describe the epidemiology of emotional distress
      experienced by Ugandan violence researchers; to (2) assess the effectiveness of group
      debriefings in mitigating secondary distress; to (3) assess risk and protective factors.
      Eligible participants were 59 Ugandan researchers employed by the Good Schools Study (GSS,
      NCT01678846) to interview children and adults who experienced violence. Recruited
      participants were randomly assigned to group debriefings (intervention) or film viewing
      (control). The primary outcome was change in levels of emotional distress.

      Background: Secondary distress including emotional distress, vicarious trauma (VT) and
      secondary traumatic stress (STS) due to exposure to primary trauma victims have been
      described in helping professionals and in violence researchers. To our knowledge, there are
      few prevalence studies, and no tailored interventions have been tested to reduce secondary
      distress in violence researchers.

      Objective: To (1) describe the epidemiology of emotional distress experienced by Ugandan
      violence researchers; to (2) assess the effectiveness of group debriefings in mitigating
      secondary distress; to (3) assess risk and protective factors.

      Methods: An unblinded, individually randomised trial with parallel assignment was conducted.
      Eligible participants were 59 Ugandan researchers employed by the Good Schools Study (GSS,
      NCT01678846) to interview children and adults who experienced violence in the district of
      Luwero, Uganda. 53 researchers agreed to participate and were randomly allocated. The
      intervention group (n=26) participated in three group debriefings and the control group
      (n=27) participated in three leisure sessions (film viewing).The primary outcome was change
      in levels of emotional distress (SRQ-20); secondary outcomes were levels of VT and STS at
      end-line.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Self-Report Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) score at 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SRQ-20 is a 20 item measure which require simple 'yes' or 'no' responses and was designed as a screening tool for psychological symptoms/emotional distress. It has been widely used and validated in low and middle-income countries as a measure of mental health and wellbeing. The SRQ-20 was modelled as a continuous variable but also a binary variable were the top 33% of the overall distribution was deemed as having a 'high' score indicative of probable emotional distress, consistent with previous research.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vicarious Trauma Scale (VTS) at 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Vicarious Trauma Scale (VTS), an 8 item measure with a 7 point Likert-type scale, has recently been developed and shown to have good psychometric properties for use as a screening tool for vicarious trauma in low resource settings. It is the only publically available screening measure of VT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) at 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R)consists of 22 items with a 4 point Likert-type scale widely validated and used to screen for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It has been used by several studies to measure STS as the theoretical symptomology is similar.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) at 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) was developed to screen mental health and other professionals who may experience positive or negative impacts as they help others. Versions of the screening tool have good construct validity with over 200 published papers and it is widely used in research as a measure for STS and related constructs.</description>

    <description>The debrief group participated in 3 consecutive face-to-face group debriefing sessions lasting 1.5-2 hrs each. Each session started with a fun ice-breaker to create a relaxed atmosphere and group cohesion. Session 1 focused on encouraging group participation, discussing primary trauma encountered and emotional reactions to these stories. Session 2 connected current experiences with the group members' own trauma histories and life experiences. The last session focussed on societal and community responses to violence, and employing personal agency to find constructive ways to address violence in communities.</description>
