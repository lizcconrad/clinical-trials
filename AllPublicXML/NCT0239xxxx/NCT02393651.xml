    <textblock>
      Rationale: About 80% of stroke patients suffer motor impairments, but current therapies have
      limited effects on motor recovery. Therefore, investigating new potential therapeutic
      approaches is crucial. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of
      non-invasive electrical stimulation where a weak current is applied through electrodes over
      the scalp. This stimulation is known to (1) induce changes in neuronal excitability -which
      can last up to one day with late LTP-like plasticity protocols in a polarity and
      site-specific manner, and (2) facilitate motor learning and stroke recovery. So far, several
      pilot studies have reported beneficial results from tDCS in both subacute and chronic stroke
      patients, but it's still unclear how tDCS should be repeated over multiple days to optimally
      enhance recovery and training effects. Using a late LTP-like plasticity protocol could
      increase effectiveness of standard clinical care rehabilitation sessions and thus enhance the
      effects of rehabilitation. Therefore, the investigators want to investigate how late LTP-like
      plasticity tDCS affects rehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. The outcome of this study
      can provide important guidelines on effective motor therapy during stroke rehabilitation.

      Objective: Identify the effect of late LTP-like plasticity on motor rehabilitation during the
      subacute phase after stroke.

      Study design: Double-blinded, randomized between-subjects trials. Study population: Subacute
      stroke patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure is the upper
      limb motor function during the subacute phase after stroke.
