  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III study designed to provide efficacy and safety data for canakinumab
      administered for at least 48 weeks as subcutaneous (s.c.) injection every 4 weeks (q4wk) in
      Japanese patients with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA). Interim analysis (IA)
      data at Week 28 and 48 from this study will support a registration submission of canakinumab
      in the indication of SJIA in Japan.

        Inclusion Criteria

        - Confirmed diagnosis of SJIA as per ILAR definition (Petty, et al. 2004) that must have
        occurred at least 3 months prior to enrollment with an onset of disease &lt; 16 years of age:
        Arthritis in one or more joints, with or preceded by fever of at least 2 weeks duration
        that is documented to be daily/quotidian for at least 3 days and accompanied by one or more
        of the following: Rash due to SJIA,lymphadenopathy, Hepatomegaly/Splenomegaly, Serositis

          -  Active disease at the time of baseline defined as follows:

          -  At least 2 joints with active arthritis

          -  Documented spiking, intermittent fever (body temperature &gt; 38°C) for at least 1 day
             during the screening epoch and within 1 week before first canakinumab dose

          -  CRP &gt; 30 mg/L(3 mg/dL) (normal range &lt; 10 mg/L(1 mg/dL))

          -  Negative TB screen (Chest X-ray and T-SPOT test)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  With active or recurrent bacterial, fungal or viral infection at the time of
             enrollment, including patients with evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
             infection, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C infection. Patients with resolved/previous
             hepatitis B infection (a negative HBs antigen, but a positive anti-HBs antibody and/or
             anti-HBc antibody).

          -  With underlying metabolic, renal, hepatic, infectious or gastrointestinal conditions
             which in the opinion of the investigator immunocompromises the patient and /or places
             the patient at unacceptable risk for participation.

          -  With neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1500/mm3) at screening.
