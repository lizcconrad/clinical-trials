  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to determine whether mindfulness training could be more
      effective than another active intervention in reducing borderline personality disorder (BPD)
      symptoms. The main hypothesis was that patients allocated to the mindfulness group would show
      a greater improvement on global BPD symptomatology. As a second objective, we explored some
      of the possible underlying mechanisms of both active treatments. For that purpose, changes in
      decentering, mindfulness facets and cognitive processing of social interactions were also
      evaluated.

      The present study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of mindfulness skills (M) versus
      interpersonal effectiveness skills (IE) on borderline symptoms. For that purpose, a
      randomized, active-controlled clinical trial was designed. 64 participants with borderline
      personality disorder (BPD) diagnosis were allocated to mindfulness (n=32) or interpersonal
      effectiveness skills (n=32). Both interventions were delivered over a 10-week period. The
      borderline symptom list (BSL-23) was elected as the primary outcome measure. Mindfulness
      related capacities, decentering and cognitive processing of social interactions were also
      evaluated with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Experiences Questionnaire
      (EQ) and the Multidimensional Scale of Social Expression (EMES-C), respectively. Assessments
      were conducted pre and post interventions.
