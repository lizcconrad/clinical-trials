      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the oral bioavailability of two new tablet
      formulations of TAK-385 (T4 Formulation B and T4 Formulation C) under fasted and fed
      conditions, relative the T2 Formulation tablet; and to estimate the effect of food on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of the T4 Formulation B tablet and the T4
      Formulation C tablet.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-385. In this study, two new formulations of
      TAK-385 are being evaluated under fasted and fed conditions, relative to a previous
      formulation of TAK-385, to assess its bioavailability and how it is processed by the body.
      This study will look at lab results of people who take TAK-385.

      The study will enroll approximately 54 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups (Arms). Participants in Arm
      1 will receive TAK-385 T2 Formulation 120 mg tablet (80mg + 40mg tablets) under fasted
      conditions, TAK-385 T4 Formulation B 120 mg tablet under fasted conditions, and TAK-385 T4
      Formulation B 120 mg tablet under fed conditions. Participants in Arm 2 will receive TAK-385
      T2 Formulation 120 mg tablet (80mg + 40mg tablets) under fasted conditions, TAK-385 T4
      Formulation C 120 mg tablet under fasted conditions, and TAK-385 T4 Formulation C 120 mg
      tablet under fed conditions. Participants in each arm will be randomized to receive study
      drug in one of 6 treatment sequences. Study medication will be administered as a single dose
      on Days 1, 11 and 21. There will be a 10-day washout period between each dose.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 51 days. Participants will make 10 visits to the clinic,
      including three 4-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by
      telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
