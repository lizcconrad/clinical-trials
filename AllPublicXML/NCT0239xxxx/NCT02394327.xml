  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the current standard therapy for acute cholecystitis,
      but temporary decompression of the gallbladder (GB) through percutaneous or endoscopic route
      can be required to alleviate inflammatory process and reach an appropriate time for elective
      surgery in patients with high operative risk or marked local inflammation or organ
      dysfunction. Also preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is often
      needed because common bile duct (CBD) stone is accompanied in patients with acute
      cholecystitis at reported rate from 7-20%.

      Two-steps approach of percutaneous transhepatic GB drainage (PTGBD) followed by ERCP or vice
      versa has been performed for the treatment of acute cholecystitis with concomitant CBD stone
      who are not suitable for urgent cholecystectomy. However single-step drainage of CBD and GB
      through ERCP and endoscopic transpapillary GB drainage (ETGD) using nasocystic tube or
      plastic stent has alternatively been attempted in patients who have contraindications for
      PTGBD. In clinical practice, many endoscopists have hesitated to perform ETGD because of its
      relatively low technical success rate and specific concern about post-ERCP adverse event but
      it minimizes catheter keeping duration, and provides effective clinical improvement via
      physiologic route.

      Currently there are scarce data on if ETGD using nasocystic tube or plastic stent are
      comparable in terms of clinical efficacy and safety.
