      Aim: To compare prospectively two bariatric surgery techniques: sleeve gastrectomy (SG) vs
      gastric bypass (GB) in the evolution of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) measured by
      the transient elastography in the first year. Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial
      with morbidly obese patients, between 18-60 years old from a Federal Hospital, Ministry of
      Health, Brazil. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 - SG (n = 30) and group 2 - GB
      (n = 30). The randomization was made by lots. In the GB the investigators created 30 ml
      pouch, with a pancreatic and an alimentary limb of 1 meter, and a calibrated
      gastroenterostomy (1.5 cm diameter). In SG the investigators calibrated the gastric tube with
      a bougie number 32 (70 ml). The variables were compared one week before surgery and in the
      postoperative time (1, 3, 6 and 12 months). The variables were: patient anthropometry,
      laboratory tests and the transient liver elastography.
