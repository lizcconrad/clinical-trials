  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether ketamine, when given repeatedly via the nose
      (intranasally), can produce a quick and persistent improvement in PTSD symptoms. At higher
      doses, ketamine has been used for many years as an anesthetic for medical procedures, and at
      lower doses may be an effective treatment in patients with major depression and PTSD.

      The objective of the present research protocol, a parallel-arm, double-blind, randomized
      controlled clinical trial, is to test the efficacy of repeated intranasal administration of
      the glutamatergic NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine in providing (1) rapid relief of and (2)
      sustained improvement in core PTSD symptoms and co-morbid depressive symptoms in patients
      with chronic PTSD. The effects of ketamine will be compared with those of repeated intranasal
      administration of the benzodiazepine anesthetic midazolam, which mimics some of the acute
      subjective effects of ketamine but is expected to have lesser or less sustained anxiolytic
      effect, and no sustained antidepressant effect.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women, 18-65 years of age;

          -  Participants must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and
             examinations required by the protocol and must sign a written informed consent
             document;

          -  Participants must fulfill DSM-5 criteria for current civilian or combat-related PTSD,
             based on clinical assessment by a study psychiatrist and on the CAPS -this is done to
             ensure at least moderate severity and to safeguard against high placebo response
             rates;

          -  Women must be using a medically accepted reliable means of contraception (if using an
             oral contraceptive medication, they must also be using a barrier contraceptive) or not
             be of childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterile, postmenopausal for at least
             one year);

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             prior to each intranasal administration;

          -  Participants must be able to identify a family member, physician, or friend (i.e.
             someone who knows them well) who will participate in a Treatment Contract (and e.g.
             contact the study physician on their behalf in case manic symptoms or suicidal
             thoughts develop).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who plan to become pregnant, are pregnant or are breast-feeding (because the
             medical risk of using ketamine during pregnancy and breast-feeding is unknown);

          -  Serious, unstable medical illnesses such as hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic,
             respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic, or hematologic
             disease, including gastro-esophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, history
             of difficulty with airway management during previous anesthetics, ischemic heart
             disease and uncontrolled hypertension, and history of severe head injury;

          -  Clinically significant abnormal findings of laboratory parameters, physical
             examination, or ECG;

          -  Patients with uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism;

          -  Hormonal treatment (e.g., estrogen) started in the 3 months prior to the first
             intranasal administration day;

          -  Use of evidence-based individual psychotherapy (such as prolonged exposure) during the
             study;

          -  History of autism, mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorders, or
             Tourette's syndrome;

          -  History of one or more seizures without a clear and resolved etiology;

          -  History of (hypo)mania;

          -  Past or current presence of psychotic symptoms, or diagnosis of a lifetime psychotic
             disorder including schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder;

          -  Drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within the preceding 3 months; a rather narrow
             time period was chosen, however, in order to allow participation by individuals with a
             history of substance abuse or dependence problems that could be secondary to their
             PTSD, and to more closely approximate patients seen in real-world settings; this is
             the same period of time that we used in our recently completed study of IV ketamine
             for PTSD.

          -  Previous recreational use of ketamine or PCP;

          -  Current diagnosis of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa;

          -  Diagnosis of schizotypal or antisocial personality disorder (since these are known to
             reduce the possibility of study completion); other Axis II diagnoses will be allowed;

          -  Patients judged clinically to be at serious and imminent suicidal or homicidal risk.

          -  A blood pressure of one reading over 160/90 or two separate readings over 140/90 at
             screen or baseline visits

          -  Patients who report current treatment with a benzodiazepine, an opioid medication, or
             a mood stabilizer (such as valproic acid or lithium) within 2 weeks prior to
             randomization; patients taking stable doses of antidepressant medication for 3 months
             prior to randomization will be allowed.

          -  For subjects who may participate in the MRI portion of the study, claustrophobia, any
             trauma or surgery which may have left magnetic material in the body, magnetic implants
             or pacemakers, and inability to lie still for 1 hour or more.
