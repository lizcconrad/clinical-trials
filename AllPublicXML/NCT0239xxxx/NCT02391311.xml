  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a small, self-contained project to test the hypothesis
      that tDCS will augment SOP cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) in older HIV+ adults. The
      investigators will randomly assign 60 HIV+ older adults (i.e., â‰¥ 50 years old) to 10-hours in
      either a SOP CRT + sham tDCS condition (n=30) or SOP CRT + active tDCS condition (n=30) and
      examine neurocognitive functioning at baseline and 6 weeks post-intervention. Hypothesis 1:
      The SOP CRT + active tDCS condition will show larger proximal (i.e., SOP) gains than the SOP
      CRT + sham tDCS condition. Hypothesis 2: The active tDCS condition will demonstrate
      generalization to secondary neurocognitive domains compared to the sham tDCS condition.

    <measure>Change in the Processing of Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 week posttest</time_frame>
    <description>Computerized and paper &amp; pencil processing speed measures were used to evaluate this outcome. The Letter and Pattern Comparison Tasks are traditional paper and pencil (SOP) measures. Specifically, they assess perceptual speed. In Letter Comparison subjects are shown three sets of 32 pairs of letters containing 3, 6, or 9 segments. The participants are instructed to decide whether the patterns between the pairs are the same or different within each set, with a time limit of 20 sec per set. Pattern Comparison also presents three sets of 32 pairs of patterns with 3, 6, or 9 line segments. Similarly, participants are instructed to decide whether the patterns are the same or different within the 20 sec time limit. For each measure, the total score is the number of correct answers from all three sets. Larger scores indicate better reasoning and cognitive functioning. In this study scores from Letter and Pattern Comparison were combined for a total Letter/Pattern Score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Driving Simulator Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 week posttest</time_frame>
    <description>Driving Simulator Performance: Center lane crossings (a count of how many times an individual crosses the centerline during the entire simulator drive). A difference score was taken between time 2 and time 1 and compared between treatment groups (sham condition and tDCS condition). A negative difference score indicates that fewer center line crossings were made at time 2 than time 1, while positive difference scores indicate the opposite direction, and scores of 0 represent no change.</description>

        <title>Change in the Processing of Speed</title>
        <description>Computerized and paper &amp; pencil processing speed measures were used to evaluate this outcome. The Letter and Pattern Comparison Tasks are traditional paper and pencil (SOP) measures. Specifically, they assess perceptual speed. In Letter Comparison subjects are shown three sets of 32 pairs of letters containing 3, 6, or 9 segments. The participants are instructed to decide whether the patterns between the pairs are the same or different within each set, with a time limit of 20 sec per set. Pattern Comparison also presents three sets of 32 pairs of patterns with 3, 6, or 9 line segments. Similarly, participants are instructed to decide whether the patterns are the same or different within the 20 sec time limit. For each measure, the total score is the number of correct answers from all three sets. Larger scores indicate better reasoning and cognitive functioning. In this study scores from Letter and Pattern Comparison were combined for a total Letter/Pattern Score.</description>

        <population>n=33 subjects were included in final analyses. Of the 37 that completed the study, 4 were deemed ineligible after they had completed the study due to confirmation with medical records they had conditions that may affect neurocognition (stroke and schizophrenia) although they self reported on the screen they did not have these conditions.</population>

transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): tDCS is a low level electrical stimulation that will be applied to F10. The sham group will receive 2 mA (milliamps) for 30 seconds, while the experimental group will receive 2 mA for 20 minutes.

A difference score was taken between time 2 and time 1 and compared between treatment groups (sham condition and tDCS condition). A negative difference score indicates that fewer center line crossings were made at time 2 than time 1, while positive difference scores indicate the opposite direction, and scores of 0 represent no change.</description>
