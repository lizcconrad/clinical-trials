      OroDental anomalies are one of the phenotypical aspects of at least 900 rare diseases or
      syndromes affecting by definition less than 1 in 2000 individual within the population
      (almost 25 million persons in Europe).

      They are often described in association with other organs or system malformations, which is
      understandable, because the same genes and signalling pathways regulate the oral cavity
      formation or odontogenesis and the development of other organs. The various dental and
      orofacial anomalies can be classified by type (anomalies of tooth number, shape, size,
      structures of mineralized tissues, eruption, resorption, tumors; anomalies of oral mucosa;
      anomalies of tongue…), by signalling pathways and by syndrome families.

      These anomalies (for example hypodontia/oligodontia, amelogenesis imperfecta, dentinogenesis
      imperfecta…) become increasingly identified as diagnostic and predictive traits. Not only is
      it important to recognise, name appropriately and integrate these dysmorphic clues into the
      patient dysmorphology analysis but it is essential to synthesize the observations and
      confront them to existing data about similar orodental anomalies encountered in some of the
      corresponding mutant mouse models.

      Translational approaches in development and medicine, are relevant to gain understanding of
      molecular events underlying clinical manifestations and to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

      The aim of this study is to improve the knowledge, diagnosis and care of oral cavity
      pathologies encountered in rare diseases via the identification and gathering of national and
      international patient cohorts and to structure the molecular diagnosis behind these
      conditions via targeted next-generation sequencing assays. Data collection is implemented on
      validated accredited tools (databases) complying with the legal regulations about patient
      data protection and medical record collection. All information is anonymized.

      New effective diagnosis and therapeutic tools are being developed.
