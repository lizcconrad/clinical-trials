  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an infectious inflammatory disease. Bacteria modulate the inflammatory
      response and alter the diversity of periodontal disease. In recent years, various
      host-response modulation therapies have been developed to block the pathways responsible for
      periodontal tissue breakdown.

      There have been significant changes with respect to the effectiveness of, and attitudes
      towards conventional antimicrobial therapy to combat disease. With the threat of widespread
      antibiotic resistance rendering many antibiotics useless against important diseases, there is
      an increased necessity not only to minimise antibiotic use and develop novel
      non-antibiotic-based treatments, but also to raise the profile of disease prevention. One
      approach that has gained interest over recent years is the use of probiotic bacteria for oral
      applications. The rationale for their use in oral health care stems from the increase in
      evidence that supports their claims for benefit for a range of diseases. Lactobacilli play an
      important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating the natural immunity as well as by
      contributing to the balance of the microflora, by interacting with the other members of the
      flora. The application of health promoting bacteria for therapeutic purposes, is one of the
      strongest emerging fields. Time has come to shift the paradigm of the treatment from specific
      bacteria elimination to alteration of the bacterial ecology by using probiotics.

      So the purpose of this study is to discover a more promising approach for the treatment of
      chronic periodontitis .
