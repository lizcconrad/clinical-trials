  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patient receiving AC regimen chemotherapy (Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide) who
      has nausea score from 40/100 VAS or vomiting after the first or second cycle of chemotherapy
      is recruited. The patient who meets the eligibility criteria and provides informed consent is
      randomised to receive either Ginger capsule (500 mg) or placebo taking twice a day by mouth
      during the first 5 days of chemotherapy cycle. The study drug will be switched on the
      subsequent cycle (i.e. the patient who received Ginger capsule will receive placebo and vice
      versa). The primary outcome is the nausea score and vomiting during the first 5 days of each
      chemotherapy cycle when receiving the study drug.
