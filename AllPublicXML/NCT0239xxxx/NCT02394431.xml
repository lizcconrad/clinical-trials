  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease is a serious disease that is life-threatening for patients being
      homozygous for the SS form or heterozygous for the SC or βthal forms. The CHU Brugmann
      hospital currently regularly treats about 70 homozygous adult patients and this number is in
      constant augmentation.

      Sickle cell disease patients may develop a cardiomyopathy due to chronic anemia, the
      haemosiderosis risk or, less frequently, to coronary vaso-occlusive damages.

      The hypervolemia in patients with sickle cell disease causes an overestimation of the ejected
      left ventricular fraction measured by echocardiography, this parameter being very dependent
      of the blood volume.It has already been shown that the left ventricular ejection fraction was
      normal in most patients with sickle cell disease, but that its evaluation by parameters
      independent from the blood volume showed the existence of a dysfunction.

      Myocardial strain, as measured by speckle tracking, is a echographic evaluation method of the
      cardiac function, independent of the blood volume. This technique hasn't been used much in
      sickle cell disease patients. A study using 3D speckle tracking on a limited number of sickle
      cell disease patients failed to show a strain anomaly. Moreover, the study highlighted a
      higher global longitudinal strain in this patient population. The investigators find these
      data hard to explain and in contradiction with previous studies using other cardiac function
      evaluation techniques, independent from the blood volume.

      The primary goal of this study is thus

        -  to study the longitudinal strain by 2D echography

        -  to determine if anomalies of the longitudinal strain exist in sickle cell disease
           patients with a normal ejected left ventricular fraction, compared to a control group of
           healthy patients.

      The secondary goal of this study is to correlate, inside the sickle cell disease group, the
      possible strain anomalies with biological gravity parameters of the disease.
