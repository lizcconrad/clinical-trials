      This prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial will evaluate the
      validity and security of 2500ml Huaren Peritoneal Dialysate compared with normal 2000ml
      peritoneal dialysate.

    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of important way of renal replacement treatment worldwide. In
      China, about 40,000 patients suffered from end stage renal disease treated with PD, and most
      of them used imported dialysate, of which the price carried a great burden. Now, cheaper
      domestic dialysate is accessed to the ESRD patients in china, but the efficacy and safety of
      which are not fully clear. And according to researches from Hongkong, 6000ml of dialysate
      every day is able to. Thus, we presume 3 bags of 2500ml Huaren dialysate will satisfy the
      everyday need of an normal Asian. This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled,
      multi-center study. Patients in treatment group will use 2-3 bags of 2500ml Huaren dialysate
      in the daytime and keep 1 bag of 2500ml Huaren dialysate in the night, while those in control
      group will use 3-4 bags of normal 2000ml dialysate in the daytime and keep 1 bag of 2000ml
      dialysate in the night for 12 weeks. After followed-up for 12 weeks, the adequacy of PD,
      residual kidney function , peritoneum function and QOL of patients will be evaluated.
