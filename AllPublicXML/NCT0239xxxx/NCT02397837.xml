  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Converging evidence suggests that patients with bipolar disorder suffer from deficits in
      neurocognitive functioning that persist, despite remission of acute affective symptoms. These
      impairments contribute directly to functional disability, highlighting the need for
      interventions above and beyond standard treatments in order to achieve a full inter-episode
      recovery. The current study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of a dopamine agonist
      (pramipexole), on these persistent cognitive abnormalities in euthymic bipolar patients using
      a placebo-controlled, adjunctive, 12-week trial design.

      All eligible participants will undergo study visits at screening, baseline (week 0), week 1,
      week 2, week 3, week 4, week 6, week 8, and week 12, (end of study).

      Randomization will be conducted via a computer generated program and all study staff will be
      blinded unless un-blinding is required for safety reasons. Subjects will be randomized on a
      1:1 ratio with stratification for concomitant antipsychotic status and depression at baseline
      (HRSD &lt;8 vs &gt; 8). Study drug will be blinded and matched to placebo. Adapting from our
      previous work in BD and according to package labeling, the dosage titration schedule will be
      slow and flexible. Dosing will be initiated at 0.25 mg QHS on night one, followed by 0.25 mg
      BID day two onward, and increased every week to a target of 4.5 mg/day. As compared with our
      previous maximum 1.5 mg/day (Burdick et al. 2012), we opted to allow up to 4.5 mg/day (the
      maximum approved dosage in Parkinson's disease) to ensure adequate target engagement. We are
      familiar with this dose range, as 4.5 mg/day was allowed in our study in BD depression
      (Goldberg et al. 2004). Dosing will be flexible based on side effects; however, if 1.5 mg/day
      cannot be tolerated, the subject will be discontinued. Titration will occur up to week 6 and
      then efforts will be made to maintain the same dose until the completion of the trial (week
      12).

             accepted means of contraception (including oral contraceptive or implant, condom,
             diaphragm, spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or partner with vasectomy)

          -  Women who are breastfeeding
