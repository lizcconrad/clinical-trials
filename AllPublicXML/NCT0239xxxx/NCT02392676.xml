      Olaparib administered as monotherapy in the maintenance setting improves progression free
      survival compared to placebo in patients whose tumours carry loss of function (deleterious or
      suspected deleterious) somatic BRCA mutations or loss of function (deleterious or suspected
      deleterious) mutation in non-BRCA Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) -associated genes who
      have a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

      This is a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study to
      assess the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy in relapsed high grade epithelial
      ovarian cancer patients (including patients with primary peritoneal and / or fallopian tube
      cancer) who have responded following platinum based chemotherapy. The study population will
      be enrolled as two separate cohorts that will enrol simultaneously. The confirmatory cohort
      will consist of patients who carry a somatic BRCA mutation (documented mutation in BRCA1 or
      BRCA2 that is predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious) which are detected in
      tumour material but absent from germline blood testing ; the exploratory cohort will include
      patients with a mutation (documented mutation predicted to be deleterious or suspected
      deleterious) in non BRCA HRR-associated genes which are detected in tumour material
      regardless of their germline status.

    Study is unlikely to be feasible given the evolving ovarian cancer landscape and alternative
