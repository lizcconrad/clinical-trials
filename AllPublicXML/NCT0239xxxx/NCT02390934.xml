    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II single-arm study is to evaluate the efficacy of Radium-223 in
      treating bone lesions from differentiated thyroid cancer that are I-131 refractory. Based on
      the results of the phase III trial, the protocol using an injection of Radium-223 activity of
      50 kBq/kg b.w. given 6 times at 4 weeks interval will be applied. The end point of this study
      will be the evaluation of Radium-223 efficacy one month after 3 administrations, i.e. at 3
      months after the first injection. If disease progression at that time is excluded, patients
      will be treated with 3 further injections for a total of 6 administrations of Radium-223. The
      principal response criterion at 3 and 6 months will be the metabolic response on FDG PET/CT,
      but other imaging techniques will also be performed: axial skeleton MRI, 99mTc-HMDP bone scan
      and FNa PET/CT. Axial skeleton MRI is the reference for soft tissue study. 99mTc- HMDP bone
      scan is the most used and available routine tool to detect bone metastases in cancer
      patients, but its sensitivity in patients with bone metastases from thyroid cancer is low,
      because most lesions are lytic [23]. 18FNa PET/CT shows higher sensitivity than 99mTc-HMDP
      bone scan to detect bone lesions in cancer patients and is able to detect micrometastases
      that are not seen on bone scan [24] [25]. Preliminary results show some interest of using
      this tracer to evaluate the sclerotic component of bone metastases from thyroid cancer [26].
      Furthermore preliminary data show that FNa PET/CT can be useful to quantify response to
      Radium-223 in prostate cancer. In only five patients evaluated by FNa PET/CT at baseline, 6
      weeks and 12 weeks after 100 KBq/Kg of Radium-223, semiquantitative analysis by SUV max
      showed a relationship between PSA and SUV max level decrease in 3 patients (-44%, -31%, -27%
      vs -52%, -75, and -49% respectively) [27].

      Finally bone metastases that are visible on morphological imaging (CT scan or on RI) are
      frequently submitted to local treatment modalities, and this may induce fibrosis and
      recalcification. Therefore, already treated metastases and not treated metastases will be
      studied separately as two separate subgroups of target lesions.
