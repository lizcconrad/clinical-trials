  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of continuos exercise
      training (CET) and interval exercise trainining (IET) on oxygen uptake efficiency slope
      (OUES) in patients with coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) is a submaximal index that incorporates
      cardiovascular, peripheral and pulmonary factors that determine ventilatory response to
      exercise. There is scarce information about the effects of the mode and intensity of exercise
      training on OUES in patients with coronary artery disease.
