  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a self-administered vibration
      therapy treatment on neck pain, disability and pressure pain thresholds in patients with
      non-specific neck pain and myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). The investigators hypothesized
      that patients receiving vibration therapy would report less perceived neck pain, disability
      and present higher PPTs after receiving vibration therapy when compared to a control
      no-treatment group.

      Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) are a common source of (regional) pain in patients
      presenting with musculoskeletal pain. Mechanical vibration has been suggested as a treatment
      for pain relief. In this study, the effects of vibration therapy on people with non-specific
      neck pain and MTrPs were investigated. Seventeen chronic non-specific neck pain patients were
      randomly assigned to a treatment (vibration group, n = 9) or control group (n = 8). Vibration
      group received 10 self-administered sessions of vibration therapy (45-50 Hz for 15 minutes
      with the subject laying in supine). Perceived neck pain and disability and pressure pain
      thresholds over MTrPs of the upper trapezius and levator scapulae bilateraly were measured at
      baseline and after the first, five and 10 treatment sessions.
