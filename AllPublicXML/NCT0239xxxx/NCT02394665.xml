  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In summary, the overall prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) patients remains poor. Although
      clinical gains have been achieved in the past, these have been modest, with a majority of
      patients succumbing to local disease progression within 2 years. New strategies for treatment
      need to be identified which enhance local control above the current treatment regimen in
      order to achieve further clinical gains in this disease. Favorable early experience with
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) demonstrates that metabolic imaging can
      identify active tumor beyond standard MRI as well as high risk regions at risk for local
      failure. There is also clinical evidence that limited field dose escalation with either
      simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is feasible and safe.
      Coupling these findings provide the rationale for this proposed Phase II trial designed to
      define efficacy and toxicity of the novel treatment approach of whole brain volumetric 3D
      MRSI guided dose-escalated radiation therapy (RT) in newly diagnosed GBM patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study will investigate efficacy and safety of volumetric 3D MRSI-directed
      treatment for newly diagnosed GBM patients. This study will enroll 48 patients in order to
      obtain at least 40 patients receiving RT and temozolomide. Depending on the size and number
      of HTVs, a patient will receive either simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) with IMRT (Group
      1) or SRS boost followed by IMRT 1 week later (Group 2). Duration of enrollment will be 2
      years and minimum follow-up will be 2 years.

      The duration of treatment and follow-up will occur as follows:

        -  Six weeks of RT with concurrent Temozolomide treatment;

        -  3D MRSI at week 3 and at the end of RT;

        -  28 day break;

        -  Adjuvant treatment with Temozolomide administered daily on days 1-5 of each cycle, for
           up to 12 cycles (one cycle = 28 days) which will include standard gadolinium enhanced
           MRI and 3D MRSI prior to cycle 1, 5, 9, and post cycle 12 of adjuvant Temozolomide;

        -  Active follow-up at least every three months for one year after the end of adjuvant
           Temozolomide treatment;

        -  After one year follow-up for survival will occur every three months for one year.

             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel
             resection)

         13. Contraindications to MRI including but not limited to, pacemaker, aneurysm clips,
             neurostimulators, cochlear implants, metal in eyes, steelworker or other implants

         14. Need to continue treatment with any prohibited medication (e.g. antioxidants) or have
             not completed the appropriate washout period.

        <title>Patterns of Failure in Study Participants Post-Protocol Therapy</title>
        <description>Patterns of Failure will be assessed by determining the number of failures that arise in-field compared to the number that arise out–of-field. In-field failure will be defined as those where greater than 80% of the recurrence volume was encompassed by the 95% prescription isodose line. In addition, we will also describe failures by three types: unifocal, multifocal and diffuse (multicentric including leptomeningeal dissemination).</description>

        <population>Data were not analyzed due to insufficient number of evaluable subjects. Only one subject enrolled who was later withdrawn by the Investigator prior to assignment to any treatment group or receiving any protocol therapy.</population>
