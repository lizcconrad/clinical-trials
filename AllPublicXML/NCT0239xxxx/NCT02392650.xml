  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hominids and hominins serve as remarkable hosts to microbes, and we have co-evolved over the
      past 4.5 million years as highly plethoric communities. Human-associated microorganisms (the
      &quot;microbiome&quot;) are present in numbers exceeding the quantities of human cells by at least
      10-fold beginning in the neonatal period. The collective genome (the &quot;metagenome&quot;) exceeds
      our human genome in terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. With respect to microbiota
      and preterm birth, it has generally assumed that the majority of intrauterine infections
      originate in the lower genital tract, with microbiota ascending into the otherwise sterile
      intrauterine environment to infect the placenta (preterm birth), fetal membranes
      (chorioamnionitis), umbilical cord (funisitis), and the fetus (sepsis). However, we and
      others have recently demonstrated that the vaginal and gut microbiome communities are
      distinctly structured in pregnancy, and the placenta is in fact not sterile, but rather
      harbors a low-abundance microbiome which is likely acquired through hematogenous transmission
      of the oral microbiome.

      Based on our prior studies and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that a distinct
      and largely commensal resident microbiome in pregnancy renders risk for preterm birth. By
      utilizing our state-of-the-science technology and analysis tools in a longitudinal
      case-cohort of preterm birth subjects, we will be able to transform &quot;discovery based&quot;
      metagenomics and multi'omics science into readily translatable mechanistic studies at a
      previously unparalleled level.

      Specific Aim 1. Longitudinal maternal (vaginal, oral, skin, gut), fetal (oral, skin, gut) and
      placental (basal plate and parenchyma) 16S-based metagenomic profiling with inferred
      metagenomics will reveal distinct microbial communities in association with preterm birth.
      Methods: We will enroll 526 at-risk gravidae to yield an approximated 135 preterm births with
      401 at-risk term controls. Starting in the first/early second trimester, we will sample
      multiple body sites (vagina, oral, stool, placenta) at multiple time points (antenatal
      through delivery), isolate microbial DNA, and perform 16S-based determination of
      niche-specific microbial communities found in association with preterm birth. With our
      case-cohort longitudinal design, we will be able to apply our well-developed supervised
      learning approaches to reveal which taxa contribute to risk of preterm birth, and at what
      body sites and gestational ages they are predictive of preterm birth.

      Specific Aim 2. Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomics from selected subjects and body sites
      will enable species identification, generation of microbial gene catalogues, and metabolic
      reconstructions to determine the structure, function and diversity of the preterm birth
      microbiome. Methods: To probe metabolic functionality and describe pathogen-related
      mechanisms, we will analyze changes in total gene content using shotgun metagenomics on a
      subset of samples. We will build on our functional computational pipelines to fully
      characterize targeted subjects' metagenomic signatures.

      Specific Aim 3. Integrated host genomics, metatranscriptomics and metabonomics data will
      reveal molecular mechanisms and networks underlying preterm birth in a limited subset of
      samples. Methods: We will interrogate and integrate our concomitantly acquired clinical
      metadata, microbial and host gene expression data (RNA-Seq metatranscriptomics), and
      metabonomics profiling with advanced computational and biostatistical approaches. We will be
      guided in our choice of subjects by our data from Aims 1 and 2.
