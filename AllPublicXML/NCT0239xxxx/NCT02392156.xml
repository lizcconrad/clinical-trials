  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic treatment
      with recombinant Factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) and recombinant Factor IX Fc fusion
      protein (rFIXFc) therapy as assessed by patient treatment burden and health economic outcomes
      while maintaining disease control in males with hemophilia A or B.

    <measure>Change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM V2 is a 11-item instrument designed to measure participants' satisfaction with medication within the past 2 to 3 weeks, or since their last medication use. Treatment satisfaction is assessed through side effects, effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction scale domains.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hemophilia Activities List (HAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>HAL is an instrument designed to measure and quantify a participant's perceived functional ability to perform activities in daily life. The HAL consists of 42 multiple choice questions within seven domains: lying/sitting/kneeling/standing, function of legs, function of arms, use of transportation, self-care, household tasks, and leisure activities.</description>

    <description>WPAI and classroom impairment questionnaire version is a 9-item questionnaire designed to measure hemophilia-related impairment in work, school, and activity level within the past 7 days. Visual analogue scales and fill-in responses are used to compute scores for absenteeism, impairment at work/school, losses in work/school productivity, and activity impairment based on scoring algorithms and presented as impairment percentages. Higher percentages indicate greater disease-related impairment</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Missed planned activity and productivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of these free standing questions are to capture any missed activities due to hemophilia that are not captured in other questionnaires included in the study, especially among children and adolescents.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this survey is to assess how the intensive nature of caring for a hemophilia patient affects caregiver burden, providing scores on the following scales: Emotional burden, financial burden, lifestyle, social burden, and positive emotions. This will be completed by caregivers of children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age.</description>

          -  Have a prior history of anaphylaxis associated with any factor VIII (FVIII)/ factor IX
             (FIX) or intravenous immunoglobin administration

          -  Had an inhibitor within 5 years before the Baseline visit. Note: A family history of
             inhibitors will not exclude the patient.

          -  Past or current treatment with any factor replacement product with a prolonged
