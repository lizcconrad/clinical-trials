      The overall aim of this study is to create a trans-disciplinary chronic disease continuity of
      care model with health information technology, utilizing mobile devices such as tablets,
      iPads and smartphones.

      This study aims to explore if a trans-disciplinary chronic disease continuity of care model
      with integrated technology (mobile devices such as tablets, iPads and smartphones) to
      standard practice (patient-centered, coordinated care model without the integration of
      technology) will results in a reduction in 30-day readmission rate in adult patients.
