    <textblock>
      Recurrent upper respiratory infections ( RURTIs) are common in school aged children. An
      adequate iron status might reduce their prevalence. The aim of the study is to assess the
      percentage and type of RURTIs in Egyptian school children, assessing the percentage of iron
      deficiency anemia (IDA) and the effect of iron supplementation on the recurrence and severity
      of upper respiratory tract infections .

      This is a prospective interventional study in which 1000 Children (6-15 years) are recruited
      from two schools in urban Cairo; three months enrollment was done in early autumn ; students
      defined to have RURTIs were screened by Hemocue; if anemic (Hb &lt; 11.5gm/dL),Complete blood
      picture and iron profile were done, they were enrolled into 2 groups: (A)children with IDA on
      oral iron fumerate therapy (6mg/kg/d) for 3 months, then maintained on oral iron (1mg/kg/d)
      for 12 months, and (B) Non anemic group; were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio into: group
      (B1)children Received maintenance iron therapy for 12 months and group (B2) received placebo.
      Recurrence and severity of URTIs using (CARIFS score) throughout the study are recorded
