      This project is designed to begin to characterize the abnormalities of glucagon secretion in
      subjects with cystic fibrosis related diabetes along the spectrum of glucose tolerance.
      Cystic fibrosis patients with normal glucose tolerance as well as cystic fibrosis related
      diabetes as well as control subjects will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test, mixed meal
      tolerance test, and one step hypoglycemic clamp. Cystic fibrosis patients will then return 12
      months later to undergo repeat mixed meal tolerance test and hypoglycemic clamp test.

      This project is designed to begin to characterize the abnormalities of glucagon secretion in
      subjects with cystic fibrosis related diabetes along the spectrum of glucose tolerance. This
      will be a descriptive, cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study in a sample of children
      and young adults with CF and a continuum of glucose tolerance compared to healthy age-matched
      controls.

      Cystic fibrosis patients with normal glucose tolerance as well as cystic fibrosis related
      diabetes as well as control subjects will be admitted to the research unit on three separate
      occasions to undergo an oral glucose tolerance test, mixed meal tolerance test, and one step
      hypoglycemic clamp. Cystic fibrosis patients will then return 12 months later to undergo
      repeat mixed meal tolerance test and hypoglycemic clamp test.

    <description>Subjects will be instructed to fast after midnight the night prior to the study. Subjects will be admitted to the research unit on the morning of the test for placement of blood-drawing IV for frequent sampling. Patients will drink 1.75 gm/kg glucose (Glucola) to a maximum of 75 gm. Venous samples for glucose and c-peptide will be drawn from the IV at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Subjects will be instructed to eat at least 75 gm carbohydrates daily in the week prior to this test.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of CF by clinical or genetic determination

          -  Normal glucose tolerance or CFRD

          -  Subjects routinely taking systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids on stable regimen are
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with active pulmonary infection requiring supplemental doses of
             corticosteroids

          -  Use of any oral diabetes medications

          -  Subjects who are pregnant/lactating

          -  Subjects with poor compliance with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy

        Control Subjects:

        Approximately 10 control subjects who are matched for age, gender, are expected to be
        enrolled in the study. Non-CF subjects must be &gt;12 years old, in good health and not taking
        any medications or have any medical problems the doctor feels would prevent the subject
        from completing the study and have BMI between 15-85% for age and gender. Control subjects
        whose fasting blood glucose is found to be &gt;110 mg/dL will not be continued in the study.
