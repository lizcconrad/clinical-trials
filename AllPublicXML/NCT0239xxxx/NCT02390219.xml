      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LUM/IVA combination
      therapy in subjects 12 years and older with CF and advanced lung disease and who are
      homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>AE: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant during the study; event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. This includes any newly occurring event/previous condition that has increased in severity/frequency after informed consent form is signed. AE includes serious as well as non-serious AEs. SAE (subset of AE): medical event, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event. TEAEs: AEs that started/ worsened on/after the start of study drug through the Safety Follow up Visit (4 weeks after the last dose of study drug). Results were reported as planned, as a combined single LUM/IVA arm irrespective of permitted dose modification.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Up to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Hankinson and Wang standards were used to calculate percent predicted FEV1 (for age, gender, and height). The Hankinson standard was used for male participants 18 years and older and female participants 16 years and older. The Wang standard was used for male participants aged 12 to 17 years and for female participants aged 12 to 15 years. Results were reported as planned, as a combined single LUM/IVA arm irrespective of permitted dose modification.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Hankinson and Wang standards were used to calculate FEV1 (for age, gender, race, and height). The Hankinson standard was used for male participants 18 years and older and female participants 16 years and older. The Wang standard was used for male participants aged 12 to 17 years and for female participants aged 12 to 15 years.

    <measure>Duration For Which Participants Received Intravenous (IV) Antibiotics</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The duration for which participants received IV antibiotics for sinopulmonary signs and symptoms were reported. Results were reported as planned, as a combined single LUM/IVA arm irrespective of permitted dose modification.</description>

    <measure>Number of Hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24</time_frame>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Sweat Chloride at Average of Day 15 and Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 15 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Sweat samples were collected using an approved collection device. Baseline was defined as the average of the measurements at screening and on Day 1 pre-dose. The average absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was derived as: (Average of Day 15 and Week 4 value) minus Baseline value. Results were reported as planned, as a combined single LUM/IVA arm irrespective of permitted dose modification.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Domain Score Through Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R is a validated participant-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for participants with cystic fibrosis. Respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms (for example, coughing, congestion, wheezing), the scaled score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and better health-related quality of life. Results were reported as planned, as a combined single LUM/IVA arm irrespective of permitted dose modification.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Up to Week 24</title>
        <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Hankinson and Wang standards were used to calculate percent predicted FEV1 (for age, gender, and height). The Hankinson standard was used for male participants 18 years and older and female participants 16 years and older. The Wang standard was used for male participants aged 12 to 17 years and for female participants aged 12 to 15 years. Results were reported as planned, as a combined single LUM/IVA arm irrespective of permitted dose modification.</description>
