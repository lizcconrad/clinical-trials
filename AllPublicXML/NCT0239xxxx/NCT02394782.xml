  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-month, observational, prospective, multinational, multicenter study to determine
      the relationship between the relapse (percentage of relapse free subjects) and adherence in
      subjects diagnosed with RRMS treated with Rebif (interferon beta-1a) using the RebiSmart®2.0
      and MSdialog™.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Relapse-free Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse is defined as an increase of 2 points in at least one functional system of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) or an increase of 1 point in at least two functional systems (excluding changes in bowel or bladder function or cognition) in the absence of fever, lasting for at least 24 hours and to have been preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability or improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized Relapse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Annualized relapse rate is calculated as the total number of confirmed relapses divided by the total number of days on study multiplied by 365.25.</description>

    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life (MusiQoL) and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) Subscale Scores for MSdialog™</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Normalized scores are calculated in the range of 0 - 100; where 0 = the worst QoL status and 100 = the best QoL status (as self-assessed by the subject).</description>
