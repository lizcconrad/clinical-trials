  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin C with its antioxidant role has many indications. The objective of this study is to
      demonstrate that taking vitamin C as a preventive significantly reduces the occurrence of
      complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1 in the aftermath of a scheduled surgery of the
      upper limb.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The preventive role of vitamin C on the development of CRPS type 1 was already demonstrated
      in traumatology and foot surgery.

      The management of CRPS type 1 is long and expensive. A preventive care seems beneficial. Some
      studies already performed suggest a similar role in scheduled surgery of the upper limb,
      major provider of CRPS type 1.The aim of the study is to demonstrate a significant reduction
      of CRPS 1 when taking vitamin C during the perioperative period in upper limb surgery. It is
      a prospective, randomized, double-blind, with placebo use, in two parallel group, multicenter
      and national. Patients are followed by their surgeon, under the terms of monitoring their
      disease. Two visits are required: one at 6 months and at 12 months. The patients will be
      reviewed at least in the two consultations looking for CRPS type 1 according to the criteria
      of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)
