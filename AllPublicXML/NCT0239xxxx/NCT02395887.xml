  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High percentage of chronic back pain is due to spinal stenosis. The clinical picture is of
      'neurogenic claudication' which effects postural balance and stability. If conservative
      treatment fail to improve symptoms, an invasive treatment which includes spinal decompression
      can be done.

      The research is an observational prospective one, pre and post operational intervention. The
      aim is to examine whether an operational intervention improves quality of life, pain,
      postural balance an stability among patients.

      It's important to clarify, that although there is operational intervention, the research is
      observational. The decision weather to operate or not, is not a part of the research. The
      investigators assume that since there is a population that independently going through an
      operation, the investigators can observe this population and evaluate different aspects of
      the operation outcomes.
