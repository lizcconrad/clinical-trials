  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to Household air pollution (HAP) from burning biomass fuels is responsible for an
      estimated 2.5 million premature deaths and 3.7% of the loss of disability-adjusted life years
      (DALY) every year in developing countries.52-54 Of all environmental risks, such as unsafe
      water, poor sanitation, climate change and lead exposure, HAP accounts for the most mortality
      and DALY.55 Despite the magnitude of the problems associated with HAP, research on its health
      effects has been hindered by lack of accurate data on exposure and health outcomes. There are
      few studies available that report HAP exposures and development of adverse pregnancy outcomes
      from households using biomass fuels.
