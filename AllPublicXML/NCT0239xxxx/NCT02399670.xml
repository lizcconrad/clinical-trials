      The femoral-offset (FO) is one of the important perioperative parameters in THA. A
      prospective cohort study was conducted between September 2010 and December 2013. All patients
      with unilateral primary osteoarthritis (OA) treated with THA were considered for inclusion.
      Patients with secondary OA, previous spinal, pelvic, or lower limb injuries or fractures were
      excluded. Global FO was measured in each patient within 3 months before the THA and at the
      second postoperative day using a standardized protocol. According to the postoperative
      measurement, patients were divided into three groups: 1) the decreased FO group, where the FO
      of operated side was reduced more than 5mm compared with the contralateral side, 2) the
      restored FO group, where the FO of operated side was within 5mm restored compared with the
      contralateral side, and 3) the increased FO group, where the FO of operated side was
      increased more than 5mm compared with the contralateral side.

      Patients were followed-up at 12 - 15 months postoperatively with self-administered WOMAC and
      EQ-5D questionnaires in addition to a clinical assessment with palpation of the operated hip
      and measurement of the abductor muscle strength.

      The results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) have shown great improvement during the last
      decades in terms of function, quality of life and prosthetic survival. Beside pain relief,
      surgeons aim to position the stem and cup in a correct manner to restore the biomechanical
      forces and range of motion of the operated hip. The femoral-offset (FO) is one of the
      important perioperative parameters in THA. A prospective cohort study was conducted between
      September 2010 and December 2013. All patients with unilateral primary osteoarthritis (OA)
      treated with THA were considered for inclusion. Patients with secondary OA, previous spinal,
      pelvic, or lower limb injuries or fractures were excluded. Global FO was measured in each
      patient within 3 months before the THA and at the second postoperative day using a
      standardized protocol. According to the postoperative measurement, patients were divided into
      three groups: 1) the decreased FO group, where the FO of operated side was reduced more than
      5mm compared with the contralateral side, 2) the restored FO group, where the FO of operated
      side was within 5mm restored compared with the contralateral side, and 3) the increased FO
      group, where the FO of operated side was increased more than 5mm compared with the
      contralateral side.

      Patients were followed-up at 12 - 15 months postoperatively with self-administered WOMAC and
      EQ-5D questionnaires in addition to a clinical assessment. Patients completed an additional
      questionnaire enquiring about any residual problems with the use of walking aid and residual
      pain around the operated hip. During the clinical assessment, palpation of the operated hip
      and measurement of the abductor muscle strength were undertaken.
