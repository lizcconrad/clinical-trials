      A register system of oral and maxillofacial malignant tumors based on a prospective,
      observational, real-world study in north Chinese population was absent.

      The aim of the study is to construct a register system of oral and maxillofacial malignant
      tumors based on a prospective, observational, real-world study in Chinese population. The
      variables in the study include social informatics, etiology, and psychological and quality of
      life, coexistence disease, baseline clinicopathological data, postoperative complications,
      and long-term follow-up results.

      By released annual analysis report, the epidemiological features and prognostic factors of
      oral and maxillofacial malignant tumors in north Chinese population can be identified.

      Investigators plan to retrieve the fresh and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens after primary
      tumors are resected from the biobank in Department of Oral and Maxillofacial-Head and Neck
      Oncology, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, Capital Medical University during the whole study
      phase. The total number of fresh and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens are approximately
      1000. Specimen types include non-cancerous matched tissues and cancer tissues. These
      specimens will be used to complete the analysis of genetics and epigenetics in the further
      study.
