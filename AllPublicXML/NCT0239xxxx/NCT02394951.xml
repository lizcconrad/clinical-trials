  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to investigate certain patient characteristics that would predict the
      response to a currently approved analgesic, pregabalin, in patients with chronic pain due to
      nerve damage caused by chemotherapy. Patients with this painful condition, called
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) have a current or recent history of
      chemotherapy with particular chemotherapy agents called taxanes or oxaliplatin. The
      investigators will recruit potential subjects from both the Siteman Cancer Center and the
      Washington University Pain Management Center. Those patients who meet the inclusion and
      satisfy the exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo mechanical and thermal
      sensitivity testing on their extremities, will provide quality of life information by
      completing questionnaires and will receive pregabalin followed by placebo, or placebo
      followed by pregabalin [crossover design] in order to assess how well the sensory tests
      predict the analgesic effect of pregabalin (compared to placebo).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;18

          2. Distal symmetric pain distribution (both feet, with or without pain in hands).

          3. The pain appeared during or up to 12 weeks after treatment with oxaliplatin,
             paclitaxel, docetaxel or any combination of these.

          4. Score of 4 or more on DN4 (Douleur Neuropathique 4) neuropathic pain questionnaire

          5. Pain duration &gt; 2 months.

          6. Patient report of average daily pain intensity in the last week &gt;3 on 0-10 Numerical
             Rating Scale (NRS).

          7. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for

               -  Subjects treated with gabapentin or other anticonvulsant for neuropathic pain
                  will be required to taper the medication and discontinue for at least 2 weeks
                  prior to study initiation.

               -  Patients on antidepressant treatment for pain or depression (TCAs, SSRI, SNRIs
                  etc. will be allowed to continue their medications provided they have been on a
                  stable dose for at least 4 weeks before study initiation. No dose regimen changes

                  be equivalent to 60mg oral morphine sulphate. Patients with higher doses will be
                  required to taper down their opioid dose to maximum 60mg oral morphine
                  equivalent, and continue on stable dose for 4 weeks before enrollment in the
                  study. Short-acting opioids for painful CIPN treatment will not be allowed.
