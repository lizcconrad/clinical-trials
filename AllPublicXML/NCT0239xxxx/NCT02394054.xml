  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has long been established that interpersonal relationships can have a profound impact on
      health and well-being. Yet, the investigators are still learning about the complex biological
      processes that contribute to positive social interactions and the ability to develop and
      maintain social relationships. Recent research has begun to focus on vasopressin, a
      neuropeptide that is naturally produced in the hypothalamus, because administration of this
      neuropeptide has been associated with empathy, cooperation, memory of social stimuli (e.g.,
      faces), and brain activity in neural regions associated with social and emotional processes.
      To date, several aspects of vasopressin's effects on social behavior have been unexplored. As
      such, the overarching goal of this project is to examine the effects of intranasal
      vasopressin on several tasks involving learning and social processes. In addition, the
      investigators will explore associated neural activity through functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI). Results from the study will inform our understanding of the neurobiology of
      socioemotional processes.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared to placebo, vasopressin will improve deception
      detection, increase empathy and altruism, enhance responses to photo stimuli of primary
      caregivers, and improve learning when the subject has a prosocial goal of teaching another
      person. These effects will manifest in behavioral and neural activity. It is also
      hypothesized that main effects will not be found for vasopressin, but rather, analyses of
      relevant moderators will elucidate these findings.

    <measure>Changes in neural brain activity, as observed by fMRI, when observing others during social inclusion vs. exclusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-115 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Whole brain and region of interest (ROI) regression analysis will be used to compare the neural activity of participants in the vasopressin/placebo groups. A design matrix will be created for each participant, modeling activity that is greater during the exclusion portion of the cyberball task (Williams et al., 2012) versus the inclusion portion. A first-level analysis will compare [(friend exclusion&gt;friend inclusion)&gt;(stranger exclusion&gt;stranger inclusion)] for each participant. A second-level group analysis will compare these first-level contrasts between the vasopressin and placebo groups.</description>

    <measure>Ratings of empathic concern after witnessing social exclusion in a friend or a stranger</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-115 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Ratings of empathic concern will be calculated for each participant by deriving a composite from self-report ratings of sympathy and compassion. Using a mixed 2 (friend, stranger) x 2 (vasopressin, placebo) factorial design, comparisons of these ratings will then be made for those in the vasopressin vs. placebo groups. Main effects of drug condition (vasopressin, placebo) as well as the interaction between drug condition and target (friend, stranger) will be analyzed at a significance level of p&lt;.05.</description>

    <measure>Altruism and punishment as measured by number of points given to excluders and those excluded</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-115 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Ratings of altruism and punishment will be calculated by examining how many point (1-10) participants decide to allocate towards the friend-excluder, stranger-excluder, excluded friend, and excluded stranger after watching each social exclusion game. Using a mixed 2 (friend, stranger) x 2 (vasopressin, placebo) factorial design, comparisons of these ratings will then be made for those in the vasopressin vs. placebo groups. Main effects of drug condition (vasopressin, placebo) and target (friend, stranger), as well as an interaction between drug condition and target will be analyzed at a significance level of p&lt;.05.</description>

    <time_frame>Between 40-115 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Whole brain and region of interest (ROI) regression analysis will be used to compare the neural activity of participants in the vasopressin/placebo groups. A design matrix will be created for each participant, modeling activity that is greater during the deception detection task versus a control task. A first-level analysis will compare deception-detection&gt;control for each participant. A second-level group analysis will compare this first-level contrast between the vasopressin and placebo groups.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of deception detection as measured by self-report</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-115 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare the percentage of correct deception detection trials for participants in the vasopressin group to those in the placebo group by running a two-tailed t-test with a statistical cutoff of p&lt;.05 to determine significance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in neural brain activity, as observed by fMRI, when viewing images of primary caregivers versus strangers</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-115 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Whole brain and region of interest (ROI) regression analysis will be used to compare the neural activity of participants in the vasopressin/placebo groups. A design matrix will be created for each participant, modeling activity that is greater while viewing photo stimuli of ones primary caregivers versus viewing photo stimuli of matched strangers. A first-level analysis will compare primary-caregiver-viewing&gt;stranger-viewing for each participant. A second-level group analysis will compare this first-level contrast between the vasopressin and placebo groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in brain neural activity, observed by fMRI, in response to a reading comprehension task</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-90 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Whole brain and region of interest (ROI) regression analysis will be used to compare the neural activity of participants in the tutor/memorizer and vasopressin/placebo groups. A design matrix will be created for each participant, modeling activity that is greater during reading comprehension compared with the grammar control passage. First level analyses will compare the response during the reading comprehension passages relative to the grammar control passages. Second level group analyses will compare the first level contrasts between the tutor vs. memorizer groups as well as the vasopressin vs. placebo groups. In regression analyses the investigators will enter each participant's comprehension test score in the tutor and then memorizer condition as a regressor in a whole-brain and ROI analysis to determine which brain regions were more active during the encoding of the reading comprehension passage compared to the grammar control passage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance on a memory test of reading comprehension as measured by percentage of questions answered correctly</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-90 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy will be calculated for each participant by dividing the number of correct responses by the total number of questions. The investigators will then conduct a between-subjects 2x2 ANOVA on the accuracy scores for the four groups of interest (i.e., vasopressin-tutor, vasopressin-memorizer, placebo-tutor, placebo-memorizer). A significance level of p&lt;.05 will be used to determine whether there are significant differences between the groups. The investigators will examine whether there is a main effect of either factor (vasopressin vs. placebo, tutor vs. memorize) as well as an interaction between the factors of interest.</description>
