  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the acceptability and feasibility of using a simplified regimen of
      medical abortion in the eastern and western regions of the country of Georgia. It was
      hypothesized that home use of mifepristone and buccal administration of misoprostol would be
      both acceptable and efficacious.

      The study recruited women with pregnancies up to 63 days gestation. Eligible women took 200
      mg mifepristone. Two days later they took 400 mcg buccal misoprostol, with the option of
      doing so in the clinic or at home. They underwent clinic follow-up 12-15 days after taking
      mifepristone to determine if their medical abortions were complete. The study assessed the
      regimen's efficacy, women's preferences regarding where to administer the medications, and
      the acceptability of buccal misoprostol and of side effects that accompanied women's medical
      abortions.
