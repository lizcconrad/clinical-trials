          4. Females aged at least 8 years should have a negative serum B-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (beta-hCG) at Visit 1 and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to
             receiving their first dose of study drug at Visit 2.

          5. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

          6. Able to swallow a single tablet.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             dosing

          2. Evidence of disease that may influence the outcome of the study within 4 weeks of
             dosing (eg, psychiatric disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver,
             kidney, respiratory system, endocrine system, hematological system, neurological
             system, cardiovascular system, or subjects who have a congenital abnormality in
             metabolism)

          3. Secondary (chromosomal, endocrine, or metabolic) causes of obesity (eg, Prader-Willi

             nephrotomy, digestive organ resection or any gastrointestinal procedure for the
             purpose of weight loss, which would slow gastric emptying).

          5. Any clinically relevant symptom or organ impairment found by medical history, physical
             examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) finding, or laboratory test results
             that require medical treatment at Screening.

             monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], linezolid), dextromethorphan, lithium, tramadol,
             antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.
