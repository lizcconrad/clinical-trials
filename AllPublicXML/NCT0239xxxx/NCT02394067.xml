    <textblock>
      This prospective study will use magnetic resonance imaging of patients with Idiopathic
      Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), to determine if the common radiological finding of
      transverse venous sinus stenosis can be reversed with standard of care medical treatment of
      IIH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) will be recruited and
      undergo an ophthalmologic investigation, and a lumbar puncture, both of which are necessary
      for diagnosis of IIH. MRI is done as a standard of care to rule out other etiologies of
      raised intracranial pressure. Our patients will require four MRI/MRVs. The first MRI/MRV is
      standard of care scan. The second MRI/MRV will be on the day of the lumber puncture,
      immediately following the procedure. The third MRI/MRV will take place when significant
      reduction of clinical papilledema has taken place (about 3-6 months), and a forth MRI will
      take place one year after the initial presentation or with symptom resolution, whichever
      comes first. Radiological findings will be compared at all stages to determine if transverse
      venous sinus stenosis can be reversed with standard of care medical treatment.

        Participants will be recruited from the neuro-ophthalmology service at the Queen Elizabeth
        II Health Center. Neuro-ophthalmology service in Nova Scotia sees approximately 20 new
        diagnoses of IIH per year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients with a diagnosis of IIH, where other intracranial pathology has been ruled
        out, can participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (1)Patients who have a contraindication or are unable to undergo magnetic resonance
        imaging. (2)Patients who are found to have intracranial pathology to explain elevated
        intracranial pressure. (3)Patients with allergies to gadolinium-containing
        agents.(4)Patients with elevated creatinine above normal laboratory values.
