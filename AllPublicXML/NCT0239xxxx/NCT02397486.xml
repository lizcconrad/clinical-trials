  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pentoxifylline and vitamin E are effective
      in prevention of radiotherapy- induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled prospective study of pentoxifylline and vitamin E given on
      daily basis throughout the period of concurrent chemoradiotherapy to patients with carcinoma
      of the head and neck. All patients will be followed up to 90 days since the first day of
      treatment. The incidence and severity of adverse events will be assessed according to the
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.
