  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about the combination of Taselisib with
      other drugs in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Taselisib is an investigational
      drug which works by blocking a protein called PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) that helps
      cancer cells grow. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from
      these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.
      The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with
      other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib
      study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of Taselisib. This study will be conducted in 4 separate arms. (A-D).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided in two parts, a combination dose finding escalation part (Part 1) and a
      dose combination expansion part (Part 2). Participants will enter only one Part (either 1 or
      2) and receive study drugs from only one combindation of study drugs, know as arms, as
      assigned by the main study physician. The study includes four different arms as listed below:

        -  Arm A: Taselisib with Trastuzumab emtansine (also called T-DM1)

        -  Arm B: Taselisib with Trastuzumab emtansine and Pertuzumab

        -  Arm C: Taselisib with Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab

        -  Arm D: Taselisib with Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Paclitaxel

      Part 1: Since we are looking for the highest dose of Taselisib that can be administered
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have breast cancer,
      not everyone who participates in Part 1 of this research study will receive the same dose of
      the Taselisib. The dose participants get will depend on the number of participants who have
      been enrolled in the study before and how well they have tolerated their doses.

      Each combination dose will only be given to a group of 3 - 6 participants. The results from
      each group will be reviewed and depending on the results, a different combination dose or
      schedule may be investigated in the next group of participants or the same combination dose
      taken by a participant may be repeated with the next group of participants to investigate
      these results further (a different schedule means that instead of taking doses once every
      day, participants may take them only on some days in the week).

      Part 2: The doses in this part will be based on the best combination doses from Part 1. This
      part will look at the potential side effects and see how your cancer responds to the drug.
