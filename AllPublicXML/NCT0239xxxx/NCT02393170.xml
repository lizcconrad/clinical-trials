  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On-going rehabilitation is needed to maintain and improve the weaker upper extremity
      following stroke. Community rehabilitation programs for stroke individuals in the chronic
      stage are often difficult to be implement. Consequently, many individuals remain without
      structured interventional programs. Self-training programs, where individuals can
      independently continue to exercise at home, might answer this challenge. However, since
      exercising alone is boring and not motivating, individuals often stop the prescribed
      exercises and remain inactive. The use of video-games for self-training might answer this
      challenge.

      Therefore, the investigators aimed to assess the feasibility of using video-games for
      self-training after stroke. Specifically the investigators aim to compare the (1) training
      time, (2) satisfaction and (3) effectiveness of a self-training program using video-games
      compared to a traditional self-training program.

      This is a single-blind randomized controlled trial with four assessments; two before and two
      following the 5-week self training intervention.

      Individuals are requested to perform the self training (video-games or traditional exercises)
      60 minutes a day for 5 weeks.
