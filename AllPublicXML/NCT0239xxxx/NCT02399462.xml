      This is an open label safety and feasibility trial using Acthar® in addition to
      center-specific standard therapy including plasma exchange, for treatment of post transplant
      recurrent FSGS and post transplant recurrent idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Subjects will
      receive Acthar® 40 units subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly for two weeks then 80 units SC
      twice weekly for 24 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Proteinuria &gt; 1 g/d by urine protein/creatinine ratio (UP/C) or 24 hour urine
             collection (at what timepoint?)

          -  If treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or Angiotensin II
             receptor blockers (ARB), must be on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment

          -  Newly diagnosed recurrent focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), or
             current/previous treatment of recurrent FSGS with no evidence of at least a partial
             response as defined by one or more of the following:

               1. Recurrent FSGS confirmed by renal transplant biopsy (FSGS on light microscopy
                  and/or foot process effacement on electron microscopy), with FSGS as the primary
                  disease confirmed by native renal biopsy prior to transplant

               2. FSGS confirmed by renal transplant biopsy (FSGS on light microscopy and/or foot
                  process effacement on electron microscopy), within 18 months post transplant

               3. Patients at any time period post transplant with an established diagnosis of
                  recurrent FSGS in the first 18 months post transplant who did not respond to
                  conventional therapy as defined by persistent proteinuria of &gt; 3 g/d by UP/C or
                  24 hour urine collection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lactation, pregnancy or refusal of birth control in women of childbearing potential

          -  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or
             parvovirus B-19

          -  Malignancy (with the exception of treated and cured basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma)

          -  Evidence of diabetic nephropathy, transplant glomerulopathy or other pathologies that
             could be associated with secondary FSGS on renal transplant biopsy

          -  Non-renal organ transplant (with the exception of pancreas transplant)

          -  Contraindication to receiving Acthar®
