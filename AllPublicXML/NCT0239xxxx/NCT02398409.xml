      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the ANSWERS- VA intervention
      (Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths for Veterans) while also
      determining it's cost effectiveness in the stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      populations.

    <textblock>
      Background: Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are leading causes of long-term
      disability among Veterans and result in the need for care from informal caregivers in the
      home setting. There are very few evidence-based, easy-to-deliver follow-up programs to train
      Veterans and caregivers across multiple domains post injury. The &quot;Acquiring New Skills While
      Enhancing Remaining Strengths for Veterans (ANSWERS-VA)&quot; intervention aims to provide the
      Veteran and caregiver dyad with a set of practical skills that each can use in coping with
      and managing symptoms of a brain injury, applying a strength-based approach.

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      to evaluate (a) the efficacy of the ANSWERS-VA dyadic intervention with Veterans who have
      sustained a stroke and/or TBI and their informal caregivers, and (b) estimate effect sizes
      for the ANSWERS-VA intervention. The ANSWERS-VA intervention will be compared with an
      educational intervention that will serve as an attention control group.

      Specific Aim 1: To tailor the implementation of the ANSWERS-VA intervention to dyads of
      Veterans post stroke and/or TBI and their informal caregivers (n=10) and modify the
      implementation processes for the RCT.

      Specific Aim 2: To test the short-term (immediately post-intervention) and long-term,
      sustained (12 and 24 weeks, and at 1 year) efficacy of the ANSWERS-VA intervention for
      improving: (a) the primary outcomes of the caregivers' quality of life and unhealthy days,
      and (b) the caregiver mediators of task difficulty, threat appraisal, self-efficacy for
      caregiving, and optimism.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate program delivery costs for the ANSWERS-VA intervention and the
      educational attention control procedures, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of the
      ANSWERS-VA intervention in terms of noncaregiving hours and unhealthy days in caregivers of
      Veterans post stroke and/or TBI.

      Exploratory Aim 1: To estimate the effect sizes for the ANSWERS-VA intervention for the
      caregiver and Veteran on the secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms, social participation,
      and quality of the dyadic relationship.

      Methods: The investigators propose to conduct a RCT to evaluate the ANSWERS-VA intervention
      among Veterans with stroke or TBI and their caregivers (dyads). Veterans with stroke (N =
      222) or TBI (N = 108) and their informal caregivers, who have received care at the Michael E.
      DeBakey VAMC in Houston or the Richard L. Roudebush VAMC in Indianapolis, will be randomized
      to the ANSWERS-VA intervention or to an attention control group. Both the intervention and
      control procedures involve 8 telephone sessions delivered over 8 weeks, with a booster
      session at 12 weeks. Data collections will occur at baseline, 8 weeks (short-term
      intervention effect), 12 weeks (after booster), 24 weeks, and 1 year after baseline
      (long-term sustainability of intervention effect). Linear mixed models will be applied to the
      repeated-measures data to test efficacy of the program in stroke caregivers and to estimate
      effect sizes in TBI caregivers. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be employed to
      address the comparative costs and outcomes for the ANSWERS-VA intervention and attention
      control groups.

      Status: Essential modifications for this project were requested and approved via VA Central
      Office. IRB approval has been obtained for these modifications in Indianapolis and in
      Houston. Graduate students from multiple disciplines have been hired and have received two
      days of onsite training specific to the ANSWERS-VA intervention and control procedures,
      screening, recruitment, and data collection processes. The REDCap database has been updated
      for the project modifications and has been further tested. The investigators are currently
      working with frontline providers at both sites to recruit potential participants for this
      RCT. Enrollment of first subject dyads began November, 2014. At this time, the investigators
      have completed recruitment of new dyads.
