  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen may reduce neurophatic pain and promote wound healing. Established anti
      inflammatory effects of HBO may contribute to this effect. In a previous publication the
      investigators studied the effects of HBO on secondary hyperalgesia using a well established
      heat injury model. In a new - blinded study design, the investigators wish to investigate
      and- or confirm previous results, i.e. that HBO therapy reduce secondary hyperalgesia and
      improving therapy of severe pain conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) reduces neuropathic pain, promote healing of hypoxic, chronic wounds
      and sores caused by radiation therapy. Nitric oxide (NO) is a contributing factor to the
      prolonged anti-nociceptive effect of HBO treatment. In addition, HBO stimulates the formation
      of reactive oxygen and nitrogen forms, reduces beta-2 integrin function, and reduces contact
      of leukocytes to the endothelial surface of the capillaries, improves microcirculation and
      causes decreased monocyte chemokine synthesis. It is the interaction of these mechanisms
      involved in HBO's anti-inflammatory effect. How HBO reduces pain and inflammation in humans
      has not been established. In healthy subjects, investigators have shown that HBO has a
      reducing effect on the mechanism, which at the level the of spinal cord amplifies the number
      and and the extension of pain impulses. Subjects who were given HBO therapy initially
      developed significantly less secondary hyperalgesia than the control group several weeks
      later by the new heat injury suggesting a protective, preconditioning effect. As in the
      previous experiment (NCT02025686) preconditioning effects will be assessed by means of
      measurements of thermal thresholds, pin-prick thresholds, erythema indices and secondary
      hyperalgesic areas (i.e. area under the curve per minute). Similarly,differences in the
      sequence of sessions (i.e. first session HBO;second session ambient pressure condition or
      first session ambient pressure condition;second session HBO) will be analyzed accordingly. In
      an improved blinded study design investigators will now investigate the effect of HBO
      treatment using the same cutaneous heat injury model, as in the first study. Investigators
      expect to finally be able to confirm previous results thereby improving treatment of severe
      pain conditions.

Hyperalgesia: Weighted pins (PinPrick 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 mN) using Dixon's &quot;up-and-down&quot; method.
Secondary hyperalgesia: PinPrick, 8 symmetrical lines converging towards the center of the heat injury with 45 degrees difference.
All parameters are compared within the two sessions to assess preconditioning.</description>
