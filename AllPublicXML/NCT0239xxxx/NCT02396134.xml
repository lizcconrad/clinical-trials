    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well vaccine therapy works in reducing the
      frequency of cytomegalovirus severe infections (events) in patients with hematologic
      malignancies undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Vaccines made from a peptide may help the
      body build an effective immune response and may reduce cytomegalovirus events after donor
      stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if cytomegalovirus (CMV)peptide(Pep)vaccine(Vax) (CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide
      vaccine) reduces the frequency of CMV events defined as reactivation or CMV disease in human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) A*0201 allogeneic CMV positive hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HCT) recipients (HCT-R+).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMVPepVax by assessing the following:
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days post HCT, severe (grade 3-4) acute graft versus host
      disease (GVHD) (aGVHD), and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events [CTCAE] 4.0) probably or definitely related to the vaccination within 2 weeks
      from each vaccination.

      II. To characterize CMV reactivation and CMV disease in recipients of CMVPepVax compared to
      placebo by assessing time-to viremia (defined as number of days from transplantation to the
      date of &gt;= 500 CMV genome copies [gc]/mL) , duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia,
      incidence of late CMV viremia/disease (&gt; 100 and =&lt; 360 days post HCT), use of antiviral
      drugs (triggered by clinically significant viremia), cumulative number of CMV specific
      antiviral treatment days.

      III. To evaluate the impact of CMVPepVax on transplant related outcomes by assessing the
      incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, non-relapse mortality,
      all-cause mortality, infections.

      IV. To determine if CMVPepVax increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV-specific T cell
      immunity in vaccinated compared to placebo treated HLA A*0201, CMV seropositive
      HCT-recipients.

      V. To determine whether vaccination induces adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population
      changes, and increase in the highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells.

      VI. To explore GVHD biomarkers and compare between the vaccine and placebo groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on days 28 and 56
      after HCT.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo SC on days 28 and 56 after HCT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to day 365 after HCT.

    <description>Each randomized study subject will be followed according to the study calendar for the occurrence of CMV reactivation events, which are defined in terms of either viremia, low-level viremia treated with antivirals, or CMV disease. Both initial and recurrent events will be recorded, with patients considered at risk for recurrent events after completion of a full planned course of a full course of anti-viral therapy. Vaccine and placebo groups will be compared with regard to the hazard of CMV events, using the Anderson-Gill approach to repeated events.</description>
