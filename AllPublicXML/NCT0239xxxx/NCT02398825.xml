  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the efficacy of treatment with ponatinib in patients with
      chronic myeloid leukemia who are in a chronic phase and who previously received treatment
      with imatinib but resulted to be resistant to it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2, single-arm, multicentre, open label. No interim analysis is planned, but a
      monitoring committee will evaluate the data every 6 months. Ponatinib is given orally 30 mg
      daily, with dose adjustment to 15 mg daily once a BCR-ABL1 level smaller or equal to 0.1%
      (MMR) has been achieved and confirmed in the next test, 4 weeks apart. A return to prior, 30
      mg, dose is due in case of return of BCR-ABL1 transcripts level to &gt; 1%. Dose adjustments for
      toxicity are detailed in the protocol. Treatment time will be 52 weeks, during which study
      drug will be provided free-of-charge by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, upon approval of the protocol.
      Treatment is discontinued at any time in case of failure or treatment-related SAEs. After one
      year of treatment, upon request of the local investigator and upon confirmation of the
      Treatment Advisory Committee (TAC, see section 23), ARIAD Pharmaceutics, Inc. will continue
      to provide ponatinib for the study patients who will benefit from treatment continuation, for
      at least 2 years, until the drug will be approved with that indication.

    <description>Cytogenetic response (CyR) is defined based on the percentage of Ph pos metaphases, as evaluated by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) of at least 20 marrow cell metaphases:
Major Cytogenetic Response if Ph pos metaphases &lt; 35%
Complete (CCyR) if Ph pos metaphases 0 or FISH BCR-ABL1 nuclei minor or equal to 1%
Partial (PCyR) if Ph pos metaphases 1-34%
Minor (mCyR) if Ph pos metaphases 35-65%
Minimal or none (min/none CyR) if Ph pos metaphases &gt; 65% If marrow cell metaphases cannot be obtained or analysed, interphase fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) can be used, but only to distinguish a CCyR (minor or equal to 1% positive nuclei out of at least 200 nuclei) from a non CCyR. FISH data cannot be used to classify a response as minimal, minor, or partial.</description>
