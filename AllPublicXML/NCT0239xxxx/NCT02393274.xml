  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) life support system can provide both cardiac and
      respiratory support to patients with heart and respiratory failure. It can save time for
      these organs to recovery or for these patients to receive further management. However, many
      patients will die in spite of ECMO support. One of the key factor is whether the blood flow
      provided by the ECMO can meet the requirement of organ perfusion. The adequacy of
      macrocirculation may be determined by arterial pressure and minute blood flow of ECMO.
      However, the adequacy of microcirculation remains as a major unresolved clinical problem.
      This is a prospective observational clinical trial. The sublingual microcirculation will be
      examined with the incident dark field video microscope within 6 hours after venoarterial ECMO
      placement, and then at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h. The severity of multiple organ injury and
      clinical data will be recorded as well. The major parameters of microcirculation include
      total small vessel density, perfused small vessel density, and microvascular flow index. The
      sublingual microcirculation will also be examined before weaning off ECMO, within 6 hours
      after ECMO removal, and then at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Serum level of endothelial cell
      specific molecule-1 at specific time points will be examined. The data of 14-day mortality,
      28-day mortality, duration of ECMO support, and intensive care unit stay will be recorded.
      This study aims primarily to investigate the relationship between microcirculation and
      prognosis of these patients. This study will also investigate the relationship among serum
      level of endothelial cell specific molecule-1, microcirculation, and prognosis of these
      patients. Wish the results of this study can be applied in further research to help to
      improve the quality of ECMO care.
