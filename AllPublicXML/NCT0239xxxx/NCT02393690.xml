    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well iodine I-131 works with or without
      selumetinib in treating patients with thyroid cancer that has returned or has spread from
      where it started to other places in the body. Many thyroid cancers absorb iodine. Due to
      this, doctors often give radioactive iodine (iodine I-131) alone to treat thyroid cancer as
      part of standard practice. It is thought that the more thyroid tumors are able to absorb
      radioactive iodine, the more likely it is that the radioactive iodine will cause those tumors
      to shrink. Selumetinib may help radioactive iodine work better in patients whose tumors still
      absorb radioactive iodine. It is not yet known whether iodine I-131 is more effective with or
      without selumetinib in treating thyroid cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate at 6 months following treatment with 131I (iodine I-131) in
      combination with placebo or selumetinib for radioactive iodine-avid (RAIA) recurrent and/or
      metastatic thyroid cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the best overall response following treatment with 131I in combination with
      placebo or selumetinib for RAIA recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer.

      II. To compare the progression-free survival of patients with RAIA recurrent and/or
      metastatic thyroid cancer treated with 131I in combination with placebo or selumetinib.

      III. To compare serum thyroglobulin changes for patients with RAIA recurrent and/or
      metastatic thyroid cancer treated with 131I in combination with placebo or selumetinib.

      IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 131I in combination with placebo or
      selumetinib for patients with RAI-avid recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of RAIA tumors for signatures that
      correlate to therapeutic benefit achieved with 131I in combination with placebo or
      selumetinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) starting on week 1, day 1
      and continuing through 2 days after iodine I-131 therapy has been administered. Approximately
      3 weeks after beginning treatment with selumetinib, patients receive iodine I-131 PO.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID starting on week 1, day 1 and continuing through 2
      days after iodine I-131 therapy has been administered. Approximately 3 weeks after beginning
      treatment with placebo, patients receive iodine I-131 PO.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months, every 3
      months for 12 months, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
