      The aim of the post doc project is investigate which genes regulate implantation in order to
      analyze specific proteins and microRNA in the spent culture media with the long-term goal of
      developing a non-invasive method of embryo assessment and selection. This will be achieved by
      conducting a targeted NGS analysis, based on list obtained from a non-published pilot study.
      When further validated by q-PCR, the expression of specific microRNAs known to influence the
      final list of genes will be analyzed in the spent culture media and the protein products of
      the genes recovered from the media will be quantified. The level of specific microRNAs and
      proteins will be related to aneuploidy and implantation potential. If the level of specific
      microRNA and/or proteins correlates with pregnancy, the study will form the basis for
      developing a clinical applicable precise method of improved embryo selection and thus
      improved IVF treatment.
