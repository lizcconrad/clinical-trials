      Introduction: Health care that addresses the emotional regulation capacity of patients with
      schizophrenia confronted with daily stress may contribute to a less anxious life. A
      psycho-physiological training (cardiac coherence training; CCT) focusing on emotion
      regulation is known to decrease anxiety for non-clinical individuals.

      Methods: the investigators performed a pilot cross sectional survey to explore the benefits
      of CCT for clinically stable patients with schizophrenia. Ten patients were enrolled in the
      program consisting in height to twelve weekly one hour session program during a 2-month
      follow-up. Standardised questionnaires were used before and after the intervention assessing
      anxiety, well-being outcomes, and how patients deal with stress and stressors.

      Ten subjects, five women and five men, all volunteers, were included in the study. The
      patients were all clients of the rehabilitation center for psychotic disorders (Le Vinatier
      hospital) situated in Lyon, France. Criteria for entry into the study included: a Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-4 diagnosis of schizophrenia as confirmed by the
      Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-IV (MINI); age between 18 and 65; being
      clinically stable (i.e. not having required hospitalization or increases in medication as a
      result of an exacerbation of acute symptoms over the previous three months.

      All subjects completed a set of &quot;paper and pencil&quot; standardized assessments at
      pre-intervention and immediately after the end of the intervention.

      Trait and State anxiety was assessed using the French version of the Spielberger
      State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (S-STAI).

      Three questionnaires were used in order to evaluate the outcomes quality of life of patients.
      1/ The Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); 2/ Patient's body/mind perceptions were
      assessed using mindfulness concept (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, FMI), and 3/ Patients'
      quality of life was evaluated using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS).

      One questionnaire was used to assess how patients deal with stress and stressors (the
      Derogatis Stress Profile, DSP).
