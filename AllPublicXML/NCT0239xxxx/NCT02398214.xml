    <textblock>
      Sleep problems during infancy are associated with behavior and emotional problems, poor
      language development , parental distress and mood disturbances, and overweight and obese
      children. The investigators proposed that children who receive the light, activity, and sleep
      training (LAST) intervention program in this study will have less parent report of problem
      sleep behaviors and longer duration of nighttime sleep compared to children with no
      intervention provided.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems are reported in 71.65% of our nation's infants and toddlers, and the
      prevalence is much higher than the 20-30% reported in Western countries. The investigators'
      preliminary findings also show that approximately 53-55% of parents of children between 6 and
      12 months of age consider their child sleep a problem with about 4% not knowing whether their
      child sleep is a problem. Sleep development during infancy is characterized by increasing
      day-night differences in sleep-wakefulness such as longer bouts of sleep and fewer awakenings
      at night, and is driven by neurobiological maturation and environmental interactions. By 3
      months of age, nearly 58% of infants can sleep continuously between 24:00-05:00 hours. When
      infants do not sleep through the night by 17 months of age, they are less likely to be able
      to do so at 29 months of age and beyond. Without proper intervention, sleep problems during
      infancy can persist to toddler and preschool age. Various interventions have been developed
      and tested in Western and Asian Countries to address the sleep problems in infants and young
      children, but none are in Taiwan.
