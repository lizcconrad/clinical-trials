    <textblock>
      Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and
      Flt3, whose anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis effects have been validated in preclinical
      tests. In PhaseⅡb study, a significantly improved Progression Free Survival (PFS) was found
      in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with Famitinib compared to placebo. On
      the other hand, the toxicity of Famitinib was manageable in both PhaseⅠand Ⅱb studies.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Famitinib can improve Overall Survival (OS)
      compared with placebo in total 540 patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have failed
      in previously received at least two lines of standard chemotherapy.
