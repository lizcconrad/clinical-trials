  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major surgery results in a stress- induced catabolic response, marked by post-operative
      insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and loss of body protein, which is associated with
      increased morbidity, mortality and adverse outcomes. There has been a great deal of research
      on different approaches to optimize post-operative insulin sensitivity including hormonal and
      nutritional interventions, minimally invasive surgical techniques and epidural anesthesia.
      However, the correlation between insulin resistance and body protein loss is not well
      understood. Metformin is the most widely used insulin sensitizing and blood glucose-lowering
      drug in treatment of type 2 diabetic patients. This study will: 1) estimate the correlation
      between insulin resistance and body protein loss in pre-diabetic lung/colorectal resection
      patients; 2) investigate whether the post-operative metabolic state can be improved by the
      pre-operative administration of metformin; and assess the impact of metformin on surgical
      complications and hospital length of stay. The results of this study will provide insight
      into the relationship between insulin resistance and post-operative adverse events and
      potentially suggest a novel approach to improve outcomes using Metformin, a drug already in
      wide clinical use.
