        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Weight must be â‰¥50 kg and BMI must be between 18-35 kg/m2

          -  Subjects must have stable renal disease without evidence of progressive decline in
             renal function (stable renal disease is defined as no significant change, such as,
             stable eGFR &lt;90 mL/min, for 12 weeks prior to study entry) Other than renal
             impairment, subjects must be stable and appropriately managed relative to chronic
             diseases (such as diabetes and hypertension)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any surgical or medical condition other than renal impairment which might
             significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  Subjects with ongoing alcohol or drug abuse within 1 month prior to dosing or evidence
             of such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or
             baseline evaluations.

          -  Subjects with screening 12-lead ECG QTcF of &gt; 450 msec for males or &gt; 460 msec for
             female

          -  History of diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) or blood glucose of &gt;125 mg/dl at screening

          -  Subjects with potassium levels greater than the upper limit of normal (&gt;ULN)

        Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion may apply.
