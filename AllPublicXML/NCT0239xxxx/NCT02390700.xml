      This is a prospective, observational, non-interventional (no treatment given during course of
      the study) multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), study that will enroll participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in
      Canada. Only data available from source documentation will be collected. The participation in
      this study will not impact on the standard of care of the participant or any benefits to
      which they are otherwise entitled. All aspects of treatment decisions and clinical management
      of participants will be in accordance with clinical practice and at the discretion of the
      health care provider. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The RAID is self-administered questionnaire which includes seven domains (pain, function, fatigue, physical and psychological wellbeing, sleep disturbance and coping). Each domain is evaluated using a single question answered by a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. Each domain also has a specific weight assigned by a patient survey. The RAID score is a continuous variable ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst).</description>
