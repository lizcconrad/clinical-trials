      Swedish inhabitants from age 30 to age 89. The population was selected to be representative
      for the general Swedish population and 500 in each 10 year group, 250 men and 250 women.

      The population is contacted and asked for informed consent, whereafter a questionnaire of
      about 200 questions, used in a number of studies in clinical studies and trials, are sent
      out.

      Individuals contacted by letter with information about the study and it's aim. The next step
      is a telephone contact from the study secretariate where the person can ask for more detailed
      information and put questions to the reserach nurse. The call leads up to a question to the
      person, if the questionnaire can be sent. If yes, the questionnaire is posted includeing the
      consent form and an pre-paid return envelope. After two weeks a thank you/reminder letter is
      sent out, and if no reply one more phone call is made two weeks further on.
