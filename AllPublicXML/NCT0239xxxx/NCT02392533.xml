  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonography is routinely performed during pregnancy by obstetricians to visualize the
      fetus, making patients familiar and comfortable with its usage. Ultrasonography does not
      result in adverse effects to the mother or fetus and is readily available at most facilities,
      yet is not routinely used to identify lumbar interspaces prior to providing neuraxial
      anesthesia. Ultrasonography is a valuable tool for accurately identifying lumbar
      intervertebral spaces and is more accurate than simple palpation of obscure anatomic
      landmarks. The investigators are interested to know the accuracy of anatomic landmark
      palpation in predicting the lumbar interspace of neuraxial anesthesia administration compared
      to identification of the interspace by ultrasound. The investigators are also interested in
      presenting anesthesia providers with feedback regarding their accuracy and then investigating
      whether this feedback causes a change in provider practice (i.e. use of ultrasound) or
      improved identification of the interspace prior to providing neuraxial anesthesia.

      Informed consent will be obtained and documented. All post-partum patients who received
      neuraxial anesthesia will be asked to provide consent for ultrasound to be used at their
      bedside to identify the interspace where the neuraxial anesthetic was administered. A low
      frequency ultrasound probe and sterile gel will be used to perform the less than five-minute
      study. The site of the neuraxial anesthetic placement will be identified by the puncture mark
      on the skin. The investigators will note the patient's medical record number and BMI, the
      names of the resident and attending anesthesiologist who placed the neuraxial anesthetic, the
      documented intervertebral space at the time of neuraxial anesthetic placement, anesthetic
      type, whether ultrasound was used for the initial neuraxial placement, and the documented
      intervertebral space identified post-partum by ultrasound.

      Following 3 months of data collection, information regarding the documented intervertebral
      space versus the actual intervertebral space that the neuraxial anesthetic was administered
      will be provided to each anesthesiologist and resident. Following delivery of this
      information, an additional 3 months of data collection will be performed (the same as the
      first 3 months) to evaluate whether a practice change took place.
