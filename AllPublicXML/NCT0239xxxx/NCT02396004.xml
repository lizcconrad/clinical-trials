      Aim of study:

      To conduct an observational study to collect cerebral and renal perfusion data through NIRS
      before and after treatment of PDA by medication or by PDA ligation. The data post treatment
      would form the basis for normative baseline data in VLBW preterm newborn babies, particularly
      in the Asian population.

      Study population/inclusion criteria:

      VLBW newborn babies with hemodynamically significant PDA by echocardiography.

      Exclusion criteria:

      Major malformations Moribund patients

      VLBW newborn babies with hemodynamically significant PDA by echocardiography.

      Exclusion criteria:

      Major malformations Moribund patients

      Protocol:

      Consent will be obtained from parents of eligible newborns before treatment of hemodynamic
      significant PDA. To attach cerebral and renal oximeter by NIRS to these VLBW infants with
      PDAs for until 24 hours post closure of PDA. Doppler ultrasound will be performed on anterior
      cerebral artery (ACA) and/or middle cerebral artery (MCA) artery and/or renal artery(RA)
      before PDA treatment and/or 24hours after PDA closure.This study aims to use one of the more
      popular neonatal/paediatrics NIRS machine, which is the INVOS cerebral/somatic oximeter

      The same patient will hence form its own control after treatment. Echocardiographic follow-up
      or clinical assessment for closure of the PDA will be performed 24-48 hours after the course
      of medication or surgical closure.
