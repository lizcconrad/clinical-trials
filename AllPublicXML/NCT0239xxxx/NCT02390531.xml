  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a dose of intravitreal bevacizumab that is lower than
      currently used for severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), is effective in this study, and
      can be tested in future larger studies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite promising initial results using empirical doses of bevacizumab based on half the
      adult dose for treatment of acute severe ROP, little is known about lower doses of
      bevacizumab for ROP. An increasing number of ophthalmologists are treating premature infants
      with severe ROP using bevacizumab. Given the potential systemic and ocular adverse effects of
      intravitreal bevacizumab injections, determining a lower effective dose of bevacizumab is an
      important next step. The proposed study will test progressively lower doses to find a dose to
      take forward to a future larger study.

    <time_frame>4 weeks post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Success is defined as improvement* by the 4-day exam and no recurrence of type 1 ROP or severe neovascularization requiring additional treatment within 4 weeks of injection.
* For infants with plus disease, improvement by the 4-day post-injection exam is defined as plus disease no longer being present. For infants with type 1 ROP without plus disease (i.e., zone I, stage 3), improvement by the 4-day post-injection exam is defined as: (1) a significant reduction in severity and/or extent of extraretinal neovascularization, and, (2) if pre-plus was present pre-injection, reduction in the degree of abnormal vascular dilation and/or tortuosity.
A dose will be considered effective if it successfully treats at least 80% of subjects.</description>

    <description>The parents of each infant enrolled in the study will be given the option to participate in a study to measure levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Avastin in the plasma. Participants in this optional study will have blood collected for analysis The distribution of VEGF and Avastin levels (median, range, and quartiles) will be described before injection, and at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-injection. For each dosage level, at 2, and 4-weeks post-injection, the change from pre-injection will be calculated, and a 95% confidence interval calculated for the change.</description>
