    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II clinical trial of the combination of carboplatin, eribulin, and E7449. A
      cycle will be defined as 21 days. Carboplatin will be given on day 1 of each cycle. Eribulin
      will be given on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. E7449 will be given daily (days 1-21) during
      each cycle. Patients will continue to receive treatment until progression of disease or
      discontinuation due to unacceptable side effects.
