      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of intravitreal Eylea
      injections at a set interval, versus a variable dosing schedule (likely longer than one
      month), based on a specific individual's disease progression. There will be approximately 50
      men and women at least 18 years of age, diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, taking part
      in this study at 5 locations in the United States.

    <description>Group 1 will receive injections every 4 weeks until diabetic macular edema on the OCT is decreased and stable. At that point, the length of time between injections may increase, depending on how the study eye is doing. The interval between study eye treatments may maintain, increase, or decrease once the variable treatment dosing has begun. This will be determined by an algorithm designed into a computer program</description>

         17. Concurrent disease in the study eye, other than DME, that could compromise BCVA,

             interpretation of the results (including retinal vascular occlusion, retinal
             detachment, macular hole, or choroidal neovascularization of any cause)
