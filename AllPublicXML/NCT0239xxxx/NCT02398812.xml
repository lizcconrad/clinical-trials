  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pragmatic multi-center randomized controlled trial is to test the
      effectiveness of interprofessional medication assessment in older patients needing home care
      due to their diseases or decreased functional capacity in primary care. The main hypothesis
      is that intervention has a positive impact on functional capacity and for rational and safe
      use of medicines.

      Aging increases the risk of adverse effects and interactions caused by medication. Medication
      reconciliation and medication review are well-known practices to optimize medicines use. Both
      interventions usually require a team-based approach to be effective. Medication
      reconciliation is the process of obtaining and documenting a complete and accurate list of
      current patient medications and comparing this list with medication orders at each point of
      care transition to identify and rectify any discrepancies before patient harm occurs.
      Medication review is the process of evaluating current medication treatment to manage the
      risk and optimize the outcomes of medication treatment by detecting, solving, and preventing
      medication-related problems. The present study focuses on medication assessment including
      both medication reconciliation and review combined to clinical assessment of an individual
      patient.

      According to a systematic review there is a need for research focusing on medication
      management in community settings and especially to assess the impact of medication assessment
      on clinical outcomes.

    <description>Intervention
Phase I: A medication assessment conducted by an interprofessional team including nurse, pharmacist and physician. The assessment is based on current medication list and basic information cathered by nurse.
Phase II: This phase is needed if the assessment cannot be conducted safely without physical examination conducted by physician. The comprehensive interprofessional assessment takes place after the clinical examination conducted by home care physician.</description>
