  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with histories of depression are at high risk of depressive relapse during the
      perinatal period, and options for relapse prevention are limited. Mindfulness-based cognitive
      therapy (MBCT) has strong evidence among general populations but has not been studied among
      at risk pregnant women.

      This study is the first phase of a multi-phase project adapting MBCT for perinatal women
      (MBCT-PD). It is being conducted in a collaboration between the University of Colorado, Emory
      University, and Kaiser Permanente at Colorado and Georgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) represents one of the most important recent
      developments in the effort to prevent recurrent depression. Explicitly designed to modify
      core underlying vulnerability factors among recovered individuals with histories of
      depression, MBCT may have high applicability to the prevention of perinatal depression (PD).

      During this phase of the project the investigators will employ an iterative process to
      develop, within routine obstetric clinical settings, the MBCT-PD program across a two-center
      open trial of pregnant women at high risk of perinatal depression. During this phase, the
      investigators will modify the standard MBCT approach to be sensitive and specific to women at
      high risk of perinatal depressive relapse or recurrence based on previous history of
      depression and will address the following aims:

        -  Specific Aim 1: To examine the feasibility of MBCT-PD with respect to identification and
           enrollment of women at-risk of perinatal depression based on a history of depression.

        -  Specific Aim 2: To examine the engagement of women with the MBCT-PD approach with
           respect to retention, completion of daily practice assignments, and satisfaction

        -  Specific Aim 3: To examine the clinical outcomes including change in depression symptom
           levels and rates of relapse/recurrence over the course of the intervention and through a
           6-month postpartum follow-up.

    <description>Engagement is operationalized in-part as class attendance, with completion is defined as attendance at a minimum of four classes, and daily home practice recorded daily as the number of times of practice and type of practice, which are classified as either formal or informal practice.</description>

    <measure>Client Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction will be evaluated by the CSQ-8, which is designed to yield a homogeneous estimate of general satisfaction with services. An exit interview also will be completed at 6-months postpartum.</description>

    <measure>Depressive Relapse Status: Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of depressive relapse and time to relapse will be assessed using the LIFE, which provides a retrospective assessment of relapse or recurrence based on a semi-structured interview according to DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria.</description>
