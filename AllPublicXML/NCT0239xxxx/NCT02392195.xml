      This study will enable investigators to find out if brain structure and characteristics are
      affected by the shape of the infant's head, and if changes in the brain occur with helmet
      therapy.

    <textblock>
      A dramatic increase in the number of infants diagnosed with Deformational Plagiocephaly (DP)
      has been observed worldwide since institution of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Back to
      Sleep Program. According to one published report, the incidence of DP ranges between 3-48%;
      this translates into120,000-2 million infants/year who develop DP in the United States alone.
      Some healthcare providers believe that DP is a purely cosmetic condition. This mindset
      undermines the importance of prevention and correction. In New Zealand, a recent study
      demonstrated that 39% of children without corrective action had persistent DP at age 3 to 4
      years. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated associations between impaired social
      interactions, developmental problems and DP.Thus some researchers now believe that there may
      be a spectrum of untoward outcomes from brain remodeling resulting from DP. Recent
      technological advances now allow the detection of diminutive changes in brain structure. In
      this multidisciplinary descriptive pilot study we will use brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging) and a cerebral tissue oxygenation monitor, namely Frequency Domain Near Infrared and
      Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (FDNIR/DCS) to describe if differences in brain structure
      and characteristics exist in infants with significant DP before and after correction of the
      deformational defect. This study will enable investigators to seek preliminary evidence that
      brain development is influenced by the shape of the cranial vault, and that changes in brain
      structure and characteristics occur with helmet therapy. Additionally this study will help to
      determine the need for a larger investigation of this phenomenon that would further establish
      an association between DP and developmental delay.
