      The purpose of this study is to examine whether person-centered high-intense aerobic /
      strength training during five months reduces inflammation and disease activity, improve
      immune cell function, and increases muscle strength, fitness and ability of the individual
      independence in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
