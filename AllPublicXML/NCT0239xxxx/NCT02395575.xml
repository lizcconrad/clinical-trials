    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the result of the Prosigna
      Test (assay) on the therapeutic decision of adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and hormone
      therapy) in patients suffering from early-stage breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives will consist of:

        -  The evaluation of the confidence in the therapeutic indications of the practitioners
           before and after the test (assay) results, and by subgroups of cancers

        -  The evaluation of the rate of secondary effects of chemotherapy,

        -  The evaluation of the emotional state of patients faced with the therapeutic decision,
           of their degree of anxiety and of their functional status before and after the Prosigna
           test (assay) results
