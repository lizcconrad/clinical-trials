  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are all significant risk factors for poor early cognitive development and, as such,
      neurocognitive deficits have been demonstrated in pre-school children with sickle cell
      disease (SCD). This project assesses the efficacy of using an evidence-based early
      stimulation program, combined with components to help parents cope with stress, delivered
      during six routine monthly clinic visits to parents of children with sickle cell disease. It
      is hoped that this innovation will improve parental psychological outcomes, as well as child
      developmental outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of various complications, many of which
      arise suddenly and call on the problem solving skills of their parents. They are also at risk
      of neurocognitive delays; these may become evident during the pre-school years. Previous
      research by this group has demonstrated improved developmental outcomes after parental
      interventions incorporating play techniques in high risk and healthy pre-school children. The
      aim of the study is to determine usefulness in children with SCD of similar developmental
      interventions augmented by lessons in problem solving.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial. Parents of all infants with Hb SS (homozygous
      sickle cell disease) or Sβ0 -thalassemia disease identified by newborn screening during the
      initial year of the study will be invited to participate. They will be randomized to
      intervention or control. Parental stress, infant's development and hemoglobin levels will be
      measured at recruitment and again after six months. The intervention will occur during
      monthly Penadur (intramuscular Benzathine Penicillin) visits and will include supervised play
      with their children using an inexpensive toy and participation in solving a problem which may
      arise as they parent their child with SCD. At the end of the study, all control dyads will
      also be given the toys used in the intervention. All parents will be given the results of
      their children's developmental assessments and appropriate referrals made if deficits are
      identified.

      The study is minimal risk. Every effort will be made to maintain patient confidentiality.
      Respect for, and the maximum protection of the best interests of the research subjects will
      be maintained.

    <description>Short films that have been developed to deliver a series of child development messages will be shown at the monthly visits. Nine modules of approximate length 3 minutes each have been developed and cover the topics: Love, Comforting baby, Talking to babies and children, Praise, Using bath time to play and learn, Looking at books, Simple toys mothers can make, Drawing and games, and Puzzles. Nurses at the Sickle cell Unit (SCU) will be trained to discuss the video messages with the mothers/caregivers, demonstrate activities they can do with their children and how to make simple toys from household materials. Mothers/caregivers will practice some of the activities and they will be encouraged to make them part of their daily routine.</description>

    <description>Problem solving therapy (PST) aims to empower patients or caregivers in attending to daily challenges. It is based on cognitive behavioural therapy and can be used in primary care settings. It encourages persons to use existing resources and skills to function better and find solutions to problems. It will be delivered in 6 sessions over the 6-week period and will last for about 30 minutes per session. The stages of PST are: identification of the problems; generating possible solutions; evaluating and implementing preferred solution; and evaluating to see if the solutions were successful. The parent/caregiver will be taught a process of problem solving with reference to general everyday problems as well as specific problems which may arise while parenting a child with SCD.</description>
