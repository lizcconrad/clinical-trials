  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, two-parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial testing the
      superiority of Ofatumumab versus placebo in the treatment of children with DR-INS.
      Participants will be stratified according to eGFR at enrollment.

      Eligible participants will enter a 3-months run-in period, during which instructions on urine
      collection and dipstick readings will be carefully reviewed, compliance assessed and any
      immunosuppressive therapies withdrawn according to the following schemes:

        -  prednisone will be tapered off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal;

        -  calcineurin inhibitors and mofetile mycophenolate will be decreased by 50% and withdrawn
           after 2 additional weeks In order to minimize the risk of complications of uncontrolled
           INS a treatment with ACE-inhibitor at 6 mg/m2 will be maintained or started in all
           patients.

      After run-in period, children will be randomized to the intervention arm (Ofatumumab) or
      comparator arm (placebo). Randomization will be stratified by eGFR at randomization: ≥90 and
      &lt;90 ml/min/1.73 m2.

      All patients will be followed up to 12 months and they will leave the study at time of
      relapse.

      Relapse will be defined as uPCR ≥2000 mg/g (≥200 mg/mmol) or ≥ 3+ protein on urine dipstick
      for 3 consecutive days.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Drug Name: Ofatumumab
Why: Anti-body/antigen interaction results in cell apoptosis and reduced CD20 positive cell related activities
Procedures: methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg infused in 30' IV diluted in 100 ml of normal saline (NaCl 0,9%); oral paracetamol 15 mg/kg ; cetirizine 0,4 mg/kg IV infused slowly in 5 ml of normal saline (NaCl 0,9%) prior to Ofatumumab infusion to reduce common reactions
Who provides: registered nurse
How: Ofatumumab IV at 12 ml/hour in the first 30'. Thereafter, the infusion rate can be doubled every 30 minutes up to a maximum of 200 ml/hour.
Where: in Hospital
When and how much: once; diluted in 1000 ml of normal saline
Tailoring: 1500 mg/1.73m2
How well: expert nurse would assist administration</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Placebo</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Drug Name: Normal Saline (NaCl 0,9%)
Why: standard therapy could not be used as comparator for Ofatumumab, given its toxicity and lack of effectiveness. Moreover, although Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, is increasingly being used as a steroid-sparing treatment option for children with certain forms of INS (those that respond to and are dependent of steroids), this drug does not work in DR-INS and could not be used as a comparator.
Materials and Procedures: The placebo arm will receive the same infusion as the Ofatumumab Arm with the exception of the Ofatumumab.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Drug resistance: it signifies lack of antiproteinuric effect of a double therapy based
             on steroid plus CNI or mofetil mycophenolate (MMF). Steroid resistance is defined by
             failure to achieve complete remission after 6 weeks with prednisone 60 mg/m2. CNI
             (cyclosporine/tacrolimus) resistance is defined by failure to achieve complete
             remission within 6 months after the plasma concentration of cyclosporine (started at
             dosage of 4 mg/kg/day) or tacrolimus (started at dosage of 0,1 mg/kg/day) reached
             effective plasma concentrations. Mofetil Mycophenolate resistance is defined by
             failure to achieve complete remission after at least 6 months of treatment with
             1200mg/mq/day.

          -  Parents'/guardian's written informed consent, and child's assent given before any
             study-related procedure not part of the subject's normal medical care, with the
             understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without
             prejudice to his or her future medical care.

          -  Age between 2 and 18 years

          -  Histological pattern of minimal change disease, mesangial proliferation with IgM
             deposits or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis

             old patients.

          -  Hystological pattern characterized by elements suggestive for congenital disease:
             diffuse mesangial sclerosis without IgM deposits, cystic-like tubular dilatation,
             mitochondrial abnormalities evident on electron microscopy, IF suggestive for
             congenital collagen 4 disease.

          -  Histological pattern not suitable with INS in the pediatric age (membranous
             glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, diffuse and/or localized vasculitis, amyloidosis)

          -  Homozygous or heterozygous mutations of podocitary genes, commonly involved in the
             etiology of INS (NPHS1, NPHS2, NPHS3, NPHS6, WT1, COQ2, COQ6, MYO1E, SMARCAL1, LAMB2,
