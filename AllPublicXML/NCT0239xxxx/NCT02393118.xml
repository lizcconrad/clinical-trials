  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BrainPort V200 Device is a wearable, non-surgical, prosthetic device intended for people
      who are profoundly blind. The BrainPort V200 translates images captured by a digital camera
      into electro-tactile stimulation presented on the user's tongue to perceive shape, size,
      location, and motion of objects within the environment. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and functional performance of the BrainPort V200 device in individuals
      who have been medically documented as blind, light perception or worse, due to a traumatic
      injury (cortical or ocular).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A minimum age of 18 years at enrollment.

          2. A documented vision diagnosis of light perception or worse bilaterally.

          3. Blinded by traumatic injury (i.e., ocular or cortical trauma).

          4. Minimum post 12 months diagnosis of blindness.

          5. Previous completion of conventional rehabilitation such as orientation and mobility
             training with a cane or guide dog.
