    <textblock>
      Guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedures have significantly evolved over the last 20 years.
      Significant advances have been made with various barrier membranes with or without the use of
      bone grafts and other materials. Some of the main limitations of non-resorbable barriers
      included cytotoxicity and need for removal, which can adversely affect the regenerated bone
      volume. Similar GBR success has been documented extensively with cell occlusive resorbable
      barriers membranes. Recently, the investigators demonstrated supracrestal bone regeneration
      in guided tissue regeneration procedures in humans with the use of novel perforated barrier
      membrane (MPM). The perforation allows mesenchymal stem cells and other progenitor cells
      present in the gingival tissues to migrate into the osseous defect and contribute to the
      osseous regeneration potential.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the GBR potential of MPM in alveolar ridge
      defects, relative to a similar occlusive barrier. Ten non-smoking patients that need
      localized alveolar ridge augmentation prior to implant placement will be included into the
      study. Patients will be divided into two groups, as follows: occlusive bovine collagen
      membrane (OM control group, 5 patients) and modified bovine perforated collagen membrane (MPM
      test group, 5 patients). All sites will be grafted with mineralized cortical bone allograft
      and when needed cortical bone pins will be use for site stability. A Cone Bean (CT) will be
      obtained prior to surgery and 6-8 months post treatment from which volumetric width changes
      will be quantify. A bone biopsy will be obtained at the time of implant placement (~6-8
      months) to determine residual graft particles and new bone formation. Dimensional width
      changes will be assess at 6-8 months during re-entry for implant placement. Soft tissue
      healing will be assessed at 2, 4, 8, 16 weeks and 6 months.

      This study can potentially impact current bone augmentation techniques and may lead to the
      modification of existing commercial membranes that will enhance site development prior to
      implant placement. The contribution of progenitor cells to the osseous defect might lead to
      greater bone formation and possible faster wound healing.
