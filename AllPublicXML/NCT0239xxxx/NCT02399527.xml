  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic anomalies are a rare subset of vascular anomalies that are poorly understood. the
      understanding of the natural history, long-term outcomes, risk factors for morbidity and
      mortality, and the relative benefit of medical therapies and procedures is limited.The goal
      of this project is to better understand these diseases and improve the care of theses rare
      patients. To do this, the investigators are conducting an observational study of patients
      with lymphatic anomalies, including an annual follow-up questionnaire to gather prospective
      data on mortality, morbidity, treatments, and functionality as well as quality of life.

      The purpose of the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry, created at Boston Children's Hospital, is to
      create a database to help current and future patients diagnosed with a lymphatic anomaly. The
      ultimate goal of the registry is to better understand and predict responses to therapies and
      risk factors for complications. Although the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry exists at Boston
      Children's Hospital, patients can be entered into the registry regardless of whether or not
      they visit Boston Children's Hospital, thus increasing the program's accessibility. The
      Lymphatic Anomalies Registry includes patients who have vascular anomalies with a lymphatic
      component across various diagnoses. From the patient's perspective, participation in the
      Lymphatic Anomalies Registry means taking part in a short, thirty minute interview, and
      providing the registry with access to medical records. The interview is conducted verbally
      with study staff of the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry, and can take place either at the
      hospital, or over the phone. During the interview, the registry will inquire about the
      patient's diagnosis, disease features, medical therapies, and procedures. Interested
      prospective patients will receive an introductory packet from the registry with information
      on how to proceed in the registry process. All obtained patient information is housed on a
      secure, HIPPA compliant, internal database, managed by Boston Children's Hospital staff.
      Patient information entered into the external database is de-identified. The research teams
      will also obtain a medical record release form to request the patient's medical record for
      review in our study.

        Both domestic and international patients with complex lymphatic anomalies, as described
        above, are eligible to participate. Travel to Boston is not required for participation.
        Eligible patients are identified through active referral in the Vascular Anomalies Center
        at Boston Children's Hospital. Physicians and patients may also refer eligible patients
        directly to the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry. Patients may indicate interest in
        participation themselves by contacting the registry team through the &quot;Contact Us&quot; link on
        www.lymphaticregistry.org.
