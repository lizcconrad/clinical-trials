    <measure>Assessment Of Participant's Ability To Use The SSEC</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at the time of the participant's termination of study treatment (up to 72 hours after study drug administration)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator's assessment of participant's ability to use the SSEC system safely and effectively. The assessment consisted of a 4-level categorical evaluation (poor, fair, good, and excellent). Because of the descriptive nature of this study, no formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment Of Adherence Of The SSEC System To Skin</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately prior to removal at each 24-hour time point, or at early withdrawal, for up to 3 consecutive days (up to 72 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The adhesion of each SSEC was evaluated immediately prior to removal at each 24-hour time point, or at early withdrawal. Adhesion was recorded using the following classification: System adhered to at least 90% of the application area with no edges unattached; System adhered between 75% and 89%; System was &lt;75% adhered and not taped; System was secured with tape. The number of SSEC systems for all time points in each category is presented. Because of the descriptive nature of this study, no formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline To 1 Hour And 24 Hours In Skin Irritation Score After SSEC Removal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 hour and 24 hours after SSEC removal.</time_frame>
    <description>Skin irritation at the SSEC application site was to be assessed immediately prior to placement of the study system and at 1 and 24 hours after removal of each study system. The application site was to be scored using the following scale: 0=No evidence of irritation; 1=Minimal erythema, barely perceptible; 2=Definite erythema, readily visible, minimal edema, or minimal papular response; 3=Erythema and papules; 4=Definite edema; 5=Erythema, edema, and papules; 6=Vesicular eruption; 7=Strong reaction spreading beyond the application site.</description>

    <measure>Number Of Participants To Experience Clinically Relevant Respiratory Depression (CRRD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of application of the first system through 7 days following end of study drug administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory function and occurrence of CRRD was defined as simultaneous occurrence of bradypnoea (respiratory rate &lt;10 breaths per minute for participants 9-15 years of age and sustained for 1 minute, or &lt;8 breaths per minute for participants 16-17 years of age), with excessive sedation (that is, the participant is not easily aroused).</description>
