    <textblock>
      This is a phase I open-label study to evaluate the safety of ALLO-ASC-DFU in diabetic foot
      ulcers patients. ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells. Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release
      growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor
      (HGF), which can enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide an
      new option in treating a diabetic foot ulcer.
