      Background. Balance disorders and falls are common in People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS)
      Objective: Our hypothesis was that PwMS treated for balance disorders would reduce balance
      disorders and frequency of falls.

      Methods: A bi-centre randomised Rater-blinded controlled trial. Participants in both groups
      received 20 treatment sessions. Participants in the intervention group received treatment
      aimed at improving control of the position and movement of the centre of mass and body
      segments. Participants in the control group received treatments to reduce limitations at
      activity and body function level.

      Group allocation was done by an independent clinician by a randomization list made before the
      beginning of the study. Group allocation was kept concealed throughout the study and
      participants were not aware of group assignment.

      Data was analyzed according to a preplanned protocol by using an intention to treat approach.

    <description>Participants in the intervention group received at least 25-45' of balance treatment. The balance treatments were aimed at improving participants' control of the position and movement of the center of mass and body segments during static, dynamic and transitional tasks.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group were treated to reduce limitations at body function and activity levels, while treatment for balance disorders was restricted to a maximum of 10' per session. Treatment mainly focused on increasing range of joints motion, reducing of muscle contractures and strength training.</description>
