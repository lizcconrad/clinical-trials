      To study if incisional vacuum-assisted closure can decrease the risk of infection in cesarean
      section incisions in the obese compared with standard sterile dressing.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) â‰¥ 30) has significantly
      increased, affecting approximately 35% of adult females in the United States, according to
      CDC 2009-2010 statistics. Obesity has a significant impact on pregnancy, including increased
      need for cesarean section and post-operative wound complications. Infection rates have been
      reported to be between 10 and 30%. The advent in 1997 of negative pressure therapy (NPT),
      also known as vacuum assisted closure (VAC), has vastly changed wound care management.
      Briefly, VAC has been traditionally applied to a chronic wound to create negative or
      sub-atmospheric pressure, thus promoting wound healing by decreasing edema and increasing
      blood flow and formation of granulation tissue. Use of this therapy at the time of primary
      closure of a surgical incision (first trialed in 2006 and termed &quot;Incisional VAC&quot;) has
      provided a promising approach to reducing post-operative wound infection. Incisional VAC has
      been explored primarily in the orthopedic and cardiothoracic fields, but very few studies
      have examined the use on abdominal incisions, and only one to date on cesarean section
      incisions.
