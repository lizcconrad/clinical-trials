    <textblock>
      This study compares the morphological concordance between CT (computed tomography) and cone
      beam in sinus on 26 validated items. CT and cone beam is performed on each patient.
      Performances of these two imagery technics seem to be closed. Nevertheless, the exposure of
      the ionizing radiations is lower with the cone beam.

    <measure>Diagnosis concordance radio-endoscopic and radio-surgical</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Radio-endoscopic surgical concordance and radio will be estimated by calculating the proportion of concordant diagnoses between the radiological evaluation and cone beam scanner and endoscopic evaluation obtained at the first nasal endoscopy and radiological evaluation between the scanner and cone beam and intraoperative assessment in case of surgery. The investigators then compare the radio-endoscopic surgical concordance and radio and the cone beam scanner.</description>
