    <textblock>
      Introduction: Currently, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most serious public
      health problems, becoming a global epidemic. It is also known that the amount of displacement
      of overnight rostral fluid, from the lower limbs, is related to increased neck circumference
      and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with end-stage renal disease.
      Method / Design: A clinical trial study aiming to assess the degree of collapsibility of the
      upper airway in patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis has been proposed. The test of the
      negative expiratory pressure and nocturnal polysomnography will be performed before and after
      the hemodialysis session. Discussion: The incidence of CKD has increased, due to the
      increased number of cases of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Our hypothesis is that the
      weight gain due to volume overload, observed in the interdialytic period, will exert a
      negative influence on the degree of collapsibility of the upper airways predispose to OSA in
      CKD patients.

    <description>Daytime haemodialysis was standardised. It was performed 3 times per week, with a 4-h session duration, 250-mL/min blood flow, and 500-mL/min dialysate flow, using bicarbonate buffered dialysate with 1.25 mmol/L ionised calcium concentration, dialysate temperature of 36.5°C.
The ultrafiltration amount for each haemodialysis session was decided by individual dry weight, which was fixed during the trial. In addition, the patients were not permitted to change their medication or start new drugs, especially antiplatelet agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium-channel blockers, and β-blockers.
The patients who required a change in medication for medical reasons were subsequently excluded from the study.</description>
