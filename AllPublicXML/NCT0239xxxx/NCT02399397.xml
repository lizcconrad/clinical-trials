    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the influence of age and sepsis on in vivo activity of OATP1A2
      using rocuronium (ROC) as a probe and evaluating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in
      ASA I-III surgical patients. Thus, adult patients without sepsis (control group, n= 12),
      adult patients with sepsis (sepsis group, n= 12) and elderly patients without sepsis (elderly
      group, n= 12), all submitted to small to medium-sized surgeries who were induced with
      individual doses of rocuronium, fentanyl and propofol are being investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rocuronium (ROC), a neuromuscular blocking agent used in surgical procedures, is primarily
      eliminated by biliary excretion. Its distribution to the liver, mediated the organic anion
      transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2), is a determining factor for the duration of
      neuromuscular blockade. Age and release of cytokines during inflammation and infection
      processes of sepsis can alter expression of SLCO1A2 gene, encoding OATP1A2. The objective of
      this study is to evaluate the influence of age and sepsis on in vivo activity of OATP1A2
      using ROC as a probe and evaluating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in ASA I-III
      surgical patients. Adult patients without sepsis (control group, n=12), adult patients with
      sepsis (sepsis group, n=12) and elderly patients without sepsis (elderly group, n=12), all
      submitted to small to medium-sized surgeries are being investigated. All patients are being
      induced with individual doses of rocuronium, fentanyl and propofol. Serial blood samples are
      being collected up to 360 minutes after administration of ROC. Neuromuscular blockade induced
      by ROC is monitored by stimulation of the adductor muscle of the thumb on the ulnar nerve
      through the train of four monitoring (TOF) at the same times of blood sampling. The plasma
      concentration of ROC will be analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
      with electrospray ionization using positive ion mode.
