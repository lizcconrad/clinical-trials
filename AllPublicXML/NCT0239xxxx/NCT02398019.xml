  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients whom require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during surgery present systemic
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to blood cell activation and cytokine release to
      circulation. SIRS can lead to organ dysfunction due to hemodynamic compromise (vasodilatation
      plus leak syndrome) and/or cytokine mediated cell injury. Renal dysfunction is a major
      adverse complication after CPB surgery. Investigators hypothesize that the use of an
      increased adsorption membrane (OXIRIS®) during CPB is safe and presents low technical
      complexity. The safe use of OXIRIS® will reduce both cytokine circulatory levels and
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) circulatory levels therefore decreasing SIRS and its systemic
      effects specially those concerning renal function. Therefore, patients receiving (OXIRIS®)
      could potentially present less postcardiac surgery acute kidney injury (pAKI), lower
      intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and lower production of renal injury
      biomarkers (cell-cycle-arrest-proteins) tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and
      insulin growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP-7).

      Patients whom meet inclusion criteria would be proposed to participate once admitted to
      cardiac presurgical ward.

      After informed consignment, on those patients randomized to CPB-OXIRIS®, PrismafleX eXeed™ II
      (Hospal) with OXIRIS® set will be irrigated with saline during preparation and irrigation of
      CPB circuit. PrismafleX eXeed™ II (Hospal) with OXIRIS® set will then be connected to CPB
      circuit. Blood flow between 150-200 ml/min will be derivatised from the CPB circuit into the
      PrismafleX eXeed™ so that it all flows through OXIRIS® membrane. Flow, pressure and alarms
      will be controlled by PrismafleX eXeed™ independently from CPB circuit.

      OXIRIS® membrane will be only employed for adsorption (neither convection nor diffusion will
      be performed) during all CPB time. Using CPB flow, patient will not require venous catheter
      access neither changes in CPB normal settings.

      All blood samples collected during study will be obtained from CPB circuit or central venous
      catheters (standard cardiac surgery protocol).

      During all CPB time besides the ordinary cardiac surgery assistance team, a supplementary RRT
      expert team will be present in those patients randomized to CPB-Oxiris.

      Blood samples and all variables will be equally collected and registered in the control group
      (CPB-Standard) with no modifications from CPB standard practice.

      Adverse events will be reported (in less than 24 hours if severe) to the sponsor center to be
      properly evaluated. If the severe adverse event (SAE) is finally evaluated by the study board
      as related to the intervention arm, urgent notification to health authorities must proceed
      and study should be interrupted until further decision.

      Investigators will warrant a correct protocol application. Study data will be reviewed by an
      external monitoring committee from the clinical assay research central unit (UCICEC -
      IDIBELL). Monitors will contrast registered data from the collection data form (CDF) with
      data from patient´s medical record. All patient´s medical records will be indefinitely saved
      in electronical format to be reviewed if necessary.

        1. Registered variables and follow-up.

           Renal function related parameters. Plasma creatinine and urine output will be registered
           at baseline, prior to CPB, at ICU admission, 6 hours ,12 hours, 24h postCBP and every
           24h during the first week after cardiac surgery in order to evaluate postcardiac surgery
           acute kidney injury based on AKIN criteria (AKIN criteria Kidney inter.,2012; 2: 1-138.)
           Urinary cell cycle arrest proteins TIMP-2 y IGFBP-7 will also be quantified at ICU
           admission. Renal function will be checked at hospital discharge.

           Inflammatory response parameters:

           Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein-1
           (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10),
           interleukin-18 (IL-18), complement 5a (C5a), high mobility binding protein 1 (HMBP-1),
           RANTES, oligodeoxyribonucleotide alfa (GRO-alfa), leukocytes count, lactate, D-dimer,
           free plasma hemoglobin, HO-1, free iron and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels will be
           determined in plasma.

           These determinations will be measured baseline (0hours), and at times T1 (end of CPB),
           T2 (ICU admission) and T3 (24hours from ICU admission).

           Ordinary laboratory parameters:

           Plasmatic urea, potassium, albumin magnesium, phosphate, glucosa, sodium, chloride,
           Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hemogram and coagulation
           times will be determined following the ordinary cardiac surgery protocol (every 8 hours
           during the first 24h).

           Clinical and respiratory parameters:

           Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters will be registered every hour. Arterial and
           venous gasometries with arterial lactate will be determined every 8 hours during the
           first 24 hours. Temperature, heart rate, arterial blood pressure (systolic, diastolic,
           and mean), central venous pressure, vasopressor and/or inotrope dose will be registered
           during surgery and at ICU according to standard protocol.

           Demographic and clinical record data:

           Age, gender, weight, height, relevant clinical records, previous or chronic medication,
           type of cardiac surgery, surgery times, time on CPB, surgical complications, blood
           transfusions during and after surgery, prognostic scores (SOFA, APACHE II and SAPS II),
           ICU stay, hospital stay. Clinical outcome (survival at discharge, 28 and 90 days) and
           renal outcome (renal function, and RRT requirements).

        2. Techniques

           Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

           LPS plasmatic concentration will be measured using an Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL)
           test (Levin, J, et al. Thrombosis Et Diathesis Haemorrhagica. 1968; 19:186). This
           technique is performed when LAL proteolytic factors are activated by LPS. Life
           Technologies kit will be used for this (Thermo Fischer Scientific).

           NephroCheck®

           Commercial diagnostic kit based on an in vitro fluorescence immunoassay technique in
           order to quantify TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7 urinary biomarkers.

           Cytokines analysis

           IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, TNFα, MCP-1, HMBP-1, RANTES, GROα quantification will be
           performed with multiplex new technology. MILLIPLEX (Millipore) magnetic balls system
           will be used.

        3. Study Limitations

           SIRS harmful effects which are initiated during CPB may persist after surgery and this
           is an important limitation as our study only evaluates the use of increased adsorption
           membranes during CPB. However, investigators hypothesize that the important effect on
           cytokine and LPS levels during CPB will be observed. Furthermore, patients requiring non
           emergent cardiac surgery represent a non absolutely homogeneous cohort and this could
           introduce potential bias in main and secondary objectives. To avoid this potential bias,
           temporary sequential randomization has been performed and advanced chronic renal failure
           patients have been excluded.

           Cell cycle arrest proteins, due to test´s high cost, will only be determined (single
           check point) at ICU admission and this could also introduce a temporary bias as this
           biomarkers could still be undetectable in urine sample. However, investigators think
           that ICU admission is probably the most important moment after surgery in order to
           decide or change clinical strategies as this could be done based on cell cycle arrest
           proteins values.

        4. Statistical analysis

      Missing data will try to be avoided by an exhaustive patient´s follow up by study
      investigators. Data registry has been created to include all variables with written
      individual data collection forms (DCF). Data will be bedside registered by the study members
      but final software database registration will be done by the statistics outside investigator
      who has no contact with patients situation. Cytokines and LPS levels will be introduced in
      DCF when measured.

      Statistical analysis will be done by the statistics investigator who wont have any role in
      patient´s selection, randomization, or follow up. SPSS v. 20.0 for statistical analysis will
      be used. Variable distribution will be studied and logarithmic transformation will be used on
      those variables that don't present normal distribution, presumably cytokine and LPS levels.
      Univariate analysis comparing clinical, demographic, biochemical, metabolic, hemodynamic and
      respiratory baseline variables between both arms (CPB-OXIRIS® and CPB-Standard), will be done
      with two-tailed t test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical
      variables. Variables determined several times (T0, T1, T2, T3) will be analysed using a
      one-way repeated measures ANOVA test in order to demonstrate differences between both arms.
      Multivariate analysis will be completed to control those clinically relevant confounding
      variables as well as to discover baseline differences. Arm intervention (CPB-OXIRIS®,
      CPB-Standard) will be considered as the main independent variable adding other control
      independent variables. Intervention safety will be measured by the presence of any adverse
      effects not related to the standard technique. This effects will be recorded during CPB,
      after CPB, and during the first 24 hours postsurgery.

      As the study is measuring cytokine and LPS levels in four different moments (T0, T1, T2, T3),
      in order to maximize statistical power and reduce control variables number, the area under
      the curve (AUC) we´ll be determined for every cytokine and LPS during the first 24 hours. Due
      to this statistical maneuver investigators will obtain a continuous variable that represents
      each cytokine-LPS level during the biochemical study period (24 hours). To evaluate if the
      arm intervention improvement in terms of efficacy and safety could be related to cytokine
      and/or LPS levels during the first 24 hours, a mediation complementary analysis will be done
      considering cytokine-LPS (represented by AUC) as a mediator between the independent variable
      (intervention arm) and the effect we study.
