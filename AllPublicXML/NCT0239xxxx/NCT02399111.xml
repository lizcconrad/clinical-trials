      The purpose of this research study is to investigate if a new negative pressure incision
      (surgical cut) management system, could reduce the occurrence of groin wound infections after
      vascular surgery. This is a single use, sterile dressing that is applied to the patient's
      skin. It has an attached battery-powered unit that provides negative pressure (a vacuum
      environment) to the dressing and a disposable canister for the collection of wound fluids.
      The patient is being asked to participate in this study because the patient is planning to
      have a vascular surgery procedure that involves groin incision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) in groin wounds after vascular surgery is a significant
      contributing factor for increased morbidity. Despite the use of prophylactic systemic
      antibiotics, postoperative groin wound infection still occurs in some circumstances and it
      continues to be a serious problem after vascular surgical procedures. The incidence of SSI
      varies from 5 - 40%, and depending upon the depth of infection and type of vascular
      procedure, the morbidity could range from prolonged hospital stay to limb loss.

      Increased incidence of SSIs in patients is related to systemic factors like Diabetes,
      hypertension (HTN), history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and
      local factors like disruption of lymphatics, groin proximity to the perineum, previous
      surgery at the same site and the use of prosthetic graft material.

      Prophylactic systemic antibiotics have been routinely used in all vascular surgery
      procedures, and despite of gentle tissue handling, proper hemostasis and other technical
      points to minimize tissue trauma, SSIs do happen.

      The investigators hypothesize that using a closed dressing system with negative pressure will
      keep the surgical site protected from nearby contaminated field and decrease the risk of
      infection

    <description>The PIMS unit is a single patient use, battery-powered, disposable unit that delivers continuous negative 125 mmHg pressure to the closed surgical incision for a 7-day therapy period. It is an easy to use device that also provides audible and visual alerts for low battery, maximum canister volume, and leak conditions. Additional alerts include system error and device life-cycle expiration (8 days). It is contained in a water-resistant housing, which allows the Subject to lightly shower with the device. Wound fluids are contained within the 45 mL canister. For the purposes of this clinical investigation, canisters can be replaced as often as is needed. A carrying case is also provided with the therapy unit, to allow for patient mobility during the therapy period.</description>

            <description>Using Prevena Incision Management System
Prevena Incision Management System: The PIMS unit is a single patient use, battery-powered, disposable unit that delivers continuous negative 125 mmHg pressure to the closed surgical incision for a 7-day therapy period. It is an easy to use device that also provides audible and visual alerts for low battery, maximum canister volume, and leak conditions. Additional alerts include system error and device life-cycle expiration (8 days). It is contained in a water-resistant housing, which allows the Subject to lightly shower with the device. Wound fluids are contained within the 45 mL canister. For the purposes of this clinical investigation, canisters can be replaced as often as is needed. A carrying case is also provided with the therapy unit, to allow for patient mobility during the therapy period.</description>
