  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile Infection (RCDI), with a recent increased
      incidence, is one of the most difficult and increasingly challenges for CDI. Since Fecal
      Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) has been accepted as the first-line therapy for RCDI, it is
      prudent to consider less invasive and more convenient means of administering FMT. The
      majority of reported FMT procedures have been performed with fresh or frozen stool
      suspensions via colonoscopy or nasojejunal tube. Nowadays, using acid-resistant hypromellose
      capsules, Youngster et al. significantly simplified the clinical practice of FMT and removed
      the need for invasive gastrointestinal procedures. However, to avoid undesirable
      disintegration, those capsules containing stool suspensions must be kept frozen all the time,
      which extremely limits their widespread application. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of freeze-dried, capsulized FMT for RCDI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with refractory, recurrent or relapsing C. difficile infection (RCDI), as
             defined in guidelines as a relapse of CDI after having at least 3 episodes of mild to
             moderate CDI and failure of a 6- to 8-week taper with vancomycin with or without an
             alternative antibiotic or at least 2 episodes of severe CDI resulting in
             hospitalization and associated with significant morbidity;

          -  Willingness to accept risk of healthy unrelated donor stool.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Delayed gastric emptying syndrome;

          -  Known chronic aspiration;

          -  Swallowing dysfunction or oral-motor dyscoordination;
