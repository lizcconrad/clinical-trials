    <textblock>
      The SPARK trial is testing the use of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring in prostate cancer
      patients being treated with Stereotactic Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy. The researchers
      expect this trial to result in better targeted prostate cancer patient outcomes with lower
      toxicity. The potential application of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring to other tumour
      sites will pave the way for additional trials with Australasian radiation oncology leading
      the world.

    <textblock>
      Most linear accelerators used to treat cancer patients today are equipped with fixed X-ray
      imagers which are typically used to take images of a tumour before a patient receives
      radiotherapy. A new technology, known as Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring has recently
      emerged which allows images of a tumour to be taken in real-time while the treatment is
      occurring. The advantage of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring is that it enables
      strategies such as patient shifting or beam shifting during treatment which could potentially
      improve the accuracy of the treatment and reduce the patient's side effects. In addition, due
      to the accuracy of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring in targeting tumours, the number of
      treatment sessions this group of patients will require will be reduced to five as opposed to
      the 40 sessions required using more conventional treatment methods.
