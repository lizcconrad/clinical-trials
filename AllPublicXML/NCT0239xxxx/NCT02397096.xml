  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a switch to MK-1439A (MK-1439 [doravirine]
      plus lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in HIV-1-infected participants
      virologically suppressed on a protocol-specified antiretroviral regimen. The primary
      hypothesis is that a switch to MK-1439A will be non-inferior to continuation of the regimen
      at Screening for 24 weeks, as assessed by the proportion of participants maintaining HIV-1
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL. The Base Study will last up to 50 weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two optional study extensions are planned. Study Extension 1 will evaluate efficacy and
      safety of the switch to MK-1439A for an additional 2 years beyond the Base Study. Study
      Extension 2 will evaluate safety of the switch to MK-1439A until MK-1439A becomes locally
      available, or 2 years beyond Study Extension 1, whichever comes first.

             hepatic function)

          -  Has evidence of decompensated liver disease or has liver cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh
             Class C score or Pugh-Turcotte score &gt;9
