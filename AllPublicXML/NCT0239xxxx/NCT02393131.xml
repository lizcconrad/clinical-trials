    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are the most common brain tumors in adults. It is estimated that around
      10-30% of cancer patients would develop brain metastases during the course of their illness.

      Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with
      brain metastases. WBRT yields high radiologic response rate (27~56%) and is effective in
      rapid palliation of neurologic symptoms as well as prolongs time to neurocognitive function
      decline caused by intracranial lesions. By using conventional fractionation, 33% of patients
      developed late neurocognitive toxicity while memory impairment was the most common symptom.
      The incidence is even higher when a formal and sensitive neurocognitive assessment was
      prospectively evaluated. With more long-term survivors nowadays, it has become increasingly
      important to minimize neurocognitive function decline and maintain quality of life in
      patients with brain metastasis.

      The function of hippocampus is cooperation in learning, consolidation and retrieval of
      information and essential for formation of new memories. Bilateral and unilateral radiation
      injury of the hippocampus is known to alter learning and memory formation. Several
      preclinical studies support the hypothesis of hippocampus-mediated cognitive dysfunction by
      ionizing radiation. Clinical studies show increase in radiation dose to hippocampus is
      associated with subsequent neurocognitive function impairment in adult and pediatric
      patients. Furthermore, the preliminary result of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0933
      suggested hippocampal avoidance significant reduce the mean relative decline at 4 months from
      30% in historical cohort with WBRT to 7% in experimental cohort.

      Previous studies showed brain structures other than hippocampus are also associated with
      radiation-induced decline in neurocognitive function. There is presence of placebo effect for
      interventions seeking improvement in neurocognitive function. In present study, a single
      blind randomized phase II trial is designed to investigate the effectiveness of
      neurocognitive function preservation using conformal WBRT with or without hippocampal
      avoidance.

      This is a single institutional, randomized phase II study to assess the neurocognitive
      outcome of conformal WBRT with or without hippocampal avoidance in patients with multiple
      brain metastases.

      Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive conformal WBRT with or without hippocampal
      avoidance using permuted blocks within strata that are defined by Graded Prognostic
      Assessment (GPA) score and baseline neurocognitive status. All patients and co-investigators
      except the principal investigator and attending radiation oncologists will be blinded for
      treatment groups.

      The whole brain planning target volume (PTV) will receive 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Treatment
      will be delivered once daily, 5 fractions per week, over 2 to 2.5 weeks. Breaks in treatment
      should be minimized.

      Hippocampal Avoidance WBRT:

      The dose is prescribed such as 90% of cranial content PTV is covered by the prescription
      dose.

      Maximum dose to 2% of the PTV (D2%) is 37.5 Gy, and minimum dose to 98% of the PTV (D98%) is
      25 Gy. Minimum dose to 100% of the hippocampal avoidance regions is 10 Gy, and dose to any
      point within the hippocampal avoidance regions cannot exceed 17 Gy.

      Conformal WBRT:

      The dose is prescribed such as 95% of cranial content PTV is covered by the prescription
      dose.

      Maximum dose to 1% of the PTV (D1%) is 36 Gy, and minimum dose to 99% of the PTV (D99%) is 27
      Gy.

      Follow-up &amp; Assessment

      Side effect evaluation:

        -  Acute (â‰¤ 90 days from WBRT start) toxicities (CTCAE ver.4)

        -  Late (&gt; 90 days from WBRT start) toxicities (CTCAE ver.4)

      Functional evaluation: at baseline, 2-, 4- ,and 6-month, every 3 months for 12 months until
      intracranial disease progression or death after WBRT

        -  Neurocognitive function

        -  Self-reported cognitive functioning (two items from EORTC Quality of Life
           Questionnaire-C30 Taiwan)

        -  Health-related quality of life specific for brain neoplasms (EORTC Quality of Life
           Questionnaire-Brain Neoplasm Taiwan)

      Efficacy evaluation:

        -  Follow-up brain MRI at 4-, 9- ,and 12-month until intracranial disease progression, or
           death.

        -  Overall survival
