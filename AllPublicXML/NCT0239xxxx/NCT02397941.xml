      -  Purpose of the study is the assessment of interrectal distance and dimensions of the
           muscles of the lateral abdominal wall in pregnant and non-pregnant women

        -  Assessment via ultrasound measurement transabdominally

        -  3 groups of participants: 1.) 20 pregnant women, who have never been pregnant before;
           2.) 40 pregnant women with their first pregnancy, followed over the course of pregnancy;
           3.) 20 women1-5 days after delivery (10 after spontaneous delivery, 10 after planned
           cesarean section)

        -  comparison between pregnant and non-pregnant women; evaluation of influence of pregnancy
           and mode of delivery
