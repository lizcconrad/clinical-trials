  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Factors affecting the success of the treatment of infertility can evaluate before and after
      embryo transfer in two stages. Most of the patients reach the embryo transfer stage.
      Unfortunately, the investigators are able to intervene very few of the factors that will
      affect the success of the post-transfer. All factors and treatments that affect the
      implantation is vital to identify. Basically, healthy vasculature is essential for a
      successful implantation. The investigators will try to understand relationship between
      vascular resistance and type of infertility. The investigators will examine whether the
      effect of the ovarian uterine and spiral artery resistance over infertility.

      In this study the investigators will examine whether the alterations of doppler indices in
      the uterine, ovarian and spiral arteries can help to explain tubal or unexplained infertility
      as a standard screening method. Patients in unexplained-tubal infertility groups were treated
      in our IVF clinic. Patients will be invited to the hospital according to the criteria of the
      study. Fertile patients will be selected according to the criteria for patients who have come
      for the annual smear control. The study hypothesis is that the resistance in ovarian, uterine
      and spiral artery doppler will be higher in cases with tubal and unexplained infertility as
      opposed to low resistance in fertile women.Ovarian, uterine and spiral artery pulsatility
      index (PI = (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity) / time averaged velocity and
      resistance index ( RI= (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity) / peak systolic
      velocity ) will measure with doppler ultrasonography in the mid-luteal phase ( 21th day).
      Measured values are to be compared.
