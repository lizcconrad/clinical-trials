      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have endometrial hyperplasia (a
      pre-cancerous growth of the lining of the uterus) and/or early-stage endometrial cancer.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the Mirena intrauterine device
      (levonorgestrel IUD), alone or in combination with everolimus, is effective for the treatment
      of endometrial hyperplasia and/or early-stage endometrial cancer.

      This is an investigational study. The levonorgestrel IUD is commercially available and FDA
      approved as a form of birth control. The use of the IUD itself to treat endometrial cancer is
      investigational. Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available to treat kidney,
      breast, and pancreatic cancers. The combination of everolimus and the levonorgestrel IUD in
      this study to treat endometrial cancer is investigational.

      Up to 270 patients will be enrolled in this study. Up to 250 will take part at MD Anderson
      and up to 20 will take part at the Harris Health System.

      Stage 1 Study Visits:

      The Levonorgestrel IUD:

      This study will have 2 stages. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, in
      Stage 1, you will receive the levonorgestrel IUD. The levonorgestrel IUD is a T-shaped birth
      control device that is made of flexible plastic. It is designed to prevent pregnancy by
      releasing a hormone called levonorgestrel, which is a type of progesterone. Progesterone is a
      common type of hormone that is used to prevent pregnancy.

      The IUD is placed during an exam of the pelvis. The uterine size is measured and the IUD
      placed directly into your uterus. This placement may be done at the time of the dilation and
      curettage (D&amp;C, explained below) or during a routine clinic visit.

      Removal of the IUD is typically done during a clinic visit during a routine pelvic exam. The
      IUD strings are located, grasped, and used to remove the device.

      Study Surgery and IUD Placement:

      On Day 1 (within 1 week after screening) you will have a standard of care procedure called
      dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) to confirm the diagnosis. You would have this procedure even if
      you did not take part in this study. For this procedure, you will have a pelvic exam, and
      then you will receive general anesthesia to put you to sleep. You may also receive medication
      to numb the cervix. During this procedure a small amount of tissue will be scraped from the
      uterus. You will sign a separate consent form describing this procedure and its risks in more
      detail.

      During the D&amp;C, the levonorgestrel IUD will be placed in your uterus. If you have recently
      had a D&amp;C, the procedure will not need to be repeated. Instead, the IUD will be placed during
      a clinic visit.

      About 1 week after surgery, the study staff will review your surgery and pathology results
      with you. If the results showed that you had a change in your diagnosis from hyperplasia to
      early-stage cancer, the doctor will decide if you are still eligible to take part in this
      study. If the pathology results show that there is grade 2 or higher cancer in the uterus,
      you will be unable to take part in the study. The levonorgestrel IUD can be removed in the
      operating room when you have surgery for removal of disease outside the uterus. You may also
      have the levonorgestrel IUD removed in the clinic.

      At 4 weeks after surgery, you will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. Placement
      of the levonorgestrel IUD will be checked during the pelvic exam. This visit may be in our
      office or at your local doctor's office, whichever you prefer. In addition, you may have an
      ultrasound of your uterus to confirm the location of your IUD. If the IUD is not in the
      correct location, it will be replaced at this visit.

      Stage 1 Study Visits:

      At 3 months after the IUD placement, you will have an endometrial biopsy (a biopsy of the
      uterine lining) to check the status of the disease. This is standard care and would be done
      even if you did not take part in this study.

      If the biopsy shows that the disease has gotten worse, you will be taken off study and other
      treatment options will be discussed with you.

      If the disease appears to have become stable, you will continue on to Stage 2 of the study
      (described below). You will also have a physical exam and blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn
      for routine tests at this visit.

      If the disease appears to have responded completely, you will have a standard of care biopsy
      3 months later to confirm the response. If confirmed, you will then be followed every 6
      months with a standard of care biopsy until the disease appears to get worse or you and/or
      your physician decide to remove the IUD and come off study.

      If a complete response is not confirmed at the 6-month biopsy visit, you will be taken off
      study and the doctor will talk with you about options including surgical or non-surgical
      treatment.

      Stage 2 Study Groups:

      If at 3 months after IUD placement the disease has remained stable, you will be assigned to a
      study group. You will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 2 arms. This is
      done because no one knows if one arm is better, the same, or worse than the other arm.

        -  If you are in Arm 1, you will continue on the levonorgestrel IUD alone.

        -  If you are in Arm 2, you will receive everolimus every day in addition to continuing on
           the levonorgestrel IUD.

      Stage 2 Study Drug Administration:

      If you are in Arm 2, at 3 months after IUD placement, you will take everolimus 1 time a day
      by mouth at about the same time every day. You should take it either consistently with food
      every day or consistently without food every day. Each cycle in Stage 2 is 28 days.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-4, you will use a steroid-based mouth wash to help prevent side effects.
      You may stop taking this if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Stage 2 Study Visits--Arm 1 only:

      If you are in Arm 1, at 6 Months after IUD placement.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  You will have an endometrial biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      If the disease appears to get better or stay the same. You will then be followed every 3
      months with a standard of care biopsy until the disease appears to get worse or you and/or
      your physician decide to remove the IUD and come off study.

      You will have a physical exam and biopsy at 9 months and 1 year.

      If your disease appears to have gotten worse at the 9-month or 1-year biopsy, or your disease
      has stayed the same at the time of the 1-year biopsy, you will come off study and the doctor
      will talk with you about options including surgical or non-surgical treatment.

      If you have a complete response at the time of the 1-year biopsy, you will have a standard of
      care biopsy 3 months later to confirm the response. If confirmed, you will then have a
      standard of care biopsy every 6 months until the disease appears to get worse or you and/or
      your physician decide to remove the IUD.

      Stage 2 Study Visits--Arm 2 only:

      If you are in Arm 2, on Day 1 of each Cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check for
           hepatitis or to check your liver function.

      If you are in Arm 2, at Cycles 3, 6 and 9:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a follow-up endometrial biopsy to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your
           liver function.

      If you are in Arm 2, on Cycle 1 and every 3rd cycle (Cycles 1, 4, 7, and so on) until the end
      of treatment.

      °Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check your blood levels of fat

      If the disease appears to have completely responded at the time of the Cycle 9 biopsy, you
      will have an endometrial biopsy to confirm the response at Cycle 12. If confirmed, you will
      have a biopsy every 6 cycles as long you are on study. You will also have the following tests
      and procedures 1 time each cycle starting at Cycle 10:

      You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be
      drawn for routine tests. If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be
      drawn to check your liver function.

      If the disease appears to have gotten worse at the time of the Cycle 3, 6, or 9 biopsy, you
      will stop taking everolimus and come off study. The doctor will talk with you about surgical
      and/or non-surgical treatment options.

      If the disease has remained stable at the time of the Cycle 9 biopsy, you will come off study
      and the doctor will talk with you about surgical and/or non-surgical treatment options.

      Biomarker Testing:

      Leftover tissue from a previous procedure will be tested for biomarkers. Biomarkers are found
      in the blood/tissue and may be related to your response to levonorgestrel. Biomarker testing
      will also be performed on leftover tissue from the Month 3 EMB, Month 6 EMB and Cycle 3 (only
      if you are in Arm 2), and if you have a hysterectomy.

      End-of-Treatment Visit (Arm 2 only):

      After you are no longer receiving the study treatment(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
