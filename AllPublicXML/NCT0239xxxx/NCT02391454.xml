    <textblock>
      Rationale: Cancer treatment is increasingly successful, resulting in a rising number of
      cancer survivors. A substantial number of survivors may experience long-term and late side
      effects from their cancer treatment. In addition, evidence is accumulating that an active
      lifestyle positively influences cancer treatment outcome and changes the recurrence rates of
      the disease. Therefore, physical activity (PA) programs are urgently needed and should be
      incorporated in current treatment regimens. It is noted though that cancer patients and
      survivors experience difficulties in remaining physically active. A 'smartphone application'
      (app) may be an accessible way to counteract these problems. The app 'RunKeeper', founded by
      Mr. Jason Jacobs, 2008, FitnessKeeper Inc. (RunKeeper) is a free, widely spread and
      well-known app for self-monitoring PA. Convenient features of RunKeeper are self-monitoring
      PA with GPS or stopwatch, recording progress, goal setting, and personal records. In this
      study the investigators aim to determine if the RunKeeper app use improves PA by
      self-monitoring and empowering PA during or after cancer treatment in comparison with usual
      care in a 12-week follow-up.

      Objective: The primary objective is to identify an improvement in PA as measured by the PASE
      questionnaire when using the RunKeeper app in comparison with usual care for 12 weeks during
      or after cancer treatment. The investigators hypothesize that the RunKeeper app might assist
      in stimulating and improving PA behavior. Secondary objectives are to explore the usability
      of the RunKeeper app.

      Study design: The present study is a single-centre prospective two-armed randomized
      controlled feasibility study.

      Study population: Adult patients diagnosed with cancer currently being treated or under
      surveillance at the department of Medical Oncology at the UMCG.

      Intervention: Patients who give informed consent will be randomized in one of the two study
      arms; 'Group A', usual care (N=15) or 'Group B', usual care + the RunKeeper app (N=15).
      Directly after randomization, Group B will be sent a brief user's manual for RunKeeper and
      requested to install the RunKeeper app. Group B will use the RunKeeper app for 12 weeks to
      self-monitor PA.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is to calculate the effect-size of the
      RunKeeper app use for 12 weeks on PA as compared to usual care as measured by the Physical
      Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire. The investigators hypothesize that the
      RunKeeper app might assist in stimulating and improving PA behavior.

    <description>Group B will use the RunKeeper app for 12 weeks to self-monitor PA. In the scope of this study, patients merely have to self-monitor PA (e.g. swimming, biking, hiking, running) by GPS or stopwatch function with RunKeeper. Furthermore, patients are requested to activate the 'training reminder' option in the RunKeeper app, which is explained in the user's manual.</description>
