  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-partum haemorrhage is one of the life threatening emergencies. It accounts for nearly
      one-quarter of all maternal death worldwide. Atonic uterus contributes about 80% among the
      causes. Uterotonic drugs are administered following the delivery of baby both in vaginal and
      caesarean delivery for prevention of PPH. However postpartum haemorrhage cannot always be
      prevented. But, the incidence and especially its magnitude can be reduced by assessing the
      risk factors and following the guidelines. The intelligent anticipation, skilled supervision,
      prompt detection and effective institution of therapy can prevent a normal case from
      undergoing disastrous consequences. This study will be carried out at Bangabandhu Sheikh
      Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) within six months after approval. This is a Randomized
      Control Trial which will compare efficacy of Carbetocin and Oxytocin for the control of PPH.
      Structured Questionnaire, Data Sheet, hospital indoor documents i.e. Patient chart, operation
      notes, surgeons visual estimation of blood loss etc will be used as study tool. Ethical
      clearance will be obtained from Institutional Review Board of BSMMU. Written informed consent
      will be obtained from the patient or from her legal guardian. Patient confidentiality will be
      strictly maintained. No name, address or contact details of the patient will be divulged.
