  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess safety, tolerability and early signs of efficacy of
      the investigational drug Tadekinig alfa in Adult-onset Still's disease, a rare polygenic
      auto-inflammatory disorder for which treatment remains empirical.

      This disease is characterized by a daily spiking fever, arthralgia / arthritis, and skin
      rashes with frequent components of sore throat, lymphadenopathies and neutrophilic
      leukocytosis. The etiology is unknown. In addition to the above-mentioned clinical features,
      the diagnosis includes some laboratory components that reflect the systemic inflammation:
      high erythro-sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, high serum ferritin and high levels of
      interleukin 18 (IL-18).

      Tadekinig alfa is the drug name for recombinant human interleukin-18 binding protein
      (IL-18BP). This investigational drug was tested in healthy volunteers, psoriasis and
      rheumatoid arthritis patients in phase I studies. It demonstrated good safety and
      tolerability profile with only mild adverse events in the injection site.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study considers high levels of IL-18 during active Adult-onset still's
      disease as the therapeutic target. Treatment with IL-18BP will permit to inhibit the
      pro-inflammatory cascade triggered by IL-18 and may help to manage the different components
      of the disease.

      This study is an open label, dose-finding study involving multiple centers in Europe. Two
      dose cohorts (80mg and 160mg) were treated during twelve weeks and followed-up for four more
      weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18 years and older, diagnosed as AoSD based on the presence of the
             Yamaguchi criteria with active disease (see appendix 2), irrespective of the
             continuation of the permitted treatment mentioned below

          -  Patients with active disease will be considered if they exhibit at least two of the
             Yamaguchi's major criteria (see appendix 2) at the screening visit plus at least
             either fever or elevation of markers of inflammation (CRP ≥ 10 mg/L).

          -  Patients that have been exposed to NSAIDS, Prednisone (at least 5mg/day for ≥1 month)
             and/or synthetic sDMARDs (methotrexate at a dose of at least 10mg/day for ≥ 3 months)
             without response to treatment or with incomplete response to treatment

          -  Women of childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test at screening, V3, V4, V5
             and V6 and that agree to follow highly effective birth control recommendations during
             the study and until 1 month after the end of the treatment. Birth control methods that
             are considered as highly effective are either: combined (estrogen and progestogen
             containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,
             progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,
             intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral
             tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence.

        In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruations,
        confirmation of absence of pregnancy is strongly recommended. This recommendation also
        applies to women of child bearing potential with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycles.

        As regards the duration of contraception after the study, taking into account the median
        half-life of Tadekinig alfa of almost 40h, 5 half-lives represent duration of 200 hours. In
        order to be on the safe side, a post-study contraception duration of - Patients can
        maintain treatment with stable doses of Non-Steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs),
        Prednisone (stable dose of Prednisone of at least 5mg/day), and sDMARDs during Tadekinig
        alfa treatment (methotrexate at a dose of at least 10mg/week). Specifically baseline levels
        of prednisone treatment can be maintained or tapered (due to patient improvement), any
        requirement for prednisone increase during treatment will be considered a treatment
        failure.

             adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, tocilizumab, abatacept and 8 weeks for
             infliximab. Previous rituximab administration will require 6 months of washout and
             normal B-cell counts and previous treatment with canakinumab will require 6 months of
             washout.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a first episode of AoSD with less than one month of therapy with
             Prednisone or sDMARDs

          -  Patients suffering from inherited immunodefinciency diseases

          -  Patients suffering from immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including RA, SLE, etc.
             or spondylarthropathies, or inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  Patients with white blood cell counts below 2'500 cells/mm3

          -  Concomitantly treated with biologicals

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use highly effective birth
             control methods (see definition in Inclusion criteria above) up to 1 month after the
