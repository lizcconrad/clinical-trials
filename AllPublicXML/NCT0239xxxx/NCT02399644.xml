  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only to a limited extent has been compared the effectiveness of physical exercise and
      psychological interventions in subjects with chronic pain. Knowledge about this is necessary
      in order to compose optimal multimodal rehabilitation programs at different health care
      levels. Moreover, assuming that both types of interventions have effects, these effects may
      necessarily not concern the same outcome variables. Therefore it may be important to
      understand to what extent the effects overlap and the extent to which the effects are
      isolated to an intervention.

      The overall strategic purpose of the present study is to develop effective multimodal
      rehabilitation programs. In this study the effectiveness of following three interventions are
      compared.

        -  Group-based rehabilitation according to a concept based on an Acceptance and Commitment
           Training -Stress Management Intervention (ACT-SMI)

        -  Group-based rehabilitation compromised of physical exercise (Exercise).

        -  Group-based discussion concerning pain and its consequences (i.e., the control group,
           CON) The effectiveness is investigated with respect to long-term effects on pain and its
           consequences, including perceived health and return to work / sick leave.

      The overall hypothesis is that the former intervention means better long-term results because
      it clearly helps the individual to process the psychological aspects of itself likely to have
      long lasting effects.

    <description>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a version of Cognitive behavioral Therapy that focuses on acceptance and mindfulness. The aim is to prevent avoidance and control of negative private events such as anxiety or pain. The treatment consists of 7 weekly group sessions, 2 hours a week. The participants are given homework between sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants are going to participate in a training programme including aerobic exercise as well as endurance and strength training for the neck, shoulders, low back, core and leg muscles. The training is group-based and supervised by a physiotherapist two times a week, one hour a time for eight weeks. Home exercises twice a week are also a part of the intervention. It is possible to individually adjust movements and intensity to the participants' capacity if needed.</description>
