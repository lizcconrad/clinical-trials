  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is an initiative to bring physicians, nurses, community pharmacists and patients
      together in collaborative planning in the management of diabetes, which aligns with the
      collaborative, team based aspects of family medicine as a community based discipline. Alberta
      funds both physicians and community pharmacists to complete a comprehensive assessment and
      plan for patients with qualifying medical conditions. Our research hypothesis is that a
      collaborative approach between healthcare providers involved in delivering care will improve
      individual patient outcomes with the primary outcome being improved glycemic control. Health
      care utilization and medication adherence will also be assessed. This project will compare
      the results of comprehensive annual health care plans implemented over a period of twelve
      months with or without involvement from community pharmacists. It is hypothesized that
      involvement of community pharmacists and their collaboration with physicians will lead to
      improved outcomes.

      Research question: Does involvement of a community pharmacist in formulating and following a
      complex care plan for diabetic patients in conjunction with the patient's clinical team
      (physician and chronic disease management nurse) improve outcomes including glycemic control,
      health care utilization and medication adherence.

      Hypothesis: Collaborative complex care planning for diabetic patients with the primary care
      physician, chronic disease management nurse and community pharmacist leads to improvement in
      patient health outcomes, decreases hospital visits and visits to family physician and
      emergency room and improves medication adherence.

      Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to serve as a pilot in exploring if collaborative
      care provided by physicians, chronic disease nurse and community pharmacists in formulating
      and following complex care plans leads to better clinical outcomes when compared to care
      plans that are formulated and followed in isolation by the physician and chronic disease
      nurse. This study would be the basis for a future in depth project comparing outcomes of care
      plans completed in isolation by the pharmacists or physicians with those created in a
      collaborative environment. Our long-term objectives are improvement in patient outcomes,
      reduction in health care expenditure as well as preventing duplication and potential
      discordance of comprehensive care plans.

      Methodology

      Patients and study design: This is a single centre prospective case control pilot study.

      A cohort of 25 eligible diabetic patients at the South Health Campus Family Medicine Teaching
      Clinic (an outpatient academic family medicine clinic in Calgary, Alberta) will be studied
      and compared against a group of 25 control diabetic patients. The intervention would be
      involvement of patient's community pharmacist with their clinical team in formulating the
      complex care plan and following up with the patient on a monthly basis. The control is a set
      of patients who have complex care plans completed by their clinical team with no coordination
      with the pharmacist.

    <description>Patients would have a complex care plan completed by their clinical team, which will involve chronic disease management nurse and the family physician. This complex care plan would also involve discussion with the patient's community pharmacist who would follow-up with the patient monthly and send a report to the patient's physician. Patients would also continue to receive routine care at the clinic.
The monthly follow-ups with the community pharmacist would involve review of the goals of complex care plan and monitoring clinical targets, medication review and discussing adherence as well as patient education. This follow-up can be completed in person or by telephone. The pharmacist would then send a monthly report to patient's family physician.</description>
