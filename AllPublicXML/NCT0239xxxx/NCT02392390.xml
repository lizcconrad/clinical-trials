  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to estimate the change in the relative numbers of
      commensal or low virulence potential bacteria before and after one session TDP.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To estimate changes in several microbiological parameters over three time periods
           (before treatment, after applying the Metvixia® and after irradiation during a single
           TDP session).

        -  Describe the evolution of the size and appearance of the wound 7d after the start of
           treatment

        -  Describe the potential adverse events associated with a TDP session

    <description>Metvixia cream is applied to the lesion (about 1mm thickness) and the treated zone is covered with an opaque dression for 3 hours. Any residual cream is removed an and the lesion immediately rinsed with saline solution when uncovering. One session (8 minutes) of phototherapy is then performed using an Altilite lamp in accordance with HAS (haute authorité de santé) recommendations.</description>
