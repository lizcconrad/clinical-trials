  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of L-Arginine to the usual regimen in the treatment of
      schizophrenia in adults. As a requisite of crossover design, half of the participants started
      with L-Arginine and the other half with placebo and switched over after a three weeks use and
      one week of a washout period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      L-arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide (NO), a neuromodulator of dopamine,
      gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and glutamate systems. Nitric oxide donors which increase NO
      levels at the cellular level could improve N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction.
      Using L-arginine could bypass the blocked NMDA receptors and improve the therapeutic efficacy
      by reversing the dysfunction.

      The investigators proposed that using L-Arginine, a dietary supplement in most cultures,
      might constitute a safe option as an add-on treatment which may display beneficial effects on
      positive, negative, cognitive and affective symptoms associated with schizophrenia.
