  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non invasive methods are the only available methods to stage liver fibrosis during pregnancy.
      The safety of elastometry - ultrasound based - is obvious, as medical supervision of
      pregnancy is based on ultrasonography, both methods using same wavelengths. Therefore, this
      method is sometimes used in pregnant women with recent diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis
      infection, whereas its validity in pregnant women has never been studied. This lack of data
      justifies our study.
