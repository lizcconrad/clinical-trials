  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in
      the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), inhibiting
      tyrosine kinase activation. It has been approved to treat squamous cell carcinoma of head and
      neck (SCCHN), glioma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in different countries. Currently, the
      registered clinical trials of Nimotuzumab combined with chemotherapy in advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer and glioma have been approved and are
      ongoing all over the investigators' country. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Nimotuzumab combined with Irinotecan in patients with
      solid tumors.

      This is a single-centered, non-randomized and open-labeled Clinical Pharmacokinetics Study of
      Nimotuzumab in patients with solid tumors. The test includes 3 dose groups, namely Single
      dose group, Multiple single-week dose group and Multiple bi week dose group, to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of Nimotuzumab combined with Irinotecan in patients with
      solid tumors.
