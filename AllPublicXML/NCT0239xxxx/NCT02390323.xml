  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate a monitor that will facilitate ascertainment of an
      effective sympathetic blockade following Lumbar Sympathetic blocks. Utilization of a monitor
      with a rapid response and easy clinical applicability which can demonstrate effective
      sympathetic block would increase efficiency within the procedure suite and also serve to
      function as an objective endpoint for the evaluation of sympathetic blockade in future
      research.In current clinical practice, the most commonly used monitoring methods are clinical
      observations of sympathetic blockade, skin temperature monitoring, pulse pressure monitoring
      and any combination of these monitoring methods. The skin temperature and pulse pressure may
      increase after sympathetic block. However, changes in the skin temperature and pulse pressure
      often demonstrate an unpredictable or delayed response. Confounding variables, such as
      ambient temperature, coexisting vascular disease, use of other vasoactive medications may
      contribute to inconsistencies in the temperature or pulse pressure responses.

      Normal sympathetic activity stimulates muscarinic receptors in the periphery that
      subsequently stimulate the sweat glands to secrete and fill with sweat containing sodium and
      other electrolytes. The electrolytes present in the sweat increase the electrical conductance
      while decreasing the electrical resistance at the skin level.

      The real-time changes in skin conductance indices can be monitored at the skin level, by use
      of non-invasive electrodes attached to the skin (similar to EKG electrodes). A computer
      program analyzes the data and produces a real-time graphic and numeric data demonstrating the
      skin conductance response. The initiation of successful sympathetic blockade can cause rapid
      cessation of the skin sympathetic activity that leads to a decrease in skin conductance
      within seconds.

    <description>A lumbar sympathetic block is an injection in the middle of the lower back, toward the left or right side. The &quot;lumbar sympathetic nerves&quot; are a small bundle of nerves that carries &quot;sympathetic&quot; nerve signals from the lower extremities. In some instances, certain injuries to the lower extremities can cause a burning, unusual pain called complex regional pain syndrome or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Injecting a small amount of local anesthetic on the lumbar sympathetic nerves can identify whether or not this pain is carried by the sympathetic nervous system.</description>
