    <textblock>
      Major hepatectomies are generally selected for tumors involving the hepatic vein (HV) at the
      caval confluence (CC). As alternative, HV reconstruction has been proposed. The present study
      aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a HV-sparing policy guided by intraoperative
      ultrasonography (IOUS) in a cohort of patients having at least one colorectal liver
      metastasis (CLM) in contact with a HV at CC. HV section can be avoided in the large majority
      of cases thanking to CLMs detachment or to HV partial resection or reconstruction: this
      policy seems feasible, safe, reduces the need of major hepatectomies, and oncologically
      provides an adequate local control.
