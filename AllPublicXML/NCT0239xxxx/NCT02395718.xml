  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate differences in health outcomes among elderly patients (age ≥ 75 years) treated in
      a Quick Diagnostic Unit (QDU) compared to the Department of Internal Medicine (DIM). A QDU is
      a medical Short Stay Unit (SSU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Danish emergency care system is undergoing major changes; Emergency Departments (ED) are
      now centralised at fewer hospitals, thus the ED now serve as the single point of entry for
      all acute patients. Another initiative, has been the establishment of a Quick Diagnostic Unit
      (QDU) as a subunit in the ED. The QDU is a ward for fast track diagnostics and treatment of
      stable medical patients that is believed to optimise in-hospital care by quicker diagnosis
      and shorter hospitalisations, and minimise time for patients to return to their habitual
      health status. However, little evidence exists on the putative benefits for elderly patients
      treated in a QDU setting.

      In this study, we will examine the benefits and drawbacks of treatment of elderly medical
      patients (≥75 years) in an acute treatment system with the possibility of fast-track
      admission and treatment, rather than treatment in the traditional medical system. We will
      randomise patients to treatment in either a fast track ward/short stay unit, the QDU, or to
      standard treatment at the Dept. of Internal Medicine (DIM).

      We hypothesise that treatment in a QDU compared to DIM offers optimised care through
      immediate access to clinical staff and rapid diagnostic facilities, treatment and quicker
      rehabilitation.

    <description>Patients will undergo a fast track model for diagnostics and treatment with a goal of accomplishing a short-term hospitalisation. Patients will have immediate access to all diagnostic tests and treatments that will be carried out all day (24 hours) on demand from the responsible physician. The QDU is both organisationally and physically integrated in the ED. Point of care ultrasonography can be performed round the clock. Additionally the Department of Radiology provides the QDU with more advanced diagnostic procedures such as e.g. CT scans or MRI scans on a fast track basis. There is access to additional specialist evaluations from the ED staff or from various in house specialists, when needed. Simultaneously to the medical treatment, physical therapists and occupational therapists train and optimise patients' level of functioning, including prevention of loss of function.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control group are treated as conventionally at one of seven wards at the DIM. After initial admission including initial diagnostics and treatment have been carried out in the ED, patients are transferred to the DIM. Usually patients are seen primarily by the on-call physician for evaluation of acute symptoms. The following day, a Chief physician will work out a plan for further diagnostics and treatment. Treatment by physiotherapists and occupational therapists is available on request from a physician. Analyses of blood samples are performed at the central laboratory and radiological procedures at the Department of Radiology.</description>
