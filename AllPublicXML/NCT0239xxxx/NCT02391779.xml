  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current recommendations today suggest that use of therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as
      supplementation with specific dietary components and moderate exercise, are appropriate
      interventions for individuals with borderline high blood pressure. Dietary intervention with
      natural products, such as flaxseed, is associated with decreased prevalence of cardiovascular
      disease (Adolphe 2010). Lignans are the active compounds in flaxseed believed to mediate the
      cardiovascular health benefits following flaxseed consumption (Peterson 2010). Clinical
      trials indicate benefit of Flax Lignan Enriched Complex (FLC) (BeneFlax® from Archer Daniels
      Midland, a natural product derived from flaxseed composed of 34-38% lignan) for reducing
      blood cholesterol and glucose (Pan 2007; Zhang 2008) and blood pressure (Cornish 2009).
      Furthermore, a recent study in atherosclerosis patients showed significant clinical benefit
      of flaxseed meal for reducing blood pressure (Rodriguez-Leyva 2013). As a therapeutic
      lifestyle change that could prevent a need to introduce drug therapy in elderly patients, the
      effectiveness of FLC supplementation alone or in combination with moderate exercise merits
      investigation.

             epilepsy and genitourinary disorder.

          -  Migraine with aura within the last year (as this is a risk factor for stroke).

          -  Significant immune-compromise.

          -  Current use of hormone replacement therapy (except thyroid).

          -  Current use of flax seed supplement

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial with an investigational agent within one
             month prior to randomization.
