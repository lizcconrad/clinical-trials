      This randomized clinical trial is designed to evaluate the effect of selected antioxidant
      vitamins and minerals supplement B-Carotene (6 mg) + Vit.C (200 mg) + Vit.E (200 mg) + Vit.
      Nicotinamide (20 mg) + Selenium (200 mic.)+ Zinc oxide (8 mg) + Copper oxide (1mg)
      +Mangeneschloride (1.8 mg) in patients with mild Graves' orbitopathy according to EUGOGO
      classification.

      1. To determine total eye score (NOSPECS severity score) before and after treatment in each
           of the three arms of the study and make a before - after as well as an inter-arm
           comparison.

        2. To determine Score of thyroid eye disease Quality of life questionnaire (TED-QOL) before
           and after treatment in each of the three arms of the study and make a before - after as
           well as an inter-arm comparison.

        3. To determine clinical activity score (CAS Score) before and after treatment in each of
           the three arms of the study and make a before - after as well as an inter-arm
           comparison.

        4. To determine Serum thyroid auto-antibodies (Anti thyroid peroxidase (TPO),
           Anti-thyrogluboline) and Thyroid function test (Free T4, T3, and TSH) level before and
           after treatment in each of the three arms of the study and make a before - after as well
           as an inter-arm comparison.

        5. To determine the rate of side effects in each arm and make a comparison.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Mild TED of less than 18 months duration (as recorded by the patient).

          2. No active state (Clinical activity score of less than 3).

          3. No previous specific therapy for TED, except for local measures (artificial tear, head
             elevation, low salt diet).

          4. Euthyroidism as a result of remission after a course of antithyroid drug (ATD)
             therapy, or euthyroidism for at least 2 months since commencing ATD or after
             thyroidectomy, or euthyroidism for at least 6 months after radioiodine therapy.
             Hypothyroid patients after thyroidectomy or radioiodine were replaced with
             levothyroxine. Euthyroidism was defined as normal serum free thyroxine, total or free
             triiodothyronine concentrations, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels below 4 mU/Liter
             Patients were kept euthyroid for the whole duration of the study.

          5. Age 18-70 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. TED severity of more than mild TED.

          2. Pregnancy

          3. Drug and/or alcohol abuse

          4. Severe concomitant illness

          5. Inability to comply with the study protocol

          6. No informed consent

          7. Use of selenium- or vitamin/minerals-containing preparations in the last 3 months.

          8. Developing more severe TED in the course of the trial so that requires steroid
             treatment.
