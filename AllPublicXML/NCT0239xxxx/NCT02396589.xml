  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most serious, disabling health conditions in the United States. Patients
      who undergo rehabilitation treatment for stroke have a high rate of disability. Poor outcomes
      for many persons with stroke may be low because of incomplete treatment. The investigators
      will conduct a randomized controlled trial and a process evaluation to examine the
      feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of an enhanced rehabilitation transition
      program, Community Participation Transition after Stroke (COMPASS), designed to bridge
      inpatient rehabilitation and the home to support the performance of everyday activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose an enhanced rehabilitation transition program: Community Participation Transition
      after Stroke (COMPASS) is a compensatory intervention consisting of one pre-discharge and
      five post-discharge home visits by an occupational therapist to supplement usual care. This
      intervention is focused on resolving barriers to independence in daily activities and
      participation using environmental support and active practice of daily activities in an
      individual's real home (versus an idealized clinical setting). This is a new combination of
      evidence-based compensatory treatments delivered in a novel treatment setting (transition to
      home). Our long-term goal is the development of an effective intervention for a transition
      home designed to prevent excess disability for people living with stroke that could have an
      immediate effect and high public health significance.16

      We will recruit 40 patients currently undergoing inpatient rehabilitation (IR) for ischemic
      stroke from longitudinal studies of stroke at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM)
      and randomize them to receive six additional sessions of the enhanced rehabilitation
      transition program or attention control. Exploratory participation outcomes will be assessed
      by blinded evaluators at baseline, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after stroke.

      We will test the central hypothesis that COMPASS will be acceptable, feasible, and superior
      to attention control on measures of participation and daily activity performance at 6 months
      after stroke.
