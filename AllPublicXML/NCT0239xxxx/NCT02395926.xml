  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choline alfoscerate(L-alfa glycerylphosphorylcholine) is a natural compound found in the
      brain and breast. Choline alfoscerate contains 40.8% of choline and has a produrig structure
      and separated by a precursor of choline and nerve cell membrane precursor of acetylcholine
      glycerophosphate. Choline alfoscerate Colin normalization of nerve pathways, nerve cell
      membrane play and acetylcholine receptor function secondary symptoms caused by
      cerebrovascular deficiency and indirectly through activation of metabolism, has a
      degenerative effect on the brain organic mental syndrome.

      Currently marketed oral choline alfoscerate received a geriatric cognitive impairment,
      secondary symptoms and degeneration, or soft capsule is authorized to prescription drugs for
      degenerative brain organic mental syndrome caused by cerebrovascular deficiency. Gliatilin
      soft capsules containing 400 mg per 1 capsule 2-3 times one days're supposed to take when
      considering optimal convenience and efficiency of the drug in patients with the development
      of sustained release formulations that can be maintained for a long period of time, a certain
      concentration is required. Accordingly, the modern drug by reducing the frequency of
      administration a day circuit is to develop a sustained release formulation of choline
      alfoscerate HT-003 600 mg medication compliance for the purpose of raising. 2 tablets at a
      time (600 mg x 2) can be taken one day to 1200 mg is required by taking.

      Therefore, for the development of sustained release formulation, the test in healthy adult
      male volunteers targets choline alfoscerate soft capsule formulation of 400mg 3 times per 1
      day and sustained-release tablet 600mg 2time per 1 day, pharmacokinetic properties and safety
      of a single dose should be evaluated when compared.
