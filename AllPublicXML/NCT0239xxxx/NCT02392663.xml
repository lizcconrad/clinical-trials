  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze whether the hypertonic saline nebulization enhances sputum
      clearance effects, reduces the impact on cough severity and their level of safety and
      tolerability in a population with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE). In addition,
      this trial aims to compare these health outcomes among 3 nebulized solutions: hypertonic
      saline (7%); hyaluronic acid + hypertonic saline (7%); isotonic saline (0,9%).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Each nebulized
      solution [hypertonic saline (7%); hyaluronic acid + hypertonic saline (7%); isotonic saline
      (0,9%)] will be administrated during 4 days. After each inhalation, all patients will carry
      out a bronchial drainage session (autogenic drainage technique). All patients recruited will
      perform the three arms of intervention. In this way, each patient will be able to act as
      his/her own control.

      A 7 days washout period will be required among the different solutions to avoid carryover
      effects.

      During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remained unchanged.
