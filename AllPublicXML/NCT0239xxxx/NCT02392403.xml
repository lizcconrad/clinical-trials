      The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical benefit for patients implanted with the
      Nucleus® CI532 cochlear implant and to demonstrate the atraumatic nature of the electrode
      design.

      Nucleus® CI532 has a pre-curved, perimodiolar array, the EA32, which is introduced into the
      cochlea through a straightening sheath.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eighteen years of age or older at the time of implantation

          -  Conventional candidate for cochlear implantation with a perimodiolar electrode array
             according to local criteria (excepting the exclusion criteria that follow)

          -  Native speaker in the local language used to assess clinical performance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of hearing loss prior to 5 years of age

          -  Prior cochlear implantation; i.e. having a cochlear implant in the contralateral ear,
             or previously implanted in either ear

          -  Medical or psychological conditions that contraindicate undergoing general anaesthesia
             or surgery

          -  Ossification, malformation or any other cochlear anomaly, such as common cavity, that
             might prevent complete insertion of the electrode array, as confirmed by medical
             examination

          -  Hearing impairment due to lesion or neuropathy of the acoustic nerve, VIII nerve or
             central auditory pathway

          -  Active middle-ear infection

          -  Tympanic membrane perforation

          -  Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject, regarding the possible benefits,
             risks, and limitations that are inherent to the surgical procedure(s) and prosthetic
             devices

          -  Unwillingness or inability of the candidate to comply with all investigational
             requirements such as undergoing a post-operative digital volume tomography/ConeBeam
             scan

          -  Patients with existing Cerebral Spinal Fluid shunts or drains, existing perilymph
             fistula, skull fracture or Cerebral Spinal Fluid leak

          -  Patients with recurrent episodes of bacterial meningitis

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Known allergies to components of the implant

          -  Wearing other active implants with known interference with cochlear implants
