      The purpose of this study is to determine whether autologous T cells bearing chimeric antigen
      receptor that can specifically recognize glypican-3 (GPC3) is safe and effective for patients
      with relapsed or refractory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with HCC must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or
             equal to age 70, and must have a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

          2. GPC3 is expressed in HCC tissues by IHC.

          3. Non-diffuse HCC with the presence of extrahepatic metastasis or portal vein vascular
             invasion.

          4. The liver cirrhosis status should be Child-Pugh A or B with a score equal to 7.

          5. ECOG physical status score is equal to 0-1 or KPS score is higher than 80.

          6. Enough venous access for apheresis or venous sampling and no contraindications to
             other blood cell separation

          7. WBC≥2500/ml，PLT≥60×10^9/L，Hb≥9.0g/dL，LY≥0.7×10^9/L，LY%≥15%，Alb≥2.8g/dL， serum lipase
             and amylase＜1.5 ULN，serum creatinine≤2.5mg/dL，ALT and AST≤5 ULN，serum total
             bilirubin≤3.0mg/dL，PT:INR＜1.7 or PT beyond the normal value less than 4s.

        All laboratory test results should be in the stable range, and no persistent support
        treatment is given.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The transduction efficiency of the T cells is less than 30% or the amplification of
             the T cells via αCD3/CD28 stimulation is less than 5 times.

          2. Pregnant or lactating women (the safety of the experimental treatment to the unborn
             baby is unknown; The pregnancy status of the female participants should be negative
             when her serum or urine is evaluated 48 hrs before infusion).

          3. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other major medical illnesses
             including those of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease.

          4. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          5. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity to any of the agents including
             cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or aldesleukin.

          7. Steroid is now systemically used.

          8. Prior treatment with any other gene therapeutics.

          9. the past or present existence of hepatic encephalopathy

         10. The existence of unstable or active ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding

         11. Patients with a history of organ transplantation or are waiting for organ
             transplantation.

         12. serum sodium＜125mmol/L

         13. baseline serum K＜3.5mmol/L（The patients can be included when the serum K≧3.5mmol/L
             after supplementation）

         14. patients need anticoagulant therapy (such as warfarin or heparin)

         15. patients need long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at a dose &gt; 300mg/d; clopidogrel
             at a dose &gt; 75mg/d)

         16. Patients treated by radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior the first apheresis.

         17. Patients using fludarabine or cladribine chemotherapy within two years
