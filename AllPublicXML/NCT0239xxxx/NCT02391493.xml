  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For bilingual and multilingual patients, brain activation and Electric Stimulation Mapping
      studies have shown that different languages may be localized, at least partially, in distinct
      microanatomical systems located within the same gross anatomical areas.

      The present investigation involves both types of healthy bilinguals with carefully controlled
      proficiency levels, as well as bilingual patients suffering from low-grade glioma.

      Functional magnetic resonance imaging data will be collected while the participants perform a
      picture naming task in blocked conditions for both languages (either English or French) or in
      switch condition (English and French). A stimulation mapping study will be conducted in the
      patients during awake surgery with the same tasks.

    <description>Stimuli will be presented in 3 language conditions, French, English and &quot;switch&quot; in which the participant alternates between English and French every trial. A block design will be used, with 7 line drawings per language condition. Four 9-minute runs will be performed, there being 2 action runs and 2 object runs. In each run, there are 6 blocks of each language condition, presented in a fixed random order. No drawings are repeated. Each stimulus is preceded either by an English or a French prompt word (&quot;to&quot; or &quot;faire&quot; for actions and, &quot;say&quot; or &quot;dire&quot; for objects) for 450 msec; stimuli are presented for 1.5 seconds and followed by a blank screen for 1 second. Language blocks are separated by a variable duration (from 8 to 10 seconds).</description>
