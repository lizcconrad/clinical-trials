  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study i sto evaluate the impact of prophylactic cranial
      irradiation (PCI) with hippocampal avoidance in the neurocognitive function and quality of
      life of small cell lung cancer patients.

      In addition, the trial assesses the potential changes in hippocampal volumetry due to cranial
      irradiation using magnetic resonance imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has become a standard of care for selected patients
      with limited and extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have shown benefit after
      chemotherapy with or without thoracic radiotherapy.

      Because hippocampal involvement by metastatic disease is rare, and because preclinical and
      clinical evidence suggests that radiation dose received by the hippocampus during whole brain
      radiotherapy may play a role in radiation-induced neurocognitive decline, sparing of the
      hippocampus during the administration of PCI should result in lower rates of memory loss.

      Previous studies have demonstrated the dosimetric capabilities of intensity modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) to conformably avoid the hippocampus without detriment to the
      radiation dose the remaining brain receives.

      The main objective of this trial is compare neurocognitive functioning following hippocampal
      avoidance PCI to standard PCI treatment measured by Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test
      (FCSRT). The FCSRT measures verbal learning and memory. The FCSRT emphasizes encoding
      specificity during learning and recall. One of the secondary objectives of this trial is to
      test the hypothesis that the lowered neurocognitive function of the patients is due to a
      substantial reduction in hippocampal volume in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Others
      objectives are to evaluate quality of life (QoL) and the rate of metastases in the
      hippocampus.
