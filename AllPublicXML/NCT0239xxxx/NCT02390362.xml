  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab will be more effective than
      MMF in maintaining remission in children with frequent relapsing or steroid dependent
      nephrotic syndrome who have had one relapse while receiving MMF.

      We will conduct a randomized study comparing two Rituximab infusions and continued MMF
      treatment. We plan to enroll 64 to have a comparater group of 58 (29 in each arm).

    <textblock>
      After screening, and eligibility criteria have been met, children with steroid dependent and
      frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome (SDNS and FRNS) will be enrolled into a 53 week study.
      The study is comprised of 3 sections; screening, treatment, and followup.

      Screening will be &lt;4 weeks from Day 1/week 1. Treatment is Day 1/Week 1 and Day 15/Week 3.
      Follow-Up is Week 7, Week 13, Week 19, Week 27 and Week 53. Participants will be randomized
      by the study pharmacy between screening and treatment Day1. If participant is randomized to
      Rituximab, then Treatment Day 15 will be based on tolerance of Rituximab infusion.

      Safety assessments will occur at every visit beginning with Day 1.

        not related to a chronic underlying disease. Rescreening may only occur once and may not
        occur within 2 weeks of the initial screen failure.

        If a patient has a clinically significant laboratory abnormality, the PI will be asked to
        define a follow-up plan (timing of repeating the laboratory test and/or additional
        work-up).
