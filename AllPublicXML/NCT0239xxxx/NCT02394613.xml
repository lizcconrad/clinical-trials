  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, caused by retinal nerve cell
      (RGC) death. This is currently identified only after significant vision loss has already
      occurred with an early event in, and a potential marker of, this process being RGC
      &quot;apoptosis&quot; (a form of cell death).

      This study aims to investigate the tolerability and safety of ANX776, as part of the new
      Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells (DARC) technique. This has been developed by the
      laboratory of DARC IP holder and grant applicant: Prof. M. Francesca Cordeiro. A secondary
      aim is to initially establish the ability of DARC to identify RGC apoptosis in the diagnosis
      of glaucoma in healthy and progressive glaucoma/glaucoma-suspect/ocular hypertensive
      patients. As a positive control for this secondary aim of this study, patients with
      Non-arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) will be recruited.

      During the study, each patient will undergo several ophthalmological examinations, imaging of
      the back of the eye using established clinical devices, and blood sampling for studying the
      safety and toxicology profile of ANX776.

      The understanding of the safety profile of ANX776 is crucial for the use of DARC in patients,
      and its application as a potentially powerful new clinical tool with which to identify
      patients with early glaucoma before their vision is lost. If successful, it opens the door to
      directly observing effects of glaucoma treatments, including the assessment of new,
      breakthrough therapies.
