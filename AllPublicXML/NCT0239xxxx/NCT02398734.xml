      SONOBIRDIE Trial is a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled study designed for a
      demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of sonolysis (continual transcranial Doppler
      monitoring) in reduction of risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), brain
      infarctions and cognitive decline using a 2-MHz diagnostic probe with a maximal diagnostic
      energy on the reduction of risk of brain infarctions by the activation of endogenous
      fibrinolytic system during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with ≥ 70% symptomatic or
      asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis.

      The sample size is based on an expected 2.5% reduction of stroke or TIA during the 30-day
      postoperative period in the sonolysis group (estimated prevalence, 1.5 %) compared to the
      control group (estimated prevalence, 4 %). Pre-study calculations showed that a minimum of
      704 patients in each group is needed to reach a significant difference with an alpha value of
      0.05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.8 assuming that 10 % would be lost to follow-up or
      refuse to participate in the study.

      Consecutive patients will be assigned to the sonolysis or control group by a
      computer-generated 1:1 randomization. In patients randomized into sonolysis group, middle
      cerebral artery segment in a depth of 55 mm will be continuously monitored during
      intervention using a diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler probe with a maximal diagnostic
      energy.

      In patients randomized into control group, the transcranial Doppler probe will be fixed in a
      required position using a special helmet as in sonolysis group patients, but middle cerebral
      artery segment in a depth of 55 mm will be only localized using a diagnostic 2-MHz
      transcranial Doppler probe with a maximal diagnostic energy and the TCD monitoring will be
      stopped afterwards.

      Confirmation of the investigators hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate
      endogenous fibrinolytic system during CEA with consecutive reduction of stroke or TIA, and
      the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety of CEA in
      patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. The investigators can presume that up to 50%
      of patients indicated for CEA can be treated using these methods in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke has been the third most common cause of death in the majority of the developed
      countries for many years. Internal carotid (ICA) stenosis is one of the most common
      etiological factors of ischemic stroke (IS), causing 10 - 35 % of strokes. Stroke risk
      increases with the increased severity of ICA stenosis and this risk is higher in symptomatic
      stenoses than in asymptomatic ones. Results of the NASCET, ECST and ACAS studies showed that
      carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was a beneficial therapy for patients with a symptomatic ICA
      stenosis &gt; 50 % and &gt; 70 %, resp., and for patients with an asymptomatic ICA stenosis &gt; 60 %
      and &gt; 85 %, resp. Surgical risk of CEA varied between 2 and 15 %. However, even clinically
      silent microembolism can cause microinfarctions presenting with postoperative cognitive
      deficit.

      Since the 1970s, in vitro and in animal models studies demonstrated acceleration of thrombus
      dissolution using ultrasound beam. Alexandrov et al. referred a higher number of early
      recanalizations in acute stroke patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion treated
      using systemic thrombolysis in combination with transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring.
      Between 2002 and 2005, three other studies demonstrated potential effect of diagnostic
      ultrasound on the acceleration of spontaneous or induced recanalization of intracranial
      arteries. There are 2 possible effects of ultrasound on thrombus - [1] mechanical destruction
      due to vibration of thrombus with acceleration of penetration of fibrinolytics into thrombus
      and [2] elevation of temperature and stimulation of endothelium with local activation of
      fibrinolytic system. The results of the grant project NR/9487-3/2007 showed that TCD
      monitoring had a significant effect on activation of fibrinolytic system in healthy
      volunteers.

      Transcranial Doppler monitoring during CEA is a common diagnostic method being used for the
      detection of microemboli and changes of blood flow in intracranial stenoses. Reduction of
      periprocedural complications of CEA with TCD monitoring was referred in some studies. This
      reduction of stroke risk should be due to sophisticated indication of shunt implementation,
      optimization of surgery and anesthesia according to the blood flow changes and detection of
      microemboli in MCA using a TCD monitoring. Another course of the reduction of
      microinfarctions is the local activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system due to the TCD
      monitoring (equal to sonothrombolysis in acute stroke studies). Recently published SONOBUSTER
      Trial showed that intraoperative sonolysis reduced both the incidence and the volume of new
      brain infarctions following CEA. These benefits were most evident for larger infarctions
      (volume ≥ 0.5 mL) and extended beyond the region directly exposed to ultrasonic waves (i.e.,
      the contralateral hemisphere). Effect on cognitive function decline was not significant in
      this study due to a low number of patients.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES The objective of the randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study is to
      demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of sonolysis (continual TCD monitoring) using a
      2-MHz diagnostic probe with a maximal diagnostic energy on the reduction of stroke, transient
      ischemic attack (TIA) and brain infarction by the activation of endogenous fibrinolytic
      system during CEA in patients with ≥ 70% symptomatic or asymptomatic stenosis of the ICA.

      The substudy aims to compare the risk of brain infarction detected using magnetic resonance
      between sonolysis and control group.

      STUDY DESIGN Overview SONOBIRDIE Trial is a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled study
      designed for a demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of sonolysis (continual TCD
      monitoring) in reduction of risk of stroke or TIA, brain infarctions and cognitive decline by
      the sonolysis during CEA in patients with ≥ 70% ICA stenosis.

      Expected sample size The sample size is based on an expected 2.5% absolute risk reduction of
      stroke or TIA during the 30-day postoperative period in the sonolysis group (estimated
      prevalence, 1.5 %) compared to the control group (estimated prevalence, 4 %). Pre-study
      calculations showed that a minimum of 704 patients in each group is needed to reach a
      significant difference with an alpha value of 0.05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.8
      assuming that 10 % would be lost to follow-up or refuse to participate in the study
      (estimated 39 end-points).

      The sample size for substudy is based on an expected 15% reduction of new ischemic lesions on
      diffusion weighted imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) in the sonolysis group (estimated prevalence, 10 %)
      compared to the control group (estimated prevalence, 25 %). Pre-study calculations showed
      that a minimum of 124 patients in each group was needed to reach a significant difference
      with an alpha value of 0.05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.8 assuming that 10 % would be
      lost to follow-up or refuse to participate in the study.

      Test device The transcranial Doppler systems (e.g. DWL Multi-Dop T1, DWL, Sipplingen,
      Germany) with a diagnostic 2-MHz probe will be used for sonolysis (non-diagnostic TCD Doppler
      monitoring).

      Sonolysis In patients randomized into sonolysis group, MCA segment in a depth of 55 mm will
      be continuously monitored during intervention using a diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler
      probe with a maximal diagnostic energy (TIC~1.3), sample volume 10 mm.

      Sham procedure In patients randomized into control group, the TCD probe will be fixed in a
      required position using a special helmet as in sonolysis group patients, but MCA segment in a
      depth of 55 mm will be only localized using a diagnostic 2-MHz transcranial Doppler probe
      with a maximal diagnostic energy and the TCD monitoring will be stopped afterwards.

      Carotid endarterectomy Surgery will be performed in a general or a local anesthesia (decision
      will be left to the discretion of the operating team) using a cut in front angle of the
      sternomastoid muscle. Common carotid artery (CCA) and later ICA and external carotid artery
      (ECA) will be cut free. Common carotid artery, ICA and ECA will be temporarily closed. Using
      a longitudinal cut of CCA and ICA, atherosclerotic plaque will be visualized. Plaque will be
      withdrawn under the microscopic control and later a suture of arteriotomy will be performed
      using a monophil non-absorbent fibre 6/0. Just before the end of surgery, haemostatic process
      will be controlled and drainage will be done. Surgery will be completed by suture of subcutis
      and cutis. Unfractioned heparin (100 IU/kg bodyweight) will be administered in all patients
      just before the arteriotomy. In the case of the insufficient collateral flow into MCA after
      clipping of the CCA and ICA, a temporal shunt will be used. Antiplatelet therapy (Aggrenox,
      clopidogrel 75 mg/day or acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day) will be used continuously in all
      patients. Surgeon will be blinded to sonolysis or sham procedure.

      Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic resonance imaging will be performed in patients enrolled
      to the substudy. Magnetic resonance imaging protocol consists of 4 sequences: 1. T2TSE; 2.
      DWI. Sequences 1 - 3 will be applied in the same level, they will have the same slice
      thickness and the same cut number. The slice thickness comprises its own cut thickness (5 mm)
      + distant factor (30 %). Standard number of slices will be 19. Standard slice level is
      considered to be a modified level of skull base due to the minimalization of distant
      artifacts. Diffusion weighted sequence shows a middle (average) diffusivity of every point of
      the examined brain tissue when b value is 500 and 1000. This sequence is applied in order to
      assess hemorrhage (T2*EPI) and to monitor sites of the reduced diffusion (DWI, b=500 and
      1000); 3. T2 star-weighted gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequence for detection of bleeding
      (including microbleeds); 4. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR).Presence of new
      infarctions will be evaluated separately in the whole brain, in the territory of the
      intervened ICA and in the territory of the contralateral ICA.

      New ischemic lesions in the brain are defined as hyperintense lesions on postintervention DWI
      sequences which were not present on the pretreatment MRI.

      The volume of new brain infarctions will be measured manually. Infarct volumes will be
      calculated as the total hyperintense area in single slices multiplied by an effective slice
      thickness [(actual slice thickness + distance factor)/interslice gap].

      Ischemic lesions in the brain will be evaluated by two blinded investigators. All
      disagreements will resolved by consensus. The third blinded investigator will be involved in
      a case of a persistent disagreement.

      Clinical examinations Standard physical and neurologic examinations will be performed before
      CEA, 24 hours, afte30 days and 1 year after CEA. Evaluation of the neurologic deficit will be
      performed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (see Appendix) and
      modified Rankin scale (see Appendix) before CEA, 24 hours, 30 days and 1 year after CEA.

      Cognitive tests Cognitive testing (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), Mini
      Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, Verbal Fluency Test) will be performed before,
      24 hours, 30 days and 1 year after CEA.

      All cognitive tests will be performed by a blinded investigator.

      Randomization Consecutive patients will be assigned to the sonolysis or control group by a
      computer-generated 1:1 randomization.

      Substudy:

      Patients with indication to CEA will be assigned to the sonolysis or control group by a
      computer-generated 1:1 randomization.

      ANALYSIS SETS

      Efficacy analyses will be performed primary for the intent-to-treat population. The secondary
      analysis will be performed also for per-protocol population. The intent-to-treat population
      will consist of all randomized subjects who signed informed consent. The per-protocol
      population will exclude all subjects in the intent-to-treat population who:

        1. Have not undergone CEA.

        2. Have not received sonolysis during carotid CEA for at least 40 minutes.

        3. Have not attended one of the last 3 visits - Visit 3 (24 hours after CEA), Visit 4 (30
           days after CEA) and Visit 5 (1 year after CEA) Safety analyses will be performed on all
           randomized subjects undergoing the carotid intervention.

      Substudy:

      Efficacy analyses will be performed for both the intent-to-treat population - subjects
      indicated for CEA, randomized and undergoing procedure and undergoing magnetic resonance
      imaging before and 24 hours after CEA.

      Safety analyses will be performed on all randomized subjects undergoing the carotid
      intervention.

      STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical tests will be performed at the Department of Biophysics,
      Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University, Olomouc.

      The normality of distribution of all proceeded data will be checked using the Shapiro-Wilk
      test. Data with a normal distribution will be reported as the mean ± standard deviation.
      Parameters not fitting a normal distribution will be presented as the mean, median and
      interquartile range.

      Categorical variables in the two arms will be compared by Fisher exact test. Continuous
      variables will be compared by the Student t-test for normally distributed values, or the
      Mann-Whitney U test.

      Spearman correlation coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient will be calculated
      for the evaluation of interobserver and intraobserver agreements of brain infarction volume
      measurement.

      Multiple logistic regression analyses will be used to determine the possible predictors of
      stroke or TIA, cognitive decline, or a new brain infarction.

      All tests will be carried out at an alpha level of significance of 0.05.
