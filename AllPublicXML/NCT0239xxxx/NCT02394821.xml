      For odor control malignant wounds (MW), use is 0.8% metronidazole solution - second
      recommendation scientific and clinical practice. But no this formulation available in Brazil
      , and its application to nursing steeps metronidazole tablets , diluted in saline and applied
      to the bed of (MW) . Thus , it is used off label for metronidazole ( tablets orally applied
      via &quot; topical &quot; - but it is not intact skin or mucosa ) , nursing and eventually manipulate
      the solution at bedside , and by law this power is pharmacist bedside and can not be taken .

      Family antiseptic chlorhexidine was developed with the purpose of use in infected wounds
      called polihexanide ( PHMB ) . In Brazil is now available for hospital and home care ( 0.2 %
      Aquasept ® ) use. Evidence reported positive results in controlling infection of chronic
      wounds such as pressure ulcers . Although not tested its efficacy in odor control. Thus the
      study aims to compare metronidazole solution 0.8 % versus 0.2 % PHMB in odor control , where
      , if the results are favorable to PHMB we have a treatment option in odor control with ready
      to use formulation and easy access . Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of metronidazole
      solution 0.8% and polihexanide solution (PHMB) in odor control in MW. Aims: Evaluate and
      compare the time needed for odor control (reduction in days), using metronidazole and PHMB in
      MW (primary endpoint); Evaluate and compare the perceptions of patients, nurses and
      researcher on the odor MW, using metronidazole and PHMB in the MW; Evaluate and compare the
      pain reported by patients during dressing changes, using metronidazole and PHMB in the MW;
      Evaluate and compare the quality of life of patients before and after the use of
      metronidazole and PHMB in MW. This is a randomized, double -blind study with patients
      diagnosed with cancer and patients with MW with odor clinical trial . The sample consisted of
      24 subjects divided into 2 groups (control - metronidazole group and experimental group -
      PHMB ) , recruited in one cancer hospital in the city of São Paulo (AC Camargo Cancer
      Center), which has as protocol description in odor control MW metronidazole . After
      acceptance by the subject and return the Statement of Informed Consent signed , randomization
      will be done .

      For blinding , 0.8 % metronidazole solution will be provided by a compounding pharmacy (after
      stability testing of tablet diluted - and then stipulated expiration date) , and PHMB be
      bought from the supplier , delivered to the same compounding pharmacy which stores the PHMB
      in identical bottles to metronidazole ( only the responsible researcher will know to which
      group the subject was randomized ) .

      The evaluation of the odor will be taken by 3 &quot; employees &quot; and the patient through 3 scales
      at zero , four, eight and twelve days ( or earlier if classified as &quot; odorless &quot; by 3
      reviewers and the patient ) . Two scales about painful sensations in exchange for healing ,
      one on quality of life will be applied to the patient and a specifically on the impact of
      odor on the subject's life.

      To meet the proposed objectives, the data will be analyzed by: Friedman test to assess the
      odor reduction with respect to time; Mann-Whitney (or t test) for comparison of groups and
      the Fisher exact test to compare proportions. Data will be presented in the form of frequency
      tables for categorical variables and means, standard deviations and position measurements for
      quantitative variables. Will also be performed non-parametric analysis of ordinal data, or
      parametric analysis with Generalized Estimation Equation for binomial variables, depending on
      the data distribution and the sample size.
