  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A research project funded by the Reiss-Davis Child Study Center of Vista Del Mar (RDCSC/VDM)
      will be conducted on the Vista Del Mar campus of the RDCSC/VDM to evaluate the effectiveness
      of the Listening Project Protocol (LPP) in children who have difficulties with autonomic and
      behavior regulation in the classroom. The LPP is designed as a &quot;neural exercise&quot; to reduce
      auditory hypersensitivities, to improve auditory processing of speech, and to improve
      behavioral state regulation. The LPP uses acoustic stimulation to exercise the neural
      regulation of the middle ear structures to rehabilitate and to normalize the acoustic
      transfer function of the middle ear structures. The current study is being conducted to
      evaluate efficacy and feasibility of the LPP with emotionally disturbed and learning
      challenged young people and will use objective measures to evaluate changes in acoustic
      transfer function of the middle ears structures, auditory processing skills, physiological
      state regulation, sensory symptoms, and academic pre and post testing.

    <description>The filtered-music intervention will consist of listening to computer-altered acoustic stimulation, designed to modulate the frequency band of vocal music passed to the participant. The frequency characteristics of the acoustic stimulation are selected to emphasize the relative importance of specific frequencies in conveying the information embedded in human speech. Modulation of the acoustic energy within the frequencies of human voice, similar to an exaggerated vocal prosody, are hypothesized to recruit and modulate the neural regulation of the middle ear muscles and to functionally reduce sound hypersensitivities and improve auditory processing.
The non-filtered music intervention will consist of the same music as the filtered-music intervention.</description>
