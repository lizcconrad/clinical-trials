  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective comparative study including 100 infertile patients with suspected uterine lesion.
      2D ultrasound, sonohysterography , 3D ultrasound and hysteroscopy will be done to evaluate
      uterine cavity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be examined by 2D transvaginal ultrasound using a 6.5 MHz probe (Sonoace
      5000, Medison Co. Ltd, korea). Examination is performed after emptying of the bladder in
      dorsal lithotomy position.

      Three dimensional ultrasound will be performed using Medison, Voulson 530 D-MT ultrasound
      machine (Medison Co. Ltd, Korea). The uterus is visualized in the longitudinal plane, the
      ultrasound probe is kept steady and the patient is asked to lie still on the examination bed.

      Sonohysterography will be done after introduction of the catheter into the cervix, a twenty
      milliliter syringe which is prefilled with the distending media (saline) is then fitted to
      the catheter. The speculum is removed and endovaginal probe is introduced in the posterior
      vaginal fornix. The uterus is then visualized in the longitudinal plane to demonstrate the
      endometrial cavity and the catheter. Once this is possible, sterile saline is slowly injected
      through the catheter into the uterine cavity; up to ten milliliter of saline is usually
      enough for the procedure.

      Hysteroscopy will be done under general anesthesia. The hysteroscopy is rigid continuous flow
      diagnostic hysteroscopy . It has a 30º panoramic optic which is 4 mm in diameter and the
      diagnostic continuous flow outer sheath is 6.5 mm in diameter.

    <description>Hysteroscopy is done under general anesthesia. The hysteroscopy used is rigid continuous flow diagnostic hysteroscopy (Tuttligen, Karl Storz, Germany). It has a 30º panoramic optic which is 4 mm in diameter and the diagnostic continuous flow outer sheath is 6.5 mm in diameter.</description>

    <description>Examination is performed after emptying of the bladder in dorsal lithotomy position .The probe is introduced into the posterior fornix of the vagina, then the following structures are examined, the uterus for site, size and mobility, the myometrium for fibroids and adenomyosis, the endometrium for uniformity, polyps, submucous fibroids and intrauterine adhesions, the cervix for nabothian follicles and polyps, the adenexa and ovaries for site, size, mobility, follicles, cysts and corpus luteum</description>

    <description>The uterus is visualized in the longitudinal plane, the ultrasound probe is kept steady and the patient is asked to lie still on the examination bed. The volume mode is switched on. Three D volume is generated by the automatic rotation of the mechanical transducer through 360º. The acquired volume is in the shape of a transacted cone with a depth of 4.3 - 8.6 cm and a vertical angle α = 90º. Using the medium line density, the typical acquisition time is a round 10 seconds</description>
