  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to compare overall survival in older adults with
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who receive reduced intensity conditioning hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant (RIC HSCT) versus those who do not receive HSCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MDS is a hematologic malignancy characterized by cytopenias, bone marrow failure, and a risk
      of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HSCT is the only curative therapy for MDS.
      Despite its increasing use among older patients (age greater than 60), more data are needed
      to assess outcomes of HSCT in older adults compared to other therapies.

      In this observational study, patients with MDS presenting at the study institutions are
      screened for disease characteristics that indicate that they are potentially appropriate for
      HSCT (both high-risk disease and fit for the procedure). Patients who meet inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study are entered into a clinical database
      and followed for overall survival. Patients also complete quality of life (QoL) assessments
      at enrollment and two years afterward, with the goal of investigating potential relationships
      between QoL and MDS treatment (HSCT vs. non-HSCT strategies).

        Eligible patients will be 60 to 75 years old with a diagnosis of MDS or related disorder
        (eg, MDS/MPD or CMML) who have disease that is advanced enough to warrant RIC HSCT (defined
        by high-risk cytogenetics OR int-2 or high-risk on IPSS OR transfusion dependence as
        defined by WPSS) and who are physically fit enough to undergo RIC HSCT as assessed by
        pre-determined measures of organ function. Patients whose baseline donor status is known
        will be excluded; however, knowledge of HLA status is allowed as long as a donor search has
        not been performed.
