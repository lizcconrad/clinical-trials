  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fact that dental caries remains a major public health problem mandates that oral-health
      researchers explore new strategies for assessment of caries risk, as well as for caries
      prevention and management. Dental caries occurs when acids produced by bacterial glycolysis
      of dietary carbohydrates causes demineralization of the tooth enamel. A major focus of caries
      research has been on identifying and characterizing acid-generating bacteria and the
      mechanisms of acid resistance. The purpose of this study is to investigate over time the
      relationship between alkali production and caries.

      This study will require a total of 6 study visits over a 2 to 3 year period. The first study
      visit will last about one hour. At this study visit, parent-administered questionnaires will
      be used to collect information on the following: (a) the participant's demographic background
      (age, gender, and race), (b) socio-economic status (parents' income and housing condition),
      (c) participant's oral health practice (feeding histories, diet habits, oral hygiene
      measures, and dental attendance), and (d) systemic diseases. During the study visit, the
      participant's complete medical and dental history will be obtained and reviewed, and a dental
      exam will be performed in order to determine participants' caries status, and intraoral
      pictures may be taken of participants' teeth. At this visit and remaining visits participants
      will not be allowed to brush or clean teeth using any type of oral hygiene procedures for 8
      hours prior to the visit. Saliva and plaque (the solf white-yellowish material on the tooth
      surface) will be collected at each visit. The Investigator will use a small probe to measure
      the pH of the dental plaque that builds up on the teeth. The participant will be asked to dip
      one finger into a glass containing a buffer solution and the probe will be placed on the
      teeth from which plaque will be taken. Plaque samples will be collected by gently scrapping
      the tooth using a sterile instrument. If the participant does not have enough plaque samples,
      they will be asked to return on the following day.
