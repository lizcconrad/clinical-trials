  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac pathology is a major risk for brain injury and neurodevelopmental deficit. The most
      common cause of cardiac pathology is congenital heart defects (CHD) about 4-8/1000 live
      births a year. The most common etiology of the brain insult is hypoxic ischemic injury (HII)
      as result of hemodynamic instability in the perioperative period. Similar insults in adults
      with cardiac arrest or infants with neonatal asphyxia, was successfully treated with
      hypothermia, initiated within 6 hours after the event. Although, hypothermia is most likely
      an effective treatment for HII in children with cardiac anomaly, it also carries a risk for
      bleeding or infection of the surgical wound. In this randomized control trial, hypothermia
      treatment will be compared to normothermia treatment of patients in the pediatric cardiac
      intensive care unit (PCICU) following severe HII in the PCICU or operating room. The effect
      will be quantified by MRI, serum biomarkers of brain injury, amplitude integrated EEG,
      neurological evaluation coagulation and infection evaluation in the acute phase and by
      developmental assessment at 1, 6 months and 2, 5 years. Favorable effect of hypothermia with
      minimal risks may open the door for the implementation of hypothermia as a standard care in
      PCICUs.
