      As this is a non-interventional study, the decision to prescribe the product must be taken
      prior to, and independently from the decision to enrol the patient. This decision should be
      made in accordance with routine clinical practice at the hospital concerned. The clinical
      justification for prescribing any treatment should be recorded at the outset by the
      prescribing clinician.

      This study will not interfere with the routine practice of the investigator or with the
      patient's treatment plan. Assessments will be done only if performed regularly in routine
      practice.

      This study will be conducted in Brazil, wherein Marketing Authorization has been granted for
      the use of BoNT-A in the treatment of spasticity of the upper and lower limb in adult
      post-stroke patients.
