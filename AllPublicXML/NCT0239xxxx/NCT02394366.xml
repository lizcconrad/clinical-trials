      Delayed wound healing leads to increased risk for infection, and thus increased risk for
      morbidity and mortality. Skin oxygen delivery and peripheral blood flow predict wound
      healing. The investigators will conduct a double-masked, placebo-controlled cross-over
      clinical pilot trial in order to evaluate the effects of a topical, homeopathic/herbal salve
      (Original Healing Salve, Puremedy, Inc.) on skin oxygenation and peripheral blood flow.

      Delayed wound healing leads to increased risk for infection, and thus increased risk for
      morbidity and mortality. Skin oxygen delivery and peripheral blood flow predict wound
      healing. In order to evaluate the effects of a topical, homeopathic/herbal salve (Original
      Healing Salve, Puremedy, Inc.) on skin oxygenation and peripheral blood flow, the
      investigators will conduct a double-masked, placebo-controlled cross-over clinical pilot
      trial with randomized testing order to evaluate the effects of the salve on cutaneous oxygen
      saturation (TcPO2) and ankle-to-brachial pressure index (ABPI). The investigators will
      recruit thirty-two participants in two cohorts to participate, one with and one without type
      2 diabetes, who are otherwise generally healthy without active wounds, ulcers or skin rashes.
      Both TcPO2 and ABPI will be measured before and after the application of both the
      homeopathic/herbal salve (&quot;active&quot;), and before and after the application of the inert salve
      base (&quot;placebo&quot;). Analyses will compare pre/post changes in TcPO2 and ABPI before and after
      application of the active salve within the same visit, and also compare the changes from the
      active salve to the before and after changes in TcPO2 and ABPI measured from the placebo
      salve. If the Original Healing Salve improves cutaneous oxygenation and/or ABPI, future
      research may evaluate the formula specifically for wound healing and antimicrobial effects.
      Thus the proposed research is a pilot study targeting mechanistic outcomes, which predict
      potential clinical efficacy. The proposed research is significant, as lower cost, more
      effective treatments are needed to improve wound healing and reduce the morbidity associated
      with the complications of delayed wound healing.
