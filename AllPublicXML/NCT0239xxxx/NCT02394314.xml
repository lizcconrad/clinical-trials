      A Phase 1, single dose study with 8 cohorts of ascending doses designed to evaluate the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of MEDI0382 in healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-humans (FTIH), randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and PK of MEDI0382 administered as single-ascending SC doses to
      healthy subjects (age 18-45). Eight subjects per cohort will be enrolled in a total of 8
      cohorts. The decision whether or not to dose escalate will be based upon data review by the
      Dose Escalation Committee (DEC). Within each cohort, the subjects will be randomized to
      MEDI0382 or placebo (3:1). Following screening, the study duration for each subject will be
      approximately 29 days, consisting of an inpatient evaluation period, and an outpatient
      follow-up period.
