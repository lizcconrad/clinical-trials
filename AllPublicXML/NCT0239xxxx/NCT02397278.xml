    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about ways to treat a joint problem in the knee called
      Juvenile Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD). The goal of this study is to see if injecting
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the knee can help knee cartilage heal faster, and will try to
      determine whether the injections lead to improvements in pain, performance of activities of
      daily living, improvements is sports activities and overall function and symptoms reduction.
      The investigators will compare PRP treatment to conservative therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female age 10 - 17 inclusive with open physis confirmed by MRI

          2. Documented symptomatic stable juvenile osteochondritis dissecans of the knee based on
             MRI without changes of osteoarthritis and no prior history of knee surgery.

          3. The patient must be able to hold still without sedation for approximately 1 hour and
             must pass MRI screening evaluation for retained metal.

          4. Patients with Di Paola stage 1 or 2 lesions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with polyarticular disease.

          2. Patients with blood disorders (Blood disorders (thrombopathy, thrombocytopenia, anemia
             with hemoglobin &lt;9g/dL). Only those patients with a positive history of blood
             disorders will have a Complete Blood Count (CBC) performed a week prior to inclusion
             in the study.

          3. Patients who had intra-articular treatment with steroids within 3 months

          4. Patients who are pregnant or nursing at the time of consent.

          5. Patients with inflammatory arthritic conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis)

          6. Non-English speaking patients. (Scores used for evaluation have not been validated in
             Spanish)

          7. Patients who had previous knee surgery

          8. Additional disabilities in any of the lower limbs that would interfere with any of the
             clinical assessments.

          9. Chronic use of NSAID (defined as taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug)
             regularly every week for the last 6 months), steroids or chemotherapy drugs

         10. Treatment with NSAIDs within 15 days prior to randomization in this study

         11. Patients with a BMI over 30. Due to the fact that this study utilizes an injection
             technique which may be inaccurate in obese subjects.

         12. Patients with a prolongation of bleeding time, e.g. those receiving anticoagulant drug
             therapy

         13. Patients with a contraindication to MRI including: patients with cardiac pacemaker or
             non-approved intracranial vascular clip, and those with orthopedic hardware as the
             resulting artifact can complicate interpretation

         14. Patients with acute or chronic renal failure

         15. Patients with a previous anaphylactic reaction to gadolinium enhanced MRI.

         16. Patients with Di Paola stage 3 or 4 lesions
