    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive sequelae observed in preterm represent a major health problem for which there
      is no preventive treatment approved to date. These effects are the result of a multifactorial
      brain damage occurring in developing prenatal and perinatal period. Melatonin, the principal
      hormone secreted by the pineal gland has neuroprotective properties in various experimental
      animal models of perinatal brain damage level. This hormone readily crosses the placental
      barrier, its antenatal administration would have a neuroprotective effect in the case of
      preventive preterm birth before 28 weeks of amenorrhea.

      The objective of this study determine the dose of melatonin administered parenterally in
      prenatal maternal in preterm labor to reduce brain damage in the white matter detected by
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with statistical spatial analysis (TBSS) to the theoretical
      term of 40 weeks in children born prematurely.
