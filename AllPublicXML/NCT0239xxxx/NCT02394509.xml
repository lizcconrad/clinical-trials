    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of the home-based
      cognitive self-management program &quot;HOBSCOTCH&quot; delivered at four New England medical centers.
      It will test the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of HOBSCOTCH, and whether it can be
      delivered from a distance utilizing e-health tools for parts of the program.

      HOBSCOTCH (Home Based Self-management and Cognitive Training Changes lives) is a home-based
      self-management program to treat cognitive symptoms and improve quality of life, while
      minimizing the barriers of access to care. The program is based on Problem Solving Therapy
      (PST) and teaches problem solving strategies and compensatory mechanisms to help manage
      cognitive dysfunction and enhance quality of life.

      HOBSCOTCH Phase II is a replication study of the original HOBSCOTCH study, designed to
      translate the findings of HOBSCOTCH into a real world setting. This is a multi-center study,
      with the HOBSCOTCH intervention being implemented at four epilepsy clinics in New England.

    <time_frame>Baseline and months: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15</time_frame>
    <description>We will be using Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31). This validated tool contains 16 multi-item scales which assess health related quality of life, emotional well-being, memory and attention deficits, medication effects, seizure control, psychosocial functioning, and health perception</description>

    <measure>Change in Healthcare Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and months: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15</time_frame>
    <description>We will be using the Healthcare Utilization in Epilepsy (HCU-E). This validated survey is concordant with billing data. It assesses seizure frequency and whether the subject had received any of the following services because of their epilepsy over the past 3 months: hospital ER services, general practice or family doctor visits, neurologist or epilepsy specialist visits, and overnight hospital inpatient stay.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and months: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15</time_frame>
    <description>We will be using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a brief 9-item validated depression scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and months: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15</time_frame>
    <description>We will be using a modified version of the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT). This is a modified version of a validated psychometric instrument that can be delivered over the phone in 20 minutes. It includes measures of episodic memory, working memory, reasoning, verbal fluency and executive function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Management Practices</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and months: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15</time_frame>
    <description>We will be using the Epilepsy Self-Management Scale (ESMS). This is a 38 item scale that assesses use of epilepsy self-management practices.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and months: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15</time_frame>
