  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn more about health related quality of life factors in people
      having surgery for colorectal liver metastasis. The investigators will look at how these
      factors may change over time. The information gained from this study will help the
      investigators to understand the long-term effects that cancer treatments have on the health
      related quality of life of patients. This information is of high value and will help doctors
      talk to patients about the possible effects of their operations. While many patients live a
      long time after such operations, the studies that have been done do not tell the full story
      of what patients go through after surgery. This study will help us to understand cancer
      treatment from the patient's perspective. It will also help cancer patients make better
      decisions about their treatment options and will help them know what to expect after the
      operation.

        All patients scheduled to undergo liver resection who meet the established criteria will be
        approached for participation in this study during their preoperative visit. Patients
        undergoing a two stage resection will have their time point frozen for up to six months
        after their initial surgery. If the time before the second stage of their resection exceeds
        six months, these patients will be excluded and replaced. The time point will restart at
        the completion of the second time point. If the patient has an incomplete resection without
        mention of a second stage resection, the patient will be made ineligible, taken off study,
        and replaced.
