      Fluorescein angiography (FA) is the standard and generally accepted method to identify
      vascular features in the retina, detecting capillary dropout and neovessel growth. Its value
      is undeniable and is a routine ophthalmological examination. However, it requires intravenous
      injection of fluorescein, which can cause nausea, vomiting and, rarely, anaphylaxis and
      death. New OCT angiography methods can detect, noninvasively red blood cells flow and,
      therefore, identify well the retinal vasculature. It is crucial and of major interest to
      evaluate the clinical utility of this new methodology comparing this information with the one
      obtained from fluorescein angiography.
