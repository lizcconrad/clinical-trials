  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if positron emission tomography/magnetic
      resonance imaging (PET/MRI), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and
      whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to detect extramedullary myeloid
      leukemia (EML). EML is a type of cancer found outside of the bone marrow and can be hard to
      detect with routine bone marrow monitoring, such as bone marrow aspirations.

      This is an investigational study. The PET/MRI and PET/CT scans on this study are performed
      using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. Using these scans to detect EML is
      considered investigational.

      Up to 55 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson..

      If you choose to take part in this study, you will have a PET/MRI and PET/CT scan before you
      start your regular treatment.

      When you arrive at the clinic for your PET/MRI-PET/CT scans, you will receive a
      &quot;radioisotope&quot; and a &quot;contrast&quot; solutions by vein to make the images more accurate. If you
      feel very nervous, the doctor may give you medication to help calm you down.

      You will have the PET/MRI scan, for which you will have to lie on a table in the scanner for
      about an hour. In a different room, you have a PET/CT scan, for which you will have to lie on
      a table in the scanner for about 30 minutes.

      You and your regular doctor will be told if anything unusual is found in your scans, and the
      information will be put in your medical record.

      Information will also be collected from your medical record for at least 1 year after you
      complete the scans.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>EML prevalence assessed via imaging with PET/CT, MR, and PET/MR fusion, the latter serves as the gold standard. Follow up imaging, biopsies and clinical disposition also used to further confirm EML presence when available, but PET/MR fusion serves as the gold standard. Imaging criteria for presence of EML includes findings such as increased signal on T2 and DWI and enhancement on MR with increased 18F-FDG uptake on PET.</description>

    <description>Participants receive an injection of 18F-FDG prior to whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI images taken, then participants receive an injection of gadolinium contrast agent 2 mL/sec and 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight followed by a 20-cc saline flush. MRI images are then completed. Immediately following whole body MRI, standard positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) performed.</description>
