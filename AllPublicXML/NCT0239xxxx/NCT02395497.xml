  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the external genitalia are of great concern to the military with emphasis being
      placed on the surgical reconstruction and psychological health of these Wounded Warriors.
      However, despite significant surgical advances in microvascular surgery and autologous free
      tissue transfer, conventional reconstructions cannot truly replace the complicated structures
      and functions of the penis including the urethra, erogenous sensation, and erectile corporal
      bodies. Conventional reconstruction poses several challenges: patients may not have
      sufficient donor tissue (i.e., the forearm or thigh) due to other injuries or previous
      surgery; multiple operations are often needed to restore the neophallus; the final
      reconstruction only approximates the penis' native form; recreating the urethra is
      challenging and the new urethra is prone to stricture and fistula formation; the erectile
      function necessary for sexual intercourse is often lacking; and insufficient protective
      sensation can lead to penile implant extrusion, infection, and subsequent explantation or
      loss of the reconstruction.

      For these reasons, the investigators propose the current clinical trial to determine
      functional outcomes and quality of life (QOL) for Wounded Warriors and civilians who choose
      to undergo penile allotransplantation. The investigators will combine extensive experience
      performing total penile reconstruction in a large population affected by congenital,
      traumatic, and therapeutically extirpated Genitourinary (GU) deformities and expertise in
      reconstructive transplantation using an immunomodulatory protocol to implement this study.
      The investigators anticipate that penile transplantation can potentially replace &quot;like with
      like,&quot; restoring the appearance, anatomy, and function of the recipient in a manner far
      superior to autologous reconstruction. This project will establish the ability to perform
      penile allotransplantation using an immunomodulatory protocol and will compare outcomes with
      conventional phalloplasty patient results.

      Study Design: This is a non-randomized subject self-controlled clinical trial to implement a
      cell-based immunomodulatory protocol for penile allotransplantation. An intermediate
      deliverable is achieving allograft survival and functional return with reduced
      dosing/frequency of maintenance immunosuppression on steroid-free monotherapy (tacrolimus)
      immunosuppression. The long-term deliverable and goal is to demonstrate equivalent or
      superior outcomes when compared to satisfaction and QOL in conventional phalloplasty patients
      12-60 months post-transplant.

      Specific Aims: 1) To assess the feasibility and function of penile allotransplantation in
      Wounded Warriors and civilians who have lost their penis due to battle or traumatic injury,
      using an immunomodulatory protocol to reduce immunosuppression; 2) To assess pre-to-post
      changes in QOL in patients who undergo penile allotransplantation.
