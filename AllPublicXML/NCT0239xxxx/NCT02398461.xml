    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      dose-escalation study in subjects with relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The primary outcome
      will be the safety and tolerability of a single dose of rHIgM22 in relapsing MS subjects.
