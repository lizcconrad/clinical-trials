  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of Vargatef
      (Nintedanib) plus docetaxel in daily routine second-line treatment in patients with locally
      advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent NSCLC. Treatment with Vargatef in eligible NSCLC
      patients, for whom the treating physician has decided to initiate treatment with Vargatef in
      second line according to the local label, will be observed for up to 24 months. Survial
      follow-up will be done until the end of the study.
