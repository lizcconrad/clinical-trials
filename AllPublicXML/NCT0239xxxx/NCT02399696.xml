    <textblock>
      Primary care patients typically do not receive adequate PTSD treatment because of their
      reluctance to engage in empirically-supported treatments offered in specialty care settings.
      Effective treatments for PTSD are also typically not provided in primary care. Brief
      skill-based treatments offered in primary care may alleviate symptoms and prepare patients to
      engage in additional treatment. VA primary care patients with PTSD (N=62) were recruited for
      a randomized clinical trial comparing a Primary Care-Brief Mindfulness Program (PC-bMP) to
      primary care-treatment as usual (PC-TAU). PC-bMP is a 4-week group program adapted from the
      8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) curriculum. Veterans in the PC-bMP condition
      demonstrated significantly greater decreases in PTSD and depressive symptoms from
      pre-treatment to post-treatment compared to PC-TAU. These gains were maintained at 8 and 12
      week follow-up. PC-bMP participants experienced clinically significant decreases in PTSD,
      averaging a 15-point drop on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Exploratory analyses
      revealed that the describing, non-judging, and acting with awareness facets of mindfulness
      may account for decreases in PTSD. Our data support preliminary efficacy of a brief
      mindfulness-based intervention for Veterans with PTSD in primary care. Further research is
      needed to investigate how PC-bMP may facilitate engagement into full length
      empirically-supported treatment for PTSD.
