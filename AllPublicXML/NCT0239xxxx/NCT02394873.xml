    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety of ALLO-ASC-DFU for the treatment of deep
      second-degree burn wound patients. ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Adipose-derived stem cells release growth factors
      such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which
      can enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in
      treating a burn.
