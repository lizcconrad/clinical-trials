  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate clinical, biological and functional health changes in
      smokers switching to the candidate modified risk tobacco product: Tobacco Heating System 2.2
      (THS 2.2) as compared to smokers continuing smoking their conventional cigarettes (CC) over a
      26-week period.

      The clinical, biological and functional endpoints to be measured in this study (&quot;smoker's
      health profile&quot;) may characterize the modification of risk of smoking-related diseases.

      Clinical risk endpoint to be assessed are selected based on a) their association to
      smoking-related diseases b) their association to smoking status, c) their reversibility upon
      smoking cessation, and d) their suitability to be measured with valid and robust methods in
      clinical studies.

      The biological markers, functional markers and biomarkers of exposure (BoExp) with the
      strongest scientific evidence will constitute the 'smoker's health profile' and will be
      measured as the primary objective of the study.

      Additional endpoints involved in the mechanistic of smoking-related diseases will be studied
      to provide additional scientific evidence to strengthen the primary objective.

      The study will provide a perspective of product usage in a &quot;real world setting&quot; where smoking
      CC in addition to THS 2.2 may be expected.
