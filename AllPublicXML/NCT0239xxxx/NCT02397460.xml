      This is a double-blind, randomized, 4 period, crossover study in up to 30 male and female
      healthy and chronic cough subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 subjects who meet all entry criteria will be randomly assigned to gefapixant or
      matching placebo.

      There will be a Screening Period, a Baseline Visit (cough subjects only), and four Treatment
      Periods, with a washout period between treatments. Subjects will return after their last
      Treatment Visit for a Follow-up Visit.

      At the Screening Visit and during the Treatment Periods, cough sensitivity will be measured
      by standard clinical methodology incorporating two cough challenges (capsaicin and ATP). The
      ATP challenge will only be performed during the study treatment period. The Baseline Visit
      (cough subjects only) will occur prior to Treatment Period 1. Day time cough monitoring will
      be performed at the Baseline Visit and during each of the four Treatment Periods (cough
      subjects only).
