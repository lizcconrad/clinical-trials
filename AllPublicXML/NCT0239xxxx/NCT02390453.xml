  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of cognitive and exercise
      training versus control condition on executive cognitive function in older adults with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise and cognitive training hold promise for delaying progression of MCI. Exercise
      improves cognitive ability, brain function, and brain structure in older adults. Cognitive
      training has been shown to durably improve mental abilities and functional status in older
      adults. In addition, persons with MCI respond to some forms of cognitive training just as
      robustly as healthy older adults.

      This pilot study is a 4 group design with a home-based multi-modal physical exercise
      intervention, cognitive training, combined cognitive and physical training, and a social
      contact control enrolling older adults with MCI.

      This pilot study is designed to be consistent with current recommended approaches to
      establishing trial feasibility. If the aims are achieved, it will provide a conceptual and
      practical rationale to support a large, multi-site, randomized clinical trial to test the
      efficacy of combined physical and cognitive training in delaying time to a clinical diagnosis
      of dementia.
