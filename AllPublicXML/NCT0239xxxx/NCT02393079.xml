      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early and late effects of Transcranial Led
      Therapy (TLTC) in memory and executive functions in patients with moderate and severe TBI
      history in the initial phase (3-6 months).

      In the current study patients in the outpatient center - Neurotrauma Unit at University of
      SÃ£o Paulo (HCFMUSP) diagnosed with moderate / severe blunt head trauma that meet the
      inclusion criteria will be divided randomly and blindly in two groups: Group A (n = 15) will
      receive stimulation through active helmet and Group B (n = 15) given placebo stimulation or
      sham through the inactive helmet. All patients will be subjected to 3 times of
      neuropsychological assessment: Study 1 (E1) - up to 4 weeks before the start of TLTC
      sessions; Study 2 (E2) - a week after the end of TLTC; and Study 3 (E3) - three months after
      the intervention. The evaluations will take in order to verify the early and late effects of
      TLTC in attention, memory and executive functions in patients with moderate and severe TBI.
