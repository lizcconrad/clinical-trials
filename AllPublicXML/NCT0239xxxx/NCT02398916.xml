  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is the primary diagnostic and therapeutic
      procedure employed in women with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix. The
      procedure usually performed in the outpatient setting under local anesthesia. However, it
      could be associated with significant pain and anxiety.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of listening to music during the procedure in
      reducing pain and anxiety.
