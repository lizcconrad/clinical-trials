  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will determine whether patients with documented
      atherosclerosis are characterized by specific epigenetic changes in circulating cells of the
      innate immune system, compared to patients without atherosclerosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The innate immune system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression
      of atherosclerosis. Recently, it was reported that monocytes can develop a long-lasting
      immunological memory after stimulation with various microorganisms, which has been termed
      'trained innate immunity'. This memory is induced by epigenetic reprogramming. We hypothesize
      that trained monocytes augment atherogenesis.

      Objective: The main objective is to study whether patients with coronary atherosclerosis show
      specific epigenetic changes in the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
      chemokines and whether this correlates with the inflammatory phenotype of these cells.

      Study design: Observational study

      Study population: Adult patients who have had computed tomography coronary angiography
      because of chest pain: 20 patients without atherosclerosis and 20 patients with severe
      atherosclerosis will be included.
