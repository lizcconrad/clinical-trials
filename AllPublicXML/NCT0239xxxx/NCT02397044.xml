  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the success rates of two surgical protocols. One
      protocol will have the implants placed at the time of tooth extraction and placed into
      function. The other protocol will have the implants placed into healed extraction sites and
      placed into function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-eight patients (22 men, 26 women) were enrolled in the study and received 48 implants.
      The population was divided into 2 groups: Group A implants (n=23) were loaded immediately on
      the day of surgery and Group B implants (n=19) were loaded 3 weeks after surgery. Cone Beam
      Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans were taken preoperatively to aid in treatment planning. Bone
      density was evaluated on CBCT scans in Hounsfield units (HU) and by tactile feedback during
      surgery. Insertion torque was recorded at time of implant placement. Resonance frequency
      analysis, performed on the day of surgery, at the time of loading, and at 6, 12 and 24
      months, was used to record implant stability according to the unit's Implant Stability
      Quotient (Osstell ISQ). Standardized radiographs were taken at time of implant placement and
      at 6, 12 and 24 months to measure crestal bone stability. Bone level changes were measured by
      software (Image J, available online at: http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html; last accessed

    <description>Implant survival
Crestal Bone Loss will be determined radiographically and will be defined as having occurred when greater than 1.5 mm of bone loss is evident. This endpoint will be summarized for the subgroups of the study population which are formed by stratifying on implant diameter, implant length, implant location and patient age. Rates of crestal bone loss will be computed at one year.
ISQ will be measured at the time of implant placement, at 5 months and at one year post implant placement. Insertion torque will be measured at time of placement only.</description>
