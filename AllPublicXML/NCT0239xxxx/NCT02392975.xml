      This proposal will test the diagnostic utility of fast magnetic resonance (MR) in young
      children with Traumatic brain Injury (TBI).

      In children, TBI causes &gt;2000 deaths, 35,000 hospitalizations and 470,000 emergency
      department visits in the US each year, making it a leading cause of pediatric disability and
      death. Currently 20-50% of these children undergo computed tomography (CT) scanning, exposing
      them to harmful radiation, and increasing their lifetime risk of cancer. Risks are especially
      increased in children because the neurologic exam is less reliable, because growing tissues
      are more vulnerable to radiation, and because children have more years to accumulate harmful
      mutations.

      Fast MR is a short, motion-tolerant protocol that has been used in children with shunted
      hydrocephalus to eliminate radiation exposure without the need for sedation. However, fast MR
      has not been validated in children with TBI, a critical gap. The investigators will measure
      feasibility and diagnostic utility of fast MR in children &lt; 6 years (72 months) old who
      undergo head CT for TBI.

      The Investigator will recruit children in whom a head CT is ordered for TBI. Consenting
      subjects will undergo fast MR shortly after CT and results will be compared to determine: 1)
      whether fast MR identifies all traumatic injuries identified by CT and 2) whether fast MR
      without sedation can be performed quickly and successfully.
