  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to answer why &quot;patient capacity&quot; (i.e. patient available abilities and
      resources to enact self-care and access healthcare) is not regularly documented in the
      Electronic Medical Record (EMR) in a way that is useful for clinicians.

      Through the implementation of communication tools designed for patient capacity assessment
      and engagement of stakeholders in a process of user-centered design, the study team
      hypothesizes that the study can help clinicians elicit this information in conversation and
      regularly document it in the medical record for future healthcare discussions.
