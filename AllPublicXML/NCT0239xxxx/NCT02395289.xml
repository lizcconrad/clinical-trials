  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of cognitive-based compassion training
      (CBCT), a meditative practice based on Buddhist teachings, on long term emotional well-being
      and immune system improvement with people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the efficacy of cognitive-based compassion training
      (CBCT), a contemplative technique based on the Tibetan Buddhist tradition of compassion
      meditation, for enhancing immune restoration and psychological resilience in people living
      with HIV-1 (PLHIV). Psychosocial stress has been associated with increased circulating
      concentrations of key inflammatory biomarkers. The patients with HIV must cope with the
      physical impact of HIV disease itself, the often complex treatment regimens and side effects
      of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), illness-associated psychological and existential
      dilemmas, changes in social roles and lifestyle patterns relative to illness progression,
      social stigma, and financial and material resource concerns. This study aims to determine if
      engagement with CBCT is associated with reduced circulating concentrations of stress-related
      inflammatory biomarkers, improves HIV-related clinical outcomes and decreases stress in
      PLHIV.

    <measure>Change in scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS is a 10-item scale that provides a general index of perceived psychological stress as this relates to a sense that one's life is experienced as unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded. The subjects are asked to indicate how often they felt or thought a certain way and to score their responses on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0= Never and 4=Very Often. PSS is measured on a scale of 0 to 40, with higher scores reflecting greater perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Change in scores on the General Well-Being (GWB) Schedule Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GWB is an 18-item self-report scale designed to measure subjective psychological well-being and distress. It includes six subscales (anxiety, depression, positive well-being, self-control, vitality, general health) and also yields an overall well-being score. The response format used a 6-grade Likert scale and the range of scores will be normalized from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the better the well-being of the participant.</description>

    <measure>Change in scores on the Illness Cognition Questionnaire (ICQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This ICQ is an 18-item self-report measure used to assess changes in illness appraisal. It includes three subscales that evaluate specific dimensions of illness cognitions. Each of the three scales (helplessness, acceptance and benefits) consists of 6 items that are rated according to a 4-point Likert scale to the extent of agreement (0= not at all, 1=somewhat, 2= to a large extent, 3= completely), producing a total score ranging from 0 to 72, with a higher score being indicative of more illness appraisal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scores on the World Assumptions Scale (WAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WAS is a 32-item self-report instrument that measures core personal beliefs. Subscales tap specific core belief domains, including: benevolence of the impersonal world, benevolence of people, justice, controllability of life events, self-worth, self-controllability, and personal luck. Each of these scales consist of items that are rated according to a 6-point Likert-type scale bounded by 1 (strongly disagree) and 6 (strongly agree). The higher the score is indicative to a stronger belief.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scores on the Life Regard Index - Revised (LRI-R).</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The LRI-R is a 28-item scale that provides an index of global personal meaning. It includes two subscales: framework (assesses one's sense of having a frame of reference from which to appraise one's life and goals), and fulfillment (evaluates the degree to which one perceives that life goals are being realized). Both of these scales consist of items that are rated according to a 3-point Likert scale (1= I agree, 2= I have no opinion and 3= I disagree) and scores on both subscales range between 14 and 42, for a total range of 28 and 84. In case of the framework subscale, a higher score indicates a higher degree of positive beliefs and goals. In case of the fulfillment subscale, a higher score indicates that persons see themselves in the process of fulfilling their beliefs and goals.</description>

    <measure>Change in scores on the Rosenberg self-esteem scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Rosenberg Self-esteem scale is a 10-item scale that provides a self-report index of self-esteem. Each item is rated according to a 4-point Likert scale with scores ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The scale ranges from 0-30, with 30 indicating the highest score possible. Total sum scores between 15 and 25 are within normal range; with scores below 15 suggest low self-esteem.</description>

    <measure>Change in scores on the Berger HIV Stigma Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Berger HIV Stigma Scale is a 13-item self-report measure that evaluates perceptions of HIV stigma across three subscale domains, including distancing (concerns about avoidance by others), blaming (feelings of blame from others and internal shame relative to HIV), and discrimination (concerns about inequitable treatment because of HIV). Each item is rated according to a 4-point Likert scale with scores ranging from bounded by 1 (strongly disagree) and 4 (strongly agree). Endorsement of stigmatizing views yielded a higher score.</description>

    <description>Cognitive-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) is composed of secular, didactic instruction and meditation practices. CBCT includes the meditative practices of developing one-pointed concentration and mindfulness. CBCT will be one class per week, 2 hours each, for 8 weeks, for a total of 16 hours during the study. Each meditation class will include a didactic and discussion session that will describe the meditative technique introduced during the week and a practice meditation session. The training protocol is highly iterative and techniques introduced early in training are practiced daily. All participants will be asked to meditate approximately 30 minutes a day &quot;at home&quot; and will be given a meditation diary to record amount of time spent meditating per week.</description>

    <description>Health discussion therapy is one class per week, 2 hours each, for 8 weeks. Each class will use interactive teaching methods to present the health material in an engaging and relevant manner. Representative weekly topics that will be covered include healthy diet, the role of exercise in emotional health, and the importance of sleep and relaxation. It is important to note that the material presented in the health discussion group, although intended to be beneficial to participants, does not include a contemplative component and is not iterative in nature.</description>
