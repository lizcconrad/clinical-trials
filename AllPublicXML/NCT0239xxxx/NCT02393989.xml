      Background: This 3-year clinical trial compared the performance and post-operative
      sensitivity of a posterior resin composite with that of bonded-amalgam in large sized
      cavities. Additionally, it was evaluated whether resin composite could be an alternative for
      bonded amalgam.

      Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial. Patients in need of at least two posterior
      restorations were recruited. Authors randomly assigned one half of the restorations to
      receive bonded-amalgam and the other half to composite restorations. Forty bonded-amalgams
      and composites were evaluated for their performance on modified Ryge criteria and
      post-operative sensitivity using VAS for 36-months.
