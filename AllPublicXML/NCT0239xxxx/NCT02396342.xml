               -  Known moderately severe FIX deficiency with plasma FIX activity level between ≥

                    -  Currently on on-demand therapy with a current or past history of frequent
                       bleeding defined as four or more bleeding episodes in the last 12 months or
                       chronic hemophilic arthropathy (pain, joint destruction, and loss of range

          4. More than 150 previous exposure days of treatment with FIX protein.

          5. Acceptance to use a condom during sexual intercourse in the period from
             Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration until AAV5 has been cleared
             from semen, as evidenced by the central laboratory from negative analysis results for
             at least 3 consecutively collected semen samples (this criterion is applicable also
             for subjects who are surgically sterilized)

          6. Following receipt of verbal and written information about the trial, the subject has
             provided signed informed consent before any trial related activity is carried out.

         13. Active severe infection or any other significant concurrent, uncontrolled medical
             condition including, but not limited to, renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurological, cerebral or psychiatric disease,
             alcoholism, drug dependency or any other psychological disorder evaluated by the

             of tolerance to the IMP

         14. Known significant medical condition including disseminated intravascular coagulation,
             fibrinolysis and liver fibrosis which, in the opinion of the investigator, may
