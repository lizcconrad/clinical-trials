  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of limb skeletal muscle perfusion and perfusion reserve during exercise is an
      approach that can assess the total impact of the complex pathophysiologic processes in
      patients with limb ischemia, particularly in those with diabetes in whom distal arterial
      disease and abnormal microvascular functional responses are common. This trial is designed
      to: (a) optimize methods for assessment of limb perfusion at rest and during stress using
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (normal subjects) and a microbubble contrast agent that is able
      to provide non-linear signal without destruction at medium acoustic pressures, and (b) to
      test whether perfusion imaging provides incremental information on the severity of disease in
      patients with peripheral artery disease.

    <description>Intervention: administration of ultrasound contrast agent (drug) to assess muscle perfusion. Normal healthy subjects (n=10) will be used for optimization of dose and acoustic settings for performing real-time contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging of the limb.</description>

    <description>Intervention: administration of ultrasound contrast agent (drug) to assess muscle perfusion. Patients with moderate to severe PAD (ABI 0.4 to 0.6) will be evaluated with contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging using methods optimized in the first Arm to determine whether symptoms better correlate with perfusion imaging than other measures of PAD severity.</description>

    <description>Intervention: administration of ultrasound contrast agent (drug) to assess change in muscle perfusion produced by revascularization (surgical or percutaneous procedure). Patients with symptomatic PAD will be evaluated with contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging using methods optimized in the first Arm before and within 1 month of revascularization to determine whether improvement in symptoms correlate with perfusion imaging data.</description>
