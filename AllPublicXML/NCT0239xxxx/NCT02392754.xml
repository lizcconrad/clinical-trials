  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major treatable risk factor for stroke, but it may be hard to
      detect because it is frequently silent and intermittent. New ambulatory cardiac monitoring
      technologies have the potential to improve early detection of AF. This trial investigates AF
      screening in primary care patients using the ZIO XT Patch, a wearable adhesive patch monitor
      that provides continuous ECG recording for up to 14 days, in addition to the WatchBP home
      blood pressure monitor that has built-in AF screening capability.

      SCREEN-AF is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, two-group randomized
      controlled trial investigating non-invasive, home-based AF screening. The trial targets
      patients aged 75 years or older with a history of hypertension and without known AF who would
      be potential anticoagulant candidates if AF were detected. Eligible participants will be
      recruited from primary care practices and randomly allocated (1:1) to one of two groups:

        -  The control group will receive standard care for 6 months (including a pulse check and
           heart auscultation by a physician at baseline and 6 months).

        -  The intervention group will undergo ambulatory screening for AF with a 2-week continuous
           ECG patch monitor worn at baseline and again at 3 months, in addition to standard care
           for 6 months (including a pulse check and heart auscultation by a physician at baseline
           and 6 months). The intervention group will also receive a home BP monitor with automatic
           AF detection capability to be used twice daily for 2 weeks during the ECG monitoring
           blocks.

      The hypothesis is that continuous ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring using an adhesive ECG
      patch monitor will be superior to standard care for AF detection. The overall aim of this
      research is to establish a practical and cost-effective screening strategy that could be
      applied in primary care for early detection of AF in patients who would benefit from
      anticoagulant therapy if AF were detected. The ultimate goal of this primary prevention
      initiative is to prevent more strokes, and stroke-related deaths, disability, dementia,
      hospitalizations and institutionalization, through the early detection and treatment of AF.
