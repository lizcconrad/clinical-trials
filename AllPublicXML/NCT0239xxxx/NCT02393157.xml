    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of administering obinutuzumab as a
      single agent alone and in combination with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE)
      chemotherapy and determine the response rate of this treatment for children, adolescents and
      young adults (CAYA) with relapsed CD20 positive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL).

    <description>All patients will receive 4 doses of obinutuzumab on days -14, -10, -6 and -2. Patients without CNS involvement will receive one dose of Liposomal cytarabine for CNS prophylaxis on day -13. Dexamethasone will be given for 5 days with each Liposomal cytarabine dose starting one day prior to the Liposomal cytarabine. Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg/dose (max 4mg) IV BID will be given days -14 to -10. Following completion of the Prephase (or at the first sign of progressive disease), all patients will proceed to cycle 1 of O-ICE. O-ICE chemotherapy is given in 21-day (3-week) cycles. Three weekly doses of obinutuzumab will be given days -2 (during the prephase), +6 and +13. Patients will receive ICE chemotherapy (ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide) administered on Days 0-2 of Cycle 1.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive 4 doses of obinutuzumab on days -14, -10, -6 and -2. Patients with positive CSF prior to enrollment will receive treatment with two doses of Liposomal cytarabine during the prephase portion of therapy. Liposomal cytarabine will be given intrathecally on days -13 and -5. Dexamethasone will be given for 5 days with each Liposomal cytarabine dose starting the day prior to the Liposomal cytarabine. Dexamethasone will be given days -14 to -10 and days -6 through -2. Following completion of the Prephase (or at the first sign of progressive disease), all patients will proceed to cycle 1 of O-ICE. O-ICE chemotherapy is given in 21-day (3-week) cycles. Three weekly doses of obinutuzumab will be given days -2 (during the prephase), +6 and +13.
