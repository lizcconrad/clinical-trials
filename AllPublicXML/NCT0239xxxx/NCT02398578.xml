        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet ALL the inclusion criteria to be eligible to participate in the study.

          1. Non-pregnant, non-lactating female &gt; 18 years old with a history of idiopathic OAB for
             ≥ 6 months

          2. Have failed or are not a candidate for drug treatment

          3. Subject is willing to provide Informed Consent, is geographically stable, understands
             the requirements for completing the bladder diary and is willing to comply with the
             required diary, follow up visits and testing schedules

          4. Ambulatory without the aid of walking assistance a majority of the time (cane, walker
             etc.) and able to use toilet without assistance

          5. Post-void residual (PVR) ≤ 100 ml NOTE: Subjects with a single PVR of &gt;100 ml followed
             by two consecutive PVR measurements of ≤100 ml may be included in the study. The final
             acceptable PVR measurement will be recorded in the data.

          6. Ability and willingness to self-catheterize in case this is necessary

          7. 3 day Bladder Diary Criteria: Symptoms of OAB as evidenced by: Micturition frequency
             of ≥ 8 times/day And &gt; 3 episodes of urgency urinary incontinence (UUI)

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subject will be excluded if ANY of the following conditions apply:

          1. Planning on becoming pregnant during the 12 month study period

          2. Current participation in any other conflicting interventional or OAB treatment study

          3. Primary complaint of stress urinary incontinence or stress predominant mixed
             incontinence or functional incontinence

          4. Any invasive or surgical intervention (e.g., radio frequency, implant, sling)
             involving the bladder, rectum or vaginal wall within the last 6 months

          5. Ongoing complications of prior anti-incontinence surgery

          6. Subject with 24-hour total urine volume voided greater than 3,000 ml as measured at
             screening period

          7. Receiving electro-stimulation (e.g. PTNS or SNS) treatment within the last 15 days.

             NOTE: Subjects with an implanted SNS device that has not been active in the last 15
             days is acceptable for enrollment

          8. Botox treatment for OAB with 100u in the last 6 months OR Botox treatment with &gt;100u
             in last 9 months

          9. Urinary tract infection that is not resolved at the time of enrollment or had &gt; 3
             urinary tract infections (UTIs) within the last 12 months NOTE: If UTI is present at
             baseline screening, treatment with antibiotics and a negative urinalysis at least 7
             days after the initial diagnosis of UTI will be acceptable for enrollment.

         10. Documented spontaneous unprovoked urinary retention within the last 6 months

         11. Anatomical conditions that would preclude the introduction and use of the device, in
             the opinion of the investigator, such as significant pelvic organ prolapse, urogenital
             prolapse visible at rest beyond the hymen, significant cystocele prolapse or high BMI

         12. Current bleeding disorder or coagulopathies

         13. Current use of antimuscarinics, β3 agonist or antispasmodics NOTE: subjects on these
             drugs must undergo a 2 week washout period prior to completing the baseline Bladder
             Diary.

         14. Subject has been previously diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, bladder cancer or
             chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

         15. Previous pelvic irradiation

         16. Serum creatinine &gt; twice the upper limit of normal within the last six months

         17. Neurological disease affecting bladder function such as multiple sclerosis, spinal
             cord injuries, myasthenia gravis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease

         18. Current hydronephrosis or hydroureter

         19. Bladder outflow obstruction

         20. Ureteral dysfunction, stricture or reflux
