  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare trans-abdominal uterine massage to sustained uterine
      compression after vaginal delivery with respect to blood loss and maternal pain. It is a
      randomized controlled trial that will be conducted at the American University of Beirut
      Medical Center - Delivery Suite.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women allocated to either the massage or compression group will be given 10 units of oxytocin
      intramuscularly immediately after delivery of the shoulder and controlled cord traction will
      be performed to assist placental delivery. The umbilical cord will be clamped and cut
      approximately 1 minute after delivery of the baby. The uterine fundus will be rubbed and
      blood clots expelled as quickly as possible after delivery of the placenta.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of blood loss of 500 mL or more</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Collection of lost blood will be initiated immediately after delivery of the neonate by putting a drape under the woman's buttocks. Blood collected will be weighed on an electronic scale together with the drape, and the amount will be recorded in grams after subtracting the weight of the drape. The amount of blood loss will be recorded 30 mins after delivery of the neonate. The amount of lost blood in grams will be converted to volume by dividing by 1.06 (blood density in g/mL) for the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal pain</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal discomfort and pain intensity will be evaluated after the intervention using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which consists of a two-sided rule with a 10 cm vertical or horizontal line linking two points, at one extreme indicating a total absence of pain and at the other the worst pain imaginable. The women will be required to mark a spot on the line corresponding to the intensity of their pain at that particular time on a possible scale of 0 to 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hemoglobin as a measure of blood loss</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The change in hemoglobin will be defined as the mean difference of pre-delivery hemoglobin versus post-delivery hemoglobin in each group.</description>
