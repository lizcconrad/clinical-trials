  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation study in participants with advanced solid
      tumors to determine the pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2
      dose of ABBV-075 at different monotherapy dosing schedules. In addition the study will
      evaluate the safety. tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of ABBV-075 monotherapy or
      combination therapy in disease specific expansion cohorts.

If more than 2 participants experience a different dose limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose may be further evaluated or determined to be exceeded based on discussions with the investigators and medical monitors.</description>
