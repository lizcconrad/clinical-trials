  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis results in increased filling pressures of the heart. Size and function of the
      left atrium may be a marker for more advanced heart disease (heart failure) in patients with
      severe aortic stenosis, not presenting any apparent symptoms.

      The goal of this study is to establish the importance and possible implications of left
      atrial dilation in asymptomatic patients with aortic valve stenosis.

    <textblock>
      Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease in the western world. Mild and
      moderate AS generally is well tolerated severe AS is associated with considerable morbidity
      and mortality.

      The consequence of AS is increased pressure load on the left ventricle, which causes changes
      in the ventricular function and structure (Left ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy,
      fibrosis).

      With longstanding elevated filling pressures the left atrium will dilate and heart failure
      symptoms will develop.

      When apparent, symptoms of heart failure, in AS are associated with high mortality rate and
      aortic valve replacement (AVR) is recommended.

      The clinical assessment of heart failure symptoms in AS is however challenging particularly
      in the elderly, as symptoms progress slowly and may mimic age related fragility.

      In this observational study, the goal is to investigate the importance and possible
      implications of left atrial dilation and heart failure among 100 patients with asymptomatic
      severe aortic stenosis. Participants undergo echocardiographic evaluation for diastolic heart
      failure and we assess myocardial fibrosis using magnetic resonance imaging and exercise
      testing with invasive hemodynamic monitoring (right heart catheterization).

      LA dilatation may potentially identify patients likely benefiting of early surgery. The
      importance and possible implications of LA dilatation in asymptomatic AS patients has however
      not yet been established.

    <description>Differences in functional capacity reflected by atrial size. An incremental maximal exersice test to determine maximal whole-body oxygen uptake (VO2-max) will be performed. On a cycle ergometer VO2 and VCO2 are measured continuously with a breath-by-breath pulmonary exchange system. Following the warm up, the resistance is increased every 2 minutes for 3 bouts, where after the resistance increases every minute (10% increments in VO2-max). The test is terminated 30 seconds after the subjects are unable to maintain 60 revolutions pr. min, but are still able to bike. A horizontal plateau on the oxygen uptake graph demarks the maximal oxygen uptake in liters pr. min. This is divided by their body mass, to obtain maximal oxygen uptake pr. mass unit pr. time unit.</description>
