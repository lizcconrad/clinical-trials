    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the most effective long-term treatment of morbid obesity treatment, so
      you can maintain weight loss enduringly with improvement or resolution of comorbidity and
      mortality reduction. All bariatric surgery techniques in postoperative induce a significant
      reduction in food intake and / or absorption of nutrients and therefore may be associated
      with a risk of nutritional deficiency, which increases over the years after surgery. One of
      the nutrients whose absorption is affected significantly is iron, women of childbearing age
      segment most vulnerable being. A significant percentage of these women require oral
      supplementation with high doses of iron and often parenteral treatment is needed for
      digestive intolerance or therapeutic failure.

      Hypothesis: The liposome orally administered iron could represent a therapeutic alternative
      in women of childbearing age, previously undergone bariatric surgery that currently require
      parenteral iron therapy.

      Objectives: To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of oral iron liposome female patients
      previously undergone bariatric surgery that currently require parenteral replacement therapy,
      as well as the impact on quality of life.

      Methods: a single center, open, prospective, interventional, in 40 women of childbearing age,
      previously undergone bariatric surgery, which currently require intravenous iron therapy
      chronically. Subjects will be divided into 2 parallel groups: 20 cases and 20 controls
      matched for age, level of Hb, year after surgery and percentage of weight lost.

      Relevance: This study will allow us to identify an alternative treatment with oral iron in
      the case of patients with severe iron deficiency after bariatric surgery, which currently
      require parenteral iron therapy due to intolerance to current oral products or therapeutic
      failure. At the same time it could help reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of
      life of these patients, who will not have to enter periodically in solitary day hospital for
      administration of parenteral iron.

      This project is proposed with the aim of exploring the efficacy and tolerability of liposome
      orally administered iron in female patients previously undergone bariatric surgery (gastric
      bypass) currently receiving parenteral iron therapy chronically.

      The hypotheses are:

      (i) .- A significant percentage of patients undergoing bariatric surgery have iron deficiency
      and chronic complication. In the investigators series, approximately 100 women require
      intravenous iron therapy in a chronic (10% of all patients undergoing bariatric surgery to
      date), significantly increasing costs.

      (ii) .- The liposomal form of iron does not depend on gastric pH and increased
      bioavailability is not dependent on the presence of the digestive dudodeno circuit.

      (iii) .- Increased iron absorption and tolerability allow us to remove chronic intravenous
      iron therapy in the case of these patients. Thus, majoraria quality of life by reducing
      healthcare costs and avoiding adverse reactions associated with the procedure.

      Main objective: To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of oral iron liposome female
      patients previously undergone bariatric surgery that currently require parenteral replacement
      therapy for chronic form.

      Secondary objectives:

      (i) .- To evaluate the change in the levels of Hb, ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation at
      4, 12 weeks of treatment.

      (ii) .- Lay the foundation for future study of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery.
