  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single
      ascending doses of LMG324 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in neovascular
      age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) subjects. Enrollment will be expanded at a safe and
      tolerated dose in treatment naïve nvAMD subjects to compare a single intravitreal (IVT) dose
      of LMG324 to ranibizumab 0.5 mg administered every 4 weeks for change from baseline in
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at Week 12 (Day 85).

      The study will start with a single dose ascending (SAD) phase. LMG324 will be administered on
      Day 1 with no further treatment until implementation of standard of care (SoC) therapy. SoC
      therapy is ranibizumab 0.5 mg administered per label. Dose groups will be implemented
      sequentially to allow for safety review between the current and subsequent dose group. All
      treatments will be open-label, including ranibizumab used as SoC therapy.

      In the enrollment expansion phase, subjects randomized to LMG324 arm will receive a single
      LMG324 IVT injection on Day 1 followed by sham (fake) IVT injections until implementation of
      SoC therapy. After implementation, SoC therapy will be applied monthly with sham injections
      applied at the interim planned visits. The enrollment expansion phase may start at a selected
      dose level whilst the dose escalation phase is still ongoing.
