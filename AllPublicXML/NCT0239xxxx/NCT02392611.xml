      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of GS-5829 in adults with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas and in
      combination with exemestane or fulvestrant in adults with estrogen receptor positive breast
      cancer.

    <measure>Incidence of dose limiting toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as a toxicity listed below that is considered possibly related to GS-5829 occurring during the DLT assessment window (Day 1 to 28) in each cohort:
Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia
Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia with fever
Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia
Grade ≥ 2 bleeding
Grade ≥ 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (except Grade 3 nausea or emesis with maximum duration of 48 hours on adequate medical therapy and Grade 3 diarrhea which persists for &lt; 72 hours in the absence of maximal medical therapy)
Grade ≥ 2 non-hematologic treatment-emergent adverse event
Treatment interruption of ≥ 7 days due to unresolved toxicity
Certain laboratory assessments without a clear clinical correlate may be assessed as a DLT (any Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevation in alanine transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) associated with a Grade 2 elevation in bilirubin that is at least possibly related to study drug will be considered a DLT)</description>

    <description>This endpoint will measure the plasma PK profile of GS-5829. PK parameters that will be measured include Cmax, Ctau, AUClast, AUCtau, Tmax, and t1/2.</description>

    <description>Cohorts will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels to receive GS-5829 once daily. Participants in the first 3 cohorts will receive a single dose of GS-5829 and then approximately 7 days later, initiate dosing once daily. Each dose level will enroll 1 participant until a ≥ Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity is observed within the initial dosing period (Day 1 to Day 28). At Dose Level 5 or if a ≥ Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity is observed (whichever occurs first), the dose level will be expanded to 3 participants. Once a dosing level has expanded to 3 participants, a standard 3+3 study design will begin and dose escalation will be performed with cohort sizes of 3 to 6 participants.</description>
