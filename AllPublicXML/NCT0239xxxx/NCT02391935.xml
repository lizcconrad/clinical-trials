  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of RCS-01 injections as
      compared to placebo injections. This study will also measure the impact these injections will
      have on skin markers related to aging through evaluation of gene expression profiles.

      30 participants will be selected for this study based on their health status, current/past
      medications, and ability to adhere to protocol-related requirements. At the first visit and
      after providing informed consent, participants are evaluated against the study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide blood samples for screening assessments (including
      virology). If suitable for study participation, participants will provide a biopsy from the
      scalp from which RCS-01 will be prepared and will have four treatment evaluation sites
      identified on their buttocks, two on each side.

      Study participants will be randomized to one of two treatment subgroups. Participants in the
      RCS-01 Subgroup (n=24) will receive injections of RCS-01 or placebo or a 'sham' injection (a
      needle penetration without injection of liquid). Participants in the the Placebo Subgroup (n=
      6) will be randomized to receive only injections of placebo or sham injections.

      Baseline evaluations of subjects' overall health and skin condition at treatment sites on
      their buttocks will be performed before receipt of injections at Day 0. In addition to
      injections delivered at Day 0, the pre-selected treatment evaluation sites will receive
      intradermal injections of RCS-01 or placebo (cryomedium) or a sham injection four (4) and
      eight (8) weeks after Day 0 according to a randomization schedule for a total of three (3)
      injections per treatment site.

      All participants will return to the clinic for at least 9 visits during the 52-week follow-up
      period to monitor long-term safety. At the 12-week time point, 18 randomly-selected
      participants from the RCS-01 Subgroup will provide biopsies from all injection sites for
      analysis of skin markers related to aging. At the 26-week time point, the remaining
      participants will provide biopsies of all injection sites for histopathological analysis.
