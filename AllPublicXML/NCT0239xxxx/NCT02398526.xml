    <textblock>
      This observational prospective single arm cohort study is designed to assess pain and bone
      pain related quality of life of metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
      patients receiving Radium-223 in a real life nuclear medicine practice setting. In addition,
      overall survival, time to next tumor treatment (TTNT), time to first symptomatic skeletal
      event (SSE), course of blood counts, and safety will be assessed.
