    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients
      undergoing CPR for cardiac arrest in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four academic
      teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran from June 1 to October 31, 2014. The intervention and
      control groups were labeled group 1 and 2 respectively. The assessment tool was scored by the
      principle investigator and an ICU nurse. The data analyzer was blinded to group randomization
      and was not present during CPR.

    <textblock>
      Effective chest compression remains the cornerstone of successful CPR and is vital for
      survival and good neurological recovery. Proper compression force and depth is important to
      minimize CPR-associated injuries. A number of CPR-adjunct devices have been developed to
      improve the consistency and quality of manual chest compressions. The investigators sought to
      determine if the addition of a CPR feedback device to routine manual CPR would impact the
      quality and consistency of CPR and patient survival. The investigators conducted a
      randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients undergoing CPR for cardiac arrest in
      the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four academic teaching hospitals. Patients were randomized
      to receive either standard manual CPR or CPR using the Cardio First Angel TM CPR feedback
      device. Recorded variables included return of spontaneous circulation, adherence to CPR
      guidelines and quality of CPR, nurse satisfaction and CPR associated morbidity.

    <description>The investigator have two groups: intervention and control group. In the control group, the CPR procedure was done based on the routine procedure but in the intervention group, the CPR procedure was done based on the defined protocol by using the cardio first angle device.</description>

    <description>Patients in the intervention group received CPR in accordance to published guidelines using the CFA device per manufacturer instructions. The Cardio First Angel TM (InotechGruppe, Nubberg, Germany) is a lightweight device that consists of three components . Application of400 ± 30 Newtons of force (41 kg or 90 lb of pressure), which correlates toa sternum compression depth of 50-60 mm, is followed by an audible &quot;click&quot; sound to alert the rescuer to cease compression. The &quot;click&quot; sound is also audible upon spring decompression alerting the rescuer to resume compression. When used properly rescuers may deliver approximately 100-120 compressions per minute. The device functions purely mechanically and does not require electrical power supply.</description>
