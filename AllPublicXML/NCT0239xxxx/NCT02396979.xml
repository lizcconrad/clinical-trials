    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative impact a medical drug (methadone) or
      behavioral counseling program (Holistic Health Recovery Program) or both (methadone and
      Holistic Health Recovery Program) has on reducing HIV-related risk behaviors and illicit drug
      use among opioid-dependent, HIV-infected individuals in prison when given 90 to 180 days
      prior to leaving prison.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV Risk Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in HIV Risk Events at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the number of HIV high risk events. This outcome will be constructed from a composite measure counting the number of unprotected vaginal and anal insertive events and needle-or-syringe-sharing events with an HIV- or HIV-status-unknown partner that might result in HIV transmission to an uninfected partner. As such, the primary outcome will be the number of high-risk events during the period of observation in the intervention. All data will be self-reported by the participant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in HIV Quality of Life at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by a series of questions that will be used to produce a composite score that will indicate the participant's overall quality of life as it relates to their HIV status. These questions will ask about your general health and your ability to perform daily activities in your life. All data will be self-reported by the participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse to Drug Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Relapse to Drug Use at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured as any opioid drug use after release from prison. This outcome will be measured in two ways. First, participants will provide a monthly urine sample that will be tested for the presence of opioids. Second, participants will answer questions about their drug use since the time of their last interview.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Addiction Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Addiction Severity at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by a series of questions about the participant's drug use. These questions will be used to produce a composite score which indicates the severity of the participant's addiction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reincarceration</measure>
    <time_frame>Any reincarceration to prison during the 12 month post-release follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by both self-report and objective data from the Malaysian Ministry of Prisons. Self-report questions will be used to ask participants if they have been arrested by police (placed in jail) or incarcerated in prison during the time since the last interview. Objective data will also be obtained from the Ministry of Prisons which will indicate if the participant has been reincarcerated in one of Malaysia's prison during the 12 months since they were initially released from prison.</description>
