  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mainstay of control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) is school-based deworming but
      recent modelling has highlights that in all but low very transmission settings, the treatment
      of school-aged children is unlikely to interrupt transmission, and that new treatment
      strategies are required. This study seeks to answer the question: is it possible to interrupt
      the transmission of STH and if so, what is the most cost-effective treatment strategy and
      delivery system to achieve this goal? In this study, two paired community cluster randomised
      trials in different settings in Kenya will evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of
      annual school-based deworming, annual community-based deworming, and biannual community-based
      deworming. The interventions are (i) annual mass anthelmintic treatment delivered either to
      pre-school and school-aged children, as part of a national school-based deworming programme,
      or to the entire community delivered by community health workers. The primary outcome measure
      is the prevalence of hookworm infection (the most common STH species), assessed by periodic
      cross-sectional, age-stratified parasitological surveys. Secondary outcomes include intensity
      of hookworm, prevalence and intensity of Ascaris lumbricoides, treatment coverage, and among
      a randomly selected sub-sample of participants who will be followed longitudinally, worm
      burden and proportion of eggs unfertilised. A nested process evaluation, using
      semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and a stakeholder analysis will
      investigate the community acceptability, feasibility given the local and regional health
      system structures and processes, and scale-up of the interventions.

      The study will be conducted in two settings of Kenya that have contrasting epidemiological
      and programmatic characteristics, Kwale County on the south Kenyan coast and Bungoma County
      in western Kenya. Allocation to study group will be by cluster, using predefined units used
      in public health provision - termed Community Units (CUs), which comprise approximately 1,000
      households or 5,000 people. CUs will be randomized to one of three groups, receiving either
      (i) annual school-based deworming; (ii) annual community-based deworming; (iii) biannual
      community-based deworming. In nine CUs, a longitudinal study will be conducted in order to
      better understand the transmission dynamics of STH.

    <description>The prevalence of hookworm will be measured in a final age-stratified, community cross-sectional survey, which will be conducted approximately 24 months after the start of the intervention. Selected individuals will be asked to provide a stool sample which will be examined in duplicate and within one hour of preparation using the Kato-Katz method. Parasite prevalence will be defined as the proportion of slides that are positive for hookworm eggs. A baseline survey will be conducted prior to implementing the intervention and an interim survey conducted at 12 months. In a random subset of individuals, additional confirmatory diagnosis of infection will be based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</description>

    <description>The intensity of STH species will be measured in a final age-stratified, community cross-sectional survey, which will be conducted approximately 24 months after the start of the intervention. Selected individuals will be asked to provide a stool sample which will be examined in duplicate and within one hour of preparation using the Kato-Katz method. Intensity of infection will be quantified as eggs per gram of faeces.

    <description>â€¢ Treatment coverage will be measured using both routine data, and data collected during scheduled STH stool surveys. Teachers and community health workers (CHWs) will be provided with treatment registers and asked to provide a full record of all individuals who have received treatment. To augment these data, population-based coverage surveys using multistage clustering sampling will be carried out among a random subsample of communities.</description>
