      This study is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of MTC896 Gel in
      subjects with acne. In this study, MTC896 Gel will be applied at 3 concentrations, twice
      daily (bid) for 12 weeks and compared against a vehicle control.

               -  At least 20 inflammatory lesions,

               -  At least 20 noninflammatory lesions,

               -  ≤ 2 nodular lesions, and

               -  Investigator Global Assessment of 2 or greater;

          4. Is willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol;

          5. If female and of child-bearing potential or premenarcheal, has a negative urine

             contraception during the study and for 30 days after the last study medication
             application. Females are considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically
             sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation), diagnosed as
             infertile, or are postmenopausal for at least 1 year; (Acceptable methods of birth
             control are defined as: abstinence, oral contraceptives, contraceptive
             patches/implants, Depo-Provera®, double barrier methods (e.g. condom and spermicide)
             or an intrauterine device (IUD). Birth control method must have been stable/unchanged
             for 12 weeks prior to Baseline and must remain unchanged during study participation);

          6. If male, has been vasectomized or agrees to use an accepted method of birth control
             with female partner during study participation and for 30 days after the last study
             medication application;

          7. Is in good health and free from any disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would put the subject at risk if participating in the study;

          8. Is free of any systemic or dermatologic disorder, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase the risk of adverse
             events;

          9. Is willing to abstain from using any facial treatment products on the face during the
             study (continued use of make-up is permitted but may not be changed within 2 weeks

         12. Is willing to refrain from using any treatments, other than the study medication,
             including antibiotics, for acne present on the face. Topical acne treatments that do
             not have significant or measurable systemic absorption (e.g. benzoyl peroxide,
             salicylic acid) are allowed for treatment of acne of the back, shoulders, and chest
             only.
