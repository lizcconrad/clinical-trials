    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) to
      gemcitabine and cisplatin can help to control metastatic (has spread) or unresectable (cannot
      be removed by surgery) biliary cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be
      studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs
      in 21-day study cycles.

      You will receive all 3 drugs by vein on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle over about 2 hours total.
      You will receive abraxane first, followed by cisplatin, and then gemcitabine.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1 and 8 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At the end of every 3rd cycle (Cycles 3, 6, 9, and so on), you will have MRI or CT scans. If
      the disease appears to get better, you will have another scan about 3 cycles later.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the last scan during long-term follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 10 days after you stop taking the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you have not had one in the last 4 weeks, you will have MRI or CT scans.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your last dose of the study drugs, the study staff will ask about any
      symptoms or side effects you may be having, either by phone or during a routine clinic visit.
      If you are called, it should last about 15-30 minutes.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      About every 12 weeks after the end-of-treatment visit, if you leave the study for any reason
      other than the disease getting worse, you will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of
      the disease. If you start receiving other anti-cancer treatment, you will stop having these
      scans.

      The study staff will also review your medical records and/or call you to check the status of
      the disease every 3 months after you stop receiving the study drugs. If you are called, it
      should take about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Abraxane is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of melanoma, breast, pancreatic, and lung cancer. The use of abraxane in patients
      with biliary cancer is considered investigational.

      Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of ovarian, biliary,
      and pancreatic cancer. Cisplatin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment
      of osteosarcoma, lung cancer, biliary cancer, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 50 will take part at
      MD Anderson.

          6. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test in women with childbearing potential (WOCBP)
             defined as not post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization,
             within one week prior to initiation of treatment. WOCBP must be using an adequate
             method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks
             after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy.

          7. A male subject of fathering potential must use an adequate method of contraception to
             avoid conception throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of
             study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. If the partner is pregnant or
             breastfeeding, the subject must use a condom.

          8. Patients must sign an Informed Consent and Authorization indicating that they are

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or greater by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events (CTCAE) 4.0. In CTCAE version 4.0 grade 2 sensory neuropathy is defined as
             &quot;moderate symptoms; limiting instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs)&quot;

          2. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which could compromise
             participation in the study such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6

             uncontrolled infection.

          3. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation.

          4. Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis. Treated brain metastases are
             defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no
