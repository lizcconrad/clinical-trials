        <title>Percent of Self-Test Alternate Site Palm Blood Glucose (BG) Results (From Subjects WITH and WITHOUT Diabetes) Within +/- 15 mg/dL (&lt;75 mg/dL) and Within +/- 15% (&gt;= 75 mg/dL) of Laboratory Glucose Method</title>
        <description>Untrained subject WITH and WITHOUT diabetes self-tested Alternate Site (AST) palm blood using an investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS). BGMS results were compared with subject capillary plasma BG results obtained with a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. YSI Analyzer BG results were used to calculate the percent of BGMS results within +/- 15 mg/dL (&lt; 75 mg/dL YSI capillary plasma) and +/- 15% (&gt;= 75 mg/dL YSI capillary plasma).</description>

The ONYX NEXT BGMS: Untrained Persons WITH and WITHOUT Diabetes Use the ONYX NEXT BGMS (Blood Glucose Monitoring System). Subjects tested capillary fingerstick and palm blood (and study staff tested subject fingerstick blood) using the ONYX NEXT BGMS. All BG results were compared to reference method results obtained with subject capillary plasma.</description>
