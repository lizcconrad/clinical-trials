  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Fecal Microbiota Transplant
      (FMT) for treating patients with mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Even with the
      expanding choices of medication for UC, physicians and patients are still in search of highly
      effective and safe medications with minimal side effects. FMT has been approved for the
      treatment of a bacterial infection called Clostridium difficile. In this setting, FMT has
      been proven to be an effective and safe alternative therapy with zero reported serious
      adverse events from patients that have had this treatment.

      The providers that are conducting this study hypothesize that delivering microbes from a
      healthy human gut can help treat the damages caused by UC. This is done by &quot;transplanting&quot;
      fecal material, which contains a highly complex and dense community of healthy microbes,
      including bacteria, fungi and viruses. This collection of microbes is referred to as a
      microbiome. Preliminary studies suggest that alteration of the microbiome can help treat UC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women 18-75 years of age.

          -  Established diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) with known involvement of the left
             colon

          -  Mild to moderate disease defined as endoscopic evidence of disease with Mayo
             endoscopic sub-score 1 or 2 and total MAYO score ranging from 4-10. (The Mayo score
             ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. This score can
             be used for both initial evaluation and monitoring treatment response).

          -  Patients may be on any class of IBD-related medication (excluding steroids)

          -  Patients must be on stable medication regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign informed consent document

          -  Patients with severe, refractory disease (defined as Mayo scores of &gt; 10, or
             endoscopic disease activity score of &gt; 3) or patients with any other significant
             condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound or interfere with
