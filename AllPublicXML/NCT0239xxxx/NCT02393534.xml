  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors frequently speak with their patients over the telephone. Having a visit with a doctor
      over the telephone rather than face-to-face can be convenient for patients and allow them to
      save time and money on transportation and missed time from work. However, some patients may
      prefer seeing the doctor in person. In this study, we will study two groups of patients -
      some who have their visits with their doctor over the telephone and some who have them
      face-to-face. Using surveys and interviews, we will study if the groups differ in their
      satisfaction with their visit with their doctor after participating in the study for 6
      months. We will also look at doctor satisfaction with telephone visits, use of clinic
      resources and if patients received recommended care such as laboratory tests and vaccines
      during the study period.

      This two arm randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effect of telephone follow-up
      versus standard in-person follow-up (usual care) on patient satisfaction among a sample of
      360 primary care patients followed at the Gouverneur Ambulatory Care Practice. All primary
      care patients will be considered eligible at the outset. Providers will determine patient's
      study eligibility at the baseline visit based on the ability to safely follow-up the
      patient's health issue over the telephone in subsequent visits. Eligible patients that are
      randomized to the telephone follow-up arm will have their next medical visit with their
      primary care provider via a telephone call. Eligible patients that are randomized to the
      usual care arm will have a standard in-person clinic visit with their primary care provider.
      In both study arms, the timing and frequency of follow-up appointments will be determined by
      the patient's primary care provider. Regardless of group assignment, outcomes will be
      assessed at the baseline and 6-month study visit.

    <description>Patient satisfaction assessed with the CG-CAHPS questionnaire. For the purposes of this study we will only use measures related to provider ratings and communication . Semi-structured in-depth interviews will also be conducted with a subsample of patients in the telephone visit arm to elicit their beliefs on the usefulness and appropriateness of telephone visits for their health care needs as well as suggestions for instituting a telephone visit program, and willingness to participate in future telephone visits.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Provider Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Provider satisfaction will be assessed with a Likert-type scale that assesses satisfaction with the telephone medicine program after 6 months of participation. A focus group will also be conducted to elicit providers' opinions beliefs regarding the logistical, organizational, and administrative barriers to conducting telephone follow-up visits, usefulness/suitability of telephone visit to address patient concerns, disadvantages and advantages of using telephone visits, opinions on which patients benefit the most from the service, suggestions for improving the process.</description>

    <measure>Patient receipt of medical recommendations</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Electronic medical records (EMR) will be reviewed to collect data on patient's comorbid conditions, receipt of chronic disease management measures (i.e., blood pressure checks, HbA1c levels), and clinic appointment attendance (i.e., number of visits scheduled with the provider but not attended during the 6-month study period divided by the total number of visits scheduled). Documentation of the receipt of chronic disease management measures (e.g. whether or not patient had recommended blood tests performed) will be used as a proxy for patient adherence.</description>
