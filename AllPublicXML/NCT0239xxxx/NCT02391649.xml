      This proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of a problem-solving
      based bibliotherapy program (PSBBP) for Chinese family caregivers in schizophrenia spectrum
      disorders. A repeated-measures, three-group design will be used to evaluate and compare the
      effects between two treatment groups(PSBBP and psycho-education group) and routine outpatient
      service and family support (control group) for 129 randomly selected family caregivers of
      outpatients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders over a 12-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family caregivers of people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders are confronted by a various
      physical, psychosocial and financial hardships. This can adversely affect family members'
      caregiving experiences, psychological distress, general well-being, and family relationships
      or emotional involvement, which in turn may contribute to a greater risk of patient relapse
      and non-recovery. While family psycho-education and mutual support groups are effective in
      reducing caregivers' burden of care, these approaches usually require regular meetings and
      encounter difficulties in extensive training of group leaders/facilitators and engaging
      participants to actively share their caregiving experiences due to time inconvenience and
      fear/inability of expression of feelings. By virtue of the above, an alternate model of
      self-help program in book form named bibliotherapy, which is a guided reading and
      self-practice program with problem-solving training facilitated by a psychiatric nurse, has
      recently demonstrated evidences in clinical trials for families of depressive and psychotic
      patients by the research team, and other researchers.

      This proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of a problem-solving
      based bibliotherapy program (PSBBP) for Chinese family caregivers in schizophrenia spectrum
      disorders. A repeated-measures, three-group design will be used to evaluate and compare the
      effects between two treatment groups(PSBBP and psycho-education group) and routine outpatient
      service and family support (control group) for 129 randomly selected family caregivers of
      outpatients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders over a 12-month follow-up. Primary outcomes
      include caregivers' burden of care, caregiving experiences and coping and social
      problem-solving skills using validated instruments. Secondary outcomes are patients' mental
      state, functioning, perceived expressed emotion, and re-hospitalization rate. They will be
      measured at recruitment, one week, and 6 and 12 months following the interventions. It is
      hypothesized that the PSBBP participants will produce significantly better improvements in
      caregivers' perceived burden, caregiving experience and coping and problem-solving skills
      than those in psycho-education and control groups over 12-month follow-up.

      Focus group interviews will be conducted after the first post-test with 20 caregivers (10
      participants per group) in both treatment groups. Their data will be content analyzed to
      identify their perceived benefits, limitations and difficulties encountered and therapeutic
      ingredients of the two programs.
