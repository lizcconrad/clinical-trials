  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators long term-goal is to help YMCA programs across the nation successfully
      acheive the Y of USA &quot;Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Standards&quot;. Our objective here is
      threefold. First, the investigators will work with South Carolina YMCA leadership to achieve
      the &quot;Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Standards&quot; and implement our HEPA Strategies in
      YMCA programs across the state, evaluate the uptake of and adherence to the standards and
      strategies, and identify factors that influence their implementation. Second, the
      investigators will evaluate the impact of acheiving the standards on children's MVPA and the
      serving and consumption of FV and water during the programs. Third, the investigators will
      evaluate the costs associated with and the cost-effectiveness of meeting the standards in
      terms of improvements in activity and healthy eating.

      The investigators research team developed a conceptual framework that identifies critical
      modifiable levers within Out of School Time programs that can be altered and/or strengthened
      to reach policy or standards goals. These include the policy environment at the national,
      state and local levels; characteristics of the individual site, program leadership, staff,
      and children; and existing outside organizational partnerships. This framework was informed
      by complex systems change, social ecology, systemic capacity building , and the literature on
      the impact of public health policy that identifies key elements of the system to be targeted
      as well as possible influences on those elements.

      Viewing OST programs as complex systems, &quot;Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Standards&quot;
      represent one of many leverage points within a system. Existing efforts to implement
      standards rest solely upon the voluntary adoption of the standards, with little to no other
      changes to the OST program setting. It is clear from our preliminary work and comprehensive
      reviews that OST programs are falling short of meeting goals set forth in the standards.
