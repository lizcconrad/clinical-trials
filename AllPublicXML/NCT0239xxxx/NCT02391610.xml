      The China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS) was set up to examine the delayed, cumulative and
      interactive effects of maternal environmental exposures on birth outcomes and children's
      development. The C-ABCS recruited pregnant women from six major cities of Anhui province,
      China, between November 2008 and October 2010. A range of data (including demographic,
      obstetric, occupational, nutritional and psychosocial factors) were collected by both
      interviews and laboratory tests. In each trimester, women's blood samples were drawn, and
      pregnancy complications were abstracted from physician's medical records. By the end of 2011,
      birth outcomes/birth defects were observed/identified by clinicians within 12 months after
      the delivery of 11 421 singleton live births of six cities and those outcomes among the
      remaining 2033 live births are still being observed. In addition, 4668 children from
      Ma'anshan city will be further followed up during the pre-school period till they reach
      adolescence to obtain the data on familial environmental exposures as well as children's
      physical, psychological, behavioural and sexual development. The interview data and
      information on laboratory examinations are available on request from archives in the Anhui
      Provincial Key Laboratory of Population Health &amp; Aristogenics.

        The China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS) is a prospective population-based cohort study
        that recruited 16766 pregnant women from six major cities of Anhui province in China
        between November 2008 and October 2010. Six cities were selected for study sites, including
        Hefei, Ma'anshan, Wuhu, Jieshou, Lu'an and Ningguo. Anhui province is located in the
        south-east of China. Its socio-economic development is ranked at the mid-level in China.
        Six cities were selected according to their social and geographic characteristics. These
        cities are located in Central, Southern and Northern regions of Anhui Province and may
        represent socio-economic, geographic and cultural variations. In addition, strong local
        support was one of the important factors to consider in selecting these cities.
