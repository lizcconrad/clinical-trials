        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The included volunteer is a researcher within parasitology with main focus on
             Trichuris trichiura and Trichiura suis. He planned to infect himself and contacted our
             department with the purpose of being monitored during this infection for safety
             (medical supervision) and research reasons. The only clinical criterion for his
             inclusion in the study was that he was healthy.
