    <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients who had at least one post-baseline overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during study conduct according to the criteria defined by the Lugano Classification, 2014 and assessed by CT/MRI/PET-CT. The primary efficacy overall response assessment was based on investigator assessment of response.</description>

          <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients who had at least one post-baseline overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during study conduct according to the criteria defined by the Lugano Classification, 2014 and assessed by CT/MRI/PET-CT. The overall response assessment for this outcome measure was based on central imaging review.</description>
