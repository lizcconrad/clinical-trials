  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to perform a prospective randomized study and compare the incidence
      of surgical wound infection between mastectomy wounds irrigated with triple antibiotic
      solution (one side) and 0.05% CHG (opposite side) in patients undergoing bilateral breast
      reconstruction. Each patient will receive triple antibiotic solution on one breast and the
      CHG on the other breast.

      Breast reconstruction with tissue expender (TE) remains the gold standard of breast
      restoration after mastectomy. During the first stage of reconstruction, a TE is placed under
      chest muscles and slowly inflated postoperatively over the period of several weeks. After
      desired volume of TE is achieved it is exchanged for permanent breast prosthesis during
      another surgery (second stage of reconstruction). Postoperative wound infection after
      placement of TE can lead to devastating consequences both for patients and a surgeon.
      Frequently, surgical site infection requires additional surgeries and resulting in the
      removal of TE and long term IV antibiotic therapy. Therefore, during breast reconstruction
      procedures all possible measures are implemented to reduce postoperative infection rate.
      Several studies demonstrated that intra-operative irrigation of surgical wounds with
      antibiotic containing solution before insertion of breast TE decreases postoperative
      infection rate. This approach is currently adopted as a standard of care within plastic
      surgery clinical community.

      The investigators intend to perform a prospective randomized study and compare the incidence
      of surgical wound infection between mastectomy wounds irrigated with triple antibiotic
      solution (one side) and 0.05% CHG (opposite side) in patients undergoing bilateral breast
      reconstruction.
