  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system is influenced by the commensal microbes that live in the gut and on the
      skin. This study aims to characterize the microbiota of subjects with autoimmune disease in
      order to determine whether certain microbial species may cause or worsen immune-mediated
      diseases

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a combination of a defined pilot microbiome study as well as exploratory mechanistic
      research with candidate commensals identified based on known structures accessible in public
      databases. In the observational prospective two-center study, subjects will be followed for 8
      weeks. The study will consist of a total of 3 study visits (0, 4 and 8 weeks). Screening and
      baseline visits (week 0) will take place at the same time. A study window period of +/- 7
      days will be allowed for follow-up study visits. The mechanistic in vitro research with
      subjects' blood cells and candidate commensals will typically require between 2-4 visits for
      sampling, but will not be limited by the frequency of visits.
