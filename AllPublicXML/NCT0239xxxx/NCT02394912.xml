  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the LUMIFI with Crux
      VCF System for deployment of the Crux VCF. The study will compare the method of Crux VCF
      deployment using the LUMIFI with Crux VCF System (IVUS guidance) with the historical results
      of the Crux VCF System (fluoroscopic guidance). The study will include enrollment into a roll
      in phase consisting of 2 study subjects per site prior to enrollment into the primary
      treatment phase for primary analyses. The purpose of the roll in phase is to assure
      compliance with site training on the use of the investigational device and protocol workflow.

    <description>Technical success of filter placement is defined as the primary deployment of the filter such that the investigator judges the location to be suitable to provide sufficient mechanical protection against pulmonary embolism (PE). Technical success rate is the proportion of successful deployments relative to the number of overall attempts in non roll-in subjects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &gt;18 years of age.

          2. Patient or their legally authorized representative understands the research nature of
             the study and is willing and capable of providing informed consent

          3. Patient has appropriate femoral vein access

          4. Patient at risk for PE and meets at least one of the following sets of conditions:

             a. Documented DVT or PE and: i. Inability to anticoagulate the patient due to risk of
             bleeding such as recent surgery, trauma, intracranial bleed, GI bleed, OR ii.
             Progression/recurrence of DVT or PE on therapeutic anticoagulation, OR iii. Inability
             to anticoagulate due to high risk of tumor bleeding, OR iv. Patient unable to safely
             comply with anticoagulation, OR v. Patient that needs interruption of therapeutic
             anticoagulation such as at the time of an operation or other procedure.

             b. Patient that is high risk for DVT or PE and cannot be safely anticoagulated such as
             severe multi-trauma patient or patient having procedure with high risk for
             thromboembolism such as bariatric surgery.

             c. Patients with DVT at high risk for PE and free floating iliac or caval thrombosis
             d. Patients with compromised cardiopulmonary reserve from existing PE with right heart
             failure/strain who could not tolerate any further insult from new PE

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has any one of the following conditions:

               1. Thrombus in the iliac veins or the IVC that precludes access to appropriate
                  placement of the Crux Filter

               2. Known inadequate venous anatomy to allow insertion or retrieval of the filter
                  from the IVC

               3. Known duplicated or left-sided IVC

               4. Known IVC transverse diameter at target lower renal ostia &gt; 28mm or &lt; 17mm

               5. Known extrinsic compression from abdominal or pelvic mass

               6. Known tumor thrombus involving the central venous system

               7. Uncontrolled sepsis, infection or persistent bacteremia

               8. Patient is at risk for septic pulmonary embolism

               9. Patient has an existing implanted filter in the IVC or superior vena cava (SVC)
                  or underwent filter retrieval in previous 60 days.

              10. Patient has uncontrollable or active coagulopathy or known uncorrectable bleeding
                  diathesis

              11. Patient has a condition that inhibits radiographic visualization of the IVC for
                  post-deployment assessment

          2. Patient has a known allergy or intolerance to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or
             Nitinol (nickel-titanium)

          3. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol

             cannot be pre-medicated

          5. Female patient of childbearing potential who is pregnant (she must have negative
             pregnancy test within the 48 hours prior to implantation and any retrieval procedure)

          6. Patient is participating in another device or drug clinical trial or has participated

          7. Investigator considers patient to be a poor candidate for the study or believes that
             the patient may compromise the study, e.g., concomitant conditions (reasons will be
