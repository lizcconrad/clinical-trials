      Multicentre, prospective study, aiming to assess the effect on sexuality of an information
      and education program in women with spinal cord injury.

      Included patients will be women hospitalized for initial rehabilitation, and will be included
      two weeks before their first return to home.

      Socio-demographic data, diagnosis and etiology, secondary conditions, treatment,
      comorbidities and expectations towards rehabilitation care will be assessed at inclusion.

      At M3 Patients will be randomized in either the intervention arm or the control arm.

      Patients enrolled in the intervention arm will benefit from a standardised information and
      education consultation on physiology of sexual response 6 months after their return home.

      Patients enrolled in the control arm will undergo the same follow-up but will only have the
      usual unstructured and unformalized information provided by the clinical team.

      At M3, M6, M12 secondary conditions , sexual function index (FSFI), social integration (LHS),
      treatment and expectations towards rehabilitation care will be assessed
