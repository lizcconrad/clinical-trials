      Study objective: To assess the nocturnal changes in mechanosensitivity and chemosensitivity
      in hypertensive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) patients and in SAHS patients with
      isolated nocturnal hypertension. To value the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      effect on these parameters.

      Design: Controlled cross-over longitudinal study. Settings: Madrid metropolitan area.
      Patients: Day-night sustained hypertensive and isolated nocturnal hypertensive patients with
      SAHS without previous treatment. At least 30 patients are needed.

      Interventions: Patients will allocate in each treatment arm (CPAP vs. sham CPAP) during three
      months. Explorations will perform before and immediately after sleep at 0-, 3-, and 6-months
      of trial.

      Measurements: 24-h urinary catecholamine, local vascular factors, angiotensin and aldosterone
      levels. Diaphragmatic tension-time index, metabolic rate, hypoxic withdrawal test, and
      ventilatory and inspiratory neural drive responses to progressive isocapnic hypoxia.
