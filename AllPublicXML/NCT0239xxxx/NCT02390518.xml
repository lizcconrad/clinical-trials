    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation trial. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose of radiation received during stereotactic radiosurgery in patients
      with brain metastases who have never received radiation to the brain before.

    <description>Patients with 1 to 5 brain metastases will be treated. Patients will be assigned to one of four cohorts based on the size of their brain lesions. For each patient, a single lesion will be treated at experimental dose level, other metastases (if present) will receive standard SRS doses.
Dose Level 1 Dose Level 2 Dose Level 3 Dose Level 4 Cohort 1a Diameter: ≤ 10 mm Volume: ≤ 0.5236 cm3 26 Gy 28 Gy 30 Gy n/a Cohort 1b Diameter: 11-20 mm Volume: 0.5237-4.1888 cm3 26 Gy 28 Gy 30 Gy n/a Cohort 2 Diameter: 21-30 mm Volume: 4.1889-14.1372 cm3 20 Gy 22 Gy 24 Gy n/a Cohort 3 Diameter: 31-40 mm Volume: 14.1373-33.5103 cm3 17 Gy 19 Gy 21 Gy 23 Gy
Dose Escalation A non-standard 5+4 design will be used for the dose escalation. For each cohort, an initial group of 5 patients will be accrued at dose level 1 and receive experimental treatment to one of their lesions.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically confirmed brain metastases by CT or MRI criteria. If there is evidence of
             extra-cranial metastatic disease, it is preferable that the lesions be pathologically
             confirmed (see section 4.2.5 for excluded histologies) and reviewed by a University of
             Utah or Huntsman Cancer Hospital pathologist if the initial review was done at an
             outside facility.

          -  Prior brain surgery is allowed, although a lesion situated in the operative bed would
             not be selected to receive an experimental dose of SRS treatment. SRS should be
             delivered 4-6 weeks post-surgery if the patient had a craniotomy for resection of a
             lesion. Enrollment of a patient with the goal of performing SRS outside of the 4-6
             post-craniotomy window is at the PI's discretion.

          -  Patients must have 1-5 brain metastases total.

          -  Equivalent tumor diameter ≤ 40 mm by CT or MRI measurement at the time of
             consultation/screening (for each metastatic lesion present in the brain).

          -  All metastatic lesions must be separated by a minimum of 3 cm as measured from the
             peripheral edges of the lesions which are in closest proximity to one another. If
             multiple lesions are present and are not all ≥ 3 cm away from each other, the patient
             will be deemed ineligible.

          -  Prior systemic therapy is allowed, although appropriate washout is required for
             patients who have been on BRAF inhibitors (at least 7 days).

          -  For subjects currently on active systemic cancer therapy, the treating medical
             oncologist should be consulted to ensure proper washout (if appropriate) periods prior
             to SRS.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60.

          -  Able to provide informed consent and have signed an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 10 days of
             study enrollment and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control while
             receiving radiation and for 3 months after radiation. Women of non-childbearing
             potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been
             postmenopausal for &gt;1 year.

          -  Men who are able to father a child must agree to use an acceptable method of birth
             control while receiving radiation, and for 3 months after radiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior whole/partial brain irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery

          -  Brain lesions with an equivalent diameter of &gt; 40 mm in size on MRI imaging at the
             time of consultation/screening for protocol eligibility.

          -  Lesion located in anatomic regions that are not amendable to SRS, including the brain
             stem, optic apparatus, or eloquent cortex

          -  Radiographic or cytologic evidence of leptomeningeal disease

          -  Primary lesion with radiosensitive histology that includes the following: small cell
             carcinoma, germ cell tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Patients with multiple lesions, which by size criteria would be enrolled in a cohort
             which is full at the time of enrollment and the 12 weeks DLT period has not been
             reached.
