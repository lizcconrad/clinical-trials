    <textblock>
      This is a single center cross-sectional imaging study investigating the use of gallium-68
      citrate PET in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who are planning
      to undergo a metastatic tumor biopsy on protocol CC# 125519.

      The study population will consist of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer who are undergoing a metastatic tumor biopsy as part of clinical protocol CC# 125519,
      with evidence of resistance to androgen signaling inhibition.

      The study will involve gallium-68 PET scan obtained at single time point, followed by
      radiographically-guided metastatic tumor biopsy within 14 days of PET scan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer

          -  Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) on LHRH analogue or
             have had prior orchiectomy.

          -  Presence of one or more metastases by standard radiographic scans including
             cross-sectional imaging of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and whole body bone scan that is
             safely accessible to tumor biopsy in the judgment of treating clinician and/or
             Interventional Radiology

          -  Evidence of disease progression by PCWG2 criteria during or within 4 weeks following
             treatment discontinuation with potent androgen signaling inhibitor, including
             abiraterone, enzalutamide, ARN-509, or a combination.

          -  Patients must be either receiving or within 4 weeks of discontinuation of androgen
             signaling inhibitor at the time of PET imaging and tumor biopsy.

          -  Age 18 years or older at the time of study entry

          -  Platelets &gt;75,000/Î¼l and PT or INR and a PTT &lt; 1.5 times the institutional ULN within
             14 days prior to biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intervening systemic therapy between discontinuation of androgen signaling inhibitor
             and planned date of gallium citrate PET.

          -  History of radiation therapy to the target metastatic lesion selected for tumor biopsy

          -  Contra-indication to biopsy including uncontrolled bleeding diathesis.

          -  Active infection within 14 days of study enrollment

          -  Contraindications for MRI (for patients undergoing PET/MR study), including presence
             of pacemaker, aneurysm clip, implanted device, or severe claustrophobia
