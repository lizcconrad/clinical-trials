  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the fate of the roniciclib (study drug) in the
      body in a so called mass-balance study. This means to investigate how the study drug is
      absorbed, distributed, broken down (metabolized) and removed (excreted or eliminated) from
      the body.
