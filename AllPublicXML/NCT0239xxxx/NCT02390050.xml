    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of bexagliflozin in lowering
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Bexagliflozin
      is an orally administered drug for the treatment of T2DM and is classified as a Sodium
      Glucose co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitor. This study will enroll both treatment naive and
      those subjects previously treated with one oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA). Approximately 320
      subjects eligible for randomization will receive bexagliflozin tablets, 5, 10, 20 mg or
      placebo, once daily for 12 weeks in an outpatient setting.

      THR-1442-C-449 is a phase 2b multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose range
      finding study to assess the efficacy and safety of once daily bexagliflozin in either
      treatment- naïve type 2 diabetic subjects or subjects previously treated with one oral
      hypoglycemic agent (OHA). The primary efficacy endpoint will be placebo-adjusted reduction in
      HbA1c, measured after 12 weeks of treatment. Treatment naïve subjects are those who have
      never received prescription anti-diabetic medications or who have received no more than 14
      days of prescription medications for diabetes in the 12 weeks prior to enrollment. The study
      will enroll men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and with HbA1c between 7% and
      8.5% (inclusive) at the screening visit (for subjects who are treatment naïve) or with T2DM
      and with HbA1c between 6.5% and 8.5% (inclusive) at screening visit (for subjects who have
      received one OHA and who are willing and able to undergo a washout period.) Approximately 400
      subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and who consent
      to participate in the study are eligible to be enrolled to complete a 6 to 10 week washout if
      needed and a 2 week run-in period prior to being randomized. Subjects who can adhere to the
      run-in medication dosing schedule (i.e., miss no more than one dosage in 2 weeks) and who
      have HbA1c between 7 and 8.5% at baseline (visit S5) will be eligible for randomization and
      receive investigational product. A 20% screen fail rate is expected by the end of run-in,
      leading to approximately 320 subjects eligible for randomization to receive oral
      bexagliflozin tablets, 5, 10, 20 mg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks in an outpatient
      setting. Subjects who experience hyperglycemia during the study may receive approved
      anti-diabetic medication. Subjects will visit their study site at weeks 2, 6, and 12 for
      safety and efficacy evaluation, with a follow up visit at week 14.

      Measurement of bexagliflozin plasma concentration over time (sparsely sampled) will be
      conducted at 20 centers and will include approximately 240 subjects who consent to
      participate the pharmacokinetics (PK) study. Three samples from each subject will be drawn at
      weeks 2, 6, or 12.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to identify dose(s) for further clinical study through the comparison of HbA1c change from baseline in each active group that will receive bexagliflozin tablets, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg, to the placebo group over 12 weeks of treatment. To examine the dose response, tests for linear and quadratic dose-response relationships between the doses (0 [placebo], 5, 10 and 20 mg bexagliflozin) and the change from baseline in HbA1c at week 12 will be conducted using a general linear model and appropriate orthogonal polynomial contrasts.</description>
