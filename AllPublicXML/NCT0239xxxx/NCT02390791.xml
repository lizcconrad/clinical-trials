      This cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the general effectiveness of the
      intervention (e.g. enhanced myADHDportal.com), compared to control (e.g. treatment as usual
      standard portal), on medication continuity as measured by prescriptions written and other
      more proximal outcomes during the first six months of treatment.
