      The aim of the trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of coronally advanced flap
      (CAF)+connective tissue graft(CTG)+platelet-rich fibrin(PRF) combination in Miller I and II
      recession treatment by comparing with CAF+CTG. 40 patients were surgically treated either
      with CAF+CTG+PRF (test group) or CAF+CTG (control group). Clinical parameters of plaque index
      (PI), gingival index (GI), vertical recession (VR), probing depth (PD), attachment level
      (AL), keratinized tissue width (KTW), horizontal recession (HR), MGJ localization (L-MGJ),
      tissue thickness (TT) were recorded at baseline, 3 months (PS1) and 6 months (PS2)
      post-surgery. Root coverage (RC), complete RC (CRC), attachment gain (AG), and keratinized
      tissue change (KTC) were also calculated.

      Given the encouraging effects of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in healing and regeneration, it
      has been hypothesized that PRF might develop the outcomes obtained with coronally advanced
      flap (CAF)+connective tissue graft(CTG). Therefore, it was aimed to evaluate the
      effectiveness of CAF + CTG + PRF in Miller Class I and II recession defect treatment by
      comparing the outcomes with CAF + CTG in a preliminary, controlled, randomized clinical trial
      (RCT) with a 6-month follow-up. The study was conducted with 40 patients randomly grouped in
      half shares into indicated study groups. After phase I therapy, clinical variables including
      plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), vertical recession (VR), probing depth (PD),
      attachment level (AL), keratinized tissue width (KTW), horizontal recession (HR), MGJ
      localization (L-MGJ), tissue thickness (TT) were recorded. The surgical sites were prepared
      by using sulcular and adjacent vertical incisions and CTGs were harvested from the palatal
      regions. Different from CAF+CTG group, PRF was prepared by obtaining 10 ml venous blood,
      centrifugation and extraction of the gel containing highly concentrated platelet cells in
      CAF+CTG+PRF patients. Then the gel was placed over the exposed root surface in the same
      group. The CAF was primarily closed and postoperative instructions were given. After suture
      removal at second postoperative week, the patients were followed-up by monthly recall visits.
      Same periodontal clinical variables were recorded 3 and 6 months after surgery.

Surgical incisions involving sulcular and adjacent vertical incisions were made and split-full-split flaps were elevated. PRF was prepared from 10 ml venous blood and the gel part was placed under CTG harvested from the palate. Flap was coronally advanced and CTG+PRF was completely closed. Extraoral cold compress and analgesic plus antiinflammatory drugs (Ibuprofen, 100 mg, twice a day) were given for pain and edema control. Toothbrushing in the surgical region was prohibited for 4 weeks; instead, antiseptic solution (Chlorhexidine gluconate) was prescribed.</description>

            <description>A computer-generated randomization scheme (simple randomization without any blocking) was used to assign 20 patients into each study groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. After phase I therapy, the patients were surgically treated with coronally advanced flap (CAF)+connective tissue graft(CTG)+platelet-rich fibrin(PRF). Surgical incisions involving sulcular and adjacent vertical incisions were made and split-full-split flaps were elevated. PRF was prepared from 10 ml venous blood and the gel part was placed under CTG harvested from the palate. Flap was coronally advanced and CTG+PRF was completely closed. Extraoral cold compress and analgesic plus antiinflammatory drugs (Ibuprofen, 100 mg, twice a day) were given for pain and edema control. Toothbrushing in the surgical region was prohibited for 4 weeks; instead, antiseptic solution (Chlorhexidine gluconate) was prescribed.</description>
