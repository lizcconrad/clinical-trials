      The objective of this post approval safety study is to evaluate the incidence of IOL vaulting
      (ie, position change) of the Trulign™ Toric IOL following cataract surgery at up to three
      years post implantation.

    <description>IOL vaulting is position change such as clinically significant anterior vaulting, clinically significant tilt, and secondary surgical intervention related to such vaulting. The proportion of study eyes experiencing vaulting will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        Subjects will be chosen from 30-50 clinical sites in the US. All subjects who meet
        Eligibility Criteria (below) will be consecutively offered enrollment until the site meets
        the maximum number of enrollees.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are able and willing to comply with the follow-up schedule

          -  Subjects must have a clinically documented diagnosis of age-related cataract that is
             considered amenable to treatment with standard phacoemulsification/extracapsular
             cataract extraction

          -  Subjects must require a lens power from 4 to 33 D

          -  Subjects must have a Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) equal to or worse than 20/40,
             with or without a glare source

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any anterior segment pathology in the study eye likely to increase the
             risk of complications from phacoemulsification cataract surgery

          -  Subjects with associated ocular conditions which could affect the stability of the IOL

          -  Subjects with clinically significant irregular corneal astigmatism in the study eye
