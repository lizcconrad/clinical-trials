    <textblock>
      Computed tomography (CT) is the most accurate test for evaluating patients with thoracic
      disease. However, access to CT is limited due to long wait times and for the sickest patients
      in Hospital who cannot be transported from the ward to the CT scanner. The investigators
      propose to modify a standard X-ray unit to provide more detailed information of the chest
      such that a CT scan is not required for all patients.

    <textblock>
      Dual-energy (DE) imaging consists of acquiring paired &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot;-energy x-ray images.
      The use of DE to improve radiological contrast was first described by Jacobson et al in 1958;
      followed by Mistretta et al and Alvarez and Macovski in the mid-1970s. With the advent of new
      digital X-ray detectors that provide high dose efficiency and rapid readout of digital X-ray
      projections, there has been renewed interest in using DE x-ray imaging for lung nodule
      detection. More recently, portable x-ray detectors have made bedside DE imaging possible.
      Jabri et. al. presented a portable DE system with novel respiratory and cardiac gating, and
      Hoggarth et. al. investigated the potential for DE subtraction in improving the visualization
      of lung tumors while performing image-guided radiotherapy.

      The investigators group is experienced in investigating DE for lung nodule detection, this
      theoretical framework was instrumental in optimizing a clinical prototype for
      high-performance DE chest X-ray. It identified optimal DE image acquisition and decomposition
      techniques, and validated the approach in comparison to human observer performance. The
      analysis further demonstrated that - given a high-performance flat plate detector, optimal
      acquisition and decomposition - DE chest X-ray is possible at the same dose as conventional
      computer radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) chest X-ray, while significantly
      improving conspicuity of subtle lung nodules by the reduction of overlying background noise.
      The DE work undertaken by our group is unique in terms of providing a clear theoretical
      framework for optimizing a clinical prototype for best performance in terms of image quality
      and patient exposure to ionizing radiation.
