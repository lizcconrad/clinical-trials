  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After diagnosis of a dementing illness, patients and their spouses have many concerns related
      to the disease and their future. This often leads to poor psychological well-being and
      reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of the family. Support for Empowerment has
      been proven to be an effective method to improve prognosis of asthma, heart failure,
      osteoarthritis.and diabetes. However empowering interventions have not been studied in
      dementia. Therefore, the investigators aim was to examine, in an objective-oriented group
      intervention, the efficacy of empowerment support program (ESP) on the HRQoL of dementia
      patients and their spousal caregivers as well as on the sense of competence and psychological
      well-being of caregivers.

      Methods: During the years 2014 to 15, 180 dementia patients and their spouses will be
      recruited from memory clinics or day centers and randomized into two arms: 90 patients for
      group-based ESP sessions including topics selected by the participants and the use of the by
      us for us guides, 90 patients will serve as controls in usual community care. Sessions may
      include topics on dementia, active lifestyle and prevention for cognitive decline, spousal
      relationship, future planning and emotional well-being. The patients and spouses will have
      their separate group sessions (ten participants per group) once a week for eight weeks.

      Diagnoses and medications are confirmed from medical records provided by the couples.
      Charlson's comorbidity index is calculated to assess the severity and prognostic value of the
      participants' disease burden . Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of the patients is
      assessed by using the 15D instrument Dementia patients are also assessed with the Clinical
      Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Other measurements
      include activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) The
      presence of advance directives, such as a living will, are inquired about. Clinical
      measurements include height, weight, blood pressure and hand grip strength. The spousal
      caregivers are asked questions concerning the impact of their spouse's dementia diagnosis and
      they are assessed by the RAND-36 HRQoL instrument, 12-item General Health Questionnaire
      (GHQ-12) the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) the randomization is
      performed by telephone to a randomization center. Couples are randomly allocated by means of
      computer-generated random numbers. Every randomization result will appear in the program
      after the participants name has been written and the person executing the randomization has
      confirmed the process with her initials. Participating couples are assessed by two study
      nurses three times over nine months: at baseline, three, and nine months. Use of health
      services, institutionalizations and mortality of both patients and caregivers will be
      retrieved from the central registers until 24 months from the baseline measurements.
