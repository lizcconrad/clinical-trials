  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an acquired retinal pathology affecting the central
      region of the retina responsible for discrimination between high spatial frequencies
      (reading), colour vision and the central visual field. The loss of visual acuity which occurs
      with the onset of AMD significantly affects patients' quality of life. In developed
      countries, AMD is the leading cause of vision impairment for people aged over 50 years. Its
      prevalence in Europe in people aged over 65 years is 3.3%. In France, around 2 million people
      suffer from this disease.

      In the first stage of the disease it is known as age-related maculopathy (ARM). This early
      form of the disease can develop into intermediate AMD (stage 3 of the AREDS classification)
      and then advanced AMD (stage 4 AREDS), which can be atrophic or exudative. In cases of
      exudative AMD, the intravitreal administration of anti-VEGF drugs can limit the disease's
      progression.

      It is therefore vital to adopt a strategy to assess the stage of the disease and provide the
      appropriate care management at the earliest possible stage. This is even more important for
      patients with advanced AMD in one eye and intermediate AMD in the fellow eye, as the risk of
      the fellow eye progressing to the advanced stage within 5 years is between 35% and 53%.

      Microperimetry is a promising new diagnostic method which combines measurements of light
      sensitivity, loss of fixation and the anatomy of the retina. It offers a new approach to the
      functional assessment of retinal damage in patients with AMD, as it precisely correlates
      anatomical and functional modifications by measuring the loss of sensitivity and macular
      fixation. It has been shown that the more advanced the patient's AMD is, the further the
      parameters measured by microperimetry are from the norm.

      The investigators want to assess the MAIA™ as a means of screening for AMD progression in
      patients with a high risk of progressing to a more advanced stage (patients presenting one
      eye with advanced AMD and a fellow eye with stage 3 AMD according to the AREDS
      classification). The research hypothesis for our proposed study is that the parameters
      measured using microperimetry will already show abnormal results in the study eye prior to
      progressing to a more advanced stage of the disease. The use of these microperimetric
      parameters as predictor of progression would therefore make it possible to screen eyes likely
      to develop from intermediate to advanced AMD at an earlier stage, and subsequently provide
      patients who need it with earlier follow-up, preventive treatment or adapted, personalized
      rehabilitation as appropriate.
