  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All the studies underlined the high frequency of co-morbid associations in specific learning
      disorders. Understanding the reasons for these associations could enable us to determine the
      cerebral bases that underlie each disorder. Their frequent association suggests the
      etiological bases are partly common, it seems logical to turn to explanatory models of
      various common specific disorders. The model recently proposed by Nicholson &amp; Fawcett (2007)
      suggests a specific disorder of procedural learning. But the brain networks involved in this
      learning could be achieved separately. We intend therefore to study the neural networks
      involved in learning procedural and compare networks recruited among children with specific
      learning disorder alone or in combination (co-morbidity). The children included in the study
      have either a Developmental Dyslexia or a Developmental Coordination Disorder, or both. The
      procedure includes a neuropsychological evaluation and a brain MRI study with a morphological
      and a functional part. During fMRI the child realizes a automated motor task contrasting with
      a task involving learning procedural.

    <description>The level of brain activity obtained by fMRI will be estimated by the blood flow in milliliters per minute using a standardized procedure and validated specific MRI used and managed entirely by dedicated software (SPM8 - Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). The performance adjustment is made in the analysis of the estimated difference in blood flow using a mixed model. Regions of interest are the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the pre motor cortex, the striatum and the cerebellum. These regions will be studied in both hemispheres.</description>

    <description>It will include a first session of about an hour outside MRI for familiarization with the environment of the MRI. The MRI will then be made after a break of 15 minutes
Morphological time: this time include the initial acquisition of a sequence of anatomical 3D T1-weighted high-resolution contiguous axial slices and the imaging of diffusion tensor.
Functional time: The experimental paradigm is a paradigm as a block with alternating phase of motor and rest conditions. The two motor tasks are: a Learning motor sequence or motor sequence task and Automated motor sequence or AT (automated task).</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

        These children presenting either a specific disorder in learning to read (developmental
        dyslexia or DD) type phonological or mixed as defined by World Health Organisation or a
        Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
        IV criteria or the association of both disorders (DCD + DD).

        Or in the control group:

        Children having no neurological or psychiatric disorder, mental retardation with IQ
        (Intelligence quotient) &gt; 70 and DCD (score&gt; 15 percentile on the Movement ABC) and
        Dyslexia (reading delay should not exceed 12 months) The age of children included in the
        study is between 8 and 12 years. The inclusion of subjects from 8 years is justified to
        have an optimal level of cooperation of the child in the MRI, in order to determine the
        status of children for reading and the fact that most of validated neuropsychological tests
        for reading are for the age 8 to 12 years.

        Children and their parents must have given their free and informed consent signed. The
        representative of the child shall be affiliated to a social security scheme.

        The children included in the study will be all right handed.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Mental retardation as defined by DSM IV criteria by an estimated IQ from the Wechsler
        scales less than 70.

        The presence of a Specific Language Impairment (or dysphasia): a score below -2 SD
        (standard deviation) in at least one of three tests for language assessment is a criterion
        for exclusion.

        The presence of a dyslexia-type surface defined by a specific disorder in learning to read
        without difficulty for metaphonological tests and/or an exclusive impairment of the
        addressing reading route (reading irregular words).

        Children regularly practicing a musical instrument conferring a high manual dexterity such
        as piano or guitar.

        Children with neurological or psychiatric disorders as epilepsy for example. Children under
        psychotropic medication such as anticonvulsant. Treatment with methylphenidate is not an
        exclusion criterion but treatment should be discontinued at least 48 hours before
        performing MRI. Children with ADHD according to DSM IV criteria.

        The presence of a cons-indication for a MRI.
