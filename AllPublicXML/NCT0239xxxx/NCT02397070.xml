    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of jaw exercise therapy in the treatment of temporomandibular
      disorder patients (TMD). An eligible group of patients will be treated with that therapy
      (experimental group) and another group will be treated with counseling and occlusal splint
      (control group), considered the standard therapy for TMD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mandibular exercises may have behavioral and cognitive action, educating the patient and
      serving as an instrument of control of parafunctional activity. It is a simple, easy, which
      seeks adherence to treatment and has negligible cost. A disadvantage is the need of
      motivation and discipline of the patient in carrying out the therapy daily. The occlusal
      splints, associated with educational guidance and counseling have world indication the
      possibility of promoting teeth protection, joint decompression, equalization of
      electromyographic activity, conscious control of parafunctional activity and strong placebo
      effect.

    <description>The jaw exercise program will consist of three cycles: 1st CYCLE - simple opening and closing mouth, right and left lateral excursions with mechanisms of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and muscle coordination; 2 ° CYCLE - opening and closing exercises, right and left lateral excursions with a counter-resistance force imposed by the participant, with reciprocal inhibition, stretching, and muscular endurance mechanisms; 3rd CYCLE - specific exercises to disk capture attempt in cases of disk displacement with reduction and acute disk displacement without reduction (mouth opening and closing in protrusion) or chronic disk displacement without reduction (forced mouth opening in order to push the disc), with remodeling articulate mechanisms. The conduct will be individualized according to the need and symptoms of patients, which will be monitored fortnightly. It will be proposed 3 times a day, lasting a minute and a half per turn, in front of the mirror, during three months.</description>

    <description>The occlusal splints will be made from obtaining a plaster type IV model of upper arch using alginate and metal stock tray. A 2mm thick polyacetate blade will be adapted to the vacuum device plasticizer, heated and pressed over the previously cut U-shaped plaster model. After cooling, it will be added the self-curing acrylic resin on occlusal surface in order to increase the vertical dimension of occlusion in 2mm (anterior region). After polishing, the splints will be intraorally adjusted using carbon paper and clamp Muller, and installed obtaining maximum tooth contacts in centric relation. The splints will be flat and of full coverage for night use. Patients will be monitored every two weeks for the occlusal adjustment for three months. It will also be done counseling measures through a printed guide in relation to the daily care and the various contributing factors of TMD (diet, stress reduction, elimination of parafunctions and posture correction).</description>
