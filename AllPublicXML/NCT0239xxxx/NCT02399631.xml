  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An enhanced recovery program has been developed to provide for colon cancer patients faster
      and more personalized postoperative treatment. Most of the previous studies have showed that
      the efficacy of the enhanced recovery program on both subjective and objective physical
      recovery of patients. However, such studies are rarely conducted in South Korea. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a postoperative enhanced
      recovery program in patients who underwent laparoscopic colon cancer surgery at a tertiary
      hospital in Korea.
