      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of EEG biofeedback mental attention-neuromuscular
      training (AT-NMT), neuromuscular training (NMT) alone, EEG biofeedback mental attention
      training (AT) alone, and no intervention for improving reactive balance performance among
      children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD).

      Design: A single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. Sample: 172 children with
      DCD. Interventions: AT-NMT, NMT, AT, or no intervention for 12 weeks. Major outcomes:
      Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. A motor
      control test (MCT) will give a composite latency score, prefrontal cortex EEG recordings
      during MCT will measure the mental attention level, and surface electromyography recordings
      during MCT will indicate the lower limb muscle onset latency.

      Hypothesis: The Investigators hypothesize that the reactive balance performance in children
      with DCD can be best improved by treating both their mental attention and neuromuscular
      deficits.

      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of AT-NMT, NMT alone, AT alone, and no intervention
      for improving reactive balance performance among children with DCD.

      Design: A single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. Sample: 172 children with
      DCD. Interventions: AT-NMT, NMT, AT, or no intervention for 12 weeks. Major outcomes:
      Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. A motor
      control test (MCT) will give a composite latency score, prefrontal cortex EEG recordings
      during MCT will measure the mental attention level, and surface electromyography recordings
      during MCT will indicate the lower limb muscle onset latency.

      Anticipated results and clinical significance: Children with DCD who receive AT-NMT will have
      the best reactive balance performance outcomes. If the results are positive, this novel
      training regime can be readily adopted in clinical practice. AT-NMT will improve overall
      well-being in these children and have positive socio-economic implications such as shorter
      rehabilitation periods and reduced healthcare costs.
