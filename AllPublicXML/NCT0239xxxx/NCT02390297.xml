        Eligibility for this protocol is dependent on prior exposure to a Cal-1 modified
        hematopoietic cellular product. The study population will thus consist of individuals with
        HIV-1 infection, who have met criteria for participation in a Cal-1 phase I/II clinical
        trial and received a dose of Cal-1 modified hematopoietic cells as part of a previous study
