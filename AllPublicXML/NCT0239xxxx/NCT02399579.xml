    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better standardize the symptom recording of cat allergic
      persons under real-life conditions. A new self-assessed, home-based symptom score will be
      tested.

      In order to bring research on cat dander allergy a step further we aim to investigate cat
      dander allergy symptoms and record them in a natural environment, respectively, i.e. at the
      participant's home. For this purpose we aim to test a new self-assessed, homebased symptom
      score (called HypoScore). The participants will perform 8 provocation tests. Every
      provocation test consists of petting the cat until the participants become symptomatic. The
      participants have to pet the cat everytime in the same manner. Directly before and after the
      provocation test the symptoms will be recorded in the eCRF by using an iPad mini.
