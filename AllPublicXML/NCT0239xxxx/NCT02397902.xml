  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of the proposed study is to address the efficacy of conventional full-fat
      dairy products as part of the normal routine diet for improving vascular function and
      reducing blood pressure in middle-aged and older adults with elevated blood pressure. The
      investigators hypothesize that dietary intervention including whole milk and full-fat milk
      products will induce significant decreases in systolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness.
      The investigators also test the hypothesis that the reductions in blood pressure will be
      associated with the corresponding decreases in arterial stiffness and/or increases in
      endothelial vasodilatory function as well as improvements in arterial baroreflex sensitivity.
      If our hypotheses are supported by the results, the information could be used as a basis for
      recommendations for the use of whole milk and full-fat milk products in the secondary
      prevention of elevated blood pressure and vascular dysfunction.
