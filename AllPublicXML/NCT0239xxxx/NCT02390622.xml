  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the major sources of nosocomial
      infection. Along with the widely application of antibiotics around perioperative period, MRSA
      infection is increasing by years.Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT),infusion of fecal
      preparation from a healthy donor into the GI tract of a patient is being proposed as a novel
      therapeutic approach to modulate diseases associated with pathological imbalances within the
      resident microbiota, termed dysbiosis.It has been used to treat intestinal disease such as
      inflammatory bowel diseases and Clostridium difficile infection, but no reports are available
      on its role in treating MRSA enteritis yet. vancomycin is the first choice to treat MRSA but
      can also lead to an increase in antibiotic resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant
      enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and transfer of antibiotic
      resistance genes among the microbial community. So FMT seems a more harmless and reasonable
      measure to treat similar diseases.

      Five cases from July, 2013 to February, 2014 were collected in Jinling hospital.They
      developed unexplained high fever, bloating, nausea, vomit, a high stoma output or diarrhea in
      the color of yellow-green with copious amounts of mucus leading to dehydration and
      tachycardia after short time of operation (2-4d).We got the etiology diagnosis from all the
      patients' gastric juice cultures which revealed MRSA.Vancocin cp had a dissatisfied effect,so
      FMT was supplied for treating MRSA.All the patients had a decreased intestinal flora species
      before FMT and the content of staphylococcus aureus almost reached half of total intestinal
      flora . Patients' gut bacteria after FMT gradually agree with the donors' reflected the
      alleviative symptoms.
