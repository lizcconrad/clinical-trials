  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aim of this study is to analyse contemporary labor patterns by measuring rate of
      dilatation and head descent via transperineal ultrasonography. Labor curves will be generated
      using data regarding rate of dilatation, head-descent obtained via transperineal
      ultrasonography. Factors which are known to effect duration of labor will be taken into
      account.

      Intrapartum sonography is rapidly advancing field in the management of obstetrics labor.
      Traditional approach to labor management consists evaluation of cervical dilatation, head
      position and head descent via digital examinations. Rate of progress is evaluated using data
      of available labor curves. Unsatisfactory progression is either treated with labor
      augmentation or cesarean section depending on the degree and duration of labor retardation.
      Transperineal ultrasonography is able to assess cervical dilatation, fetal head descent and
      head position. Data obtained from analysis of labor via transperineal ultrasonography is not
      available. This research's primary aim is to generate labor curves using data obtained via
      ultrasonographic measurements.

    <description>Women with term pregnancies whose labor started spontaneously. Spontaneous labor is determined by either spontaneous rupture of membranes at term and/or powerful, regular uterine contractions that cause cervical change. Women will be admitted to labor ward after initial assessment via transperineal ultrasonography. Labor augmentation will be performed for women with inadequate uterine contractions, i.e. contractions measuring less than Montevideo units, irregular weak uterine contractions. Analgesia will be provided via administration of 50 mg intramuscular meperidine at 2 hour intervals as required. Amniotomy will be performed for women with adequate cervical dilatation and fetal head-descent. Transperineal ultrasonography will be performed at irregular intervals to assess cervical dilatation, angle of progression and fetal head position. After birth, birth time, birth weight, APGAR scores, degree of perineal trauma, episiotomy use will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Women with term pregnancies who are induced for birth before the onset of spontaneous labor. Labor will be induced with either oxytocin infusion for women with high Bishop score, or labor will be induced with dinoprostone pessary for women requiring cervical ripening, i.e. poor. Women will be admitted to labor ward after initial assessment via transperineal ultrasonography. Analgesia will be provided via administration of 50 mg intramuscular meperidine at 2 hour intervals as required. Amniotomy will be performed for women with adequate cervical dilatation and fetal head-descent. Transperineal ultrasonography will be performed at irregular intervals to assess cervical dilatation, angle of progression and fetal head position. After birth, birth time, birth weight, APGAR scores, degree of perineal trauma, episiotomy use will be recorded.</description>
