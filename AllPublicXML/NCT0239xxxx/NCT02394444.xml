  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the impact of an early psychological intervention,
      Triadic parent-infant Relationship Therapy (TRT), on parenting stress, parental mental
      health, and preterm infant development in the motor, cognitive, emotional and behavioral
      domains at a corrected age of 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to prematurity induced infant-mother separation at birth, sometimes for several weeks,
      and owing to the concerns it generates, preterm birth exposes the parent-child attachment
      link to disturbances, especially the mother-child attachment after discharge. Several
      psychological factors affect infant (distress, dysmaturity ) and parents (psychological
      pain). These can cause lasting parent-child interactions disruption and jeopardize the
      attachment process. These early link distortions may hinder the infant's behavioral-emotional
      and cognitive development. Prematurity psychological consequences may negatively influence
      biomedical risks. Understanding these premature infants' future development modalities and
      support involves taking into account intricate organic and psychological factors - which may
      be combined as well.

      Post-hospital psychological intervention with the family, focusing on parental mental health
      and triadic parent-infant relationship, proves an essential element in these children care,
      whose birth conditions were painful.

    <description>We needed to use a variety of measures because these measures had to be tailored to the child's stage of development. To ensure the relative strength conclusion on the treatment effect, the statistic analyses of test scores each time point were made using bonefferoni correction for multiple comparisons.
Parenting Stress Index ( PSI-SF), &quot;R&quot; interview and Q-sort attachment were tests based on the infant's age at different assessment periods.</description>

    <measure>Change in &quot;Parental Mental Health&quot; assessed by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) scores: assessing level of post-traumatic stress</measure>

    <time_frame>assessments at each time point: at 44 weeks gestational age and at the corrected ages of 3, 9 and18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI and the EPDS are both based on the frequency of depressive symptoms The statistic analyses were used to compare the evolution of all of the other scores over time.
The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were tests that were resorted to enable us to examine and monitor the preterm birth traumatic impact on parental mental health.</description>

    <description>The statistic analyses were used to compare the evolution of all of the other scores over time.
The Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS),the Brunet-Lezine Psychomotor Development Scale and Infant Behavioral Symptom were tests that were complementary and enable us to assess infant's various facets of socio-emotional, motor and cognitive development at different stage of development.</description>

    <description>Parents with premature infants received the intervention called &quot;Triadic parent-infant's Relationship Therapy&quot; (TRT) :
the psychological intervention included home visits twice month during the first four months and then monthly visits in the neonatal ward until the 18 months corrected age resulting in a total of 22 visits during the whole intervention; TRT gave attention to emotional distress and the promotion of parenting skills and attachment security; The three sessions of intervention targeted objectives specific to each child's development; A basic manual was designed to ensure uniformity of the defined themes during each session</description>
