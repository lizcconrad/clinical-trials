  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a well-implemented non-invasive
      diagnostic imaging modality in patients with stable chest pain. Besides conventional
      CT-reading, CCTA is also capable to identify several morphologic and geometric
      characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques. Recently, the investigators showed that the use
      of semi-automated plaque quantification algorithm identified parameters predictive for acute
      coronary syndrome on top of clinical risk profiling and conventional CT-reading. In addition,
      several atherotrombosis biomarkers, like high-sensitivity cardiac troponins, are described as
      related to coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events. Prospective data with
      sequential analysis of atherosclerotic plaques combined with different atherothrombosis
      biomarkers are currently lacking, but will provide important clues about the pathophysiology
      of plaque progression and atherothrombosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a recent history of (a)typical chest pain, who underwent a coronary
             calcium score scan as well as CCTA.

          -  Age older than 18 years and competent to perform written informed consent.

          -  At least 2 coronary segments with plaques:

          -  1 proximal lesion.

          -  At least one coronary plaque consisting of a non-calcified or mixed component.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable angina.

          -  Renal insufficiency: calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;45mL/min.

          -  Iodine allergy.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Known history of atrial fibrillation.

          -  Inconclusive baseline computed coronary CT-angiography.

          -  Patients which are currently on oral vitamin K antagonists.

          -  Patients which are currently using selective anticoagulants.

          -  Previous PCI.

          -  Previous or planned coronary artery bypass grafting.

          -  Patients whereby the baseline CCTA was performed by a retrospective ECG-gated
             'helical' protocol due to a high (&gt;90bpm) or irregular heart rate.
