      Study Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Xihuang Capsules prevention of
      recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy.

      Study Design: The study was A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label, Parallel-Group
      Clinical Trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to Xihuang Capsules group or the control
      group by the proportion of 2: 1.

      The total sample size: 1000 cases. Study Process: The study is divided into three phases: the
      screening phase, treatment phase, follow-up phase.To complete screening in two weeks,
      patients who fit the criteria were randomly assigned to Xihuang Capsules group or the control
      group.In two weeks after hepatectomy, Xihuang Capsules group received Xihuang Capsules
      (2g,bid), Continuously taking to cancer recurrence or death.Control group was not received
      Xihuang Capsules. In the first month to three years after treatment, Conducting visits for
      once every three months,to evaluate the efficacy and safety with hepatocellular carcinoma
      recurrence rate in the three years after hepatectomy as the primary outcome. When entering
      the follow-up phase, Keeping in touch with patients withdrew from the study for a clinic or
      telephone follow-up every three months.

      From signing informed consent till the end of the study, inspecting the adverse events and
      concomitant medications for all subjects in each visit.

    <description>Diagnostic criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence: refer to Chinese Anti-Cancer Association Professional Committee of hepatocellular carcinoma developed diagnostic criteria for primary hepatocellular carcinoma belong to Guangzhou standard in 2001. Once new or suspected place nature lesions within liver were found by B-ultrasonography examination,we should do CT, MRI or PET-CT review, in order to confirm the diagnosis. If imaging is positive, diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma(dominant) recurrence after treatment; if imaging is negative, but AFP values&gt; 400μg/L or ongoing elevated AFP values, diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma occult recurrence after treatment.</description>

    <description>Using Karnofsky-Performance-Status score:
Evaluation Methods: Comparison of symptom scores before and after the treatment.
Markedly: increasing by more than 20 points after treatment compared to before treatment; Effective: increasing by more than 10 points after treatment compared to before treatment; Stable: increasing by less than 10 points or no change after treatment compared to before treatment; Invalid: decrease after treatment than before treatment.</description>

Evaluation methods: comparison of symptom total integral before and after the treatment (before treatment / after treatment) Markedly: symptom disappeared, or symptom integral reduce ≥ 2/3; Effective: symptom alleviative, integral is reduced≥1/3，≤2/3; Invalid: symptom is not alleviated or reduced＜1/3.</description>
