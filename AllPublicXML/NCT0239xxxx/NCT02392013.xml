    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness and implementation of a home-hazard removal program to
      reduce falls in older adults through a community program delivered through the aging services
      network. The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness/implementation trial of 300
      older adults at risk for a fall who will be randomized to a home-hazard removal program or
      usual care and then followed for 12 months. Investigators will look at the number of falls at
      6 months and 12 months.

      The investigators will randomly select a sample of older adults from the large observational
      cohort of older adults assessed annually by an Area Agendy on Aging via the National Aging
      Program Information System (NAPIS). The eligibility criteria include age 65 years or older
      and self-report of one previous fall or more in the preceding 12 months or self-report as
      &quot;worried about falling.&quot; We will conduct baseline assessments and randomize participants to
      receive an home hazard removal program or usual care. Outcomes (falls, fall self-efficacy)
      will be assessed by a blinded rater at baseline and 12 months after intervention. All
      assessments and study visits will occur in participants' homes.
