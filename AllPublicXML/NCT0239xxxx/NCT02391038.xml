  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of MLN0264 in previously treated Asian
      participants with Advanced Gastrointestinal (GI) Carcinoma (Phase 1) or Metastatic or
      Recurrent Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (Phase 2) Expressing Guanylyl
      Cyclase C (GCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0264. This drug is being evaluated to check
      the effects on previously treated Asian individuals with Advanced GI Carcinoma (Phase 1) or
      Metastatic or Recurrent Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (Phase 2). The
      study will enroll approximately 95 participants.

      In Phase 1, approximately 14 Asian participants with GI malignancies will be enrolled in 3
      planned dose cohorts according to the traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme. The starting
      dose will be 1.2 mg/kg of MLN0264 administered IV on Day 1 of 3-week cycles for up to 1 year
      or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Dose escalation will take place
      until Phase 2 recommended dose is determined.

      In Phase 2, eligible Asian participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
      stomach or gastroesophageal junction will be enrolled. Participants must have failed at least
      2 lines of prior anticancer therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Disease recurrence
      within 6 months of the last dose of post-surgical adjuvant chemotherapy counts as 1 line of
      prior anticancer therapy for advanced disease.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 3 years.

    The study was terminated because preliminary PK and overall clinical data demonstrated
    compelling similarity between Western and Asian participant populations.

The score is obtained by the formula: 3 * percentage of strongly staining nuclei + 2 * percentage of moderately staining nuclei + percentage of weakly staining nuclei, giving a range of 0 to 300. The 600 H-score is based on the sum of the 0 to 300 H-score for cytoplasmic staining and the 0 to 300 H-score for apical staining</description>

All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total representative of all involved organs were identified as target lesions at baseline. Target lesions were selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability for reproducible repeated measurements.</description>

          <title>Phase 1- Disease Response Based on the Investigator’s Assessment</title>
          <description>Disease response was based on the investigator’s assessment using the modified RECIST version 1.1 guidelines. Evaluation of target lesions included CR (Disappearance of all target lesions),PR(at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions),Progressive disease (PD:at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking the smallest sum LD recorded as reference since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions) and Stable disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD).Evaluation of Non target Lesions included CR (disappearance of all non target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level), Incomplete response/SD (Persistence of 1 or more non target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits) and PD(Appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non target lesions).</description>
          <population>The Response-Evaluable population is defined as all participants with measurable disease who receive at least 1 dose of MLN0264 and have at least 1 post baseline response assessment.</population>

        <description>The H-score is a method of assessing the extent of nuclear immunoreactivity, applicable to steroid receptors. The score is obtained by the formula: 3 * percentage of strongly staining nuclei + 2 * percentage of moderately staining nuclei + percentage of weakly staining nuclei, giving a range of 0 to 300. The 600 H-score is based on the sum of the 0 to 300 H-score for cytoplasmic staining and the 0 to 300 H-score for apical staining</description>
