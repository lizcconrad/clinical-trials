      This phase II trial studies F-18 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol (FES) positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in predicting response to endocrine therapy in patients with
      newly diagnosed breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. FES is a
      radioactive form of the hormone estrogen and may &quot;light up&quot; where cancer is in the body.
      Diagnostic procedures using FES, such as FES PET/CT, may help measure the FES and help
      doctors predict how well the cancer will respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of [18F]fluoroestradiol (FES) uptake for
      response (clinical benefit) at 6 months in patients with estrogen-receptor positive (ER+)
      metastatic breast cancer treated with first-line endocrine therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the test-retest reproducibility of quantitative assessment of tumor FES
      uptake by standardized uptake values (SUVs).

      II. To evaluate the accuracy of FES-PET/CT for predicting response in patients treated with
      first line endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer.

      III. To evaluate the accuracy of FES-PET/CT for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in
      patients treated with first line endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer.

      IV. To examine the role of FES-PET/CT in predicting progressive disease (PD) or clinical
      benefit (CB), in concert with semi-quantitative interpretation of ER, progesterone receptor
      (PgR), and marker of proliferation Ki-67 (Ki-67).

      V. To evaluate the relationships among FES uptake, as measured by maximum SUV (SUVmax) and
      semi-quantitative ER from immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      VI. To evaluate FES SUVmax &lt; 1.5 as the optimal cutpoint for predicting progression-free
      survival (PFS) to first line endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer.

      VII. To determine the percent of eligible patients for whom biopsy is not feasible, i.e.,
      determine the clinical utility of indirect assay of ER expression by FES-PET/CT.

      VIII. To evaluate the heterogeneity of tumor FES uptake in individual patients defined as
      variability in lesion's FES uptake.

      OUTLINE:

      Between 0 to 30 days before start of endocrine therapy, patients receive F-18 16
      alpha-fluoroestradiol intravenously (IV) over 2 minutes and undergo PET/CT. Patients may
      undergo a second FES-PET/CT study at least 24 hours after the first study and no later than
      10 days after the initial study.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 6 months and then periodically for up
      to 2 years.

    <measure>Negative predictive value of 18F FES uptake for response (CB), defined as the proportion of patients with a negative FES test result who have progressive disease</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>FES-PET results will be assessed as positive or negative by quantitative or qualitative criteria. FES SUVmax &lt; 1.5 will be defined as quantitatively negative test result while one or more sites of active disease will be qualitatively negative test result. The reference standard is patient's tumor response categorized by either CB or PD at 6 months. As part of the preliminary analysis, rates of FES uptake negative results overall and next by tumor response status will be calculated. FES-PET test positive results will be compared in the two tumor response groups using a chi-square test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test-retest reproducibility of quantitative assessment of tumor FES uptake by SUVs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The reproducibility of the two measurements of SUVs will be assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, the coefficient of repeatability (CR) and the Bland-Altman plot will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FES SUVmax</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of FES SUVmax and its associated area under an ROC curve (AUC) will be estimated to predict tumor response (clinical benefit). Next, sensitivity and specificity of the dichotomized FES SUVmax (using a cutoff of 1.5) will be estimated non-parametrically, where sensitivity is the proportion of responders having FES SUVmax &lt; 1.5 and specificity is the proportion of non-responders having FES SUVmax &gt; 1.5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Predictive accuracy of FES PET/CT for PFS, defined as the time from entry onto study until tumor progression or death from any cause</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the predictive accuracy of FES PET, the time-dependent ROC curve of FES SUVmax at pre-specified time points (e.g. 6 months, 1 year) and its corresponding AUC will be estimated. Next, sensitivity and specificity of the dichotomized FES SUVmax (using a cutoff of 1.5) will be estimated in which reference standard is PFS status at pre-specified time points including 6 months and 1 year.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Significance of FES PET measures in predicting PD or CB, in concert with semi-quantitative interpretation of ER, PgR, and Ki-67</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Logistic regression analysis will be used to examine the effects of various FES PET measurements on clinical benefit. Predictors are semi-quantitative ER measure, PgR, and Ki-67 based on IHC. Significance of each FES PET measure will be determined by the odds ratio and its 95% CI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FES uptake, as measured by SUVmax and semi-quantitative ER from IHC</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The semi-quantitative ER measure will be obtained by using Allred score. The relationship between SUVmax and semi-quantitative ER measure will be evaluated by using a linear regression model treating SUVmax as a dependent variable and semi-quantitative ER measure as a predictor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FES SUVmax &lt; 1.5 as the optimal cutpoint for predicting PFS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Time dependent ROC analysis will be performed to determine the optimal cutoff point for the FES SUVmax and to examine whether there is a more optimal cut-off for dichotomous interpretation of FES SUVmax than the current value 1.5. Specifically, the optimal cut-off point will be determined by maximizing Youden's index for the time dependent ROC curve at a pre-specified time point (e.g. 6 months, 1 year).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of eligible patients for whom biopsy is not feasible, i.e., clinical utility of indirect assay of ER expression by FES PET</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of eligible patients for whom biopsy of a metastatic site is not feasible out of a total of 99 patients will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heterogeneity of tumor FES uptake in individual patients defined as variability in lesion's FES uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sample correlation matrix for the multiple SUV measurements will be calculated. Next, linear mixed effects model will be used where the outcome is SUV measurements and covariates include fixed effects (sites that the SUV value is measured and patient characteristics). Lesion-specific random effects will be added to the model. The correlations among SUV measurements will be calculated based on the fitted model.</description>
