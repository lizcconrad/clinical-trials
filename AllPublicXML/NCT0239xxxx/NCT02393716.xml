          6. Subject meets all the following anatomical criteria as demonstrated on
             contrast-enhanced CT or

        MRA imaging:

          -  Proximal neck length of ≥ 10 mm with ≤ 60° infrarenal and ≤ 45° suprarenal neck
             angulation or Proximal neck length of ≥ 15 mm with ≤ 75° infrarenal and ≤ 60°
             suprarenal neck angulation

          -  Subject has vascular dimensions, e.g., aortic and iliac diameters, lengths from renal
             arteries to iliac bifurcation and hypogastric arteries, in the range of sizes
             available for the Endurant Evo AAA stent graft system (measured intima to intima) and
             within the sizing recommendations (refer to Endurant Evo AAA stent graft system
             Instructions for Use (IFU))

          -  Subject has a proximal aortic neck diameter ≥ 18 mm and ≤ 32 mm

          -  The distal fixation center of the iliac arteries must have a diameter ≥ 7 mm and ≤ 25
             mm bilaterally for the bifur and unilaterally for the AUI

          -  Subject has documented imaging evidence of at least one patent iliac and one femoral
             artery, or can tolerate a vascular conduit that allows introduction of the Endurant
             Evo AAA stent graft system

          -  Subject has distal non-aneurysmal iliac (cylindrical) fixation length ≥20 mm bilateral
             for the bifur and unilaterally for the AUI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a life expectancy ≤1 year

             graft

         10. Subject has had a myocardial infarction (MI) or cerebral vascular accident (CVA)

         13. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants,
             antiplatelets, or contrast media, which is not amenable to pre-treatment

         14. Subject has significant aortic thrombus and/or calcification at either the proximal or
             distal attachment centers that would compromise fixation and seal of the device at the
             discretion of the investigator

         15. Subject has ectatic iliac arteries requiring bilateral exclusion of hypogastric blood
             flow

         16. Subject whose arterial access site is not anticipated to accommodate the diameter of
             the Endurant Evo AAA stent graft delivery system (13F-17F) due to vessel size,
             calcification, or tortuosity

         17. Subject is morbidly obese or has other documented clinical conditions that severely
             inhibit radiographic visualization of the aorta at the discretion of the investigator

         18. Subject has active infection at the time of the index procedure documented by e.g.
             pain, fever, drainage, positive culture and/or leukocytosis considered to be
             clinically significant per investigator discretion

         19. Subject has congenital degenerative collagen disease, e.g., Marfan's Syndrome
