    <textblock>
      Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is based on the guidelines of ESC-EAS 2011 (European Heart
      Journal (2011) 32, 1769-1818, ESC / EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias)
      These calculate the 10 year risk based on SCORE tables - Systematic COronary Risk Estimation
      and taking into account specific parameters in the patient's profile.

      The European Society of Cardiology initiated the development of a new risk calculation system
      (SCORE) using data from 12 European population monitoring studies (N = 205.178) with wide
      geographic distribution of countries with different cardiovascular risk. The SCORE data
      contains more than 3 million man-years of observation and 7934 fatal cardiovascular events.

        -  patient is classified into risk category (Very high-high-medium-low)

        -  a target for LDL-C was then placed on a risk basis and appropriate treatment proposed

        -  As a first option is to statin monotherapy to the maximum tolerated dose.

        -  Only in case of failure of the therapeutic target for LDL-C may be used active substance
           other therapeutic class or as alternative monotherapy or in combination with statin,
           Because European countries exhibit heterogeneity in genetics, lifestyle, living
           standards, health benefits, etc. have been divided into two groups, high risk
           (countries) and low risk (countries) and have been prepared in different tables SCORE
           (Systematic COronary Risk Estimation) For Greece, as in other countries has been further
           refinement of SCORE and trained specialists tables adapted to the Greek population
           (Statistical The most currently used treatment in Greece is atorvastatin, obtained from
           520,000 patients From far studies with atorvastatin have been well documented reductions
           in various lipid parameters and especially the LDL-C, which is the main objective in the
           treatment.

      But there is no evidence to suggest what is the dosage proved suitable in practice for the
      patient depending on the risk class belongs.
