    <textblock>
      Intrusive negative thinking styles such as rumination are typical of many psychiatric
      disorders, are difficult to treat, and predict poor treatment outcome. The investigators
      propose to evaluate a new intervention for negative thinking that capitalizes and builds on
      the preserved ability to attend to physical sensation. The investigators will examine changes
      in physiological mechanisms and symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Intrusive negative cognitions are key transdiagnostic features of many psychiatric disorders,
      are difficult to treat, and predict poor outcomes in conventional and neurobehavioral
      interventions. Here, we evaluate the extent to which a novel intervention capitalizing on a
      preserved neurocircuitry for attending to evolutionarily salient somatosensory stimuli can be
      used to train attentional mechanisms to override otherwise pre-potent negative cognitions.
      The initial period will involve open-label intervention refinement and mechanistic evaluation
      of mechanism; N=35 individuals with high levels of intrusive negative cognitions and
      dysphoria will be assessed pre/post intervention in the graded sensory training condition.
      Success will suggest a new intervention pathway for a traditionally treatment-resistant
      dimension of psychopathology. The second phase will be a randomized trial of 70 participants
      equally allocated to graded and non-graded training conditions.

    <description>Sustained attention is operationalized by performance on computer-based tasks (sensitivity, reaction times) and associated physiological measures (pupil dilation, eye movements, heart rate, EEG) and central measures (fMRI derived reactivity in affect, somatosensory, and attention networks). These metrics will be interpreted together as a meta-analytic composite by counting the number of component measures with significant change in association with the intervention in comparison to a permutation-test derived critical number of indices change under the null hypothesis given the autocorrelation of the administered measures.</description>

    <description>Participants will be instructed to attend to sensory stimuli and to press a button as quickly and accurately as possible while doing mental arithmetic. Speed and intensity of the task will change depending on participant progress. At high speeds, attention will need to be voluntarily recruited. At slow initial speeds, attention is expected to be automatically captured by each stimulus (not effortful). Stimuli will consist of non-painful electrical muscle stimulation (10Hz biphasic current with a pulse width of 200us with rectangular 2&quot; electrodes placed on the back near the shoulders. Sessions will be approximately 45 minutes 3 session over the course of two weeks.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for all participants:

          -  Signed study consent document

          -  Native English speakers (learned English before age 5)

          -  Right handed

          -  20/30 vision or better

          -  Free from benzodiazepines and betablockers within 8 hours of evaluations

        Subject specific Inclusion Criteria

          -  Endorsement of chronic and intrusive negative thinking

          -  Highscores on rumination; Response Style Questionnaire (RSQ &gt;= 44)

          -  Automatic Negative Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ &gt;= 48)

          -  Dysphoria; Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR &gt;= 8)

          -  Must be in current treatment (either Intensive Outpatient Therapy, regular therapy
             sessions with a licensed provider, or close care by a psychiatrist). This is to ensure
             the research team is not the patient's only care provider, as this intervention is
             intended to be adjunct with therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal or inability to provide informed consent

          -  Current alcohol or substance dependence

          -  Psychotic disorders or psychosis

          -  Neurological disorders (stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, etc.)

          -  Inability to complete questionnaires in English. The justification is that many of the
             primary analyses involve assessment of change in self-reported symptoms using measures
             normed in English. Participants must thus be able to read those measures to give valid
             indications of the extent to which they have responded to the intervention.

          -  Current use of any psychotropic drugs thought to affect learning, including
             antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, stimulants, and anti-Parkinsonian drugs. Current is
             defined as within 2 weeks of testing, 4 weeks for fluoxetine.

          -  Chronic pain that could be exacerbated by TENS unit electrical stimulation

          -  Having any eye problems or difficulties in corrected vision or hearing

          -  Having a North American Adult Reading Test (NAART) equivalent Full Scale Intelligence
             Quotient &lt; 85

          -  Being pregnant. Determined by self-report at the interview and by a pregnancy test

          -  Severe or poorly controlled concurrent medical disorders that may cause thinking
             disruptions or require medication that could cause negative thinking

          -  Current use of medications that could cause affect thinking symptoms. That is,
             participants need to be able to think clearly to complete the proposed information
             processing tasks. And they need to be able to learn to be able to make use of the
             intervention. Medications which compromise clear thinking or which block learning will
             thus be considered exclusion criteria.

          -  Any implanted electrical device (pacemaker, vagus nerve stimulator implant, etc.) or
             prior treatment with a vagus nerve stimulator

          -  History of a convulsive disorder

          -  Underwent electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) &lt; 9 months prior to study entry.

          -  Presence of a neurologic disorder or medication therapy known to alter seizure
             threshold (e.g., brain injury, frequent/severe headaches).

          -  People who have foreign objects in their body that are not cleared for safety at 3T
             scanning, such as aneurysm clips or pacemakers, will be excluded from the fMRI portion
             of the study.

          -  Participants deemed &quot;not a good fit&quot; for the study for other reasons (such as, but not
             limited to, continually arriving late or rescheduling, not being a trustworthy
             historian or accurate reporter of symptoms, being belligerent with study staff, or
             presenting an active suicide risk) can also be excluded.

          -  Any heart condition

          -  Any metal implant or subcutaneous metal in the arm
