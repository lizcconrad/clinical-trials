    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some people with cancer have solid tumors. Others have refractory leukemia. This doesn t go
      away after treatment. Researchers want to see if a drug called PLX3397 can shrink tumors or
      stop them from growing.

      Objectives:

      - To find the highest safe dose and side effects of PLX3397. To see if it helps treat certain
      types of cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  People ages 3 22 with a solid tumor or leukemia that has returned or not responded to
           cancer therapies.

        -  For Phase II, people ages 3 31 with a Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Associated
           Plexiform Neurofibroma (PN) that cannot be removed with surgery.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Heart tests

        -  Scans or other tests of the tumor

        -  Participants will take PLX3397 as a capsule once daily for a 28-day cycle. They can do
           this for up to 2 years.

        -  During the study, participants will have many tests and procedures. They include repeats
           of the screening tests. Participants will keep a diary of symptoms.

        -  Participants with solid tumors will have scans or x-rays.

        -  Participants with NF1 PN will have MRI scans.

        -  Participants with leukemia will have blood tests. They may have a bone marrow sample
           taken.

        -  Some participants may have a biopsy.

        -  When finished taking PLX3397, participants will have follow-up visits. They will repeat
           the screening tests and note side effects.

        -  Phase II will follow the same procedures as Phase I above, but participants will also
           fill out questionnaires about their pain and quality of life.

      Background

        -  Traditional therapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer have focused on cytotoxic agents
           and, more recently, targeted inhibition of cellular signaling pathways through the use
           of small molecule kinase inhibitors. Despite these interventions, significant numbers of
           pediatric cancer patients develop recurrent and resistant disease. Targeting the tumor
           microenvironment is a promising but incompletely explored strategy for the treatment of
           pediatric cancer and non-cancer tumors.

        -  This trial will begin to explore the disruption of the interaction between neoplastic
           cells and the myeloid component of the tumor microenvironment as a treatment strategy
           for pediatric cancers and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) related plexiform neurofibromas
           (PN) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST).

        -  PLX3397 is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of class III protein tyrosine
           kinases including Kit, CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor)/Fms (Feline
           McDonough Sarcoma), and oncogenic Flt3 (Fms like tyrosine kinase).

      Primary Objectives

        -  Phase I: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of PLX3397, and determine a recommended
           phase II dose of PLX3397 in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors including
           NF1 MPNST and brain tumors or refractory leukemias, limited to acute myelogenous
           leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

        -  Phase II: Determine the anti-tumor activity of PLX3397 in patients with NF1 PN.
           Objective response rate (ORR) will be defined as the proportion of patients with a
           partial response (PN volume decrease greater than or equal to 20% determined by
           volumetric MRI analysis). PN Cohort temporarily suspended as requested by the FDA due to
           IND Safety Report of 07 October 2016.

      Eligibility

        -  Tumor type:

             -  Phase I: Children (greater than or equal to 3 and lessthan or equal to 21 years of
                age) with recurrent or refractory solid tumors including primary neoplasms of the
                central nervous system and patients with NF1 and MPNST. NF1 PN only Cohort
                temporarily suspended as requested by the FDA due to IND Safety Report of 07
                October 2016., or Children (greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 21
                years of age) with refractory leukemias (AML or ALL) (Phase 1).

             -  Phase II: Patients with NF1 and inoperable PN, that cause morbidity (greater than
                or equal to 3 and lessthan or equal to 35 years of age). PN Cohort temporarily
                suspended as requested by the FDA due to IND Safety Report of 07 October 2016.

        -  Subjects must have adequate performance status, be able to swallow tablets, may not be
           pregnant or breastfeeding, and have adequate major organ function. Subjects with history
           of severe or uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
           active infection, symptomatic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, or history of
           prolonged QT syndrome will be excluded.

      Design

        -  Phase I

             -  Using a rolling-six phase I design with 2-6 subjects per dose level and standard
                definitions of MTD (during cycle 1) and DLT.

             -  PLX3397 will be administered orally (200 mg capsules) once daily on a continuous
                basis for cycles of 28 days without a rest period between cycles. Patients must be
                able to swallow intact capsules. Dosing will be based on body surface area (BSA),
                and the total weekly dose will be rounded to within 10% of calculated dose using a
                dosing nomogram.

             -  At the MTD, the recommended phase II dose level will be expanded to up to 12
                patients with attempts made to enroll at least 3 patients with refractory solid
                tumors and 3 patients with refractory acute leukemia (ALL and AML) to gain more
                experience with the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of PLX3397 in these disease
                cohorts. Attempts will be made to enroll equal numbers of patients between the ages
                of 3 and 12 years and over 12 years of age to gain pharmacokinetic and safety data
                over a broad age range.

        -  Phase II (PN Cohort temporarily suspended as requested by the FDA due to IND Safety
           Report of 07 October 2016.)

             -  A Simon 2-stage design will be used: 9 evaluable patients with NF1 and inoperable
                PN that cause morbidity will be enrolled on the initial stage, and if greater than
                or equal to 1/9 patients have a response (PN volume decrease greater than or equal
                to 20% compared to baseline), enrollment will be expanded to a total of 17
                evaluable patients.

             -  Impact of therapy on patient-reported outcomes will be evaluated in patients with
                PN. This study will assess both general health-related qualify of life (QOL) and
                pain (pain intensity and pain interference) as patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

             -  To complete both Phase I and Phase II portions, a maximum of (24 + 17= 41 plus up
                to 6 to replace inevaluable patients) 47 patients will be accrued in 2 to 2.5
                years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Enrollment in the cohort of patients with NF1 inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN) is
        temporarily suspended as of Amendment G as requested by the FDA due to IND Safety Report of
        07 October 2016. Patient accrual of patients with NF1 and MPNST may continue in the Phase I
        Portion.

          -  Diagnosis:

               -  Phase I: Patients must have recurrent or refractory solid tumors or acute
                  leukemia (limited to AML or ALL) or have been intolerant of prior therapies,
                  confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI, e.g., solid tumors including
                  rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, soft tissue sarcomas. These may include primary
                  neoplasms of the central nervous system, such as high-grade (WHO grade III-IV)
                  glioma. Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or optic pathway
                  glioma are exempt from histologic verification. For DIPG typical MRI findings
                  must be present which include hypo- or isointense on T1-weighted imaging,
                  hyperintense on FLAIR or T2-weighted imaging, epicenter in the pons in the face
                  of a typical clinical presentation. Optic pathway glioma are located in the optic
                  pathway and are typically hypo- or iso-intense on T1 and hyperintense on
                  T2-weighted images.

               -  In addition, patients with NF1 and with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
                  (MPNST).

          -  Phase II temporarily suspended as requested by the FDA due to IND Safety Report of 07
             October 2016

               -  Phase II: inoperable PN causing morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and
                  neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, brachial or
                  lumbar plexus lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function,
                  lesions that could result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or
                  significant cosmetic problems, lesions of the extremity that cause limb
                  hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions in patients with NF1.

               -  Histologic confirmation of PN tumor is not necessary in the presence of
                  consistent clinical and radiographic findings, but should be considered if
                  malignant degeneration of a PN is clinically suspected.

               -  A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and
                  may involve multiple fascicles and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more
                  levels with connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve.
                  In addition to PN, all study subjects must have either positive genetic testing
                  for NF1 confirmed in a CLIA certified laboratory or have at least one other
                  diagnostic criterion for NF1 listed below (NIH Consensus conference):

                    -  Six or more cafe-au-lait macules (greater than or equal to 0.5cm in
                       prepubertal subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in post pubertal
                       subjects)

                    -  Freckling in axilla or groin

                    -  Optic glioma

                    -  Two or more Lisch nodules

                    -  A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or
                       thinning of long bone cortex)

                    -  A first-degree relative with NF1

                    -  Patients must have relapsed after or be refractory to effective standard
                       therapies. For NF1 PN there is no standard medical therapy, and therefore no
                       requirement for prior therapy. There are no limits on number of prior
                       therapeutic regimens.

               -  Phase II: greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 35 years of age

          -  Informed Consent: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is&lt;18 years
             old) must sign an IRB-approved document of informed consent to demonstrate their
             understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study before any
             protocol-related studies are performed. When appropriate, pediatric subjects will be
             included in all discussions.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow capsules.

          -  Performance Status: Karnofsky greater than or equal to 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of

        Lansky greater than or equal to 50% for patients less than or eqal to 16 years of age.
        Subjects who are wheelchair bound because of paralysis will be considered ambulatory when
        they are up in their wheelchair. Subjects have to be able to travel to the NIH for
        evaluations.

        -Prior therapy:

                  or &lt;470 ms (female) on ECG at Baseline. (Fridericia's Formula: QTcF =
                  (QT)/RR0.33)

               -  Contraception: Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use an effective
                  method of birth control during treatment and for 3 months after receiving their
                  last dose of study drug. Fertile men must also agree to use an acceptable method
                  of birth control while on study drug and for at least 3 months after last dose.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Individuals who are pregnant or breast feeding or who become pregnant while enrolled
             on this trial will be excluded from participation, due to the unknown effects of
             PLX3397 on a growing fetus or newborn child.

          -  Individuals with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors will not be eligible to
             participate in the phase II portion of the trial.

          -  Ongoing treatment with any other cancer therapy or investigational agent, with the
             exception of IT chemotherapy for leukemia, when indicated.

          -  Individuals who require therapy with warfarin.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Active untreated infection.

          -  Known chronic Hepatitis B or C, or HIV infection.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to PLX3397 or other agents used in study.

          -  Patients with PT and/or INR higher than or equal to 1.5 time upper limit of normal,
             unless patients have lupus anticoagulant in which case they are eligible if cleared by
             hematology.

          -  Drugs that strongly inhibit or potentiate CYP3A4:

               -  During Phase I: patients who have received these drugs within 14 days or within 5
                  half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to study initiation will be
                  excluded.

               -  During Phase II: These drugs should be avoided if possible, as these drugs could
                  increase or decrease blood levels of PLX3397.
