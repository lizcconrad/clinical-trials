  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral internal sphinterotomy (LIS) is the gold standard against which all treatments are
      compared with a healing rate over 92%. However, the most serious complication of this
      procedure is anal incontinence. To overcome these problems, continued efforts are being tried
      to find less invasive treatments modalities for anal fissure that is as effective as surgical
      therapy with lower morbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sacral nerve stimulation has been recently tried for management of chronic anal fissure with
      promising results. However, the technique described is invasive with the need for surgically
      implantable expensive stimulator electrodes.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of posterior tibial nerve stimulation
      (PTN) by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and to compare it to the
      conventional LIS. This non-invasive technique has been proved to be of acceptable results in
      treatment of fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence.
