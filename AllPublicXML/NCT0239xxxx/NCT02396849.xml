  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the use of a machine called CPAP will help children
      with asthma breathe better. CPAP is a machine that produces airflow to help people with
      breathing problems. To use it, you will wear a mask connected by a hose to the CPAP machine.
      We believe that use of CPAP may be a treatment for children with asthma.

      During the previous funding period of this project, our laboratory demonstrated that chronic
      mechanical strain imposed on the airways in vivo using continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) results in a dramatic reduction in airway reactivity in vivo in mice, ferrets and
      rabbits1-3. Lungs, airways and airway smooth muscle (ASM) tissues isolated from CPAP-treated
      animals studied in vitro exhibited lower responsiveness to bronchoconstrictors1-3. We also
      observed this suppression of airway responsiveness by chronic mechanical strain in a rabbit
      model of allergic asthma5. These animal studies led to a small clinical trial in which adults
      with asthma were treated with nocturnal CPAP for 1 week. CPAP caused a significant reduction
      in airway reactivity in these patients6. This novel approach for treating airway
      hyper-reactivity is currently being evaluated in a NIH multi-center Phase II clinical trial
      of adults with mild to moderate asthma (U01 HL108730).

    <measure>Change in Airway Reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in airway reactivity (logPC20) measured prior to and after 4 wks of either CPAP or SHAM treatment. We will compare the change in PC20 between two groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, adjusting for baseline PC20. We anticipate that PC20 will increase for the CPAP treated group, but not change for the SHAM treated subjects.</description>

    <measure>Change in Airway Inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Airway Inflammation assessed as the change in the percentage eosinophils in the induced sputum measured prior to and after 4 wks CPAP or SHAM treatment. We will compare the change between two groups using an ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline percentage eosinophils. We anticipate that eosinophilia will decrease for the CPAP treated group, but not in the SHAM treated subjects.</description>
