  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial proposed clinical study will be conducted in adult head and neck cancer subjects.
      This will be an open-labeled, proof of concept trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of EISO in a form of oral rinse as adjunctive therapy to standard of care.
      Santalis believes that the proposed study is a prudent and appropriate approach to
      investigate the potential of their product to prevent or improve oral mucositis symptoms
      commonly seen in subjects undergoing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.

      The objectives of this proof of concept trial are: to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of SAN005 when administered to adults for the prevention and treatment of
      radiation induced oral mucositis.

      Subjects will be instructed on the administration of study medication thrice daily till oral
      mucositis resolves. Subjects will return to the clinic once a week while receiving radiation
      and then once every two weeks once their radiation has been completed and then until their
      mucositis has resolved for the Final Study Visit.

      Preliminary Efficacy Evaluation will be the severity of pain rated by the NRPS and mucositis
      grade by RTOG criteria at Visit 7 (Day 36). Additional secondary efficacy evaluations will
      include the severity of pain rated by the NRPS and mucositis grade by RTOG criteria at each
      study visit, frequency of the PEG tube for feeding during the duration of treatment and
      weight loss from baseline through Visit 5 and 7. The time of mucositis onset and duration
      will also be used in assessing efficacy. Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints will
      be outlined in the statistical analysis plan. The overall efficacy is determined by comparing
      the data to historical controls. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs)
      with respect to severity, duration, and relationship to study drug. In addition tolerability
      evaluations will be performed at each study visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with head and neck cancer involving the oropharynx or oral cavity, who are
             expected to undergo high dose radiation therapy (i.e., â‰¥ 60 Gy) that typically results
             in oral mucositis, with or without concurrent chemotherapy or biologic targeted
             therapy.

          2. At least 18 years of age

          3. Estimated survival of at least 6 months.

          4. No prior radiation therapy to the head and neck area, and no chemotherapy within the
             last year except for induction chemotherapy delivered (or to be delivered) prior to
             the current course of radiation therapy

          5. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use an adequate form of
             contraceptive (e.g., hormonal, barrier method or abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of the trial.

          6. Are willing to refrain from using other treatments for oral mucositis until they
             consult with the study investigator(s).

          7. Are able to give written informed consent in a manner approved by the Institutional
             Review Board and comply with the requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have preexisting mucositis from other causes.

          4. ECOG performance status &gt; 3

          5. Unwilling or unable to follow the protocol requirements.

          6. Have any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would confound the
