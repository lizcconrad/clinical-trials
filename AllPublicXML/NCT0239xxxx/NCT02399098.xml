    <textblock>
      Focusing attention is pertinent to the performance of closed self-paced motor tasks. The
      following study will examine the effectiveness of internal and external focus of attention
      instructions on the performance of a dart throwing task under rested and fatigue (after
      performing intense exercise) conditions. As well as the relationship between attentional
      focus instructions and gaze behavior under these two conditions.

      The participants will arrive at the Ribstein Center for Sports Medicine and Research at the
      Wingate Institute on four different occasions, 2-3 days apart, in order to complete three
      motor learning phases. Session 1 and 2 will include the acquisition phase, Session 3 will
      include the retention and transfer phases, and the last visit, Session 4, will include the
      fatigued session.

      Sessions 1 and 2 The participants will be informed of the purpose, methods, and study
      protocol. Then an informed consent form will be provided to the participant to be signed. The
      participants will learn the throwing task according to specific instructions. Participants in
      all groups will be given the same technical instructions on how to throw the dart. The
      technical instructions will be followed by attentional focus instructions that will differ
      between groups. After receiving the instructions, the participants in both these groups will
      be given a questionnaire to fill in. The researcher will go over the answers with each
      participant to ensure that the instructions were understood. If needed, the instructions will
      be repeated until appropriate understanding and performance is achieved. Then, a 3-min
      practice period will begin. The participants of the internal focus group will be asked to
      perform the throwing movement of the arms 20 times without holding the dart. The external
      focus group's participants will be asked to perform the throwing motion 20 times while
      holding the dart. The participants in the control group will be asked to practice their
      stance, posture, and the holding of the dart.

      Testing will begin after the preparation period. The Mobile Eye gaze tracking system will be
      fitted and calibrated to six different reference locations. The calibration target will be a
      board with six &quot;X&quot; shapes spaced 30 cm apart on a white paper that will be placed on the
      target. The external video will be located perpendicular to the participant in a way that the
      upper body and the arm movement can be seen in the frame. The participant will then perform
      the dart throwing task of 5 blocks of 12 trials, with a 2-min rest in between each block of
      trials. During the 2-min rest interval the researcher will remind each participant to use the
      attenational focus strategy. During the rest interval between the blocks, the system's
      calibration will be checked and calibrated again if necessary. In total, each participant
      will complete 120 trials of the dart throwing task in the acquisition phase.

      Session 3 Upon arrival to the Lab, participants will be fitted with the Mobile Eye system,
      and calibration will be performed. The external video camera will be turned on and the
      participants will perform the same dart throwing task for 2 blocks of 10 trials, with 2min of
      rest in between. A transfer task will be performed after a 15-min break. Participants will be
      re-fitted with the Mobile Eye and re-calibration will be performed. The transfer task (an
      underarm throw) will be performed for 2 blocks of 10 trials with 2-min of rest in between.

      Session 4 On the fourth and final visit, the participants will be randomly assigned into two
      groups. Each subgroup will perform two blocks of 10 trials, with a 60-sec rest in between,
      under different types of anaerobic physical exertions: (1) Leg Anaerobic condition
      (WAnT-leg): using the modified WAnT, and (2) Arm anaerobic condition (WAnT-arm): using the
      WAnT arm modification.

      Before commencing the exercise test protocol, anthropometric measures will be determined for
      each participant. Height and body mass will be measured using a stadiometer (Seca,
      Birmingham, UK) and a digital scale (Model HBF-514C, Omron Healthcare Inc, Bannockburn,
      Illinois), respectively, and will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively.
      Skinfold thickness will be measured in triplicate using Caliper (Skyndex System 1, Caldwell,
      Justiss &amp; Company, Inc, Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA). The following sites will be evaluated:
      biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac. Adiposity (percentage of body fat) will be
      estimated from the appropriate skinfold measurements using Durning and Womersly equations
      (Durnin &amp; Womersley, 1974). All measurements will be performed by the same investigator.
      Preceding the anthropometric measurement and before beginning either test, either ergometer
      will be individually adjusted to fit each participant's height and body size. A heart rate
      monitor (Polar FT1, Polar Electro, USA) will be worn by each subject in order to record heart
      rate data. The eye tracking system will be put on and calibrated. Then the participants will
      remove the apparatus and will begin the physical exertion test. Subsequently, the
      participants will warm up for the WAnT-leg (men=75 W; women=50 W) and for the WAnT-arm
      (men=30 W; women=unloaded) by exercising at 60 rpm for 5 min.

      During the warm-up period, participants will be asked to perform three all-out 5-sec sprints
      on the command of the researcher. Following the warm-up, participants will rest quietly for
      10 min. Then the participants will perform ten consecutive 10 seconds sprints interspersed
      with 15 seconds recovery intervals. The participant will be instructed to sprint as fast as
      possible for 10 seconds. Verbal encouragement will be given during the test. The resistance
      for men will be set at 0.931 and 0.601 N/Kg-1, and for women 0.833 and 0.470 N/Kg-1 during
      the WAnT-leg and the WAnT-arm, respectively (Weber, Chia, &amp; Inbar, 2006). Participants will
      be instructed to remain seated throughout the test and will be given verbal encouragement to
      maintain an all-out effort throughout the 10 seconds sprints. During each sprint, peak and
      mean power outputs will be calculated. Peak power (PP) will be the highest power produced in
      a 1 sec segment of each 10 seconds sprint, whereas mean power (MP) will be calculated as the
      average power during the 10 seconds duration. PP and MP will be expressed in watts and
      relative to body mass (W/Kg). A fatigue index (FI) will be calculated as the absolute
      difference between the PP and the MP divided by the PP and expressed in percentage (%FI). In
      order to monitor the exercise intensity during each exertion protocol, the following measures
      will be obtained prior to the beginning of the test, at the end of the last 10 seconds sprint
      and 3min and 5min after the last sprint: heart rate, lactate levels, and rate of perceived
      exertion. Five minutes after completing the WAnT-leg or-arm test, the participants will put
      on the eye tracking apparatus; if needed the system will be re-calibrated. Then the subject
      will be asked to perform the throwing task without additional explanation. This time period
      was chosen based on previous studies that found peak lactate after the WAnT test to occur
      following approximately 5 min of recovery (Weinstein, Bediz, Dotan, &amp; Falk, 1998). At the end
      of the fourth session, participants will be asked to fill in the learning strategies'
      implementation questionnaire. This 4-questions questionnaire will include two close-ended
      questions and two open-ended questions, and is meant to check whether participants used their
      assigned attentional focus strategies.
