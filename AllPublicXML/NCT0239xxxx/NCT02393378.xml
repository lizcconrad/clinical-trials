      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of namilumab in combination
      with existing methotrexate (MTX) over 24 weeks in patients with moderate to severe early
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diagnosed within 6 months and inadequately controlled by MTX
      alone.

      The drug being investigated in this study is Namilumab for the treatment of moderate to
      severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      namilumab in participants diagnosed with RA within 6 months of entry into the study.

      The study will enroll approximately 36 participants, who will be randomly assigned in a 2:1
      ratio to the following open label treatment groups:

        -  Namilumab 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) administered at Week 0 followed thereafter by 150 mg
           SC administered at Weeks 2 through 22 (at the intervals specified in the protocol) as an
           add-on to weekly existing stable methotrexate (MTX) and folic acid: 24 subjects.

        -  Active control, adalimumab 40 mg SC administered at Weeks 0 through 22 (at the intervals
           specified in the protocol) as an add-on to weekly existing stable MTX and folic acid: 12
           participants.

      Sensitive imaging techniques, including Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (DCE-MRI), will be used to measure changes in the dominant hand and the wrist.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Europe. The overall time to participate in this
      study is a maximum of 44 weeks, including follow-up period. Participants will make 16 visits
      to the site and will be followed up by telephone twice after end of treatment.
