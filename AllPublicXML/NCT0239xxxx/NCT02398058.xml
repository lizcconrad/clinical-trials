    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multi-site, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial evaluating the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of olaparib and trabectedin in
      patients with unresectable advanced/metastatic sarcomas. Patients will continue to be treated
      on this combination regimen in the absence of disease progression, intolerable toxicity or
      patient's decision.

    <description>The concentration-time data will be used for a preliminary assessment of the effect of combination therapy on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of trabectedin and olaparib. The data will be analyzed by noncompartmental methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters for trabectedin: steady state profile, end of infusion concentration, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and, if data permit, terminal phase half-life. For these parameters, the following descriptive statistics will be calculated: mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, and geometric mean. Any drug-drug interaction will be thoroughly searched. For both trabectedin and olaparib all pharmacokinetic evaluations will be done only for the first 2 cycles.</description>
