  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind (subject, Investigator, and site staff with the
      exception of unblinded dedicated staff to handle study medication), phase 2a study with 3
      dose cohorts, randomized (concealed) to CANDIN or placebo (3:1). Main study will be up to 20
      weeks (10 doses administered every other week) or until a subject has complete resolution of
      all injectable common warts. Subjects who cannot tolerate dosing every 2 weeks due to a local
      tolerance issue may be injected at 3-week intervals for up to 10 doses, increasing the length
      of the study to 29 weeks. Subjects will be followed for 4 months after final injection(s) for
      evidence of new or reoccurring warts and for safety evaluation.

             azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept,
             systemic steroids, etc.) within 12 weeks of the Baseline Visit

         12. Subject has used any investigational agent within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit
