  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study in women with primary, non-recurrent
      breast cancer undergoing surgery. AVB-620 will be administered prior to surgery.

      This study will examine the safety and tolerability of AVB-620 administered as an IV infusion
      to women with primary, non-recurrent breast cancer undergoing surgery. The study will also
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of AVB-620 in this subject population and determine the
      dose of AVB-620 needed to generate a fluorescence signal in tumor and lymph node tissue to
      enable fluorescence recordings and image analysis with an imaging system. The study will also
      evaluate the effect of timing of AVB-620 administration, relative to surgery, on fluorescence
      characteristics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or Stage I-III, primary invasive carcinoma of the
             breast

          -  Primary surgical treatment is planned to be a mastectomy or lumpectomy. Sentinel lymph
             node (LN) biopsy or axillary LN dissection (ALND) is planned as part of the subject's
             therapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2

          -  Adequate renal function

          -  Lab values (hematology and chemistry) within institution's normal laboratory limits

          -  Willing to remain on-site for approximately 24 hours after administration of AVB-620
             or, if required, stay overnight after the surgical procedure

          -  If the subject received neoadjuvant therapy, residual tumor is present (to be
             determined by the primary surgeon)

          -  If the subject received prior anthracycline therapy, the left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) must be within institution's normal limits

          -  Subject has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent ipsilateral breast cancer

          -  Prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy or biologic therapy for current clinically or
             biopsy-proven node positive breast cancer within 4 weeks before the planned surgery.

          -  Open surgery in the ipsilateral breast within 1 year of AVB-620 administration

          -  History of radiation therapy to ipsilateral breast

          -  Abnormal cardiac rhythm not controlled with medication, history of stroke, coronary
             events, and/or heart failure within 1 year of AVB-620 administration

          -  Diagnosis of autoimmune disorders

          -  History of drug-related anaphylactic reactions or allergic reactions; subjects with an
             active diagnosis of uncontrolled airway hyperactivity, uncontrolled asthma, or asthma
             requiring oral corticosteroids will be excluded

          -  History of renal disease or current evidence of renal disease

          -  Current diagnosis of any other active or clinically significant non-breast cancer

          -  Systemic investigational drug of any kind within 6 weeks of AVB-620 administration

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding
