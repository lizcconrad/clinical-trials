  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective analysis for HRM measurements using liquid swallows and a test meal for the
      presence of hiatal hernia. The investigators will correlate hernia descriptions with presence
      of acidic reflux and clinical complaints.

      We will retrospectively analyze all patients referred to hour unit for high-resolution
      esophageal manometry. These patients have been tested using liquid swallows and a test meal.
      We will analyze the HRM measurements for presence of manometric signs of hiatal hernia and
      determine predictive factors for hernia presence. We will correlate hernia description versus
      presence of acid reflux, clinical complaints and HRM measurements.
