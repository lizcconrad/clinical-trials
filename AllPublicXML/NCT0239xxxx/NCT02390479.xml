  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this case-control intervention study to explore the effectiveness of
      non surgical periodontal therapy on the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of sclerostin
      in patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) so as to get a more detailed insight into its
      diagnostic and prognostic potential as a biomarker of periodontal disease.

      All individuals underwent a full-mouth periodontal examination, which included probing pocket
      depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI),
      bleeding on probing (BOP). Individuals were categorized into three groups: individuals with
      clinically healthy periodontium (group 1), patients with chronic periodontitis (group 2), and
      group 3 consisted of the patients with chronic periodontitis (group 2), treated by scaling
      and root planning. GCF samples in grup 1 were taken at baseline. In group 2, GCF samples were
      taken before and after non- surgical periodontal treatment. Sclerostin, OPG and RANKL levels
      were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

    <description>The changes in levels of sclerostin, OPG and RANKL 6 weeks after periodontal treatment determined by ELISA. The changes in levels of sclerostin were analyzed to determine diagnostic and prognostic potential as a biomarker of periodontal disease. The relative RANKL/OPG ratio (bone resorption marker) was also calculated to detect the relationship between sclerostin levels.</description>
