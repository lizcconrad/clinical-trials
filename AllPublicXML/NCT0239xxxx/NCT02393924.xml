    <textblock>
      This disease registry is a prospective, multicenter non-interventional study designed to
      observe the different anticancer treatment regimens and their sequencing throughout the
      course of the disease in participants with unresectable locally advanced breast cancer (LABC)
      or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and to describe the clinical outcome for each treatment
      regimen measured as progression-free survival.
