      Fecal microbial treatment (FMT) is a treatment that utilizes the microbiota of a healthy
      intestine as a probiotic preparation. The feces of a healthy individual is fluidized and than
      inserted into the intestinal tract of a sick individual, assuming that the healthy flora will
      colonize and cure the intestine. There are reports of the efficacy of this treatment for
      inflammatory bowel disease but currently the numbers are small.

      aim: To investigate whether use of FMT will bring improvement for colitis in IBD patients .
      Methods: The patients will undergo full colonoscopy, the stool preparation will be infused
      through the colonoscope during withdrawal of the instrument.

      Back ground: intestinal microbiota have a central role in disease pathogenesis, either in a
      form of a &quot;permissive&quot; role or as a direct pathogenic cause.

      Clostridium difficile colitis; irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and IBD have all been connected
      to a disturbance in the equilibrium of intestinal microbiome. But the causative mechanism is
      not yet known. (5-10) . Various bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus and
      bifidobacterium bifidus are being empirically used as treatment for many intestinal ailments.
      The cause of inflammatory bowel disease in unknown but evidence is gathering that excessive
      immune reaction of intestinal immune system to microflora combined with a genetic
      predisposition are responsible for the chronic inflammation.

      Fecal microbial treatment (FMT) is a treatment that utilizes the microbiota of a healthy
      intestine as a probiotic preparation. The feces of a healthy individual is fluidized and that
      inserted into the intestinal tract of a sick individual, assuming that the healthy flora will
      colonize and cure the intestine. Previous work had shown success in fecal transplantation as
      a treatment for clostridium difficile colitis. There are also reports of the efficacy of this
      treatment for inflammatory bowel disease but currently the numbers are small. A review by
      Anderson et al describes 17 studies reporting treatment of IBD by FMT. (12). In 9 cases it
      was done to treat IBD and in 8 cases for intestinal infection in IBD patients. Altogether 41
      cases were reported , In some the FMT was inserted through a nasogastric tube directly to the
      duodenum, in some be colonoscopy and in some by an enema. A significant clinical improvement
      was reported in 19/25 patients. 13/17 stopped IBD treatment , 15/24 entered full clinical
      remission. In all 15 patients treated for infection the treatment was successful. No sever
      adverse effects were reported, Fever was developed in 8 cases and in one case there was
      exacerbation of colitis after treatment.

      Primary aim: To investigate whether use of FMT will bring improvement of at least 2 points in
      partial mayo score in ulcerative colitis patients, or 70 points in CDAI of patients with
      Crohn's colitis. One month after FMT.

      Improvement will be defined as:

      For Ulcerative colitis: a decrease of at least 2 points in the partial mayo score, and a
      decrease of at least 1 point in endoscopic Mayo score.

      For Crohn's disease: A decrease of at least 70 points in Crohn's disease activity index
      (CDAI) .

      Materials and methods:

      Study population: 40 patients aged 18-80 years, with histological and endoscopic diagnosis of
      ulcerative colitis or crohn's colitis who did not respond to either thiopurines or tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.

      Exacerbation will be defined as partial mayo score higher then 3, with either CRP higher than
      0.5 or endoscopic mayo score &gt;1 in ulcerative colitis and CDAI higher them 220 and C reactive
      protein (CRP) higher than 0.5 in Crohn's colitis.

      Stool will be donated by the patients choice either from a relative, preferably a partner to
      minimize possible transference of an infective agent, alternatively samples will be ordered
      from &quot;open biom&quot;.

      Endoscopic disease activity will be defined as follows:

      Endoscopic Mayo score:

        -  Normal or inactive disease: 0

        -  Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability): 1

        -  Moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions): 2

        -  Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration): 3

      Simple endoscopic score Crohns disease (SES-CD):

      Segments of intestine: Rectum,Sigmoid and left colon, Transverse colon,Right colon, Ileum for
      each segment the Presence of: ulcers,Ulcerated surface, Affected surface, Presence of
      narrowing, and number of affected segments will be evaluated and the total score sumed, The
      SES-CD will than be calculated as follows: TOTAL - 1.4 X (number of affected segments) =
      E-CDI

      Inclusion criteria

        2. Both donor and recipient will do the above mentioned laboratory tests, the investigator
           will verify that the results are negative.

        3. Recipient will be prepared for colonoscopy with 3 liters of polyethylene glycol
           according to the routine protocol.

        4. The donor will bring same day stool, alternatively, preparation from &quot;open biom&quot; will be
           used.

        5. 200 gr stools will be mixed with sterile 200ml sodium chloride (NACL) 0.9% and then

      month for 6 months.

      After 6 months repeat colonoscopy + biopsies + stool samples. Colonoscopy does not have to be
      complete but has to include the segment that was inflamed in the first colonoscopy.

      At the time of colonoscopy blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), liver and kidney
      function, CRP, fecal calprotectin.

      Microbiota profiles:
