  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to pilot a new computerised cognitive behavioural therapy programme for a
      small case series of adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The investigators hypothesise
      that the findings will demonstrate improvements in symptomatology following the programme.
      The programme will have longer-term aims of being rolled out over a number of IAPT services
      within the NHS, reducing waiting lists and increasing therapist time.

    <measure>Change in Y-BOCS-OCD</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 3, week 4 or week 5 after baseline, 12 weeks, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale for OCD. Questions focus on obsessive thoughts participants may have along with behaviours they feel compelled to do in order to reduce their anxiety. This outcome is expected to change (improve) from baseline throughout the trial as a result of the computerised CBT.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DSM-IV OCD SCID</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is used to check that participants meet the DSM-IV diagnosis for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and covers a range of questions from any previous treatment received to alcohol and drug consumption.</description>

    <measure>Work and social adjustment scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 3, week 4 or week 5 after baseline, 12 weeks, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This scale has 5 questions, each of which is answered using a 9 point likert scale. It focuses on work, home management, social and private leisure activities, and relationships/family.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expectation for treatment success and credibility</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 3, week 4 or week 5 after baseline, 12 weeks, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the information collected from all other measures, a therapist or clinician will make a prediction about the participants suitability for treatment using CBT, and how well (or not well) they expect the participant to respond to CBT treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>demographic variables</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This involves questions about Age, gender, ethnicity, education, employment, relationship status and access to the internet.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults aged 18 or over with OCD as defined by DSM-IV who are seeking CBT.

          -  The patient describes their OCD as their main problem and scores between 14 and 30 on
             the YBOCS (Goodman et al, 1989). A score above 30 is in the severe range and indicates
             that the CBT should probably be therapist delivered.

          -  Able to use self-help materials in English and answer written questionnaires.

          -  Able to access the internet (either at home or in a public library or drop in centre
             or at the clinic).

          -  Have a current episode of OCD of more than 6 months in duration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant and complex co-morbidity (e.g. significant personality disorder, severe
             depression or alcohol dependence, which requires longer therapy or is more difficult
             to treat). Such patients are likely to be part of a Community Mental Health team or be
             funded by the Department of Health's National Specialist Commissioning Team scheme for
             severe treatment refectory OCD.

          -  Current active suicidal intent or severe self-neglect that requires hospitalisation.

          -  The patient has a primary problem of compulsive hoarding (as such patients are more
             complex or are more likely to be under a Community Mental Health team).

          -  Continuing to receive another form of psychotherapy.

          -  Has received CBT for OCD in the past year.

          -  A participant may be taking an anti-depressant for OCD but must be on a stable dose
             for at least 12 weeks prior to entry in the trial with no plans to alter the dose
             during the trial period. There must also be no plan to commence on an anti-depressant
             or anti-psychotic medication. (Participants excluded because of their current or
             planned medication may be offered a further assessment for the trial after being on a
             stable dose
