    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Vortioxetine in an adult
      population with a diagnosis of PD. PD is generally treated with benzodiazepines which are
      very effective but have a high risk for addiction, fall, and cognitive impairment. There is
      still a need for better treatment for PD for longer term use. There are other drugs within
      the SSRI/SNRI class which have proven to be effective in treating patients with this
      diagnosis.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Vortioxetine (5, 10, or
      20mg) over a period of 10 weeks in subjects with PD, with or without Agoraphobia. The
      efficacy of Vortioxetine will be evaluated using the Mean Change from Baseline in the Panic
      Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score and the reduction in occurrence of panic attacks as
      measured by item 1 in the PDSS Scale after 10 weeks of treatment with Vortioxetine. This
      study is an open-label, adaptive study with flexible dose strategies lasting 10 weeks.
      Approximately 20 male and female subjects over the age of 18aged 18-60 years who currently
      meet DSM-IV criteria for PD with or without Agoraphobia or who have a PDSS score &gt; 8 at
      Baseline will be enrolled in this study.
