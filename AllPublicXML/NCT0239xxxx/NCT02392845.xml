  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of a densified regimen of the association of
      docetaxel (DTX) and epirubicin (EPI), supported by the concomitant administration of
      hematopoietic growth factors in patients with metastatic breast cancer in first-line,
      optimizing in each patient the administration schedule using a formal procedure based on
      mathematical models in order to manage the severity of induced neutropenia.

      The models used in this project allow:

        -  an optimal administration schedule of the planned total dose per cycle (number of
           infusions and calculating their rates and durations)

        -  an individualization of the administration schedule from the second cycle (based on
           observations from the first cycle), and

        -  an assessment of the risk of a dose-limiting toxicity event combining several severe
           non-hematological toxicities (conditioning the decision for dose escalation).

      Using formal mathematical models the investigators expect controlling the hematological and
      non-hematological toxicities in order to realize the full series of six cycles of densified
      DTX+EPI chemotherapy (2 weeks per cycle) for each patient. For each patient, chemotherapy is
      considered feasible if it is possible, in the absence of tumor progression, to consider 6
      cycles of treatment without observing any serious adverse events and without:

        -  patient death that may be related to the treatments;

        -  decision of the patient to interrupt treatment for physical or psychological tolerance
           reasons;

        -  decision of the investigator to discontinue treatment, in the absence of disease
           progression.
