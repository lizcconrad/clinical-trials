  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health issue and its association with insulin resistance greatly
      increases risks for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Exercise training is
      recommended for obese populations, but longitudinal studies indicate aerobic exercise
      training in obese individuals in the absence of weight loss has minimal impact on insulin
      resistance. High turnover of fat stored within muscle cells (i.e., intramyocellular
      triglyceride) during exercise and elevated muscle fitness (i.e., muscle oxidative capacity)
      are key features of the enhanced insulin sensitivity observed in endurance-trained
      individuals. It could be that longitudinal studies of exercise training in obese individuals
      failed to sufficiently stimulate intramyocellular triglyceride turnover during exercise and
      muscle oxidative adaptation as a result of failure to consider the impact of recent nutrition
      within their study designs. Performing exercise in the fed vs. fasted state can blunt these
      exercise responses in non-obese individuals. The researchers will investigate the hypothesis
      that an acute bout of aerobic exercise performed in the overnight-fasted versus fed-state can
      stimulate greater intramyocellular triglyceride utilization during exercise and enhanced
      expression of genes related to muscle oxidative adaptation in obese individuals. The expected
      outcomes will help to determine if exercising in the fasted state could be used to optimise
      metabolic adaptation to training in obese individuals. The future impact of this research
      could be the recommendation of a simple nutritional strategy considering meal timing to
      enhance the effects of aerobic exercise training in obese individuals, with potential
      long-term benefits for reducing insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic disease risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two thirds of the adult US population is overweight or obese and the prevention and treatment
      of obesity is a key priority due to the strain on societal health, well-being and economic
      prosperity. Obesity is associated with insulin resistance characterized by a reduced ability
      of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and by hyperglycaemia. Obesity
      and insulin resistance are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
      Weight loss through caloric restriction and increasing physical activity levels are the
      mainstay of non-surgical/pharmacological treatment for obesity. Weight loss can reduce
      insulin resistance although sustainable weight loss is difficult to achieve. Physical
      activity can help with weight maintenance but perhaps surprisingly, carefully controlled
      longitudinal studies in obese patients indicate aerobic exercise training in the absence of
      weight loss has no or at best modest impact on peripheral insulin resistance.

      One mechanism by which regular aerobic exercise training ensures high peripheral insulin
      sensitivity in endurance trained individuals is via stimulation of intramyocellular
      triglyceride turnover and muscle fat oxidation, which maintains low muscle levels of fatty
      acid metabolites known to interfere with insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake (e.g.,
      fatty acyl CoA, diacyglycerols, ceramides). Indirect evidence suggests intramyocellular
      triglyceride can be utilized as fuel during aerobic exercise in obese individuals, at least
      in the overnight-fasted state. However, the influence of overnight-fasted vs. fed-state
      exercise on intramyocellular triglyceride utilization and muscle oxidative adaptation has not
      been studied in obesity. This is important to study as fed-state exercise, as compared to
      overnight-fasted exercise, blunts exercise-associated increases in intramyocellular
      triglyceride utilization, oxidative gene expression, long-term adaptation of muscle oxidative
      capacity and resistance to high fat diet induced impairments in oral glucose tolerance in
      lean individuals.

      Thus, the presence or timing of recent nutrition with respect to exercise could be a critical
      factor explaining the inability of aerobic exercise training per se to improve peripheral
      insulin sensitivity in longitudinal studies in obese populations. Exercising in the
      overnight-fasted state could optimize metabolic adaptation to training in obese individuals
      with long-term benefits for reduced insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic disease risk.
