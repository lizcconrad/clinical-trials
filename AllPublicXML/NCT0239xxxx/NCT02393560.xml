  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine presence and volume of monosodium urate (MSU)
      crystal deposits as determined by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) imaging in gout
      subjects treated with allopurinol with and without visible tophi.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DECT is a technique that enables visualization of MSU crystal deposits by analysis of the
      chemical composition of the scanned materials. This study will determine the extent of MSU
      crystal volume in the hands/wrists, feet/ankles, and knees as determined by DECT of subjects
      with gout taking a dose of at least 300 mg allopurinol daily for the past 12 weeks.

      Patients with gout on allopurinol with and without tophi to be assessed using DECT imaging
      for crystal deposition with assessments, which include patient and provider assessments of
      disease severity and pain, prior to and after the scan.

      Whole blood sample may be used for optional genetic testing in subjects who give consent.
      Serum aliquots will be collected and may be used for the analysis of potential analytes and
      biomarkers, but may not be used for genetic testing without the subject's written consent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is able to understand the study procedures, the risks involved and willing to
             provide written informed consent before the first study related activity.

          -  Subject is willing to adhere to the visit/protocol schedules.

          -  Subject meets the diagnosis of gout as per the American Rheumatism Association
             Criteria for the Classification of Acute Arthritis of Primary Gout.

          -  Subject has been taking allopurinol at a dose of at least 300 mg daily for at least 12
             weeks prior to Day 1, as the sole uratelowering therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Subject with any other medical or psychological condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator and/or Medical Monitor, might create undue risk to the subject or
             interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the protocol requirements
             (including dual energy computed tomography imaging), or to complete the study.

          -  Subject who has received an investigational therapy or has participated in any
             clinical trial or research study within 30 days of Day 1.

          -  Subject who has taken pegloticase (KRYSTEXXAÂ®) or is expected to take pegloticase
             during the study.
