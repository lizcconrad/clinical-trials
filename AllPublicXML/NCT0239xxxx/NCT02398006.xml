  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Fracture of the clavicle is common accounting for 2.6% to 4 % of all fractures,
      with an overall incidence of 36.5 to 64 per 100,000 per year. Around 80% of clavicle
      fractures occur in the middle third of the clavicle. There is a lack of evidence of
      randomised controlled trials assessing the best treatment of these fractures. The objective
      of this study is to evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions:
      figure-of-eight bandage versus sling for the treating middle third clavicle fractures.
      Methods/Design: this project has been designed as a single-centre, parallel-group randomised
      controlled trial that will compare figure-of-eight bandage versus sling. The investigators
      aim to recruit 110 adults, aged 18 years or older, with an acute (less than 10 days) middle
      third clavicle fracture. Primary outcomes will be function or disability measured by DASH
      questionnaire; the secondary outcomes will be: modified UCLA score pain, treatment failure,
      adverse events and numbers returning to previous activities. Data analysis: the chi-square
      test will be used to analyse the results of categorical variables, and Student t-test will be
      used to compare groups with respect to the numerical variables. The Student t-test is used to
      compare the clinical outcome of each group at 1, 2 and 4 weeks and at 6 and 12 months after
      the intervention. The significance level of 5% (alpha = 0.05) is used for all statistical
      tests such that tests have a value of less than 0.05 are considered statistically
      significant. Discussion: According to current evidence there is very limited evidence from
      two single trials only regarding the effectiveness of different methods of conservative
      interventions for treating clavicle fractures. This study is one of the first randomised
      controlled trials following the CONSORT statements designed to compare two conservative
      methods for treating clavicle fractures (figure-of-eight versus sling).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whilst there are several options for conservative treatment for middle third clavicle
      fractures, only two randomised controlled published in the 80s attempted to determine the
      effects of different methods for conservative treatment for middle third clavicle fractures.
      Thus, a pragmatic trial design has been chosen as it can directly inform clinical practice;
      our inclusion criteria will reflect the variety in patient presentations that would be
      encountered by general orthopaedic surgeons in the clinical setting. The current trial
      includes design characteristics known to minimise bias. Participants will be assigned using a
      concealed random procedure, assessments and data analysis will be blinded and we will use the
      intention-to-treat analysis.

    <description>Function or disability will be measured by DASH - Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire validated and translated into Portuguese in Brazil, the final score of the DASH questionnaire will be converted to a percentage via the following formula: Scoring = [Sum of answers n/n - 1] X 25, where n is the number of complete answers. The two optional modules will not be measured. The value obtained will be directly proportional to the percentage of impairment of the limb function.</description>

    <description>Pain measured on a 0 to 100 using visual analogue scale (VAS) (with 0 indicating no pain and 100 indicating the maximum pain). As reported in the literature, a clinically important change will be considered as a 30% or more change in pain score.</description>

    <measure>Treatment failure measured by the number of participants who have undergone or are being considered a surgical intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure measured by the number of participants who have undergone or are being considered a surgical intervention (e.g. symptomatic non-union or malunion with intractable pain). Although studies evaluating patients with fractures without displacement reported low rates of nonunion (about 0.03%), studies with patients with displaced fractures found nonunion rates of up to 15%. Therefore, we expect between 5 and 10% of our participants might provide symptomatic nonunion during follow-up. Patients who experience this complication during follow-up study will be treated surgically with open reduction and internal fixation with pre-contoured locking plate counted down the superior surface of the clavicle and bone grafting when necessary.</description>

    <description>Group 1: the orthopaedic surgeon will apply a standard arm sling that will be used for four weeks; however, during these weeks, participants will be encouraged to discard the sling when their pain has subsided. After four weeks the same orientations of group 1 will be done to this group.</description>

    <description>Group 2: a figure-of-eight bandage will be used for four weeks, and every week the participants will return to check and adjust the immobilisation. In this way, the dominant hand can remain free and simple activities will be allowed (writing, keyboarding and other). After four weeks, participants will be encouraged to discard the bandage, but load bearing will not be allowed before osseous consolidation (around 10 weeks).</description>
