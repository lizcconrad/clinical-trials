  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) may result in physical deficits that require assistance from others
      in order to stay healthy and live independently in a community. The assistance provided by
      caregivers to a family member with SCI often involves a wide range of activities from helping
      with basic activities, like toileting and bathing, to managing more complex tasks, such as
      keeping up with household finances, shopping, and transportation. Caregiving puts demands on
      an individual's ability to cope and deal with day-to-day stresses, and may be influenced by
      personal beliefs about one's ability to cope with stress. Beliefs about our ability to
      perform tasks that affect our lives have been termed &quot;self-efficacy&quot;. A strong sense of
      self-efficacy has been shown to positively impact life choices, motivation, quality of
      functioning, resilience to adversity, and vulnerability to stress and depression. People with
      low self-efficacy tend to avoid challenges, discontinue tasks that are difficult, and be at
      risk for more depression and stress, resulting in less satisfaction with life.

      This study uses a psychological strategy, called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), to
      enhance self-efficacy skills for caregivers of family members with SCI, with a focus on
      changing thinking styles to help people make emotional and behavioral changes. The
      investigators hypothesize that by providing family caregivers with a six week group
      educational intervention, their self-efficacy skills as well as general life satisfaction can
      be improved, and minimize depression, stress and anxiety that often accompany the caregiving
      role. The innovation of the proposed intervention is its integration of positive
      psychotherapy concepts into structured group CBT to develop optimistic self-efficacy beliefs,
      strengthen the caregiver's ability to deal with day-to-day stress, and enhance a sense of
      well-being in the caregiver which, in turn, may benefit the family member with SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) may result in physical limitations such that receiving assistance
      from others is critical to maintaining health and facilitating full social integration. The
      assistance ranges from helping with basic daily activities such as bowel and bladder
      management, hygiene and dressing, to instrumental activities of daily living, including
      managing household finances, shopping, or transportation. The challenges that accompany a
      caregiving role may result in a caregiver's inability to balance responsibilities at home and
      in the workplace. In addition, there is a tendency for caregivers to neglect their own
      health, which may jeopardize the ability of the person with SCI to obtain the necessary care
      and support required for optimal independent functioning. Vulnerability and resilience to the
      ongoing stresses associated with caregiving for a loved one with SCI may be influenced by
      personal beliefs about the caregiver's capabilities for coping with them. People's belief
      about their capabilities for successfully performing tasks that affect their lives has been
      termed &quot;self-efficacy&quot;.

      For family caregivers of individuals with SCI, self-efficacy beliefs are essential for coping
      with the stressors that are experienced in the caregiving role. Anxiety, depression, and a
      sense of &quot;losing&quot; one's own identity are frequently reported by family caregivers. However,
      there has been relatively little research regarding caregiving in SCI and even fewer
      treatment options to enhance self-efficacy for these caregivers. The proposed study involves
      a randomized clinical trial to examine the effect of an intervention specifically designed by
      and for family caregivers to help improve self-efficacy and reduce emotional distress
      associated with it. The goal of this project is to test a six-week manualized,
      cognitive-behaviorally based group educational intervention to improve family caregivers'
      self-efficacy beliefs and skills, improve their resilience to the ongoing stresses associated
      with caregiving, and enhance their overall quality of life with the potential added benefit
      of improving the quality of life for their family members with SCI. Investigators hypothesize
      that by providing family caregivers with this educational intervention, the intervention can
      improve their self-efficacy skills as well as general life satisfaction, and minimize
      depression, stress and anxiety associated with caregiving. The proposed intervention consists
      of weekly facilitator-led sessions for a total of 6 weeks and includes didactic presentations
      of 8 key principles, discussion topics and experiential exercises such as goal setting and
      problem solving with extensive group discussion. At the end of each session, tasks are
      assigned to participants to be completed outside the group prior to the next meeting. Session
      content is organized around concepts of identifying and building character strengths,
      cultivating positive emotion through focusing on gratitude and on the good in one's life,
      experientially engaging in pleasurable activities, and accomplishing personal goals. The
      innovation of the proposed intervention lies in its integration of positive psychotherapy
      concepts into structured group CBT to develop optimistic self-efficacy beliefs, thereby
      strengthening the caregiver's resilience to emotional distress, enhancing a sense of
      well-being in the caregiver which, in turn, may benefit the family member with SCI.
