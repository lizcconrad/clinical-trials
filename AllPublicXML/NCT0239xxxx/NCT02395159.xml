      Comparison of the Prevena™ IMS with the standard wound management method of sterile plaster
      in vascular surgery patients.

      The aim is to demonstrate that the application of the Prevena™ IMS significantly reduces the
      incidence of postoperative wound infections. The wound infections will be classified
      according to Szilagyi.

      The treatment phase begins following vascular surgery with wound management using either the
      Prevena™ IMS or a standard wound dressing, depending on the group to which the patient was
      randomly assigned. It involves a minimum stay of 7 and maximum 10 days in hospital.

    <description>Prevena™ IMS is intended for the management of the surgical incision environment and surrounding healthy skin in patients with a risk of postoperative complications such as infections. This entails the maintenance of a closed environment around the incision by applying a negative pressure wound therapy system.
The corresponding dressing is known under the name Prevena™ Dressing. The layer closest to the skin comprises silver foil, which reduces the microbial colonisation of cells.</description>
