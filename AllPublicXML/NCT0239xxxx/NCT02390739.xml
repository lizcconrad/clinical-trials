      Background

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patient with
      metastatic thyroid cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing
      them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a
      type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to
      the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying
      the patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-thyroglobulin
      incorporated in the retrovirus.

      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified
      cells) that express the receptor for the thyroglobulin molecule on their surface can cause
      thyroid tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.

      Eligibility:

      &lt;TAB&gt;Adults 18 and older with thyroid cancer that has the thyroglobulin molecule on tumor
      surfaces

      Design:

      &lt;TAB&gt;Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and
      undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as
      needed

      &lt;TAB&gt;Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will
      undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti- thyroglobulin cells.
      {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the
      patient.}

      &lt;TAB&gt;Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital
      for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-thyroglobulin cells and aldesleukin. They will
      stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

      Follow up:

      Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests,
      and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as
      long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.

      Background:

        -  We generated a murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that recognizes human thyroglobulin (hTG)
           in the context of HLA-A0201 and constructed a single retroviral vector that contains its
           alpha and beta chains and will confer hTG recognition to HLA-A0201+ PBL on transduction.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A0201+, hTG+ target cells, anti-TG mTCR transduced T cells
           secrete significant amounts of IFN- &gt;= with high specificity.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with this anti-TG mTCR in
           concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;
           aldesleukin).

        -  Determine if these mTCR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of TG-expressing
           tumors.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-A*0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have

      -Advanced TG-expressing thyroid cancer (including those with bone-only disease) which has
      progressed after surgery (if indicated) and radioiodine ablation

      Patients may not have:

      -Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant
           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-TG mTCR.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  On day 0 patients will receive their PBL transduced with the anti-TG mTCR and then begin
           high dose aldesleukin.

        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted approximately 4-6 weeks
           after treatment.

        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design.

        -  The objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin,
           lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-TG mTCR-gene engineered lymphocytes is able
           to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor
           of a modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).

        -  A total of up to 68 patients may be required; approximately 25 patients in the phase I
           portion of the study and 43 (41, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable) patients in
           the phase II portion of the study.

               3. Confirmation of diagnosis of thyroid cancer by the Laboratory of Pathology of the
                  NCI.

               4. PET avid disease with SUV &gt;5.

               5. Patients must have previously received standard systemic therapy for advanced
                  thyroid cancer (to include radioactive iodine for iodine-avid tumors and surgery
                  (if indicated)) and have been either non-responders (progressive disease) or have
                  recurred.

               6. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and
                  asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic
                  radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the
                  patient to be eligible.

               7. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of
                  age.

               8. Willing to sign a durable power of attorney

               9. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document

              10. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1

              11. Life expectancy of greater than three months

              14. Serology:

          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If
             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the presence of
             antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

             o. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

             p. Hematology

          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm3 without the support of filgrastim

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to to 1.5 mg/dl, except in patients with Gilbert s
             Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

             r. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients toxicities must have
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).

        Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks, as
        long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined

             Immunodeficiency Disease).

          3. Active systemic infections (e.g. : requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation
             disorders or other major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or
             immune system, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive
             pulmonary disease.

          4. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          5. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy.

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide or
             fludarabine.
