    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of its total hip arthroplasty (THA) European Union (EU) .
      These types of studies are required by regulatory authorities for all THA devices that do not
      have clinical evidence available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU. This
      study has been designed in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev 2.
