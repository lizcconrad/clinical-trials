    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain results from damage to or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous
      system, rather than stimulation of pain receptors. Diagnosis is suggested by pain out of
      proportion to tissue injury, dysesthesia (eg, burning, tingling), and signs of nerve injury
      detected during neurologic examination. Although neuropathic pain responds to opioids,
      treatment is often with adjuvant drugs (eg, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, baclofen,
      topical drugs). Neuropathic pain (e.g. phantom limb pain, CRPS, postherpetic neuralgia,
      postsurgical pain syndromes, CLBP etc.) remains a challenging condition to treat because it
      is commonly refractory to classical pharmacological and to surgical treatment approaches.
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a widespread and costly problem for which few interventions
      are effective. An increased focus on the study of the nervous system and its involvement in
      pain disorders has documented complex neuronal activity and structural changes at a
      peripheral, as well as at spinal cord and cortical levels indicating a neuropathic element in
      CLBP. Accumulated evidence suggests that neuropathic pain in general and CLBP specifically
      might be associated to brain cortical plastic changes. Thus an ideal rehabilitative approach
      should aim to reverse them. In line with this idea, the investigators suggest an innovative
      noninvasive intervention aimed at alleviating neuropathic pain. New rehabilitative approaches
      have been proposed to try and reverse this cortical reorganization. Results of several
      studies have shown that motor cortex stimulation with epidural electrodes or repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) are
      effective in reducing pain in patients with central pain refractory to treatment.
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an easily applied and safe technique by
      which brain activity can be modulated noninvasively and can decrease pain in patients with
      refractory central pain. The investigators hypothesized that focal-tDCS treatment personally
      customized to each patients basal neuronal network properties would result in both acute and
      long term pain relief for neuropathic pain patients.

    <description>Each patient will undergo initial diagnosis with NIBS algorithm utilizing EEG measurements combined with TMS. Initial diagnosis will last 10 minutes in which EEG measurement will be recorded 5 minutes and then in combination with TMS for another 5 minutes with no more than 500 TMS stimuli applied to cortex at low frequency of up to 5Hz. EEG recording will be analyzed by NIBS algorithm which will propose a course of treatment with the following limitations: stimulation of 2mA (32, 33) current after 30 seconds ramp up of 0.1mA increments, 20 min for each session, twice a week</description>
