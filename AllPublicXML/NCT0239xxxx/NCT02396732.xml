  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of antiplatelet therapy (i.e.
      aspirin) to low-molecular-weight-heparin (i.e. enoxaparin) will decrease the incidence of
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk critically injured patients. The investigators
      further aim to determine the safety and efficacy of dual thromboprophylaxis with aspirin and
      enoxaparin for decreasing the incidence of VTE after trauma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial evaluating the
      effect of dual thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin and aspirin versus enoxaparin alone on the
      incidence of VTE in trauma patients. Once a trauma patient is admitted to the Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU), study personnel will screen for entry criteria and, if eligible, will obtain
      informed consent from the patient or healthcare proxy. After informed consent, subjects will
      be randomized into one of 2 groups to receive either standard of care with enoxaparin alone
      (control group) or dual thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin plus aspirin (intervention group).
      Alternative thromboprophylaxis will be permitted prior to consent or randomization or at
      anytime at the discretion of the attending physician for any reason. Standard drug dosages
      will be used (enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneous twice daily; aspirin 81 mg oral daily).

      All consented subjects will be followed from admission until discharge from the hospital.
      Data collection will include demographic information, injury pattern, mechanism of injury,
      need for surgical intervention, admission and daily laboratory values (e.g. basic metabolic
      profile, complete blood count, coagulation studies, ROTEM), weekly venous duplex
      ultrasonography (VDU), admission and subsequent radiologic examinations, medication
      administration records (including missed doses of thromboprophylaxis), and outcomes measures
      (complications, VTE, mortality). Blood samples for complete blood count and coagulation
      studies will be ordered as medically necessary per the primary team; ROTEM samples will be
      taken pre-prophylaxis and post-prophylaxis and will be run in the Trauma Research Office. The
      amount drawn will not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg in an 8 week period and
      collection will not occur more frequently than 2 times per week.

      All clinical care will be at the discretion of the attending physician. Should the attending
      physician choose to change thromboprophylaxis medication, this will be permitted for the
      study and included in the data collection. Discontinuation of thromboprophylaxis generally
      occurs in a standardized fashion once the patient is fully ambulatory; however, should the
      attending physician stray from this regimen, it is permitted for the study and will be part
      of the data collection.

      For each patient admitted to the ICU and eligible for study participation, routine measures
      already obtained by clinical staff will be collected/calculated.
