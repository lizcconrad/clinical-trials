      No standard way exists to measure the quality of medical care or independent living long-term
      services and supports provided to persons with disabilities. This project will: provide a
      broader picture of how consumers with disabilities define care and care quality; measure the
      value of using consumers' expertise in developing, collecting, and assessing quality
      measures; and use this information to assist One Care providers in improving care delivered
      to their enrollees

      The aims of the project are as follows:

        1. To work with persons with significant physical disabilities and serious and persistent
           mental illness to develop two new approaches to assess quality of care:

           Approach #1: We will survey enrollees about their experiences in One Care and their
           thoughts about the care they receive. This survey will also ask One Care enrollees about
           how they manage their care and what self-direction means to them. The survey will be
           called the Persons with Disabilities Quality Survey (PDQ-S), and it will be available in
           English and Spanish versions.

           Approach #2: Enrollees in One Care will provide information about their perceptions of
           care quality to a trained team of persons with disabilities who will report the
           information to One Care care teams. The goal of the activity is to support quality
           improvement in One Care through hearing the consumer's voice. This is called YES Health
           - Your Experience: Speak up for better health care.

        2. We want to test how providing consumer informed and consumer directed quality
           information to One Care providers affects One Care quality.

        3. We want to improve the ability of One Care enrollees to manage their own health care and
           to recognize and report quality problems

    <masking_description>Randomization was performed at the level of primary care practice.

    <description>The PDQ-S is a consumer driven survey that reflects the perceptions of One Care enrollees. The survey will be administered prior to the intervention (wave 1) and again one year later (wave 2) to determine if experiences within One Care have improved.</description>

    <description>Initiative created by persons with disabilities for persons with disabilities to actively engage in collecting, analyzing and reporting on quality of care from the consumer perspective. The purpose is to engage eligible enrollees to answer brief surveys surrounding various themes about the care and experiences they receive through One Care. Subsequent brief, actionable reports are fed back to primary care provider practices randomized to this arm.</description>
