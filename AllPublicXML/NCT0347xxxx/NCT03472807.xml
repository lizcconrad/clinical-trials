  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Other than high-dose radiation and previous chemotherapy, few strong risk factors have been
      identified as causes of childhood cancer. Geneticists estimate that 5 to 10% of all cancers
      diagnosed during the paediatric period occur in children born with a genetic mutation,
      increasing their lifetime risk of neoplasia. Such genetic risk is higher in children with
      congenital anomalies and specific genetic syndromes. Some germline genetic alterations are
      well known (e.g. P53 protein (P53), Neurofibromatosis type 1(NF1)), however many children
      with none of these mutations have clinical presentations that strongly suggest the
      involvement of a genetic predisposition. Comprehensive genetic testing for all such patients
      is an important factor for improving disease surveillance. Such opportunities are now
      available thanks to whole exome sequencing (WES). In oncology, an important clinical
      application of WES will be to routinely identify mutations associated with inherited cancer
      predispositions and to guide cancer risk-management decisions.

      Our project is a national translational multicenter genetics study aimed at identifying genes
      involved in paediatric cancer predisposition by WES in a very select population of children
      with both developmental delay and cancer. Our project relies on the TED register (Tumeur Et
      Développement), an initiative by the French organisation SFCE (Société Française de lutte
      contre les Cancers et les leucémies de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent) involving 30 child cancer
      units in France. This database includes the information of more than 500 paediatric cancer
      patients with congenital abnormalities. The investigators plan to sequence the germline and
      tumour exome of 100 patients with developmental delay in a trio-design consisting of 300
      people and 100 tumours.

      The investigators believe that the ExoCaRe project will provide answers to the genetic
      origins of certain particular childhood cancers. The ExoCaRe project relies on a genetic
      study to identify genetic risk factors for rare forms of childhood cancer and aims to
      establish more personalised treatment. It is aimed at improving genetic counselling for
      families and will be fully integrated in the genetic counselling process. The information
      provided by our study will be used to improve the management approach to an initial cancer by
      clarifying the risks of other cancers in related families. The investigators hope to identify
      new germline genes predisposing to cancer that will be of interest in understanding tumour
      biology.

      -Primary objective : Our aim is to identify new mutations and genes involved in paediatric
      cancer predisposition associating developmental delay by WES of a sub-cohort of patients
      included in the TED database.

      -Secondary objectives :

        1. Describe inherited predisposition to cancer.

        2. Improve genetic counselling processes.

        3. Initiate clinical exome sequencing in childhood cancer treatment.
