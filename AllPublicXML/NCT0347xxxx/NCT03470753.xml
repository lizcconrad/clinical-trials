  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients seeking care for chronic low back or knee pain will be recruited for enrollment, and
      randomized within two phases (retention and compliance). Patients will consent to a 2-step
      study design, with independent randomization for each. The initial step will assess retention
      based on 4 different exercise prescription strategies. This will be assessed short-term, and
      then the 2nd step will consist of a second independent randomization to receive different
      reminder strategies to determine their influence on exercise compliance at home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients seeking care for their chronic low back or knee pain will be recruited to
      participate in a trial investigating the value of different exercise and education
      prescription strategies as well as strategies to determine the influence of various exercise
      reminder strategies. On day 1 of enrollment, patients will be randomized and instructed in
      two different types and amounts of exercises, as well as two types of delivery strategies.
      The ability to recall and perform these exercises will be assessed 20 minutes after
      completion of the instructional period (retention). In phase 2, patients will be randomized
      to receive different reminder strategies (none, email, text, and/or video) and their
      compliance assessed over a 1 month period (compliance). Self-reported compliance over the
      first month, and health care utilization outcomes will be analyzed for the 1 year following
      completion of the 1 month period, in all groups.

    <time_frame>1-month</time_frame>
    <description>This survey consists of a total of 9 questions, 5 of them modified from the Short Form-36. It asks questions related to the subject's perception of their physical health. The first 5 questions are related to the subject's perception of ability to return to work or full duty, the need for additional healthcare for their current condition, and function at the level that they feel is expected of them. The final 4 questions ask about their perception of general physical health.</description>
