  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liquid biopsy has been widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors, and cfDNA has
      always been a hot spot in clinical research. Previous studies have shown that cfDNA may be
      associated with postoperative recurrence of gastric cancer, but it is rarely reported whether
      cfDNA is associated with the survival of gastric cancer. The purpose of this study was to
      assess the relationship between cfDNA and survival in advanced gastric cancer
