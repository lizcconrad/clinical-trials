  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower respiratory tract infection is the most common cause of acute exacerbations of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Patients diagnosed with pneumonia in addition to an
      AECOPD experience more severe clinical and laboratory disease manifestations, increase
      in-hospital morbidity and worse outcome. Clinicians have sought for new biomarkers that
      together with clinical assessments can improve the diagnostic accuracy of pneumonia in
      patients with AECOPD.The aim of the present study is to compare the accuracy of calprotectin
      with procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC).

      The standard hospital procedures were followed for collection and processing of blood for the
      analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Additional blood
      samples for calprotectin were obtained at admission (T0) and 6 (T1), 24 (T2) and 48 (T3)
      hours post admission. Serum specimens for the calprotectin analysis were stored at minus 70°C
      until they were analyzed.

        Patients admitted to the Department of Thoracic Medicine at Trondheim University Hospital
        (TUH) due to an AECOPD, age &gt; 18years old. (EU). The patients were examined at the
        Emergency Unit and included in the study if they had a COPD diagnosis previously confirmed
        by spirometry according to the GOLD criteria and a clinically confirmed AECOPD
