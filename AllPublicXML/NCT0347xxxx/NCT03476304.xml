  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caries disease is still the leading cause of severe tooth decay. Since this can lead to tooth
      loss, it is important that appropriate treatment is advised to help prevent damage and
      maintain tooth health. Faced with major coronary destruction, several times it becomes
      necessary to perform the endodontic treatment, aiming to maintain the element in the buccal
      cavity for longer. It is known that an excellent restorative treatment with poor endodontic
      treatment and the inverse has a direct impact on the (in) success of the treatment. In this
      context, the proper cleaning of the root canals is highlighted, aiming the removal of
      bacteria and toxins. Acceptable restorations are those that provide adequate reestablishment
      of anatomy, function, proximal contacts, and occlusal stability. Traditionally, indirect
      restorations would be indicated in cases of extensive coronary destruction, because it was
      believed that they would present greater resistance and longevity when compared to direct
      restorations. However, contemporary dentistry admits that, thanks to adhesive and
      conservative principles, this difference between direct and indirect procedures in terms of
      longevity is not significant. The classic restorative procedure in cases of endodontically
      treated teeth with great loss of coronary structure involves the use of intraradicular
      retainers, followed by the creation of core and restoration through total crowns. Removal of
      healthy tissue for the use of posts can weaken the remaining dental structure and increase
      the risk of root perforations. In this sense, endocrown restorations show superiority when
      compared to those made with intraradicular retainers. Although the indications are favorable
      for the use of endocrown restorations, the clinical evidence available on the subject is
      still scarce. In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, patients who need and meet the
      inclusion criteria will will be allocated to one of the three restorative groups available,
      being endocrown restoration in semi-direct composite resin, direct restoration in composite
      resin retained on the post and ceramic crown retained in the post. Patients will be monitored
      annually after completion of restorative treatment outcome. In addition to treatment
      longevity, other secondary outcomes will be evaluated, such as patient satisfaction, impact
      on quality of life and cost-effectiveness of the proposed treatments.
