  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal for this prospective randomized controlled trial (PRCT) is to determine
      whether a virtual-environment, home-rehabilitation program improves functional outcomes for
      individuals after a burn injury. Specifically, this study will test the efficacy of a
      technology-assisted rehabilitation program against current standard of home therapy.

      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial (PRCT) involving 50 adult burn survivors.
      This study tests the efficacy of a technology-assisted rehabilitation program against current
      standard of home therapy. There are two study groups for which subjects will be randomized:
      control and experimental.The control group will receive treatment as usual, which includes a
      personalized home exercise program prescribed by a burn therapist, prior to hospital
      discharge. The experimental group receives treatment as usual, in addition to training and
      use of the Jintronix platform for 3 months after hospital discharge. Participants will
      undergo their prescribed therapy regimen for 3 months, with outcomes follow-up to 12 months
      post-discharge.
