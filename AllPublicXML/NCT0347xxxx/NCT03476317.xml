  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a novel gut microbiota-targeted
      therapeutic regimen (bowel lavage and antibiotics with or without an antifungal) in the
      management of active Crohn's Disease (CD) that is refractory to conventional,
      immunosuppressive therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will evaluate the efficacy of a novel treatment regimen, employing
      non-immunosuppressive medications, in the management of refractory CD. Refractory patients
      include those patients who have experienced loss of responsiveness (LOR) or primary
      nonresponse to an immunomodulator or a biologic. Investigators will treat participants with a
      combination of gut microbiota-targeted therapies to restore a healthy gut microbiome
      composition. Investigators believe that this strategy will both treat the gut inflammation
      associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as salvage response to immune
      suppressive therapies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in disease activity by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be the change in disease activity, as measured by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score, between the enrollment visit and Day 15. All participants who withdraw for any reason prior to day 15 will be considered treatment failures. The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index is a clinical score which takes into account general well being, degree of abdominal pain, number of liquid stools per day, abdominal physical examination, and Crohn's disease complications.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in disease activity by fecal calprotectin (FCP)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The second primary outcome measure will be the change in disease activity, as measured by fecal calprotectin, between the enrollment visit and day 15. The fecal calprotectin is a stool test which measures intestinal inflammation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in C-reactive Protein (CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be the change in C-reactive protein between the enrollment visit and day 15. The C-reactive protein is a blood test which measures systemic inflammation.</description>
