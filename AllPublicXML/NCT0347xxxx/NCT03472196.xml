    <description>The Nitinotes EndoZip system is designed to allow for the creation of multiple internal gastric segmentation (4-8) in the stomach by using an endoscopic approach. The system allows the forming of wall-to-wall longitudinal attachments of the anterior and posterior stomach walls, creating multiple strictures within.
Creation of this segmentation may significantly reduce gastric volume, may affect gastric motility and consequently, reduce weight.</description>
