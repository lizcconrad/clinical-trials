      The study is designed as an open label, single period study in approximately 16-20 patients
      with EB ranging in age from infants/children (ages 6 months - 11 years, inclusive) and
      adolescents/adults (ages 12 and up) with at least 8-10 subjects between the aged 6 months to
      11 years, inclusive (infants/children). Note: US sites will only enroll patients ages 4 and

          -  The subject must weigh at least 9 kg (19.8 lbs) at Screening.

          -  Subject has a documented genetic mutation consistent with EB. A blood or saliva sample

             available.

          -  Subject has EB lesions on â‰¥ 2% body surface area (BSA) and the EB lesions are in the
             following body areas:

               1. Localized: plantar and/or palmar areas

               2. Generalized: arms, legs, torso, hands and feet.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has EB lesions where drug will be applied that are infected (i.e., EB lesions
             that require anti-microbial therapy to treat an infection)

          -  Subject has used any diacerein containing product within 1 month prior to Visit 1

          -  Subject has used systemic immunotherapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy within 60 days prior
             to dosing.

          -  Subject has used systemic steroidal therapy or has used topical steroidal therapy on
             the EB lesions in the application area within 14 days prior to dosing (Note: inhaled,
             nasal sprays, and ophthalmic products containing steroids are allowed)

          -  Subject has participated in an investigational drug trial in which administration of
             an investigational study medication occurred within 30 days prior to dosing
