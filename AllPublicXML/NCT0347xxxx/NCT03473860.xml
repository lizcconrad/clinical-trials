  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the change of total cholesterol content of
      erythrocyte membranes (CEM) in patients with coronary artery disease treated with secondary
      prevention drugs, and the correlation with the prognosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, plasma samples, the red cells and associated clinical data of
      patients with coronary artery disease were collected from Department of Cardiology of Lu'an
      Shili Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University. Blood samples collected
      from all the participants at baseline (prior to the follow-up) and the time points of
      follow-up were placed into ordinary test tubes and stored at 4°C for less than 4 hours. After
      centrifuged, plasma and erythrocyte membranes was separated and stored at -80°C. The change
      of total cholesterol content of erythrocyte membranes (CEM) was measured. A follow-up form
      was designed according to the research purpose and discussed among the team members. The
      follow-up was performed through telephone by the trained investigators with good
      communication skills and knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease.
      Patients were followed up every six months from the day of discharge. The results of the
      follow-up were entered into the database, a process that was carried out by a designated
      person and double-checked by an independent person. The primary clinical endpoints were
      composite atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, defined as nonfatal myocardial
      infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality. Secondary clinical endpoints were
      revascularization, including percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass
      grafting, and Class IV heart failure requiring hospitalization.
