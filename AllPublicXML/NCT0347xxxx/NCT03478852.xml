      Background:

      Epilepsy affects about 1 percent of the U.S. population. Most people with epilepsy respond
      well to medicine, but some do not. Researchers want people who have diagnosed or suspected
      epilepsy to participate in ongoing studies. They want to learn more about clinical care for
      epilepsy. They want fellows and residents to learn more about the care of people with
      epilepsy.

      Objectives:

      To learn more about seizures and find ways to best treat people with drug-resistant epilepsy.

      Eligibility:

      Adults and children ages 8 years and older with diagnosed or suspected epilepsy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Questionnaires

      Participants will have many visits. They may be admitted to the hospital for several weeks.
      Their medication might be stopped or changed.

      Participants will have many tests:

      Blood and urine tests

      EEG: Wires attached to the head with paste record brain waves. This may be videotaped.

      Thinking and memory tests

      MRI: Participants lie on a table that slides in and out of a tube. They perform simple tasks
      in the tube.

      MEG: Participants lie on a table and place their head in a helmet to record brain waves.

      PET scan: Participants lie on a table that slides into a machine. A small amount of
      radioactive dye is injected into their arm with an IV. For the IV, a small tube is inserted
      into the arm with a needle.

      Participants will stay enrolled in this study if they join other epilepsy-related studies.
      They may be contacted at intervals for follow-up. Their participation will end if they have
      not been seen clinically for their epilepsy for 3 years.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective is to screen patients who are referred to the NIH with a known or
      suspected diagnosis of epilepsy for eligibility to participate in ongoing epilepsy-related
      protocols. The secondary objectives are to provide standard of care evaluation and treatment
      of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, to provide training for clinical fellows in the
      evaluation and treatment of epilepsy and related disorders, and to allow for descriptive
      and/or correlational studies based on the data collected through clinical care of these
      patients.

      Study Population:

      Adults and children age 8 years and older referred with a known or suspected diagnosis of
      epilepsy.

      Design:

      Participants in this protocol will be evaluated by study investigators with standard
      diagnostic clinical studies as clinically indicated to fully characterize their seizures and
      related clinical features. Testing may include history and neurologic examination, blood
      tests including antiepileptic drug levels, clinical neurophysiology testing, structural and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, FDG-PET (performed by nuclear
      medicine as a clinical procedure), and neuropsychological testing. Patients may be evaluated
      in an outpatient or inpatient setting or both as clinically indicated. Clinical medical
      management of epilepsy will be performed under this protocol. Follow up will be performed as
      clinically indicated.

      Outcome Measures:

      Patients will be screened for eligibility for epilepsy-related research protocols. In
      addition, patients with epilepsy will be evaluated and treated, clinical fellows will obtain
      training in the care of patients with epilepsy, and samples and/or data obtained through
      clinical care will be used for descriptive and/or correlative research.
