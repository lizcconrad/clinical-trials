    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAB001 in subjects with
      various advanced malignancies and to evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose.

      The secondary objectives are to: 1) describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TAB001, 2)
      evaluate antitumor activity of TAB001; 3) determine the immunogenicity of TAB001 , and 4)
      evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of TAB001 on its target receptor, programmed cell death 1
      (PD-1), as well as effects on the immune system.

      The exploratory objectives are to: 1) evaluate biomarkers that may correlate with activity of
      TAB001, 2) evaluate the utility of PD-L1 &amp; additional exploratory markers as biomarkers that
      could aid in selection of appropriate subjects for TAB001 therapy, and 3) identification of
      additional biomarkers correlating with response to treatment with TAB001.

      OVERVIEW: This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TAB001, a
      humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody targeting the Programmed Death -1 (PD-1). It is estimated
      that up to 78 subjects with advanced malignancies will be enrolled in the study. Subjects
      must have an advanced solid malignancy that is refractory to standard therapy or for which no
      standard therapy exists.

      The study has 2 parts. In Part A, up to 18 subjects will be enrolled who have not received
      prior immunotherapy for their cancer. Three dose levels are planned and include: 80, 240 and
      480 mg/dose. Part A will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 or 6 subjects per dose level
      (cohort) and will receive their assigned dose every 14 days in the absence of a dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) that would prevent further dosing. Subjects will be assigned to a dose level
      in the order of study entry.

      If no DLTs occur in a cohort of 3 subjects, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at the
      next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 subjects in a dose level experiences a DLT, that dose level
      will be expanded to 6 subjects. If only 1 of the 6 subjects has a DLT, then the next cohort
      of 3 subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level. If 2 or more DLTs occur within a
      cohort, then that dose level will be above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the previous
      lower tolerated dose level will be considered the MTD.

      In Part B, up to 60 subjects will be enrolled. Solid tumors may include, but will not be
      limited to, esophageal and gastric carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, endometrial cancer,
      soft tissue sarcoma, or other orphan tumors who have received at least one line of therapy in
      the metastatic setting. Subjects must not have received more than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic
      chemotherapy.

      Tumor response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST v1.1) and the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).

      In the absence of confirmed disease progression and intolerable toxicities, subjects will be
      allowed to continue TAB001 administration every 14 days .

      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION TAB001 doses are 80, 240 and 480 mg. TAB001 will be administered as
      a 60-minute i.v. infusion for the first 2 doses and may be decreased at the investigators
      discretion to 30 minutes in subsequent infusions.

      SAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements,
      clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
      evaluations, diagnostic imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the incidence
      and severity of adverse events.

      Safety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. Particular
      attention will be given to adverse events that may follow enhanced T-cell activation such as
      dermatitis and colitis, uveitis, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

      An irAE is a clinically significant adverse event of any organ that is associated with drug
      exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.

      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS will include overall response, disease control, duration of response,
      and progression free survival .

      PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC, Cmax, CL, Vd and tÂ½z.

      STATISTICAL METHODS The sample size for this study is not determined from power analysis. In
      Part A, it is based on the 3+3 design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements.

      Descriptive statistics will include: mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and
      maximum values for continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical
      variables.

      The efficacy parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics. All safety and
      pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
