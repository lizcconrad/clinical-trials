        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or Ulcerative colitis) or
             Microscopic Colitis proven on the basis of radiology, endoscopy or histology.

          -  Patients with clinically and endoscopically active, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative
             Colitis or Microscopic Colitis

          -  Patient must have attempted reasonable medical therapies to control their disease
             without sufficient response.

          -  All patients have to be capable of attending appointments, as well completing surveys
             and diagnostic tests for the duration of study follow up

          -  The patient must be able to identify a likely stool donor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an enteropathy or colitis which cannot definitively be diagnosed as
             Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's disease or Microscopic colitis

          -  A patient on steroids (prednisolone, budesonide) at a dose that cannot be safely
             tapered to zero within 6 weeks of initial FMT, due to the risk of adrenal
             insufficiency

          -  Short gut syndrome and/or small intestine less than 1.5m in length as measured
