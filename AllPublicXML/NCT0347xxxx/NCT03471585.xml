    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of THC on the retrieval of emotional and
      neutral memories in healthy young adults.

      Here, the investigators aimed to investigate the effects of THC (15 mg) on the retrieval of
      negative, neutral, and positive memories. The study used a placebo-controlled,
      within-subjects, crossover design with 23 participants. In each experimental arm,
      participants attend a session to encode stimuli and a second session 48 hours later in which
      their memories are tested for the stimuli from the first session. In the second session, two
      hours prior to memory testing, THC or placebo is administered. On all sessions subjects
      complete mood questionnaires.

    <description>The Addiction Research Centre Inventory (ARCI; Martin, Sloan, Sapira, &amp; Jasinski, 1971) measures drug-specific effects on a 56-item true-false questionnaire.

    <description>Participants came in for an encoding session, followed 48 hours later by a retrieval session. Participants received a placebo capsule (dextrose) during the retrieval session, 2 hours prior to their memories being tested. Participants were monitored for the next 2 hours including physiological and subjective measures every 30 minutes. After 2 hours, participants' memory for the emotional stimuli and Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM; a false memory task) stimuli was tested. After the memory tests and 3.5 hours post-capsule, if participants' physiological and subjective measures had returned to baseline, they were allowed to leave. Other than the capsule, this arm was identical to the THC arm.</description>
