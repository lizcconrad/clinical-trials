  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug Related Problem (DRP) is defined as an event that may potentially affect the health
      outcomes in the patients. DRPs can occur at all stages of the medication usage process
      starting from prescribing to dispensing stage. Lack of follow-ups and reassessment of
      therapeutic outcomes may also contribute to DRPs. Pharmaceutical care is a co-operative
      activity in concert with other health care professionals and offered directly to the patient
      for improved quality use of medicines and achieving achieve the desired therapeutic outcomes.
      Pharmaceutical care identifies and resolves actual or potential DRPs.

      DRPs pose a challenge to the clinician, and that may affect patient's clinical outcomes and
      may result in morbidity or mortality and increased health care costs. Health care costs may
      become a burden to the patient or may be to the government or to the third parties. Clinical
      Pharmacy is a discipline that promotes the quality use of medicines through evidence-based
      medicine and helps in identification and resolving DRPs. A clinical pharmacist through
      his/her clinical accuracy checking may identify DRPs and come out with suitable solutions to
      resolve the same.

      Consequently, the aims of our study were to assess prevalence and characteristics of DRPs
      identified in inpatient and to identify factors associated with DRPs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At admission, pharmaceutics' team (senior pharmacist, one resident and two pharmacy
      students), conducted medication reconciliation process within 24 hours of admission or on the
      first working day following admission for admissions during week-ends. A medication
      reconciliation process was conducted according to a validated protocol. The first step
      consists of getting the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH), defined as the most
      comprehensive list of all medications taken by the patient. The second step consists of
      comparing the BPMH with admission prescription made by the physician in charge.

      During pharmacist interview, pharmacist discussed about medication adherence and knowledge.

      The third step consists of characterizing, solving and documenting DRPs. Each DRP highlighted
      by pharmaceutical team were collected and were classified regarding drug class and problem'
      types. For each patient with an identified DRP, the potential clinical impact was determined
      through a consensus of an expert panel: 2 pharmacists (1 hospital senior pharmacist and the
      resident) and 2 senior clinicians from the clinical department. The index used to rate the
      significance of the errors was based on the National Coordinating Council for Medication
      Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) Index for categorizing medication errors and
      adapted to get 4 severity categories with the type of error that leads to this severity: very
      serious, serious, moderate and minor.

      For each medication, we collected its name, dosage, dosage forms and frequency of
      administration. For each DRP, we collected the type of DRP, the drug classes (according to
      anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system) and the potential clinical impact for
      the patient.
