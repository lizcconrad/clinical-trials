    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical trial evaluating the
      combination of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic
      colorectal adenocarcinoma who have not responded to prior therapy.

    <textblock>
      This study will be done in two stages. In stage 1, ten patients will be treated with standard
      doses of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab to ensure that the doses are safe and
      tolerable. In stage 2, patients will be enrolled into either cohort A, where they will be
      treated with a 7-day run-in of binimetinib, followed by pembrolizumab, bevacizumab, and
      binimetinib combination treatment in 21 day cycles, or they will be enrolled to cohort B,
      which does not include the 7-day run-in of binimetinib. Treatment in cohort B will include
      combination therapy of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab from first day of
      treatment.

             o Administration of bevacizumab previously does not impact study inclusion.

          8. Measurable disease, according to RECIST v1.1. Note that lesions intended to be
             biopsied should not be target lesions.

          9. Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory
             results obtained within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug treatment:

               -  WBC ≥ 2.5 and ≤ 15.0 × 109/L

               -  ANC ≥ 1.5 × 109/L

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min

         10. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use of contraceptive methods that result in a failure
             rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 180 days after the
             last study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is
             post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone

             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male
             sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing
             intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual
             abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception.

         11. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:
             With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must
             remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 180 days
             after the last dose of study treatment. Men must refrain from donating sperm during
             this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation
             to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
