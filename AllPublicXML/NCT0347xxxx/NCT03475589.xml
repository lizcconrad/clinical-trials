  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tolerability of apatinib, an effective antiangiogenic agent, varies greatly in patients
      with stage IV cancer during treatment. This study will include patients with advanced (stage
      IV) gastric cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer or ovarian cancer, who
      will be administered apatinib treatment starting from 500 mg Qd and closely monitored for
      ADRs during the period of apatinib treatment. Meanwhile, relevant assay technologies will be
      used to precisely detect changes of various biomarkers in the patients treated by apatinib,
      with the aim of identifying biomarkers related to their prognosis and relevant complications
      so as to screen out the favored population, establish the drug's indication(s) and reduce
      relevant side effects.
