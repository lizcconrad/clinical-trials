  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators profiled plasma glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in a retrospective
      consecutive series of patients with a radiographic finding of renal mass referred to primary
      surgery for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A control group was formed by measuring plasma GAGs
      in healthy volunteers. The primary endpoints were the specificity and sensitivity of plasma
      GAGs in the detection of early stage RCC in pre-surgical samples versus healthy individuals.
      The investigators further analyzed how plasma GAGs varied according to stage, grade, RCC
      histology, other renal masses, and after surgery. Finally, the investigators estimated
      whether plasma GAGs could be used for prediction and surveillance of RCC recurrence.
