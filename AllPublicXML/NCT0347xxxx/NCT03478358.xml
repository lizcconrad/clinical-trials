      This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized study to investigate the long-lasting
      radiolabeled somatostatin analogue based peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and evaluate
      response to 177Lu-DOTAEB-TATE in patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.
      Different groups with doses of 0.37GBq-0.74GBq (10-20 mCi) and 1.85GBq (50 mCi)of
      177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE,3.7GBq (100 mCi)of 177Lu-DOTA-TATE will be injected intravenously. All
      patients will undergo 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scans before and after the treatment.

    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that can develop anywhere
      in the body and arise from neuroendocrine cells throughout the endocrine system. The most
      recent NCCN guidelines for unresectable and metastatic NET recommend somatostatin analogues
      as first-line treatment, but do not recommend a particular treatment sequence for the
      remaining therapies. Radiolabeled somatostatin analogue therapy, also known as peptide
      receptor radionuclide therapy has become a well-accepted treatment for patients with well to
      moderately differentiated unresectable or metastatic NETs and disease progression after
      first-line treatment. However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-Dotatate has
      been its short half-life and fast rate of clearance. This study was designed to compare the
      efficacy of a long-lasting radiolabeled somatostatin analogue 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE with
      177Lu-DOTA-TATE in patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.
