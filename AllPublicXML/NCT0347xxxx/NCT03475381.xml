  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the real-life safety and effectiveness of the novel
      combination ivacaftor+lumacaftor in eligible patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). All patients
      with CF were eligible if they were 12 years and older, started ivacaftor+lumacaftor outside
      of a clinical trial between December 15th 2017 and December 15th 2018 in an accredited CF
      center in France. Patient followed-up is based on standardized recommendation of the French
      Cystic Fibrosis Society. Each patient is followed 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient is followed one year with visits at months 1, 3, 6 and 12.

      At each visit, the following data are recorded:

        -  Treatment discontinuation or not. If the treatment was discontinued, reasons for
           discontinuation

        -  Adverse effects

        -  Lung function (spirometry)

        -  Body mass index

        -  Pulmonary exacerbations (intravenous antibiotics)

        -  Sputum microbiology

        -  Liver enzymes are measured at each visit

      At the initial and 12 visits, a yearly CF examination is proposed to the patients:

        -  Blood tests

        -  Chest CT scans

        -  Body plethysmography
