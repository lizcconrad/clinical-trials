      The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of the Exo-H2 robotic exoskeleton for
      walking rehabilitation of people with incomplete spinal cord injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recovery of walking ability is a primary concern of rehabilitation programs for people
      who have suffered anincomplete spinal cord injury. Robotic therapy arises from the new
      concepts of neuroplasticity. One of the most novel contributions in this field is robotic
      exoskeletons. However, there is still not enough scientific evidence to support the clinical
      use of this technology.

      The aim of this proposal is to assess the efficacy of a new model of robotic exoskeleton (Exo
      H2) developed by the CSIC with HNP involvement in the context of HYPER project (Consolider
      2009 call) in gait rehabilitation for people with incomplete spinal cord injury. A
      multicenter study is proposed here, involving the National Hospital of Paraplegics and the
      Institut Guttmann. Two randomized groups of patients with subacute incomplete spinal cord
      injury will be defined. In one group, protocol gait rehabilitation based on the Exo H2 will
      be established and traditional gait therapy will be adapted for control group. Both groups of
      patients were assessed performing a physical exam including functional gait scales (10 MWT,
      6MWT, WISCI II score, SCIM) and a biomechanical gait analysis with kinetic and kinematic
      techniques. Functional assessment will be carried out before intervention, at the end of the
      intervention and a follow up six weeks later.

Range from 0 (no contraction) to 5 (healthy function). The total score summs up the scores of all muscles. In healthy conditions is 50 points.</description>

    <measure>Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline WISCI II Scale at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>WISCI II assess the amount of physical assistance needed, as well as devices required, for walking following paralysis that results from Spinal Cord Injury.
The subject is observed by the trained personnel and the WISCI level is recorded on the scale of 0 to 20 at baseline (Baseline WISCI). The subject is observed again at the defined interval (Interval WISCI). The change in score is calculated by subtracting the baseline WISCI from the Interval WISCI, which equals the change in WISCI (Changed WISCI). If a group of subjects are enrolled, medians and means may be calculated.</description>

The questionnaire consists of 12 satisfaction items. For each of the 12 items, rate your satisfaction with your assistive device and the related services you experienced by using the following scale of 1 to 5.</description>
