  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Greater than 50% of lung transplant recipients show signs of chronic lung allograft
      dysfunction (CLAD) by 5 years post-transplantation.Therapies to prevent or slow CLAD are
      lacking. Anti-fibrotic therapies may offer an avenue to prevent progression of CLAD and
      prolong allograft survival. This study investigates if Pirfenidone therapy will stabilize
      lung function decline and slow progression of Functional small airways disease (fSAD) in lung
      transplant recipients with CLAD.
