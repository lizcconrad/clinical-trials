  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard management strategy for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is to
      treat with multiple drugs for 6 months, although patients often fail to adhere to the long
      treatment, leading to poor clinical outcomes including drug resistance, which is expensive
      and difficult to treat.

      The TRUNCATE-TB trial evaluates an alternative strategy (the TRUNCATE-TB Management Strategy)
      comprising treatment for 2 months (8 weeks, extended to 12 weeks if inadequate clinical
      response) with a regimen predicted to have enhanced sterilising activity (&quot;boosted regimen&quot;)
      and monitoring closely after treatment cessation. Those who relapse (predicted to be always
      drug sensitive and likely to occur early) will be retreated with a standard 6 month regimen.

      The trial is a randomized, open-label, multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) trial to test the
      hypothesis that the TRUNCATE-TB Management Strategy is non-inferior to the standard
      management strategy in terms of longer-term outcomes (clinical status at 96 weeks). If
      non-inferiority is demonstrated then the advantages/disadvantages of implementing the
      strategy will be explored in secondary outcomes (from patient and programme perspective).

      The trial will evaluate the TRUNCATE-TB Management Strategy with 4 potential boosted regimens
      (180 per arm, total 900 with the standard TB management strategy arm). The boosted regimens
      include new drugs (licensed drugs, repurposed from other indications) and optimized doses of
      standard drugs, selected based on consideration of maximal sterilising effect, absence of
      drug-drug interactions, as well as safety and tolerability over a period of 2 months
