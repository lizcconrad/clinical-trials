  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this longitudinal prospective cohort study including young people with anterior cruciate
      ligament reconstruction (ACLR), the aims are to 1) study the association between different
      measures of muscle function and early future of knee osteoarthritis (OA) assessed as
      patient-reported pain, 2) monitor the patients' functional status, and early OA development
      over time, 3) explore potential associations between muscle function and features indicative
      of early radiographic OA measured with MRI, and early detection of OA in biomarker profiles,
      respectively. The main hypothesis is that knee extensor weakness predicts future symptomatic
      OA of the knee (KOOS pain).

    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, prospective, cohort study. The reporting will adhere to the STROBE
      guidelines. Approximately 100 patients 12 months (range 10 - 16 months) after anterior
      cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) will be recruited from Sk책ne University Hospital,
      Sweden and Ullev책l Hospital, Oslo, Norway. The majority of the patients (approx. 80 %) will
      be recruited in Sweden.

      A research coordinator at each site will determine eligibility for the study, based on
      pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be provided with written and
      oral information about the study. Patients who accept to participate will be assessed with
      various measures of muscle function, patient-reported outcomes, MRI, and blood samples for
      biomarker analyses, at baseline (1 year after ACLR) and 2 years later (3 years after ACLR).

      For descriptive purposes, the mean difference (95% CI), or median (quartiles), between
      baseline and follow-up assessments will be used as appropriate. Separate linear regression
      model will be used to elucidate the influence of change in each muscle function variable on
      change in primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes (biomarkers), adjusted for baseline
      values. Separate linear regression models will also be used to elucidate the influence of
      demographic factors on change in muscle function, self-reported outcomes, and early OA.
      Assuming a clinically relevant correlation of 0.30 between knee extension strength and
      self-reported pain, 84 patients are needed with 80% power at the 5% significance level. Based
      on this calculation, 100 patients will be included, including an approximate drop-out of 15%.
