  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are performing a randomized controlled trial investigating starting
      cervical ripening in the outpatient setting with a mechanical method, the transcervical Foley
      catheter. The objective of the study is to determine if outpatient compared to inpatient
      cervical ripening with a transcervical Foley catheter in nulliparous women undergoing
      induction shortens the time spent in labor and delivery (from the time of admission to the
      time of delivery).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20-25% of pregnant women undergo an induction of labor, and a large percentage
      of these women require cervical ripening in order to &quot;ready&quot; the cervix for induction. In the
      setting of an unfavorable cervix, induction of labor with oxytocin alone can be associated
      with longer times to delivery, uterine tachysystole (uterine contractions that are too
      frequent), and increased rates of cesarean delivery.

      Outpatient cervical ripening is an attractive option for both women and their physicians, as
      this allows for the potential to spend less time in the hospital and more time in the
      comforts of the patient's own home.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing outpatient to
      inpatient cervical ripening using a transcervical Foley catheter. Women will be randomized to
      undergo inpatient or outpatient transcervical Foley catheter cervical ripening beyond their
      39th week of gestation. Women and their infants will be followed until the time of their
      discharge from the hospital.

Midwifery. 2002 Dec; 18(4):260-7.) This survey has 6 questions to assess perceptions of satisfaction with care. The questions include questions such as, &quot;I had appropriate and adequate control over my care,&quot; &quot;The person(s) responsible for my care are/were caring and compassionate,&quot; and &quot;Problems that have arisen up to now have not been dealt with effectively.&quot; The scare ranges from 1-7, with 1 representing Strongly Disagree and 7 representing Strongly Agree.</description>

    <description>Assessed through survey adapted from &quot;Labor and Delivery Index (LADY-X&quot; Survey, which has been published by Gartner et al (Gartner et al. Calculating Preference Weights for the Labor and Delivery Index: A Discrete Choice Experiment on Women's Birth Experiences. Value Health. 2015 Sep; 18(6):856-864.) This survey has 7 questions to assess experiences during labor and birth. Each question then has 3 answer choices that describe how good/poor the experience was. An example of a question is, &quot;Taking your wishes seriously during childbirth.&quot; The answers then include &quot;very seriously, sufficiently seriously, or insufficiently seriously.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of pain experienced during childbirth</measure>

    <description>Assessed through survey that contains 4 questions. The first 3 questions assess pain (worst pain during labor, overall pain during labor, and worse pain during placement of the Foley balloon). The 4th question asks how likely a patient is to recommend her method of induction to a friend/family member. The scale ranges from 0-100, with 0 representing no pain or very unlikely and 100 representing pain as bad as it could possibly be or very likely. The patient is instructed to place a hash mark over the line.</description>
