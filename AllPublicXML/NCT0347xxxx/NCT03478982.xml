  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, dose-ranging study to
      investigate the efficacy and clinical usability of STAP-001 in adult (18 years of age and
      older) subjects with epilepsy with a predictable seizure pattern. These subjects have an
      established diagnosis of focal or generalized epilepsy with a documented history of
      predictable seizure episodes. This is an in-patient study. The subjects will be admitted to a
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) or Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) for study participation. The
      duration of the stay in the in-patient unit will be 2-8 days. One seizure event per subject
      will be treated with study medication. The duration and timing of the seizure event and
      occurrence of subsequent seizures will be assessed by the Staff Caregiver(s)1 through
      clinical observation and confirmed with video electroencephalogram (EEG).

          2. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Has an established diagnosis of focal or generalized epilepsy with a documented
             history of predictable seizure episodes that includes at least one of the following:

               -  Generalized seizure episodes starting with a flurry of absence seizures or
                  myoclonic seizures with a minimum duration of 5 minutes

               -  Episodes of a prolonged focal seizure with a minimum duration of 3 minutes

               -  Episodes of multiple (≥2) focal seizures within a 2-hour time period

          4. Prior to randomization, has experienced ≥4 seizure episodes with predictable pattern
             during the last 4 weeks (qualification period) and no more than one week without a
             predictable seizure episode before the Screening Visit.
