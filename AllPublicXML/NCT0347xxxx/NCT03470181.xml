    <textblock>
      Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a disorder characterized by nausea and vomiting, separated by
      periods without any symptoms. There is very little research on this field at this point and
      most doctors do not fully understand the disorder. The goal of this study is to assess how
      the stomach empties food. Participants will be asked to participate in this study because
      either (a) they have been diagnosed and/or treated for cyclic vomiting syndrome in the past,
      or (b) they are physically healthy. The study seeks to compare how a healthy person's stomach
      empties to how the stomach of someone with cyclic vomiting disorder empties.

    <textblock>
      Up to 14% of unexplained vomiting in adults is attributed to an under recognized and often
      misdiagnosed disorder termed cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). As CVS is better understood,
      gastroenterologists are increasingly recognizing the importance of timely diagnosis and early
      management for this chronic and debilitating disorder. Currently, the only gold standard
      diagnostic strategy involves evaluating clinical criteria set by the Rome Foundation, such as
      vomiting frequency and duration of episodes. Outside of these subjective criteria, no
      definitive and objective diagnostic strategy for cyclic vomiting syndrome exists.

      Developing diagnostic strategies has been difficult given the exact etiology of CVS is still
      unknown. One physiologic theory includes rapid gastric emptying (GE)—or a dumping-like
      syndrome related to impaired gastric accommodation. A retrospective analysis observed rapid
      gastric emptying by standard 4-hour scintigraphic gastric emptying study in 80% of subjects,
      suggesting a relationship with CVS and rapid GE. In turn, rapid emptying has been
      hypothesized to relate with abnormal gastric accommodation - the reflex allowing storage of
      food through increased fundic volume. This physiologic abnormality can be readily and easily
      measured using non-invasive tools, but have never been tested in CVS. To explore this
      further, we aim to determine if CVS patients have abnormal gastric accommodation measured by
      nutrient drink test.
