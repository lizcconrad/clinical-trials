    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament injury is a common issue in sports involving cutting and jumping.
      Treatment may include surgical intervention followed by physical therapy, or no surgical
      intervention with the main treatment being physical therapy. Despite meeting physical
      therapist requirements for return to sport, many athletes do not return to sport. This
      discrepancy in the physical requirements for returning to sport and actually returning to the
      same physical activity level leads to the question of whether current rehabilitation
      treatments may be improved upon.

      One potential method is by integrating mental training into physical rehabilitation. By using
      mental training and increasing the meaning and relevance of rehabilitation, the athlete may
      be preparing more effectively for return to the pace and intensity common during play.

      In this study, the investigators aim to create and evaluate a model of training which
      incorporates sport/related movement and mental training in order to more effectively prepare
      athletes for return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament injury. This will be measured
      by examining functional hop measures, as well as patient-reported outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is increasingly common in sports involving jumping
      and cutting. Treatment for such injuries most often includes physical therapist-supervised
      rehabilitation, with or without surgical reconstruction. Care-as-usual rehabilitation often
      includes neuromuscular training in order to improve function and reduce knee-related
      symptoms. Recent data shows that 90% of athletes undergoing rehabilitation achieved normal or
      nearly-normal knee function when measured in strength and knee laxity. Despite this number,
      56% of these athletes did not return to sport or pre-injury activity levels. Due to this
      imbalance, the question is raised of whether there is a potential to supplement care-as-usual
      in order to improve upon current rehabilitative training programs.

      One attractive alternative is the use of dynamic motor imagery (DMI), which is a form of
      mental training intended to increase functional equivalence. This is done by imaging a
      sport-specific and relevant movement while simultaneously completing a similar movement,
      thereby simulating a real-life sporting movement. This approach makes it possible to create a
      situation in which an athlete is able to create meaning and find relevance in movement used
      in a rehabilitative training environment.

      In this study, the investigators aim to create and test a new training model, which is
      referred to as MOTIFS, and compare the efficacy of neuromuscular training plus dynamic motor
      imagery vs neuromuscular training alone in terms of muscle function and patient-reported
      outcomes in athletes with an ACL injury and with a goal of returning to pre-injury level of
      activity.

      Primary Hypothesis: 12 weeks of neuromuscular training plus dynamic motor imagery will
      improve muscle function, measured by relative percent change of the injured leg in
      performance on a single-leg hop for distance test, and patient-reported measures of
      psychological readiness to return to sport to a greater extent and with a quicker onset of
      recovery than neuromuscular training alone.

      Methods:

      In this randomized controlled trial, the inclusion criteria are as follows: (i) male and
      female ACL-injured athletes, (ii) between the ages of 18-35, (iii) currently undergoing
      rehabilitation, (iv)have been active in the sports of basketball, floorball, handball, and/or
      soccer, and (v) have a goal of reaching pre-injury activity level. Exclusion criteria for
      participants include: (i) a disease or disorder overriding the knee injury, (ii) have
      undergone return-to-sport evaluation by a physical therapist, and (iii) do not understand a
      Scandinavian language (Swedish, Danish, Norwegian) or English.

      Those athletes randomized to the care-as-usual group will receive rehabilitation according to
      standard practices.

      The experimental group will receive standard training which has been supplemented with the
      dynamic motor imagery in the MOTIFS model. In this experimental condition, physical
      therapists will be educated in the use of the new training model and will administer it
      during clinical practice with the participants. The new model includes information intended
      to open a dialogue with the athlete in order to create a mental simulation in which the
      athlete is able to mentally create a realistic and relevant situation in order to maximize
      the meaning and motivation of the rehabilitation exercises. This may include the use of
      sporting equipment, such as balls or sticks, in order to make the rehabilitation session seem
      as similar to a training session in the relevant sport as possible.

      Outcomes:

      At baseline and 12 weeks, participants will be measured in patient-reported outcomes, hop
      ability, and will be filmed in a series of functional tests in order to evaluate postural
      orientation errors. The main outcomes are relative percent change of the injured leg's
      performance on a single-leg hop for distance test, and psychological readiness to return to
      sport (ACL Return to Sport After Injury Scale). Secondary outcomes include a hop test battery
      (single-leg hop for distance and square hop), postural orientation errors (single-leg squat,
      stair descending, forward lunge, side hop, and single-leg hop for distance), Knee
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Rehabilitation Outcome Satisfaction, Motivation, Patient
      Enablement Instrument, Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale, and the Tegner Activity scale. A
      subgroup of both physical therapists and patients will also be asked a series of open-ended
      questions in a phenomenological interview upon completion of the intervention.

    <description>o This intervention is an individualized and sport-specific integrated model that includes aspects of both neuromuscular training, as used in rehabilitation practices, and dynamic motor imagery. Dynamic motor imagery is a form of mental training in which the participant images him-/herself performing a task from a first-person perspective in order to maximize functional equivalence to the task in question. This includes dynamic, physical movement, as well as mental imaging. The intervention provides a framework for designing individualized, sport-specific rehabilitation exercises for knee-injured athletes.</description>
