      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of new D-Dimer assay combined with a
      clinical pretest probability (PTP) to safely exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) or Deep Venous
      Thrombosis (DVT) in a 3 month follow-up.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be selected from prospective, consecutive ambulatory outpatients
      suspected of having venous thromboembolism. Patients will be diagnosed for VTE (PE or DVT)
      based on local standard of care. Samples will be collected for future testing with new
      D-Dimer assay.

      In case of Low/Moderate PTP score and negative VTE diagnosis, patients will be followed for 3
      months to evaluate potential development of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.

        The study population will be recruited from prospective, consecutive, ambulatory
        outpatients (presenting at the emergency unit or outpatient clinic) suspected of having
        VTE. Patients with DVT and PE will be analyzed as separate groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &gt; 80 years old.

          2. Patient presents at least one of these symptoms indicative of proximal DVT or PE:

               -  symptoms for proximal DVT: leg pain, tenderness (discomfort through palpation),
                  leg swelling, and /or edema,

               -  symptoms for PE: hemoptysis, lung related chest pain, dyspnea.

             be contacted by telephone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient presenting with a condition that may be associated with increased D-dimer
             levels, even in the absence of VTE, such as:

          4. Previous anticoagulant therapy stopped less than three (3) months before blood draw
             (except aspirin and platelet inhibitors)

          5. Patients with previous DVT/PE occurred less than three (3) months from screening.
