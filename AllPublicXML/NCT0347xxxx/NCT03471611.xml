      How safe and effective are CD34+ cell intracoronary injections for treating coronary
      endothelial dysfunction (CED)?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase I study to determine safety and efficacy of CD34+ cells in the
      treatment and management of CED and early atherosclerosis. Coronary endothelial function will
      be assessed in all patients by the administration of intracoronary acetylcholine. Patients
      with endothelial dysfunction who meet study inclusion criteria will receive granulocyte cell
      stimulating factor (G-CSF), followed by apheresis. The mobilized peripheral cell product will
      be processed for selection of CD34+ stem cells, and the purified CD34+ cells will be
      administered intracoronary during cardiac catheterization. The patients will undergo repeat
      endothelial function assessment 6 months post-procedure, as well as clinical assessments as
      described below either via in-person assessment by a nurse or physician, or via phone-call
      using a standardized questionnaire at 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up visits. At one month, the
      patient will undergo basic laboratory testing including troponin levels, complete blood count
      (CBC), electrolyte panel, liver function testing and ECG. At 3 months, the patients will
      receive a phone follow-up by the study coordinator who will assess the patient for any
      clinical deterioration or significant worsening in symptoms. At 6 months, the patients will
      return for a clinical visit, which will include physical examination, basic laboratory
      testing and follow-up acetylcholine study with angiography to assess for change in
      endothelial function. The first three patients will be sequentially enrolled, and subsequent
      enrollment will be held until one month follow-up. Provided there are no safety concerns at
      this time, enrollment will continue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of coronary endothelial dysfunction based on coronary angiogram and
             acetylcholine comprehensive coronary physiology study

          -  Able to provide informed written consent and willing to participate in all required
             study follow-up assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute coronary syndrome or continuous/ongoing chest pain - unremitting and
             unresponsive to nitroglycerin or rest - persisting 4 or more days before stent
             placement. If the chest pain syndrome is transient and/or intermittent - even if it
             began more than 3 days prior to admission - the patient is not excluded.

          -  Subjects in cardiogenic shock (systolic pressure &lt; 80mm/Hg, on vasopressors or
             intraaortic counter pulsation) at the time of consenting. Subjects who recover from
