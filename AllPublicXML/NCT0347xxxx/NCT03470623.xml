  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hallux valgus is the most common deformity of forefoot and the patients would suffer pain and
      disable of walking and wearing normal shoes. Chevron osteotomy of the first metatarsal is
      widely used for the treatment of mild or medium hallux valgus. It is a &quot;V&quot; sharp osteotomy
      that can decrease the intermetatarsal degree of first-second metatarsal by pushing the distal
      side of osteotomy laterally.A 2.5mm or 3.0mm steel cannulated screw is usually used for the
      fixation of the osteotomy side to provide stability.However,there are some shortcomings of
      steel screws such as rejection of internal fixation or the financial cost of the second
      surgery of fixation taken-out. To obviate these shortcomings of steel screws, bioabsorbable
      screw fixation may be an alternative method for chevron osteotomy.

      This trial is a randomized, prospective, controlled, parallel experimental design, to compare
      the clinical and radiographic outcomes of bioabsorbable screw versus steel screw for the
      treatment of hallux valgus with chevron osteotomy. The patients will be randomized to two
      groups, one treated with bioabsorbable screws while the other treated with steel screws.Data
      collection for the outcomes measures will occur pre-op,immediate post-op and then 6 weeks, 12
      weeks, and at 1 years post operation.

      The clinical outcomes measure are the VAS (visual analogue scale) score and AOFAS (American
      orthopedic foot and ankle society) forefoot score.The radiographic outcomes measures are the
      IMA (intermetatarsal angle) and the HVA (hallux valgus angle)
