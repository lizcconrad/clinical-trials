      This study was planned to evaluate the effect of neuromuscular exercise program on physical
      activity, functionality and balance in patients with knee osteoarthritis aged 35-65 years.

    <textblock>
      The degeneration that occurs in the osteoarthritis of the knee joint leads to the loss of
      proprioception, resulting in the misalignment of the mechanoreceptors in that region, the
      joint stabilization is impaired, the muscles do not fulfill the protective role and the joint
      neuromuscular is inadequate for control. Neuromuscular control is the subcortical activity of
      effector structures against stimulation with mechanoreceptor, visual, and vestibular
      affinities. Proprioception, kinesthesia, sensation of joint position, visual and vestibular
      information constitute sensory data; functional motor patterns, dynamic joint stability and
      reactive neuromuscular control motor efferent response definitions. Disturbance of
      neuromuscular control of the muscles also affects walking and balance with abnormal weight
      transfer. There are many ways to treat knee osteoarthritis such as patient education, weight
      control, different physical therapy modalities (hot, cold, electrotherapy, deep heat),
      exercise, pharmacological treatments (topical, systemic, intraarticular). There is no radical
      treatment of osteoarthritis to restore structural changes; but with the treatment applied,
      findings such as pain and loss of function of the individual can be reduced and the patients
      become more independent in daily life activities. Surgical treatment is the last resort in
      osteoarthritis. In osteoarthritis( OA), there is no pharmacological method to treat the
      deformed joint structure that will change the course of the disease. This situation
      significantly increases the importance of rehabilitation in the treatment of osteoarthritis.
      The aim of neuromuscular rehabilitation that reestablish and regulated features such as
      dynamic joint stability, reactive neuromuscular control, functional motor patterns.
      Rehabilitation programs created for this purpose include balance exercises, strengthening
      exercises, postural control, functional exercises, postural orientation, flexibility,
      agility, plyometric exercises, spore-specific exercises. neuromuscular exercise program
      includes 7 parameters including functional mobility, functional stability, sensorimotor
      system training, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation training techniques, plyometric
      exercises, reactive neuromuscular system training, technical training. Main purpose of this
      study is that the effect of neuromuscular exercise program on physical activity,
      functionality and balance in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) of patients with knee osteoarthritis at 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale used to measure knee function (0-100 total score). High scores indicate poor function status and low scores indicate good function status. The scale contains 24 questions, three subgroups of pain, stiffness and physical function.
There are 5 alternative answers to the questions: 0 = no, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe The rating (total of all answers / 96) was calculated as * 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changed from Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of patients with knee osteoarthritis at 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It used to measure level of pain (0-100 mm). On a horizontal line of 100 millimeters (mm), the initial 0 (no pain) and end (pain at unbearable grade) were marked. It was requested to place a mark on this horizontal line according to the degree of pain they felt in the cases. The point marked on the line was then recorded as a VAS value in mm, measured by a ruler.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form of patients with knee osteoarthritis at 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It used to measure level of physical activity. IPAQ short form; 7 questions that provide information about time spent on walking, moderate to severe activities, and time spent sitting. The energy required for the activities was calculated by the MET-minute score. Standard MET values for these activities are: Walk = 3,3 MET; Moderate Severe Physical Activity = 4,0 MET; Severe Physical Activity = 8.0 MET; Seating = 1,5 MET.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Y Balance Test of patients with knee osteoarthritis at 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It used to measure static balance.Anterior (A), Posteromedial (PM) and posterolateral (PL) measurements were performed. It was glued to three graves at 120 degrees. The patient was asked to put one foot on the intersection of these three bombers and to lie in directions A, PM, and PL with the other foot. During the test, the patient was asked to point to the maximum point he could reach without touching his foot and to bring it to the stable foot without losing balance. The distance is measured in centimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from 2000 International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) of patients with knee osteoarthritis at 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It used to measure functionality.
The questionnaire consists of 10 questions in total. 0 is the worst level of activity when measuring activity level; 4 is answered for the maximum level of activity. Similarly, when evaluating frequency, 0 is the most severe, 10 is not. 0-100 total score.</description>

    <description>In the experimental group, the subjects who were taken into the study were taken to the neuromuscular exercise (NME) program after the pre-treatment evaluations. The subjects in this group were given classical physiotherapy and NME performed 6 days a week, 1 set of 10 times physiotherapist control. NME was including warming, neuromuscular exercises (balance, muscle strengthening, proprioception, sensorimotor system training, joint stabilization and postural control exercises) and cooling periods.</description>
