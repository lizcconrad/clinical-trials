  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress is considered as a risk factor for physical and mental health. For this reason,
      interventional programs focused on stress management have been developed. These programs have
      proven to be efficacious modifying emotional variables and psychopathological symptoms.
      However, there are no studies showing how these interventions modify objective measures of
      stress. For example, measures reflecting Hipotalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis activity,
      the main system involved in the stress response. The activity of HPA axis is also altered by
      illness and psychopathology. Hair cortisol technique allows for changes assessment of HPA
      axis activity during months. Therefore, hair cortisol may be considered as an useful tool to
      measure changes of emotional variables related to stress in the long term. This measure of
      change over time of HPA axis activation together with related emotional variables assessment
      could be useful to evaluate the efficacy of interventional programs. For this reason, the aim
      of this research is to assess the effects of a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) on
      perceived stress, resilience, worries, psychopathology and HPA axis activity through hair
      cortisol analysis.

    <time_frame>Three measures: at the beginning of the study, at three months (when the stress program is finished) and at three months follow up (since the end of the stress program).</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures resilience as the ability to successfully cope with stress, punctuations range from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate higher levels of resilience.</description>
