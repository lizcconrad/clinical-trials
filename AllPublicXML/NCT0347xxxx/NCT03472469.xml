  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative effectiveness study of current pain management strategies in acutely
      injured trauma patients. Two different multi-modal, opioid minimizing analgesic strategies
      will be compared.

    <description>Treatment Strategy #1 is the descending dose arm. Inclusion in this arm will involve one of the following 6 drug combinations, and the treating physician will choose strategy. The 6 strategies are: 1. Acetaminophen 1g intravenous (IV)/ per oral (PO) q6 hours in the first 48 hours, and Acetaminophen 1g PO q6 hours thereafter; 2. Ketorolac 30mg IV once and Celebrex 200mg PO q12 hours in the first 48 hours, and Naproxen 500mg PO q12 hours thereafter; 3. Tramadol 100mg PO q6 hours in the first 48 hours, and Tramadol 100mg PO q6 hours thereafter; 4. Pregabalin 100mg PO q8 hours in the first 48 hours, and Gabapentin 300mg PO q8 hours thereafter; 5. Lidocaine patch q12 hours in the first 48 hours, and Lidocaine patch q12 hours thereafter; and 6. Opioids (Regional anesthesia) in the first 48 hours, and Opioids and Regional anesthesia thereafter.</description>
