  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to restrictions related to the use of DEHP as a plasticizer for PVC medical
      devices (MDs), manufacturers have resorted to alternative plasticizers. These are now
      integrated into many MDs such as infusion sets, extension lines, extracorporeal circuits,
      nutrition tubings ... etc. The ARMED project (2012-2015) funded by the ANSM, whose goal was
      to prioritizing the risk linked to the migration of these plasticizers from MDs, has shown
      that TOTM and DEHT present the best benefit / risk ratio due to lower migration and
      cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, it is important to evaluate the level of exposure of neonatal
      intensive care patients, due to the multi exposure to MD made of PVC, the frequent use of
      intravenous route and the vulnerability of this at-risk population to the metabolites of
      these plasticizers.

      The purpose of this biomonitoring study consists to evaluate the exposure of newborns and
      premature babies hospitalized in NICU to these plasticizers (DEHT and TOTM), by qualitative
      and quantitative measurement of their urinary metabolites

    <description>Quantities of plasticizers (TOTM and DEHT) are measured within each MD to which neonates are exposed in NICU. The release doses of plasticizers are evaluated with mathematical model (built from ex vivo experimentations). The study evaluates whether there is a correlation between the doses of TOTM and the DEHT released by the MD and the metabolites levels found in the urine of exposed patients</description>

    <description>The Armed Neo project include laboratory studies to evaluate the cytotoxicity and endocrine disrupting effects of plasticizers and their metabolites. These studies show the concentrations above which DHT, TOTM and metabolites are toxic. The concentrations obtained in the urines of newborns will be compared to these toxicity threshold values</description>
