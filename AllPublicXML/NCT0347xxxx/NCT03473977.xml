  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To assess the efficacy of repeat subcutaneous (SC) doses of benralizumab, compared with
      placebo, to reduce eosinophilic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with
      EG Secondary Objectives: To assess changes in endoscopic score/histological features/blood
      and biopsy eosinophil counts/clinical symptoms/esophageal, gastric, and duodenal tissue
      transcriptome changes/ before and after treatment with benralizumab.

      26 subjects are planned to be enrolled into the study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital
      Medical Center.

      Qualifying Subjects will receive 3 monthly sub-coetaneous injections of benralizumab/Placebo,
      followed by an option six month Open Label Extension period.
