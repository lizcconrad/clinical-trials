  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot study to examine the feasibility of utilizing immersive
      virtual reality to reduce procedural anxiety in children undergoing non-facial laceration
      repair in the Pediatric Emergency Department.

      The investigators hypothesize that virtual reality will be well-received by patients and
      their caregivers, and that the anxiety provoked by laceration repair will be mitigated by the
      immersive virtual reality experience.

    <measure>The percentage of children whose anxiety score did NOT increase by â‰¥ 20mm on a visual analog anxiety scale</measure>
    <time_frame>from the time of enrollment to the placement of the first stitch, which is typically ranges from 15 to 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety score will be measured on a Visual Analog Scale. This scale consists of a 100mm line on which parents mark their estimate of their child's anxiety level, with anxiety level increasing from left (0mm) to right (100mm).</description>
  </primary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with the use of VR during the procedure as assessed by a patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will fill out the questionnaire at the time their sutured laceration repair is completed, which is typically between 20 and 180 minutes after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the receptiveness of patients to this technology as well as the efficacy of the VR experience, participants will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire at the end of the procedure assessing their experience while using VR during the laceration repair.
These surveys address the patient's comfort and satisfaction with the technology. We have created separate patient surveys for children ages 5-7 and children ages 8-13 - these surveys have the same questions, but the answer choices are simplified from Likert Rating Scales (scale of 1 - 5) for the older children to a simple &quot;Yes, No, I don't know&quot; choice for the younger children. There is also a free text response question for which patients can provide additional comments or suggestions regarding their use of VR during laceration repair.</description>

    <measure>Parent/guardian satisfaction with the use of VR during the procedure as assessed by a parent/guardian questionnaire</measure>

    <description>To assess the receptiveness of patients to this technology as well as the efficacy of the VR experience, parents/guardians will be asked to complete a brief survey at the end of the procedure assessing their comfort and satisfaction with their child's use of VR during the laceration repair. The survey contains both rating questions with Likert Rating Scales (scale of 1 - 5), yes/no questions, and questions with free text responses.</description>

    <measure>Provider satisfaction with the use of VR during the procedure as measured by a provider questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Providers will fill out the questionnaire at the time their patient's sutured laceration repair is completed, which is typically between 20 and 180 minutes after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The ED provider who performed the laceration repair will complete a survey at the end of the procedure assessing their satisfaction with using VR during laceration repair. The survey contains yes/no questions, multiple choice questions, and questions with free text responses.</description>

    <measure>Headache due to VR use as reported on a qualitative simulator sickness questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>from enrollment to procedure completion, which typically ranges from 20 to 180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The patient (with the help of their parent/guardian for younger children) will complete a questionnaire assessing for symptoms of simulator sickness, including nausea, headache, dizziness, and eye pain. The questionnaire uses Likert Scales (ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating a higher level of symptom) to assess nausea, headache, dizziness, and eye pain associated with VR use.</description>
