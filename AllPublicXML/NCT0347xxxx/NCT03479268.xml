      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pevonedistat when given together
      with ibrutinib in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma that
      has come back or has stopped responding to other treatments. Pevonedistat and ibrutinib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pevonedistat administered in combination with
      ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate (ORR) will be determined based on the proportion of study
      participants who achieve complete response (CR), complete response with incomplete marrow
      recovery (CRi), partial response (PR) or nodular partial response (nPR) assessed after
      completion of therapy.

      II. Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the interval between the date of first study
      treatment and the date of objective signs of disease recurrence, subsequent anti-leukemic
      therapy, or death, whichever is first reported.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pevonedistat.

      Participants receive pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 3, and 5, and
      ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 2-21 of course 1 and days 1-21 of subsequent courses.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Participants then receive only ibrutinib PO daily on days 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants will be followed up for every 3 months for
      1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.
