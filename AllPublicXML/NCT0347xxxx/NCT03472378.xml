  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of migraineurs seeking secondary or tertiary medical care develop cutaneous
      allodynia during the course of migraine, a sensory abnormality mediated by sensitization of
      central trigeminovascular neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Triptan therapy can
      render allodynic migraineurs pain-free within a narrow window of time (20-120 min) that opens
      with the onset of pain and closes with the establishment of central sensitization. This calls
      for the development of drugs that can tackle ongoing central sensitization and render
      allodynic migraineurs pain-free after the window for triptan therapy has expired. There are
      two main objectives the investigators seek to achieve from this study: to determine whether
      oral administration of DFN-15 (solution of a COX2 inhibitor, Celecoxib) terminates migraine
      attacks when given to allodynic participants 3 hours after attack onset; and to determine
      whether mechanical and heat allodynia that develop during acute migraine attacks could be
      reversed by late (&gt; 3hrs after attack onset) treatment with DFN-15. Participants will be
      recruited from the Headache Center and randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive
      either the active drug (DFN-15) or placebo in a ratio of 4:1.The participants will be
      instructed to return to the clinic during a migraine. At the 'during-migraine' visit, which
      will begin 3 hours after onset of headache, the investigators will document headache
      intensity, associated symptoms, and mechanical and heat pain threshold (first) before
      treatment (at 180 min after onset of headache) and (second) at a 120 min after treatment (5
      hours after headache onset). Based on our prior experience studying migraine patients, the
      investigators plan to screen 100 patients to achieve 50 participants completing the 2 study
      visits as planned. The active drug group will consist of 80/100 patients and 20/100 patients
      will receive the placebo. The study will be terminated as soon as the first 40 participants
      who received the DFN-15 and first 10 patients who received placebo completed visit 2.
