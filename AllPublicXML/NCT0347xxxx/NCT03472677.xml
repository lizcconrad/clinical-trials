          -  Subject is aged between 18 and 45 years, inclusive.

          -  Subjects Body Mass Index (BMI) is between 18 and 32 kg/m^2, inclusive and subject's
             weight is greater than or equal to 50 kg.

          -  Subjects must be in good health, in the opinion of the Investigator, as determined by
             a medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and 12
             lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

        Cohort 1 Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had a clinically significant illness that has not completely resolved in
             the four weeks before screening.

          -  Subject has a history of neurological disorder which may impact the perception of pain
             or impairs the subject's ability to fully participate in the trial.

        Cohorts 2-4 Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is aged between 45 and 75 years, inclusive.

             than or equal to 50 kg.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of bilateral moderate to severe painful knee OA (subjects will
             be required to have a score on Pain with walking in the previous 24 hours, of 4 to 9,
             inclusive NPRS 0-10). The condition must be chronic with a history of painful
             arthritis for at least 3 months prior to entry in the study.

        Cohorts 2-4 Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had a clinically significant illness, other than osteoarthritis, that has
             not completely resolved in the four weeks before screening.

          -  Subject has a history of neurological disorder which may impact the perception of pain
             or impairs the subject's ability to fully participate in the trial.

          -  Subject has used analgesic medications in the 2 days prior to dosing, except for
             paracetamol, as needed.

          -  Subject has used topical medications applied to the knee for OA pain (including
             capsaicin, lidocaine, prescription or OTC medications) from 90 days prior to screening
             through to dosing.

          -  Subject has been injected with corticosteroids in the knee 90 days prior to screening
             through to dosing.

          -  Subject currently uses opioids for any condition other than OA knee pain (maximum dose
             15 mg hydrocodone, or equivalent, per day prescribed by a physician).
