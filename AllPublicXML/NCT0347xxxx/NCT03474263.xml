      Patients with rapidly progressive ALS will be assigned to IC14 intravenously on Day 1-4. This
      4-day course will be repeated on Days 8-11. Patients will all undergo MR-PET scans at
      Massachusetts General Hospital at two time points: before treatment onset and after the last
      treatment cycle. This scan will measure areas of ALS disease activity and assess response to
      IC14 treatment. MR-PET scans will be compared to historical controls.

      This is an open-label, biomarkers-driven study.

      Patients with rapidly progressive ALS will be assigned to the following dose regimen of IC14:

      • 4 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1, followed by 2 mg/kg daily x 3 days on Days 2-4. This 4-day
      course will be repeated on Days 8-11.

      Patients will be followed for 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Patients will all
      undergo [11C]-PBR28-MR-PET scans at Massachusetts General Hospital at two time points: before
      treatment onset and after the last treatment cycle.

      Patients will be followed for 28 days after the last dose of study drug for safety.
