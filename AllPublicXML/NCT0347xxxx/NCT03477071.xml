  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stenosis of the renal graft arteries occurs in 1 to 26% of cases and can damage the graft.
      Endovascular treatment is first-line treatment. The main objective of this study is to
      identify the predictive factors of failure of peri-anastomotic.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the post-operative outcomes following endovascular
      treatment of TRAS (Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis).

      This retrospective, monocentric study included patients with peri-anastomotic stenosis of the
      renal graft from 2000 to 2017. The stenosis is defined by a reduction of at least 50% of the
      arterial diameter during arteriography. Technical success was defined as residual stenosis
      less than 30% of the arterial diameter after the procedure.
