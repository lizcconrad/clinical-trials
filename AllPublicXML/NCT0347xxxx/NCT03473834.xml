      A feasibility study using measures of turning function derived from Inertial Measurement Unit
      sensory before, and after, a modified exercise programme approach.

      Participants will be patients diagnosed as having idiopathic PD by a neurologist. Patients
      will be recruited from the Movement Disorder Clinic, Division of Neurology, Faculty of
      Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand. Participants will be classified into
      two groups; the treatment and the control groups. All participants will be asked to sign an
      informed consent form approved by the ethical committee of Mahidol University Institutional
      Review Board, Mahidol University, Thailand. Only patients with PD who meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. All participants will be
      assessed for daily activity and motor skill using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Scale (UPDRS). At pre- and post- assessments, eye movement and turning characteristics will
      be assessed using Inertial Measurement Unit sensors and Electroocculography (EOG). The
      treatment group will receive a rehabilitation program by the physiotherapist. The
      rehabilitation sessions will take place at the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Mahidol
      University, Thailand. The control group will receive a diary for recording their daily
      activities during the duration of participation in this study. In addition, the researcher
      will phone participants once per week to remind then to maintain their diary records.

      Data Processing &amp; Analysis: this study will be used the outcome measures and processing data
      in MATLAB.

      Statistical analysis: Kolmogorov Smirnov Goodness of Fit Test will be used to test the data
      distribution. If the data are normal or non-normal distribution, data comparisons will be
      tested as the following;

        -  Normal distribution: Mixed model ANOVA will be used to compare outcome measures between
           pre- and post- and between the treatment and the control groups

        -  Non-normal distribution: The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare outcome
           measures between the treatment and control groups. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test will be
           used to compare outcome measures between pre- and post- assessments within group.

    <measure>Reorientation onset of body segment</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Previous research has shown that turning in healthy adults is a whole-body coordinated process characterized by a top-down sequence of body segments reorientation starting with the eyes and head followed by the trunk and ending with the feet (Hollands, Ziavra, &amp; Bronstein, 2004; Mak et al., 2008). However, Lohnes and Earhart (2011) provided evidence that impaired turn performance in PD patients could be partially explained by eye movement deficits, affecting eye, head and body coordination (Lohnes &amp; Earhart, 2011).</description>

    <measure>Fall Efficacy Score (FES-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>FES-I is a questionnaire to assess fear of falling (31). There is 16-item which developed by the Prevention of Falls Network Europe group (ProFaNE) to augment content covered by the original 10-item Fall Efficacy Score (FES). Participants will be asked to rate 16 items of questionnaire on a four-point Likert scale which is their concerns about the possibility of falling when performing 16 activities. A total score is 64 score, a higher score indicates a greater fear of falling.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, abbreviated UPDRS is a scoring system widely used for the clinical evaluation of Parkinson's disease (PD). Its 42 items are evaluated by interview and clinical observation. Clinicians and researchers alike use the UPDRS and the motor section in particular to follow the progression of a person's Parkinson's disease. Scientific researchers use it to measure benefits from a given therapy in a more unified and accepted rating system. Neurologists also use it in clinical practice to follow the progression of their patients' symptoms in a more objective manner.
A total of 199 points are possible (199 represents the worst disability and 0 no disability).</description>

    <measure>Borge Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>To monitor and quantify individual's perceptions of effort during exercise. The Borge scale is used to measure the intensity of your exercise. The Borge scale runs from 0 - 10. The numbers below relate to phrases used to rate how easy or difficult you find an activity. For example, 0 (nothing at all) would be how you feel when sitting in a chair; 10 (very, very heavy) is how you feel at the end of an exercise stress test or after a very difficult activity.</description>
