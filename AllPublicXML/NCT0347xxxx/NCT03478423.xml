      Background: Emergency department (ED) providers are frequently challenged with how best to
      treat acute pain in older patients, specifically when non-opioid analgesics are insufficient
      or contraindicated. Studies have documented older patients presenting to the ED with painful
      conditions are less likely to receive pain medications than younger patients, and this
      inadequate pain control has been associated with increased risk of delirium and longer
      hospital stays. Given the concerns for drug interactions, adverse side effects, over-sedation
      and addiction; emergency physicians often report uncertainty regarding the ideal choice of
      opioid analgesic in older adults. There are no guidelines informing best practice for the
      management of acute pain in this population.

      Objective: The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of codeine, oxycodone and
      hydromorphone for acute fracture pain in older patients discharged from the ED.

      Methods: This will be a blinded, randomized controlled trial of older adults (age â‰¥ 70)
      discharged home from the ED with acute pain secondary to an upper extremity, lower extremity,
      rib, pelvic or vertebral compression fracture. Patients will be randomized to receive a 3-day
      supply of codeine, oxycodone or hydromorphone. Patients will also be given acetaminophen.
      Patients will be contacted by phone or email 3 days following their ED visit. The primary
      outcome will be differences in pain scores at 3 days assessed using the validated Brief Pain
      Inventory (Short Form). Secondary outcomes will include side effects (ie: confusion,
      constipation), adverse events (i.e, falls, healthcare visits) and pain interference with
      daily activity. Patients, physicians and all research staff will be blinded to group
      allocation.

      Importance: All analgesics (including opioids) prescribed to older adults are associated with
      an increased risk of adverse events. This study seeks to inform ED providers of opioid
      efficacy, side effects and patient-important, functional outcomes in this growing patient
      population.

      Introduction: The Canadian population is growing older and life expectancy increases with
      advances in medicine and population health. In Canada, patients 75 years and older have the
      highest emergency department (ED) visit rate compared to younger age groups. ED providers are
      challenged with how best to treat acute pain in older patients, specifically when non-opioid
      analgesics are ineffective or contraindicated. There is a paucity of studies evaluating
      analgesic efficacy in this population, and there are no guidelines informing best practice
      for the management of acute pain in the ED.

      Studies have documented older patients presenting to the ED with painful conditions are less
      likely to receive pain medications than younger patients. Over a 7 year study period of US ED
      visits, patients aged 75 years or older were less likely than patients aged 35 to 54 years to
      receive an analgesic (49% versus 68.3%) or an opioid (34.8% versus 49.3%) for their
      pain-related presenting complaint. These differences persisted after adjusting for sex,
      race/ethnicity, pain severity, and other factors. In the hospital setting, inadequate pain
      control of acute conditions, such as fractures, has been associated with increased risk of
      delirium and longer hospital stays.

      The deleterious consequences of inadequately treated pain reach beyond the hospital setting.
      In older patients, pain is by far the most frequently cited symptom negatively impacting
      activities of daily living. Furthermore, inadequately treated pain in this population has
      been associated with poor self-rated health, depression, diminished quality of life,
      decreased cognition and reduced mobility.

      The principal challenge of treating pain in this population is that older adults are the most
      susceptible to adverse effects of analgesic treatment, which increase in the setting of
      multiple morbidities, polypharmacy, physiologic vulnerability, and functional impairment.
      Given the concerns for drug interactions, side effects, over-sedation and addiction,
      emergency physicians often report uncertainty regarding the ideal choice of opioid analgesic
      in older adults. Within the broad assortment of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic
      interventions for moderate-to-severe pain, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      medications (NSAIDs) are the most commonly administered treatments, but evidence regarding
      their safe and effective use in older adults is disproportionately lacking. As a consequence,
      clinicians managing pain in older adults must attempt to extrapolate findings from studies of
      younger adults. Translating results generated in analgesic studies of younger adults to older
      populations can be hazardous because of age-associated decline in the systemic clearance of
      analgesics due to decreased renal excretion and liver metabolism, as well as greater
      pharmacodynamic sensitivity to analgesic central nervous system effects.

      Objectives

      Primary:

      To identify the most effective prescribed oral opioid analgesic for outpatient pain
      management among older adults presenting to the emergency department with an acute fracture.

      Secondary:

      To describe analgesic use, side effects, adverse events and patient-important, functional
      outcomes in older adults.

      Methods:

      Study Design and Population This will be a pragmatic, blinded, randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) conducted in the ED of Mount Sinai Hospital, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This is a
      tertiary care, urban teaching hospital with approximately 65,000 ED visits per year. Patients
      will be considered for inclusion if they are 70 years and older, live independently, present
      to the ED with acute pain secondary to an upper extremity, lower extremity, rib, pelvic or
      vertebral compression fracture occurring within 7 days prior to ED visit, and if their
      treating ED physician intends to prescribe opioid analgesic upon ED discharge.

      Attending physicians will identify eligible patients prior to ED discharge, and informed
      written consent for trial participation will be obtained by trained research personnel.
      Research personnel will not approach physicians for fractures alone, rather they approached
      on the basis of the treating physician's intent to prescribe opioids for home use. After
      providing informed written consent, patients will be randomized to either receive oxycodone,
      hydromorphone or codeine for analgesia for home use using a fixed 1:1:1 allocation ratio
      produced by a computer-based random number generator. Block sizes of 6 will be used to ensure
      equal allocation to each group.

      The research packet will be kept in the locked narcotic cupboard of the ambulatory care
      assessment are in the ED in a box labeled &quot;Study Drugs&quot;. At any given time, 3 packets will be
      maintained, and the temperature of this cupboard will be monitored by the study RA. The room
      temp logs will be maintained on a daily basis with a calibrated thermometer. The key to this
      cupboard is kept by the nurse on duty in this area.

      Once a patient is randomized, the physician will order a study medication packet with a paper
      order for prescribing the study drug (designed and provided by MSH pharmacy). The nurse in
      the ambulatory care area will remove this packet from the cupboard, log its removal on a
      study specific narcotic sheet for inventory in ED. As in any other narcotic stored in the ED,
      the study packets will be counted daily at the end of the day as per narcotic regulations.

      The RA will record the patient's name, MRN, and other info on label that is dispensed with
      study medication (follow labeling requirements). The RA will inform the patient of medication
      instructions, possible side effects and medication reconciliation procedures.

      Trained research personnel will collect demographic and clinical parameters (medical history,
      physical examination findings, diagnostic testing, ED management) from the patient and from
      paper and electronic charts using a standardized data collection tool.

      Discharge instructions will be read by the attending physician. Patients will be provided a
      printed copy of the discharge instructions. The RA will discuss each of the medications
      provided to the patient and read the specific instructions and potential side effects for
      each medication. The RA will also instruct the patient how to complete the Medication Diary.
      Prior to ED discharge, the RA will schedule the telephone follow-up assessment and will
      administer the BPI. Patients will be provided a pre-addressed envelope to return study
      medications and the completed Medication Diary to the research team at study completion. At
      the time of discharge, a time will be scheduled for a courier to pick up unused study
      medications from their home. The envelope will be signed by the patient on shipping and
      signed by the study coordinator or pharmacy on receiving. The patient will also have the
      option of bringing their unused study medications to their scheduled MSH Fracture Clinic
      appointment, where the RA will meet them to reconcile the study medications.

      Patients will be contacted via telephone by a RA to complete follow-up assessments 72 hours
      following the initial ED visit. To assess the compliance of patients with discharge
      instructions, they will be asked to complete a Medication Diary that consists of questions,
      taking less than 1 minute to complete daily. If telephone contact is not successful on the
      first day of scheduled follow-up, participants will be left a message to remind them of the
      scheduled telephone interview. If telephone follow-up is not successful on the first day of
      scheduled follow-up, attempts will be made on the 2nd and 3rd days. If contact is not made
      within a 3 day timeframe, patients will be considered lost to follow-up, and their data will
      be excluded from further analysis.

      Outcome Measures The primary outcome of this study will be differences in pain severity 3
      days following ED discharge as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). BPI is the best
      way to measure differences in pain severity in clinical trials. It measures pain severity
      using the mean score of 4 questions (worst pain, least pain, average pain and current pain)
      on a numeric rating scale (0-10).

      Secondary outcomes will include differences in functional outcomes, analgesic use, side
      effects, and adverse events. Participants' functional outcomes will be assessed using the BPI
      - interference questions. Analgesic use will be quantified in pill counts collected from both
      telephone follow-up surveys as well as on the Medication Diaries. Side effects will be
      measured using a modified version of The Numerical Opioid Side Effect (NOSE) Assessment Tool
      during the telephone follow-up, and adverse events are defined as falls, unplanned visits to
      a healthcare provider (return ED visits, family physician, walk-in clinic), allergic
      reaction, overdose, and death.

      Data Analyses Data will be entered directly into a study specific Microsoft Excel database
      (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). Descriptive statistics will be summarized using
      means with standard deviations (SD), medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) or frequencies
      with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. The study design assumes three arms
      (codeine, oxycodone and hydromorphone), therefore the 2-tailed alpha will be set to 0.025 to
      adjust for the increased risk of type-I error with 3 pairwise comparisons. An
      intention-to-treat analysis will be performed. To test for pairwise equality between groups,
      a 1-way ANOVA will be employed. Proportional differences will be assessed using Pearson
      chi-square statistic. Missing data points will be excluded from the analysis.

      Assuming a mean (SD) change in pain scores between groups of 2.2 (3.0), a minimum clinically
      important difference on the Brief Pain Inventory of 2.0 , a 2-tailed alpha of 0.025 to adjust
      for 3 pairwise comparisons and a beta of 0.20, the investigators estimate that 47 patients
      per group (N=141) will be required. To account for potential loss to follow-up, the
      investigators will increase sample size by 25% per group, resulting in a final sample size of
      177 patients (59 per group).
