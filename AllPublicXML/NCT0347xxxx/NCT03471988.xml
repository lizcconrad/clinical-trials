    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of administering 372.6
      mg of AK1820 (isavuconazonium sulfate) intravenously or orally to adult Japanese patients
      with deep mycosis. The primary endpoint is safety (percentage of patients with adverse events
      after starting the study treatment).
