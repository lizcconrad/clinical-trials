      This study compares the the efficacy of buccal infiltration of 4% Articaine and 2%
      Mepivacaine without any palatal injection during extraction of maxillary teeth. One group of
      patient receives buccal infiltration of Articaine and another group receives buccal
      infiltration of Mepivacaine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dense local anesthesia is required to reduce pain during extraction of tooth. Administration
      of local anesthesia to the palatal mucosa is proved to be the most painful due to its firm
      adherence to the underlying periosteum and also it's abundant nerve supply. Articaine has
      greater lipid solubility and high bone penetration property. Mepivacaine is proven to be the
      safest local anaesthetic agent. Avoidance of a palatal injection during extraction will
      benefit the patient by reducing pain and anxiety to a greater extent.

      So this study compares the bone penetration property between Articaine and Mepivacaine by
      assessing the pain in the palatal mucosa while extracting the tooth using only buccal
      infiltration.
