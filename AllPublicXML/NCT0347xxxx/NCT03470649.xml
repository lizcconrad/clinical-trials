  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative anemia is a frequent complication after total knee arthroplasty, with an
      incidence of 87%. Iron supplementation is known to be effective in treatment and prevention
      of postoperative anemia. The investigators examined the effect of intravenous iron
      isomaltoside (Monofer®) administration on postoperative anemia and transfusion requirements
      in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.

      Participants undergoing total knee arthroplasty will be randomly assigned to treatment group
      or control group. After main procedure of total knee arthroplasty, iron isomaltoside 1000
      (Monofer®) or normal saline will be intravenously administered depending on the group
      assigned. The dose of iron isomaltoside will be determined based on patient's body weight
      using the manufacturer's recommendation. Serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron, ferritin,
      transferrin saturation, and phosphorus level will be checked at preoperative day,
      postoperative day 1, 7, and 30.

      The primary outcome is the incidence of postoperative anemia at 30 days after surgery.
      Secondary outcomes included the incidence and amount of red blood cell transfusion during
      admission period, hospital length of stay, the incidence of surgical site infection, and
      quality of life during postoperative period.
