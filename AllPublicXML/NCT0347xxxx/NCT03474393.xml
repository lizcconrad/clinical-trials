  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyse if intensive systematic treatment via internet and telephone
      during 4 months improved HbA1c for persons with type 1 diabetes which are already treated
      with CGM or FGM, and if the effect continuous for 1-2 years after the intervention stops.
      Time in Hypoglycaemia, treatment satisfaction, Diabetes distress and hypoglycaemia fear will
      even be analysed.

      A randomised, non-blinded, multi-centre, clinical study for persons with type 1 diabetes and
      hbA1c ≥ 58mmol/mol and treated with CGM or FGM.

      The control group continuous its normal diabetes care with study visits at randomisation, 10,
      18, 32, and 52 weeks for HbA1c and to fill in questionnaires.

      The intervention group will have contact with the study team on a weekly basis, when mean
      blood glucose levels the previous week are elevated. They will receive help with analysing
      data and advice on how to improve their glucose values. They will even meet the study team at
      randomisation, 10, 18, 32, and 52 weeks for HbA1c and to fill in questionnaires.
