    <masking_description>Prospective randomized double-blinded trial to compare TAP block versus QL block for pain management in living donor nephrectomy patients. Participants will be blinded to the type of block received and physicians will be blinded both intra- and post-op regarding which block patients received. The team who performs the block will know which block the patient received. No one else involved in the care of the patient will know. The surgery team will not know, and the primary (in the OR) anesthesia team will not know. None of the providers involved in post-operative care of the patient will know.</masking_description>
