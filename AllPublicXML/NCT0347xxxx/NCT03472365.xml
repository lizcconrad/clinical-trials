  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to estimate overall response rate (ORR) of SHR-1210 combined
      with capecitabine and oxaliplatin or with apatinib as first-line treatment in subjects with
      locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 110 participants will be assigned to SHR-1210 + capecitabine + oxaliplatin
      combination therapy (Cohort 1), or SHR-1210 + apatinib combination therapy (Cohort 2).
