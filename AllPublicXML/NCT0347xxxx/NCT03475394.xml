    <textblock>
      Background: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of tooth and supporting tissues
      with clinical signs of bone and connective tissue loss and is mediated by a combination of
      periodontal pathogens and host defense systems. Currently the use of herbal products in
      dentistry is increasing due to their easy availability, low cost and lesser side effects. One
      such herbal plant is Morus alba which is known to possess medicinal properties. Therefore the
      present study was conducted to determine the clinical effectiveness of subgingivally
      delivered Morus alba gel incorporated into polaxamers vehicle for its controlled release on
      periodontal pocket in adjunct to scaling and root planing for treatment of moderate
      periodontitis patients.

      Methods: one hundred twenty patients with chronic periodontitis having PPD of 4-6 mm were
      treated by full-mouth scaling and root planning (SRP) and curettage. They were randomly
      assigned into one of the two groupswith 60 in each group: Group 1: Chlorhexidine Sol-gel was
      applied at baseline, 15 and 30 days. Group 2: Morus alba Sol-gel was applied at baseline, 15
      and 30 days. Plaque index (PI) (Silness and Loe), Gingival index (GI) (Loe and Silness),
      Community Periodontal index, Periodontal pocket depth and quantitative analysis (anaerobic
      culture) of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella
      forsythia were assessed at baseline and after 45 days.

      Morus alba is invaluable member of the plant kingdom belonging to the family Moraceae and the
      genus Morus. It is extensively cultivated for leaf yield in sericulture. Morus alba have long
      been used in traditional medicine to improve eyesight, lower blood pressure, prevent
      diabetes, protect the liver, strengthen joints and treat fever. In particular, few studies on
      mulberry fruits have reported its biological activities such as antioxidative and
      anti-inflammatory activities. Even the root bark of has been traditionally used in Asian
      countries for medicinal purposes due to its anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antibacterial
      activities. LD50 of extracts of Morus Alba leaves was found to be above 2000 mg/kg which is
      safe to be used in human beings. Therefore, in the present study the Morus alba leaves has
      been used in the gel preparation and its effectiveness is assessed against periodontal
      microorganisms.
