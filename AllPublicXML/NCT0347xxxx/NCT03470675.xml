  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) encompass both third and fourth degree perineal
      tears. These tears can have a significant impact on women's quality of life in the short and
      long term. One of the most distressing immediate complications of this severe perineal injury
      is perineal pain. Women can also experience postpartum depression, dyspareunia, and altered
      sexual function after OASIS.

      This is a randomized controlled trial to study the effects of three interventions (placebo,
      low dose intravenous ketamine plus epidural morphine, or epidural morphine alone) on acute
      pain after OASIS.

      The objective of this study is to assess the incidence of perineal pain in postpartum
      patients 1 week after obstetric anal sphincter injuries.
