  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is a good treatment option for people with kidney disease. However,
      there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it
      functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients receive induction therapy and
      immunosuppression (anti-rejection) drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney.
      These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney.
      This research study will evaluate the safety and activity of mesenchymal stromal cells
      reducing the immune suppression necessary to achieve optimal renal function in renal
      transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled, dose-escalation and safety study of
      autologous MSCs used for induction immune suppression in living donor kidney transplant
      recipients. The comparator group will receive placebo. The investigator will obtain
      exploratory immune response markers to estimate the effect of autologous MSCs on the T- and
      B-cell response following living donor kidney transplantation. The usual dose of
      corticosteroids will be used during induction. Corticosteroids, the calcineurin inhibitor
      tacrolimus (Prograf®, Astellas Pharma) and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®, Genentech) will
      be used for maintenance therapy. All subjects will receive basiliximab (Simulect®, Novartis)
      standard induction immune suppression.

      Up to 24 patients will be enrolled at the Houston Methodist Hospital. Safety analyses will be
      conducted after the first 4 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first 30-90 days
      posttransplant, with subject 2 enrolled 30 days after subject 1 and subject 3 enrolled 30
      days after subject 2 (eg, a 30-day window between subject enrollment days). If no safety
      signal has been detected, the next group of 4 subjects will be enrolled using no less than a
      2-week enrollment window from subject 5, 2 weeks from subject 6, and so on. Subjects will be
      evaluated in the same manner until 8 subjects in the final dosing group have completed 90
      days or a decision to stop the study has occurred, whichever comes first. Each subsequent
      dosing group will begin with a 30-day window of evaluation between subjects enrolled for the
      first 4 subjects enrolled in the group. If no adverse safety signal has been detected in the
      first 4 cases in that dosing group, the next 4 subjects enrolled will have a 2-week
      evaluation window between enrollments. This early evaluation approach will allow for the
      assessment of the inflammatory period occurring after transplantation. A final safety review
      will occur at the end of the study and a report will be written.

      The study will provide information needed to select a MSC dose level to be used in subsequent
      clinical trials and to inform the design of subsequent trials.

    <measure>Number of participants without any infusional toxicity, occurring within 24 hours of infusion.</measure>

    <description>Infusional toxicity will be assessed as the occurrence of either 1) two or more participants having deep vein thrombosis (Grade 2 thrombotic event); 2) any participant having evidence of the first-pass phenomenon of cells trapping in the lung as evidenced by (a) shortness of breath at rest, (b) requiring ventilator support, or (c) pulmonary edema with hypoxia requiring support; or 3) Grade 4 hypertension or hypotension; or 4) acute myocardial infarction; or 5) new onset congestive heart failure; or 6) capillary leak syndrome; or 7) acute kidney injury; or 8) biopsy-proven rejection.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants without any acute rejection, graft loss, or death at 6 months post transplant.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Rejection will be determined as biopsy-proven allograft rejection (BPAR). Graft loss will be counted when the patient loses kidney function to the point that they require chronic renal replacement therapy (e.g., dialysis for more than 8 weeks or a re-transplant).</description>
