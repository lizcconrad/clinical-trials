  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a persistent systemic disease. WHO (World Health Organization)
      commented that a crucial goal of heath care for RA is prevention of loss of daily function by
      patients' self-management (SM) skills; however, a comprehensive rheumatoid arthritis
      self-management (RASm) for RA patients' day-to-day self-managing is limited in Taiwan.

      Aims: The aims of the study are: (1) to implement the RASm program, (2) to determine the
      effectiveness of the program with 6 months follow-up, and (3) to understand participants'
      experiences when receiving the RASm program for the experimental group.

      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a persistent systemic disease. WHO (World Health Organization)
      commented that a crucial goal of heath care for RA is prevention of loss of daily function by
      patients' self-management (SM) skills; however, a comprehensive rheumatoid arthritis
      self-management program for RA patients' day-to-day self-managing is limited in Taiwan. The
      aims of the study are: (1) to implement the rheumatoid arthritis self-management program, and
      (2) to determine the effectiveness of the program with 6 months follow-up. The project will
      design to implement and evaluate the rheumatoid arthritis self-management program for RA
      patients using two groups experimental design. A medical center in northern Taiwan will be
      selected and patients who visited the RA departments will be eligible for the study if they
      are: (1) diagnosed with RA, (2) age of 20 years or over, (3) disease considered have been
      stable for at least 3 months, and (4) able to understand and comply with the study treatment.
      After completion of baseline data, patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention or
      control group using a computerized allocation procedure and follow the CONSORT flow diagram.
      Control patients received usual care, and the intervention group will receive the 6-week
      rheumatoid arthritis self-management program which based on self-efficacy theory. The
      independent variable of the program will be the four information include mastery experience,
      social modeling, social persuasion and physical and emotional states, and the strategies
      involve education, goal setting and attainment, self-monitoring, and phone calls. All
      participants will follow up for 6 months, and the data will be collected at the baseline, and
      2, 3, and 6 months. The statistics with the GEE (generalized estimating equation) analysis
      will be used to evaluate the outcomes such as the disease activity (DAS-28), arthritis
      self-efficacy (ASE), physical functioning (MHAQ), quality of life (SF-36), self-management
      behaviors, and health care utilization. Through enhance the capacity of self-management
      program for the RA cases to reduce the health care utilization and patients' and caregivers'
      burden.

    <measure>Disease activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity was measured using the DAS-28 (Disease Activity Score-28) which evaluated 28 tender and swollen joint counts of rheumatoid arthritis patients. This scale was used to calculate the 28 tender and swollen joint counts. Scores can range from 0 to 9.4. The lower score represent a better RA outcome.</description>

    <measure>Arthritis Self-efficacy- pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We used the arthritis self-efficacy-pain (ASE-pain) to measure RA patients' pain self-efficacy. The ASE-pain used visual analogue scales (0-10), in which 0 means 'very uncertain' and 10 means 'very certain'; a higher score refers to higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Arthritis Self-efficacy- other</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We used the arthritis self-efficacy-other (ASE-OS) to measure RA patients' other symptoms self-efficacy. The ASE-OS used visual analogue scales (0-10), in which 0 means 'very uncertain' and 10 means 'very certain'; a higher score refers to higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short-form 36 includes one multi-item scale that assesses 8 dimensions of health: physical functioning (PF), social functioning (SF), role limitations because of physical health problems (RP), bodily pain (BP), general mental health (psychological distress and well-being; MH), limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems (RE), vitality (energy and fatigue; VT), and general health perceptions (GH), was used to assess the quality of life in this study.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire was used to measure the physical functioning for this study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-management behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess self-management behaviors the researchers developed a joint activity and protection self-management behaviors scale. The scale consists of eight items and ranges from zero for 'never' to four for 'always'. Higher scores indicate a higher level of use of each of the self-management behavior.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health care utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Four items of the Stanford Health Care Utilization scale was measured from the self-reported number of contacts with general physicians including clinical and emergency visits as well as hospitalizations. We calculated the number of patients' medical visits, and the score can be from zero to the number of actual medical visits.</description>

    <description>An individualized home-based rheumatoid arthritis self-management program for managing RA patients' physical behavioral problems was applied for the intervention group. The program was based on the self-efficacy theory and the four resources were incorporated to emphasize patients' knowledge, skill, and responsibility in managing their RA situations.</description>

    <description>The intervention group received the rheumatoid arthritis self-management program which was based on Bandura's theory of self-efficacy and proposes that self-efficacy is influenced by four information sources: mastery of experience, social modeling, social persuasion and one's physical and emotional states. To enhance participants' self-management skill, the following strategies were employed: peer story-telling, assessment, family involvement, goal setting, self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and phone calls consultation.</description>
