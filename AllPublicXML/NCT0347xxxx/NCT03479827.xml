  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to quantify wavefront aberration profiles of the eye with and
      without contact lens across the visual field. This will enable us to investigate the impact
      of the aberration on retinal image quality.

      The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of monofocal and bifocal soft contact
      lenses in the changes of peripheral optical quality and through-focus visual performance on
      real eyes. The goal will be accomplished by performing optical measurements using
      Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with and without the use of single vision and bifocal soft
      contact lenses.
