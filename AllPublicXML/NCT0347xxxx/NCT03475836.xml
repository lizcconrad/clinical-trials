  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the cognitive and mood effects of mint essential oils in a group of
      healthy, human adults. The investigational product will also be tested in vitro to ensure a
      number of biological mechanisms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The volatile components of essential oils (e.g. sage, lemon balm and rosemary)are found to
      exert a number of psychotropic effects and the monoterpenes in particular seem to be
      responsible for the cognitive and mood effects attributed to them.

      The current study aims to investigate the cognitive and mood effects of mint essential oil in
      humans and to ensure the efficacy of the investigational product by conducting in vitro
      analysis on central nervous system receptor binding properties.

      This will be achieved by analysing gamma-Aminobutyric acid A (GABAA), neuronal nicotinic and
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) glutamate receptor binding efficacy,
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
      analysis will quantify % Limonene, % Carvone, % Menthone and % Menthol levels in the
      investigational treatment.

      Cognitive and mood assessment will be via a randomised, placebo controlled, crossover design
      in 24, healthy adults aged between 18-35 yrs which will involve x1 training and x3 testing
      visits to the lab (placebo, 50 (micro Litre) μL and 100 μL Mentha piperita essential oil).

    <description>Changes in cognitive function as assessed by the following tasks: immediate and delayed word and picture recognition; name to face recall; 'Sternberg' Numeric Working Memory task; Corsi blocks; serial 3 subtractions; serial 7 subtractions; rapid visual information processing; peg and ball and choice reaction time. All tasks provide an outcome measure of accuracy, speed and error.</description>

    <measure>Changes in mood</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3 and 6 hrs post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in mood assessed via the Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Bond-Lader visual analogue mood scales. Scores on both measures are calculated at baseline and scores from subsequent completions are subtracted from this to produce change (change from baseline) scores. For both STAI and Bond-Lader these are numerical scores.</description>
