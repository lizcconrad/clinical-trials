  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial in up to 25 males and
      non-pregnant females, 18-45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and
      immunogenicity of a single intranasal dose of Sendai virus vectored Respiratory Syncytial
      Virus (SeVRSV) vaccine. The subjects will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive SeVRSV
      vaccine at a dose of 1 x 10^7 EID50 or placebo (saline) intranasally. Study duration is
      approximately 11 months with subject participation duration approximately 6 months. The
      primary objectives are to: 1) assess the safety and reactogenicity of SeVRSV vaccine
      following receipt of one intranasal dose; 2) assess the ELISA antibody responses to SeV and
      to the RSV F protein at 28 days post receipt of one intranasal dose of SeVRSV vaccine; 3)
      assess the detection of vaccine virus from nasal washes at days 3, 5, 8 and 15 following
      receipt of one intranasal dose of SeVRSV vaccine.

      This is a Phase I randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial in up to 25 males and
      non-pregnant females, 18-45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and
      immunogenicity of a single intranasal dose of Sendai virus vectored Respiratory Syncytial
      Virus (SeVRSV) vaccine. The subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive
      SeVRSV vaccine at a dose of 1 x 10^7 EID50 or placebo (saline) intranasally. Since this is a
      first in human, phase I study, the first two subjects (sentinels) will be enrolled in the
      SeVRSV treatment arm. Safety and laboratory data will be collected through 14 days post
      vaccination. If none of the predefined halting criteria of sentinel subjects are met,
      enrollment of the remaining subjects will proceed. If any of the pre-defined halting criteria
      of sentinel subjects are met, an electronic review by the SMC will be required prior to
      continuation of the study. While safety is evaluated for the sentinel subjects, no new
      subjects will be enrolled, but screening may continue. Study duration is approximately 11
      months with subject participation duration approximately 6 months. The primary objectives are
      to: 1) assess the safety and reactogenicity of SeVRSV vaccine following receipt of one
      intranasal dose; 2) assess the ELISA antibody responses to SeV and to the RSV F protein at 28
      days post receipt of one intranasal dose of SeVRSV vaccine; 3) assess the detection of
      vaccine virus from nasal washes at days 3, 5, 8 and 15 following receipt of one intranasal
      dose of SeVRSV vaccine.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study procedures. 2. Are able
        to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study
        visits/phone calls.

        3. Males or non-pregnant females 18-45, inclusive. 4. Are in good health

          -  As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
             currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have
             been present for at least 90 days that would affect the assessment of the safety of
             subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or
             conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic
             prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the
             chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any
             prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company,
             etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of
             medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change
             in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by
             the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be
             considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as
             needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or
             appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses
             to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the
             exception of steroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria), herbals,
             vitamins, and supplements are permitted.

             blood pressure (BP) is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive. 9. Women of childbearing potential

                  procedure, and still menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last menses if menopausal.

                  --- Includes, but is not limited to, non-male sexual relationships, abstinence
                  from sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with a
                  vasectomized partner, male condoms with the use of applied spermicide,
                  intrauterine devices, NuvaRing, and licensed hormonal methods such as implants,
