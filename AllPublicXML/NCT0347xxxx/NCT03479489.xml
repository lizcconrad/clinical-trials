    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the change in patient reported pain across four categories from baseline within the 60 day follow-up period. In every patient diary, subjects will be asked to assess their pain on a 10 point Likert scale under the following conditions
Do you experience pain continuously?
Do you experience pain with activity?
Do you experience pain while sitting?
Do you experience pain with bowel movements?</description>
