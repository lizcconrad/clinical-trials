  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) is a lethal, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage
      disorder characterized by neurodegeneration in early childhood and death in adolescence. NPC
      results from mutation of either the Niemann-Pick C1 disease (NPC1) (~95% of cases) or NPC2
      genes. NPC is characterized by the endolysosomal storage of unesterified cholesterol and
      lipids in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues such as the liver.
      Individuals with NPC demonstrate progressive central nervous system decline including
      inability to coordinate balance, gait, extremity and eye movements. Acute liver disease in
      the newborn/infant period is frequently observed, but subsequently resolves. However,
      chronic, sub-clinical liver disease persists. Intrathecal 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin
      (HP-β-CD, VTS-270) has proven effective in reducing the signs and prolonging life in animal
      models and Phase 1/2a data support efficacy in NPC1 patients. VTS-270 also has been shown to
      be effective in treating liver disease in the NPC1 cat.

      This Phase 1/2a, open-label, multiple ascending dose trial will evaluate whether VTS-270
      administered intravenously is effective in treating acute liver disease in NPC1 infants.

      In the first phase of the study, infants will be treated for a total of 6 weeks, treated
      twice weekly. Infants will be admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for the
      first week of treatment. Procedures during the first week of the study will include blood
      draws for genetic testing, clinical and research blood draws, urine collection, abdominal
      ultrasound, peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) placement, hearing screening, and the
      first two IV VTS-270 infusions through the PICC line. Weeks 2-6 will occur on an outpatient
      basis. During week 2-6, the infant will receive 2 doses per week of VTS-270 with blood draws
      and urine collection during weeks 2, 4, and 6. PICC line will be removed after final
      infusion.

      Subjects who demonstrate statistically significant reduction either in the glycine-conjugated
      trihydroxycholanic acid biomarker or serum bilirubin (direct bilirubin or direct bilirubin:
      total bilirubin ratio) will be allowed to crossover into the second phase of the study, an
      open label phase of six months duration in which IV VTS-270 will be administered monthly for
      a total of six doses. Month 1-6 procedures will occur on an outpatient basis. Procedures
      during the second phase include a monthly intravenous line placement. After each monthly
      visit, the intravenous line will be removed.
