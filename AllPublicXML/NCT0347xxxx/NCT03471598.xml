  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired motor function is common after stroke. Individuals with stroke often exhibit
      synergic pattern that disturb daily function. It is crucial to identify the movement
      impairment in the clinical settings. Upright Motor Control Test (UMCT) is one of the tests
      developed to assess the selective movement control and functional strength in people with
      central nervous disorders. It can be used to reflect the impairment of motor function and
      evaluate changes of performance after treatment. Yet is little to know the clinimetrics of
      the UMCT on clinical utility. To date, only few researches explore that UMCT has some
      construct and criterion validity.

      Therefore, this study aims to 1) establish the inter-rater reliability to administer the
      UMCT. 2) explore the correlation between the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after
      Stroke (FMA) and UMCT. 3). investigate whether the UMCT is able to predict the walking
      ability in patients with stroke.
