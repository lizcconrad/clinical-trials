    <textblock>
      This study analyzed diabetic patients without evidence of glaucoma who underwent panretinal
      photocoagulation to determine the effect on optic disc topographic parameters in
      non-glaucomatous patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) are two very prevalent diseases that
      often coexist. Previous literature suggest that panretinal photocoagulation may somehow lead
      to optic disk cupping. Therefore, evaluation of the optic disc cupping and of possible
      glaucomatous damage in patients with diabetic retinopathy can be difficult, especially after
      PRP treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term effect of PRP on optic
      disc topographic parameters in non-glaucomatous patients with PDR using Heidelberg retina
      tomograph (HRT) parameters and stereo photography. The Investigators found that PRP does not
      cause morphological optic disk changes in diabetic PDR patients after one year of follow-up.

    <description>In cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the first-line treatment. Although PRP reduces the risk of severe vision loss, it has been shown that laser energy can cause destruction to all layers of retina including the ganglion cells and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and therefore generate visual field defects similar to that observed in glaucomatous damage. In such cases, visual field testing can be less helpful to evaluate glaucomatous damage in PDR patients treated with PRP.</description>
