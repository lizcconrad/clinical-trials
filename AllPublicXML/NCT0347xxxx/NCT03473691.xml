  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, pilot study assessing safety/feasibility and efficacy of neo-adjuvant
      glembatumumab vedotin (GV) in patients with high risk triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      with glycoprotein-NMB (gpNMB) expression ≥ 25%. Primary endpoints will be safety/feasibility,
      and secondary endpoints will be rates of pathologic complete response (pCR), and measurements
      of growth differentiation factor-11 (GDF11) and glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB) expression.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will receive neo-adjuvant dose-dense (DD) doxorubicin (Adriamycin)/cyclophosphamide
      (AC) followed by GV. After completion of neo-adjuvant therapy, all patients will undergo
      lumpectomy (with radiation therapy) or mastectomy, and tissue will be assessed for residual
      disease to determine rates of pCR. Tumor tissue will be obtained by core needle biopsy and at
      the time of surgery for use in the correlative studies.
