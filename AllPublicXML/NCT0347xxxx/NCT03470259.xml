  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 50 % of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients have central lymph node metastases
      (CLNM), which are associated with a high risk of persistent or recurrent disease. However,
      the practice of performing a prophylactic central lymph node dissection (PCLND) routinely
      remains controversial. The proponents argue that without a PCLND, PTC patients with positive
      lymph nodes have an increased risk of local recurrence, and postponed node dissection leads
      to with 5-6 fold higher risk of morbidity. If performed, PCLND in clinical node negative
      patients increases staging to pN1 in more than 50% of the cases without increasing survival.
      The complication rate in PCLND is lower when compared to a technically challenging
      re-exploration in recurrent disease, with reported incidences of 0.6% and 7.3-20%,
      respectively. Opponents of routine PCLND point out the lack of randomized clinical trials and
      object to treatment-induced hypo-parathyroidism and recurrent nerve damage for the N0
      patients. Currently, no diagnostic tool is available which reliably identifies these patient
      categories. Therefore, there is a clear need for novel diagnostic imaging modalities that
      overcome this issue. Molecular Fluorescence Guided Surgery (MFGS) is potentially such a
      diagnostic tool. The administration of NIR fluorescent tracers can increase detection
      accuracy of cancer and nodal metastatic tissue using macroscopic MFGS. Therefore, we aimed to
      identify a GMP-produced near infrared (NIR) tracer that potentially has a high
      target-to-background ratio in PTC compared to normal thyroid tissue. Tyrosine-protein kinase
      Met (c-Met) is significantly upregulated at the protein level in PTC compared to normal
      thyroid tissue. The investigators therefore hypothesize that the GMP-produced NIR-fluorescent
      tracer EMI-137 (targeting c-Met, peak emission at 675 nm range) might be useful for
      intraoperative imaging of PTC and nodal metastases. The investigators' aim is to investigate
      if the administration of EMI-137 is a feasible approach to enable intraoperative selection of
      PTC patients for CLND. Eventually, secondary the investigators might also be able to
      visualize multifocality, more selective lateral neck dissections and asses residual tissue
      after thyroidectomy. Ultimately, all of these strategies may reduce overtreatment, morbidity,
      and costs while maintaining the same or better effectiveness with a lower recurrence rate and
      improved quality of life.
