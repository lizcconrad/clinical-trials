  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional device study aims to compare mainly standard Multiple Dose Injection
      (MDI) therapy vs. Accu-Chek® Solo Micropump System and investigates participant satisfaction.
      In addition, a third arm is included to compare to only similar product on the market which
      is OmniPod. The third arm is for data collection purpose.
