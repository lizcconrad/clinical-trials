  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the publication of the law &quot; Hôpital, Patients, Santé, Territoire &quot; of 2009 in France,
      the development of telemedicine is a public health issue. It is also a government priority
      registered in the government investment plan of 2017-2018.

      The quality of preanesthesia teleconsultation at home, through video-conference, has never
      been tested in practice.The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of preanesthesia
      teleconsultations through video-conference, compared with traditional preanesthesia
      consultations. The quality is established by the assessment of the primary outcome : the
      risks related to difficult intubation, in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery at the
      Surgical Center Emile Galle. Our research hypothesis is that there is no difference between
      the quality of preanesthesia teleconsultations through video-conference, and the quality of
      traditional preanesthesia consultations. Secondary objectives are to identify satisfaction
      and preoperative anxiety of patients regarding teleconsultation, to identify satisfaction of
      practioners regarding teleconsultation, to evaluate the quality (based on the assessment of
      secondary outcomes) of preanesthesia teleconsultations compared with traditional
      preanesthesia consultations, and to evaluate the technical viability of generalising
      preanesthesia teleconsultation.
