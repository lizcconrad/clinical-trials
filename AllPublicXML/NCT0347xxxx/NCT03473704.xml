  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In diabetes, web programs have been designed that have integrated cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT) with diabetes education, obtaining positive results in the mood of the patient.
      In Spain, no similar approach has been performed in people with diabetes and depression.
      However, the need to provide professionals with adequate tools to help people with this
      problem is justified.

      The main objective of this project is to apply a telematic program for the treatment of
      specific depression for people with type 1 diabetes designed by our research team in a sample
      of patients with type 1 diabetes and mild-moderate depressive symptomatology of the province
      of Malaga. To do this, the sample will be divided into two groups: treatment group (TG) and
      control group (CG). The design of the study is quasi-experimental, longitudinal randomized
      pre-post with control group. The treatment group (TG) will receive the web treatment, which
      consists of 9 weekly sessions, while the control group (CG) will be evaluated in the same
      phases as the TG. For ethical reasons, the CG will receive the web treatment once the TG
      intervention has been completed. There will be a follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months.

      On the website will be collected the 9 sessions of which the treatment consists. The sessions
      will be weekly. Each week, the patient will find a brief summary of the previous session and
      an introduction to the topic, where the new session will be explained. Then, the patient will
      be provided with the new information (the topic treated) and different examples will be added
      to facilitate understanding. Once the information is presented, a summary of the key ideas of
      the session and a small evaluation to assess the understanding on the part of the patient
      will be presented. At the end of the session, the patient will have the key ideas and a
      self-evaluation of the session. Finally, the patient will be explained the task to be
      performed and sent to the therapist with an example of how to perform it. In addition, the
      patient will have a bibliography of each of the topics discussed. Each session will last
      20-30 minutes.
