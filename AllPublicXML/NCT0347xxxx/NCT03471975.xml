      prospective randomised trial to compare the teaching effect for tracheal intubation following
      training with McGrath video laryngoscope as direct laryngoscope versus training with McGrath
      video laryngoscope as video laryngoscope

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy is very important technique in clinical
      medicine. But the training for intubation is not very easy because laryngoscopic view is
      difficult to share between trainee and trainer.

      Recently there have been reported that tracheal intubation training using video laryngoscopy
      have some advantages and showed more success rate.

      McGrath Video laryngoscopy can be used as either video laryngoscopy or direct laryngoscopy.
      Therefore when McGrath is used as intubation training tool, the trainer can monitor and
      educate the procedure while the trainee perform tracheal intubation.

      The aim of this study is comparing the teaching effect for tracheal intubation following
      training with McGrath video laryngoscope as direct laryngoscope versus training with McGrath
      video laryngoscope as video laryngoscope
