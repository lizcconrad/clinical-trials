  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline is approved for the treatment of rosacea. This work
      investigated the pharmacokinetics of doxycycline in skin and plasma of fed and fasting
      healthy volunteers receiving a 14-day treatment course with once daily 40 mg doxycycline.
      Dermal measurements were performed by means of in vivo microdialysis.
