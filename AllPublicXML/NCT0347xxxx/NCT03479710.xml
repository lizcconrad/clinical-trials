  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) present an increasingly serious public health threat to
      the global community.The prevalence of various MDRO, including carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), has been increasing
      worldwide, and some have become endemic in certain countries. Data from the Hospital
      Authority showed that the number of carbapenemase- producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) cases
      increased from 36 in 2012 to 134 in 2015. A large outbreak of VRE involving &gt;200 patients was
      recently reported in a tertiary hospital in Hong Kong.

      The primary site of colonization and persistence of most MDRO is in the gastrointestinal
      tract. Carriage can persist for months, with up to 40% of individuals still having
      colonization one year after hospital discharge. Outbreaks of MDRO have been reported in
      hospitals and long-term care facilities. Around 10% of patients colonized with MDRO would
      develop clinical infections by the same organism. Infections caused by these MDRO carry
      significant morbidity and high mortality of up to 50%, however, there is no proven therapy
      for eradication of intestinal colonization of MDRO.

      There is accumulating evidence showing that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the
      control of intestinal colonization and infection by pathogenic bacteria. Administration of
      obligate anaerobic commensal bacteria to mice has been shown to markedly reduce VRE
      colonization. Preliminary evidence, mainly from anecdotal reports, have shown that fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT) in human carriers of MDRO were safe and potentially
      effective in eliminating intestinal colonization by various MDRO, including CRE and VRE, even
      in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that FMT will be safe and
      potentially effective in eradicating intestinal colonization of CRE and VRE.

      This is a prospective pilot study to evaluate whether FMT is safe and effective to eradicate
      intestinal colonization of CRE and VRE.
