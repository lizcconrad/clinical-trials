    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the empagliflozin as add-on thearpy compared
      to insulin glargine-based antidiabetic agents (OADs) combination thearpy in patients with
      type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on triple OADs in a real clinical practice.
