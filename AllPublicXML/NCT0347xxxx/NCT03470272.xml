  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red light laser therapy using 635nm red light laser technology has previously been shown to
      cause lipolysis in subcutaneous fat as a non-surgical method to promote weight loss and body
      contouring. This study hypothesizes that red LED light therapy using 650nm red light LED
      (light emitting diode) technology produces similar results to the laser device (red LASER
      635nm) when preformed using a specified treatment protocol.

      Red light laser therapy using 635nm red light laser technology has previously been shown to
      cause lipolysis in subcutaneous fat as a non-surgical method to promote weight loss and body
      contouring. This study hypothesizes that red LED light therapy using 650nm red light LED
      (light emitting diode) technology produces similar results to the laser device (red LASER
      635nm) when preformed using a specified treatment protocol.

      Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the Vevazz therapy program achieves the results after
      one 28 minute treatment period. The predicate 635nm LED device (Photonica Professional by
      Ward Photonics) achieves its results after one 32 minute therapy program.

      The FB Professional therapy program uses the FB Professional LED device for fat removal using
      LED red light therapy. This multi-site study reviews results from 70 randomly selected
      patients after a single treatment using the FB Professional LED device.
