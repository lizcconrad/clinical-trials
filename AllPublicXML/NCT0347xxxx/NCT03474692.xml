      The purpose of this registry is to establish a research data repository, comprised primarily
      of data generated in the course of clinical care, to conduct research on Virta Health
      clinical interventions and the chronic diseases suffered by Virta Health patients. This
      single-center repository that makes use of all clinical data generated through the provision
      of clinical services by Virta Health for its patients. Additional research-only patient
      follow-up information will also be collected via questionnaire.

      The purpose of this registry is to establish a research data repository, comprised primarily
      of data generated in the course of clinical care, to conduct research on Virta Health
      clinical interventions and the chronic diseases suffered by Virta Health patients. This
      single-center repository that makes use of all clinical data generated through the provision
      of clinical services by Virta Health for its patients. Additional research-only patient
      follow-up information will also be collected via questionnaire.

      The scope of research under this protocol includes the following:

        1. Examining the efficacy, safety, and sustainability of Virta Health clinical
           interventions for treating chronic diseases and preventing associated adverse health
           outcomes.

        2. Examining the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of Virta Health clinical
           interventions for treating chronic diseases and preventing associated adverse health
           outcomes.

        3. Identifying demographics, clinical characteristics, co-morbidities, concomitant
           treatments, genetic variants, and behavioral phenotypes that predict more or less
           favorable clinical outcomes of subjects to Virta Health clinical interventions for
           chronic diseases.

        4. Examining the impact of mental health and the behavioral modification components of
           Virta Health clinical interventions on disease markers, co-morbidities, and adverse
           health outcomes associated with Virta Health clinical interventions.

        5. Characterizing typical presentation patterns, genetic determinants, biochemistry, and
           pathophysiology of the chronic diseases under treatment by Virta Health.

        6. Exploring relationships between dietary composition and physiologic characteristics of
           chronic diseases.

        7. Exploring the interrelationship and common clinical/biological features of the various
           chronic diseases under treatment by Virta Health.

        8. Compiling case reports and case series of interesting disease presentations and
           outcomes, of the chronic diseases Virta Health treats, that may inform about the disease
           state and treatment responses.

        9. Validating the integration of technological aids into Virta Health clinical
           interventions. Where the impacts of devices are examined, devices will be FDA-approved
           and approved, marketed devices. No safety or effectiveness data will be collected on
           devices; rather, research will focus only on the feasibility of adding the device to the
           treatment program and patient satisfaction attributable to the device.

       10. Understanding the relationships of patient needs, educational methods, and use of the
           Virta Health online Application, to subsequent patient satisfaction/clinical outcomes.
