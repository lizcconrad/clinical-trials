    <textblock>
      Subjects will be admitted to hospital the evening prior, or the morning of surgery, whereupon
      they will undergo standard admission processes, including pre-operative assessment by the
      anaesthetist assigned to that list (One of the two study authors). The anaesthetist will then
      explain the study again, reiterating the potential risks and benefits of the study to the
      patient themselves, and to the population as a whole. Consent will be sought at this point.

      Patients will be transferred to theatre, anaesthetised and operated on as per normal
      practice. Inclusive of this, in accordance with NICE guidelines, patients will have a nasal
      or oesophageal Doppler probe inserted to accurately measure core temperature. At this point,
      patients enrolled in the study will have temperature measurements taken every minute from the
      oesophageal probe and non-contact thermometers.

      If the patients requested it previously, they will be informed of the results of the study at
      a later date.

      Statistics will then be carried out on the data to compare accuracy of the two novel methods
      to the oesophageal probe.
