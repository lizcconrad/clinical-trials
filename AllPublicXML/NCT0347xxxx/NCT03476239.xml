    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the rate of hematological response (complete
      remission/complete remission with partial hematological recovery [CR/CRh*]) induced by
      blinatumomab in Chinese adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-precursor acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      The study will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period.

      This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate efficacy and safety
      of the BiTE (bispecific T cell engager) antibody blinatumomab in Chinese adult subjects with
      relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. The study will consist of a screening period, a
      treatment period, and a follow-up period.

      Treatment will consist of up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab. Subjects who have achieved a bone
      marrow (BM) response (≤ 5% BM blasts) or CR/CRh*/CRi within 2 induction cycles of treatment
      may continue to receive up to 3 additional consolidation cycles of blinatumomab. Thirty days
      (± 3 days) after end of the last dose of protocol-specified therapy, subjects will have a
      safety follow-up visit.

      If subjects are suitable for alloHSCT after treatment with blinatumomab, they may undergo
      alloHSCT instead of receiving further consolidation cycles with blinatumomab.

      Subjects will be followed via clinic visit or telephone contact every 3 months +/- 2 weeks
      after their safety follow-up visit until death has been observed or a maximum of 2 years
      after start of treatment, whichever occurs first

    <description>BM smears (slides) at screening and at the end of each treatment cycle (6 weeks/cycle) will be collected for cytomorphology testing.
The degree of BM infiltration defined by the percentage of leukemic blasts in BM will be evaluated by local laboratories as per cytological assessment. In addition, the BM slides will be provided to the designated central laboratories for hematological assessment.
The results of the local laboratory are applicable for inclusion into the study and for the decision if pre-treatment should be administered if the results of the central laboratory are not yet available at the time these decisions are made. For evaluation of baseline and response, the result of the central laboratory will prevail.</description>
