      Bladder Cancer Cohort:

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by
      vein 1 time each week for 4 weeks before your cystectomy. During Week 1, your dose of
      daratumumab will be given over 8 hours. After that, each dose will be given over about 4
      hours.

      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion
      related reaction:

        -  You will get drugs, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before the
           infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get drugs, including inhaled
           steroids, after the infusion.

        -  The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction.

        -  You may stay overnight in the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check
           your health.

      You may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications you will
      receive to lower your chance of an infusion-related reaction, including how they are
      administered and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 4 doses of daratumumab before your surgery. You will no longer be able
      to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if
      you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).

      Study Visits:

      During Weeks 1-4:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing.
           Daratumumab will interfere with blood type testing which is needed before blood
           transfusions can be given. For this reason, a test to find out your blood type will be
           performed before you receive daratumumab. You should carry the blood type card with you
           while you are on this study.

      During Weeks 6-8 (the week of your surgery):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and part of this sample will
           also be used for blood type testing.

        -  You will have surgery to remove your bladder. You will sign a separate consent form
           explaining the procedure and its risks in more detail.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      During Weeks 12-14, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      During Week 18, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and you will be
      asked about any side effects you are having.

      Renal Cancer Cohort:

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by
      vein 1 time each week for 8 weeks before your nephrectomy, metastasectomy, or biopsy. During
      Week 1, your dose of daratumumab will be given over 8 hours. After that, each dose will be
      given over about 4 hours.

      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion
      related reaction:

        -  You will get drugs, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before the
           infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get drugs, including inhaled
           steroids, after the infusion.

        -  The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction.

        -  You may stay overnight in the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check
           your health.

      You may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications you will
      receive to lower your chance of an infusion-related reaction, including how they are
      administered and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 8 doses of daratumumab prior to your surgery or biopsy. You may receive
      additional doses of daratumumab after the surgery/biopsy for up to one year after your first
      dose. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).

      Study Visits:

      During Weeks 1-8:

        -  You will have a physical exam each week before you receive daratumumab.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing.
           Daratumumab treatment will interfere with blood type testing which is needed before
           blood transfusions can be given. For this reason, a test to find out your blood type
           will be performed before you receive daratumumab. You should carry the blood type card
           with you while you are on this study.

      During Weeks 10-12 (the week of your surgery/tissue collection):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, part of this sample will
           also be used for blood type testing.

        -  You will have surgery to remove your kidney, a kidney cancer lesion, or repeat biopsy.
           You will sign a separate consent form explaining the procedure and its risks in more
           detail.

      During Weeks 14-30:

        -  You will have a physical exam and return every 2 weeks to receive daratumumab.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing.

      During Weeks 30-52:

        -  You will have a physical exam and return every month to receive daratumumab.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      During Week 52, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      During Week 65, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and you will be
      asked about any side effects you are having.

          2. RENAL COHORT Histological documentation of renal cell carcinoma with a clear cell
             component in the metastatic renal cell carcinoma cohort.

          3. RENAL COHORT Patients with an outside biopsy within 12 months is allowed for entry
             requirements. During the screening phase, patients without a tissue diagnosis may
             undergo a renal biopsy for histologic confirmation on PA13-0291.

          4. RENAL COHORT Patients must have measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1 criteria in at
             least one site that is not the site for planned surgical resection or serial biopsy.

          5. RENAL COHORT If the kidney primary tumor is in place this is the preferred site of
             biopsy.

          6. RENAL COHORT Patients who have progression of disease or intolerance to a tyrosine
             kinase inhibitor (TKI) and to a PD-1 (like nivolumab) or PD-L1 (like atezolizumab)
             regimen. There is no limit to number of prior treatment regimens as long as the
             patient meets other eligibility criteria.

          7. RENAL &amp; BLADDER Subject must be &gt;/=18 years of age.

          8. RENAL &amp; BLADDER Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically
             accepted barrier methods of contraception (eg, male or female condom) during the
             course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if
             oral contraceptives are also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree
             to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control during the course of
             the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s);

          9. RENAL &amp; BLADDER Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at
             screening. Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females
             capable of becoming pregnant (ie, females who have had any evidence of menses in the
             past 12 months, with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However,
             women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,
             antiestrogens, low body weight, ovarian suppression or other reasons.

         10. RENAL &amp; BLADDER ECOG performance status (PS) grade of &lt;/= 2.

         11. RENAL COHORT Recovery to baseline or &lt;/= Grade 1 CTCAE v.5.0 from toxicities related
