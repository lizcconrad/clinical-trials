    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of Observation of Action
      (Action Observation, AO) both in increasing the speed of movement of the upper limbs, agility
      and locomotion, and in improving the activities and quality of life in people with
      Parkinson's disease (PD) during a 4-6 month follow-up. The second objective is to evaluate
      the feasibility and effectiveness of a tele-rehabilitation protocol using home-based AO
      therapy. The telecommunication technology will provide a complete training through a low-cost
      software run on a touch-screen device, which will show the actions to be imitated several
      times by people with PD. This project will be the first attempt to implement AO-based
      treatment at home and, if successful, will be highly translational to clinical practice
      thanks to the advanced development and broad accessibility of information technology and
      telecommunications in our country. Furthermore, continuous exercise will reduce the risks of
      complications and the frequency of hospital admissions, thus reducing costs for the National
      Health System.

      will provide a complete training through a low-cost software run on a touch-screen device,

      admissions, thus reducing costs for the National Health System.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) should impose a growing social and economic burden on our country.
      In fact, even with optimal medical management, people with PD experience a worsening of
      mobility and independence in daily activities, with a consequent reduction in quality of
      life. In the last ten years there has been a growing demand to consider rehabilitation as an
      essential adjunct to pharmacological treatment. However, the reference rates for
      physiotherapy for people with Parkinson's disease have been historically low, both because of
      poor compliance by patients with the therapies of the movement and because of the scarce
      availability of physiotherapy services. Action Observation Therapy (AO) has recently been
      described as an effective strategy in stroke rehabilitation (Sale 2011, 2012), since it can
      shape the reorganization of the neural circuit, promote neural plasticity and motor learning.
      . The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of AO therapy on PD-related disability
      and to verify the feasibility of a home-based AO protocol.

      The first specific objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of action
      observation as an additional rehabilitative tool to improve upper limb function in terms of
      bradykinesia and dexterity and to investigate the stability of treatment effects after 4 / 6
      months of follow-up regarding functional improvement and quality of life (QoL). The second
      specific objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the observation of the
      action as an additional rehabilitative tool to improve the balance , gait and, consequently,
      to reduce falls, and to investigate the stability of treatment effects at 4/6 months of
      follow-up in terms of functional improvement and quality of life (QoL). The third objective
      is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a home telerehabilitation protocol (TR)
      based on AO therapy to improve dexterity and ambulation in people with Parkinson's disease.

Participants will then be invited to perform movements of the limbs as far as possible for 2 minutes according to a standard sequence that involves articular mobilizations of upper limbs and simulates that performed by the experimental groups.</description>
