    <textblock>
      The close homology between the central and enteric nervous system suggests that a disease
      process affecting the central nervous system could also involve its enteric counterpart. This
      has already been demonstrated for patients with Parkinson's disease but needs to be proven
      for Alzheimer's disease. Studies on enteric nervous system during Alzheimer's disease are
      indeed in low number and don't have led to definite conclusion. The investigators thus
      propose to realize a complete analysis of the enteric nervous systems in Alzheimer's disease
      by studying the presence of &quot;tau' protein, of beta-amyloid peptide,...

      not only by immunohistochemical but also by a biochemical approach. This study will be
      realized from colonic samples.

    <textblock>
      The close homology between the central and enteric nervous system suggests that a disease
      process affecting the central nervous system could also involve its enteric counterpart. The
      investigators have recently shown in that the enteric neurons can be readily analyzed using
      routine colonic biopsies. The investigators propose that the enteric nervous system could
      represent a unique window to assess the neuropathology in living patients with a
      neurodegenerative disorder. The investigators have already used this approach to show that
      Parkinson's disease pathology was recapitulated in a single colonic biopsy. By contrast to
      Parkinson's disease, the detection of Alzheimer's disease pathology in the enteric neurons
      has so far failed. This may be due to the low number of human tissue samples in addition to
      the low sensitivity of the immunohistochemical methods that were used. The aim of the current
      research project will be therefore to reevaluate Alzheimer's disease pathology in a large
      number of human colonic samples using both a morphological and biochemical approach.

      The Hypothesis is that the enteric nervous system could represent a unique window to assess
      the neuropathology in living patients with Alzheimer's disease. This might open the way to
      the development of novel Alzheimer's disease biomarkers that will directly assess the
      neuropathological process.
