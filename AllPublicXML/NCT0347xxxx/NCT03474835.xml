      The purpose of the study: to increase the efficiency of diagnosis, treatment and prediction
      of the course of coronary heart disease in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate
      gland, depending on the hormonal status by determining the cardiovascular risk factors,
      factors of angiogenesis, structural and functional state of the heart, coronary vessels,
      kidney damage and their pharmacological correction.

      Research methods:

        1. general-clinical examination

        2. Laboratory methods:

             -  estimation of the generally accepted laboratory parameters

             -  determination of blood lipid profile

             -  Determination of the level of highly sensitive CRP by the method of immuno-enzyme
                analysis,

             -  determination of the level of proteinuria, creatinine by the method of
                immuno-enzyme analysis with the subsequent calculation of GFR

             -  determination of the level of insulin by the method of immuno-enzyme analysis with
                the subsequent calculation of indices of insulin resistance,

             -  determination of the level of blood testosterone by the method of immuno-enzyme
                analysis,

             -  determination of the levels of vascular-endothelial growth factor, angiosetamine by
                the immuno-enzyme assay,

        3. Echo-doppler examination of vessels (endothelium-dependent vasodilatation with reactive
           hyperemia, determination of the thickness of CIM, GPI)

        4. Ultrasound examination of the main vessels of the head and neck

        5. ECG

        6. Daily monitoring of BP

        7. CT-angiographic examination of coronary vessels with the definition of the index of
           calcification

        8. Statistical methods
