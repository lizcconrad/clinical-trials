  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of intra-articular administration of RegenoGel-OSP™ and
      RegenoGel™ to treat knee pain and effect on subject's activity and quality of life. During
      the study the subjects will receive two treatments at a 3-month interval. The study is
      double-blinded. The subjects will be randomized and sequentially assigned to RegenoGel-OSP™,
      RegenoGel or placebo treatment in the first treatment. In the second treatment after interval
      of three months all the subjects will necessarily receive one of the two active products. The
      follow-up period will continue for one year after first treatment.

    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain in the effected knee joint in response to treatment using the Visual Analog Score (VAS). VAS score is measured according to the patient's pain rating scale from 1 to 10. The scale of pain increases with increasing pain. For example, score 1 indicates absence of pain (minimum score) and score 10 indicates unbearable pain (maximum score). Each VAS score amounts to only one number of outcome from 1 to 10. VAS will be determined in resting position and in active position. No subscales are combined here.</description>
