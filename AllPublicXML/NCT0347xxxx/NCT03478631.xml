  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to determine the effect of a high-nitrate dietary intervention on blood
      pressure and markers of vascular function compared to a low-nitrate intervention in people
      with elevated blood pressure. Half of the participants will receive the high-nitrate
      dehydrated vegetable intervention, while the other half will receive the low-nitrate
      dehydrated vegetable intervention.This project will advance the current hypothesis on the
      therapeutic link between dietary nitrate and high blood pressure, and potentially derive
      impactful recommendations for individuals at risk of hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diets rich in fruits and in particular, vegetables, reduce blood pressure (BP) and the risk
      of cardiovascular events. Increasingly, attention is being given to high-nitrate containing
      vegetables, with emerging evidence that it might represent a source of vasoactive nitric
      oxide. Clinical data to date uniformly suggest an acute vasoprotective role of dietary
      nitrate administration and a BP-lowering effect. Whether the vascular effects extend to
      long-term intake and in individuals with elevated blood pressure is not well known. The
      investigators hypothesize that consumption of a dietary intervention high in nitrate from
      vegetable sources will have a greater effect on BP and related vascular parameters than a
      similar intervention that is low in dietary nitrates.
