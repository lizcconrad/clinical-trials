  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy in terms of objective response rate (ORR) of the combination of
      durvalumab and tremelimumab in addition with gemcitabine or in addition with gemcitabine and
      cisplatin in treatment-naïve patients with advanced, unresectable and/or metastatic
      cholangio- and gallbladder carcinoma (CCA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with CCA have poor outcomes, as a consequence of the very aggressive nature of the
      disease, and the limited treatment options. Thus there is a significant unmet medical need
      for additional treatment options for use in this patient population. As in most other tumor
      entities however, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy alone. Evidence
      suggests that those patients might preferentially have tumors that have favorable mutational
      landscapes, express the PD-L1 and/ or contain preexisting tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells
      that are inhibited locally, e.g., by PD-1 engagement. In order to increase the proportion of
      patients who could ultimately benefit from immunotherapies, it is important to develop
      strategies that can be employed for converting tumor microenvironments lacking T cell
      infiltration to ones displaying antitumor T-cell immunity and therefore to sensitize tumors
      to checkpoint inhibition therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the
      combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab in addition with gemcitabine or in addition with
      gemcitabine and cisplatin in treatment-naïve patients with advanced, unresectable and/or
      metastatic cholangio- and gallbladder carcinoma.
