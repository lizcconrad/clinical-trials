      -Background: Cancer is one of the most common cause of death. Cancer pain is often cited as
      one of the most feared in cancer patients. Although, WHO guidelines have been provided to
      improve pain outcome, the results are still unsatisfied. In order to improve cancer pain
      management we consider to contribute a new guideline which includes interdisciplinary
      approach, early doing the pain interventions, breakthrough pain, education, high quality of
      pain assessment and contribute the effectiveness follow-up system
