  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inlet patch is a congenital condition of the upper oesophagus, consisting of stomach lining
      that is in the wrong place. It affects 5% of the population. Symptoms are a feeling of a ball
      in the back of the throat (called chronic globus sensation), cough and sore throat - these
      account for 4% of general practitioner (GP) referral to Ear Nose &amp; Throat departments.

      There is no recognised treatment. Drugs that reduce acid may help but do not block mucus
      production. Argon Plasma coagulation has been shown to be successful but limited to a few
      expert centres. The investigators have previously shown a device that uses radiofrequency
      energy to remove the patch to be highly effective in a ten patient pilot study, with 80%
      response rate that was durable over 1 year.

      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the previous study was not due to placebo effect
      alone, with a sham controlled arm. Patients would then crossover to treatment at 6 months
      after sham. All males and non-pregnant females over 18 years old with previously diagnosed
      inlet patch causing symptoms of globus, with &gt; 50% severity on a visual analogue score, are
      eligible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inlet patch is a congenital anomaly of the upper oesophagus, consisting of stomach lining
      that is in an aberrant position. Prevalence is up to 10% on endoscopy studies and 5% on post
      mortem studies. There is thought to be a link with another condition of the lower oesophagus
      called Barrett's oesophagus, although there is limited evidence. Unlike Barrett's oesophagus,
      progression to cancer from an inlet patch is exceptionally rare.

      The inlet patch can produce acid and mucus, and is associated with symptoms including sore
      throat, cough and hoarseness. One particular symptom, called globus pharyngeus (the feeling
      of a ball in the back of the throat) is often associated with an inlet patch.

      There is no recognised treatment for symptomatic inlet patch. Anti-acid medications works for
      some but not all, which may in part be explained by the lack of acid producing cells in some
      inlet patches. Ablation of the inlet patch has been successful in small series using Argon
      Plasma Coagulation. This device is, however, associated with inter user variability and
      unpredictable depth of ablation. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using the BarrxTM System is a
      National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and FDA approved device for
      treatment of abnormal oesophageal lining, which has shown to be successful in reversing
      Barrett's oesophagus to normal squamous lining. These devices are advantageous as the depth
      of ablation is controlled. The investigators have previously demonstrated, in a pilot study,
      that these devices are safe and effective for reversal of inlet patch to normal mucosa, with
      improvement in symptoms.

      This study will use the BarrxTM system to treat patients with symptomatic inlet patch that is
      refractory to standard anti-acid medication, in a blinded sham controlled trial.

    <description>Ablation using the Barrx RFA System is a new technique for field ablation in the oesophagus. It has been used for eradication of diseased epithelium of all three subclasses of Barrett's oesophagus (non-dysplastic Intestinal metaplasia (IM), Low grade dysplasia (LGD) and High grade dysplasia (HGD). The BarrxTM RFA System uses ultra short pulse RF energy delivering 40Watts/cm2 power density and 12Joule/cm2 energy density, and affects the mucosa whilst preserving the submucosa.
Clinical trials have suggested that it is safe and effective for treating non-dysplastic IM, LGD and HGD in Barrett's oesophagus . Long term data show the effect to be durable over 5 years.</description>
