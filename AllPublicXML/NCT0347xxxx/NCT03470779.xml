  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact and feasibility of an interdisciplinary group
      treatment approach, involving psychotherapy and physiotherapy, with survivors of torture that
      are incarcerated in a prison in Kurdistan, Iraq. The primary aim is to develop initial
      estimates of treatment effects on symptoms and poor functioning consistent with centralized
      pain and post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and/or depression. The secondary aim is to
      assess the feasibility of studying this interdisciplinary treatment program in which local
      Kurdish psychotherapists and physiotherapists provide a 10-week intervention in a prison, in
      the Kurdish Sorani language, and to Kurdish participants that present with mental health
      symptoms, physical complaints, and poor functioning

      The aim of this randomized wait-list controlled pilot study is to assess the impact and
      feasibility of an interdisciplinary group treatment approach, involving psychotherapy and
      physiotherapy, with survivors of torture that are incarcerated in a prison in Kurdistan,
      Iraq. The primary aim is to develop initial estimates of treatment effects on symptoms and
      poor functioning consistent with centralized pain and post-traumatic stress disorder,
      anxiety, and/or depression. It is hypothesized that participants in the study will present
      with statistically significant improvements in some to all measures of symptoms and function.
      The secondary aim is to assess the feasibility of studying this interdisciplinary treatment
      program in which local Kurdish psychotherapists and physiotherapists provide a 10-week
      intervention in a prison, in the Kurdish Sorani language, and to Kurdish participants that
      present with mental health symptoms, physical complaints, and poor functioning
