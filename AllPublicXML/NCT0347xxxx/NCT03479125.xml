      A multi-center, post-treatment follow-up observational study for liver disease subjects with
      or without liver cirrhosis after receiving emricasan or placebo.

      This phase 2 observational study will enroll subjects from Study IDN-6556-07 (Post
      Orthotropic Liver Transplantation - NCT02138253), IDN-6556-12 (NASH Fibrosis - NCT02686762),
      IDN-6556-14 (NASH Cirrhosis and Severe Portal Hypertension - NCT02960204) or IDN-6556-17
      (Decompensated NASH Cirrhosis - NCT03205345) who have received at least one dose of emricasan

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects previously treated with at least 1 dose of emricasan or placebo from clinical
             studies IDN-6556-07 (post orthotopic liver transplant due to HCV), IDN-6556-12 (NASH
             fibrosis), IDN-6556-14 (NASH cirrhosis), or IDN-6556-17 (NASH cirrhosis).

          2. Subjects able to provide written informed consent and able to understand and willing
             to comply with the requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of controlled substances (including inhaled or injected drugs) or non-prescribed
             use of prescription drugs within 1 year of screening to the point of interfering with
             the subject's ability to comply, in the investigator's judgement, with study
             procedures.

          2. Treatment with an investigational drug following treatment with emricasan or placebo.

          3. Previous transplant unless subject was enrolled from IDN-6556-07 (post orthotopic
