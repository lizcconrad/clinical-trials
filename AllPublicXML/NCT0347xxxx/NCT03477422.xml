  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of CSE-1034 (Ceftriaxone+ Sulbactam+
      EDTA) compared to Meropenem for treating hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract
      infections, including acute pyelonephritis caused by β-lactamase producing gram-negative
      bacteria
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      cUTIs are mostly caused by gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae (particularly
      Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      and often possess mechanisms leading to multidrug resistance. These mechanisms primarily
      consist of ESBLs (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases) that can hydrolyse cephalosporins,
      penicillins and aztreonam, and are encoded on mobile genes. This has led to increased risk of
      failure with first-line antibiotics and increased the usage of last line drugs like
      carbapenems. However, over the past decade, with the emergence of carbapenem-resistant
      infections caused by gram-negative pathogens like CRE (carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae), CRAB (carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii) and CRPA
      (carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa), there is a major threat looming on the
      effectiveness of these last resort drugs, warranting the discovery of newer and alternate
      agents.

      To this end, the concept of using Antibiotic Resistance Breakers (ARBs) to revive the potency
      of existing antibiotics has been widely discussed in the recent literature. ARBs, sometimes
      referred as antibiotic adjuvants, are non-antibiotic moieties which do not have any
      antimicrobial activity on its own, but, in combination with antibiotics enhance their
      antimicrobial activity and help overcome resistance barriers. Most beta lactamase inhibitors
      (BLIs) can be thought of as ARBs that do not have any significant antimicrobial activity when
      used alone, but in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, help restore the activity
      against beta-lactamase producing organisms.

      CSE-1034 is a novel combination of Ceftriaxone (third generation beta-lactam cephalosporin),
      Sulbactam (beta-lactamase inhibitor) and Disodium EDTA (Class 1 Antibiotic Resistance
      Breaker), and it restores the in vitro activity of Ceftriaxone against ESBL/MBL producing
      gram-negative bacteria, including enzyme families that belong to Ambler class A (TEM, SHV,
      CTX-M), class B (NDM, VIM, IMP), class C (some variants of AmpC), and class D (OXA ESBLs); it
      is not active against serine carbapenemases (higher variants of KPC, OXA carbapenemases).
      CSE-1034 also has proven in vitro activity against multiple resistance mechanisms including
      efflux pumps, bacterial biofilms, membrane permeability, and transfer of resistance by means
      of conjugation.

      Since CSE-1034 has shown its efficacy in ESBL producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species in various in vitro and in vivo studies,
      therefore, to meet regulatory expectations, non-inferiority of CSE-1034 in comparison to
      Meropenem (drug of choice in ESBL producing pathogens) is under study in this phase-3
      clinical trial.

    <description>This was the second co-primary outcome measure for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Eradication was defined using the FDA's colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/mL) criteria that the bacterial pathogen(s) found at baseline was/were reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL of urine culture and a negative blood culture for an organism that was identified as an uropathogen (if repeated after positive at baseline blood culture).</description>

It was evaluated using the RAND methodology that measures the results based on eight different scales, namely - Physical functioning, Role limitations due to physical health, Role Limitations due to emotional problems, Energy/Fatigue, Emotional well-being, General Health, Health change, Pain and Social functioning. Broadly, the QoL scales are divided into two main sub-groups that provide a summary of the physical functioning and the mental functioning of the patient. Scores represent the percentage of the total possible score achieved, 100 being the highest score possible (denoting best outcome) and 0 being the lowest (denoting worst outcome)</description>
