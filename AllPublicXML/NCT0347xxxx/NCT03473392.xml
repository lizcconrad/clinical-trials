  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results found in the literature do not allow to define objectively the indications
      respective for a one-step or a two-step exchange of prosthetic joint. Some criteria could
      help to decide for one-step exchange or two-step exchange: bacteria is/are identified,
      profile of the bacteria, anesthetic difficulties,..

      A puncture could allow to identify the bacteria involved in the prosthetic joint infection
      (PJI) and an antibiotherapy for a few days can be given to the patient in order to decrease
      the inoculum. Then, a one-step exchange can be performed.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the management of patients who had a pre-treatment
      before a one-step exchange of their prosthetic joint.
