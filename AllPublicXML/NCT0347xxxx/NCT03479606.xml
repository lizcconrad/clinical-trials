  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of an emotion regulation intervention delivered online
      to individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) with deficits in emotion regulation. 104
      subjects will be enrolled and will receive 24, 60-minute emotion regulation skills-training
      sessions twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered online in a group video-conference with 3-4
      other participants. Participants will be asked to complete an online survey, lasting
      approximately 40-50 minutes, every four weeks during the intervention and 12-week follow-up
      phase. Attendance and compliance will be tracked, and outcomes will be monitored using online
      data collection methods.

    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of an emotion regulation skills-training intervention
      (Online EmReg) provided online to individuals with TBI with emotion regulation difficulties.
      Specifically, this study seeks to accomplish three aims: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of the
      Online EmReg intervention immediately post-intervention and at a 12-week follow-up
      assessment; 2) Identify factors that optimize the effectiveness of the Online EmReg
      intervention; 3) Explore the impact of Online EmReg on positive and negative affect, life
      satisfaction, and executive functioning. The study design is a randomized control trial with
      a waitlist control group whereby the participants in the control group undergo the training
      after a 12 week waiting period. 104 subjects with TBI and self-reported deficits in emotion
      regulation will be enrolled.

      The intervention protocol calls for 24, 60-minute emotion regulation sessions twice a week
      for 12 weeks, delivered online via GoToMeeting by post-doctoral level therapists with
      specialty training in rehabilitation neuropsychology. Study participation will last
      approximately 28 weeks for participants in the immediate intervention arm (4 weeks
      preparation, 12 weeks intervention, 12 weeks follow-up) and 40 weeks for participants in the
      waitlist arm (4 weeks preparation, 12 weeks waitlist, 12 weeks intervention, and 12 weeks
      follow-up). Core assessments will be conducted at each major time point: T1 (baseline), T2
      (immediate intervention end/waitlist baseline), T3 (immediate intervention follow-up/end of
      waitlist intervention), and T4 (waitlist follow-up). A subset of the measures will be
      administered every 4 weeks between each major time point for the duration of the study.

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Online Emotion Regulation Skills-training</intervention_name>
    <description>Emotion Regulation Training (EmReg) is a cognitive-behavioral approach which aims to increase awareness, and self-monitoring of affective states to improve self-regulation. The intervention is divided into two phases: knowledge provision and practice facilitation. During the knowledge provision phase participants are introduced to the objectives and the main concepts of the intervention, to increase their familiarity with the terminology, and to the emotion regulation skills they acquire during the practice facilitation phase. During the practice facilitation phase participants receive training in emotion regulation skills, which they practice in-session with the guidance of the therapist and feedback from the group, as well as out-of-session as homework assignments.</description>
