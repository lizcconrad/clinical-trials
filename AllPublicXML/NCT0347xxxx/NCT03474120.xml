  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      genetic screening and etiological analysis was conducted on patients with ovarian
      insufficiency and decline in ovarian reserve. All patients were enrolled in the IVF-treated
      and non-IVF-treated groups, followed up for long-term treatment outcomes and genomic
      screening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cause of ovarian insufficiency and decline in ovarian reserve are not clear, but most
      researchers think the probable causes are mainly three aspects: chromosomal abnormalities,
      genetic factors and autoimmune diseases，But the majority of patients with normal chromosome
      karyotype analysis. The screening of pathogenic genes in patients with normal karyotype is
      the focus of current premature ovarian insufficiency(POI) and decline in ovarian reserve(DOR)
      etiology, to further explain the pathogenesis of patients, improve the diagnosis of those
      diseases and Clinical treatment.
