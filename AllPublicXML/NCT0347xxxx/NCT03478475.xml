  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age affect insulin sensitivity and the metabolism, and vitamin D status was shown to have a
      correlation with markers of insulin resistance. That's why, we aimed in our trial to study
      the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic markers and index of insulin resistance.

    <textblock>
      A low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [(25(OH) D)] concentration was shown to correlate with higher
      fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin levels. Since age affect insulin sensitivity and the
      metabolism, we aimed in this randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of vitamin
      D supplementation on glucose homeostasis and index of insulin resistance in elderly subjects
      living in Beirut, Lebanon.

      Participants (n= 115) deficient in vitamin D were randomly divided into two groups, a group
      receiving 30,000 IU cholecalciferol/week for a period of 6 months, and a placebo group. The
      index of insulin resistance HOMA (homeostasis model assessment) was the primary outcome.
      Glucose homeostasis and metabolic markers were also measured at start of treatment and at 6
      months.

    <intervention_model_description>This was a randomized, controlled, double blind study. Participants were randomized into 2 groups; the vitamin D group received three times per week a supplement of 10,000 IU cholecalciferol (Euro-Pharm International, Canada) and the placebo group who also received three times per week a tablet containing microcrystalline cellulose (66.3%), starch (33.2%), and magnesium stearate (0.5%), per serving. The treatment was led for a period of 6 months.</intervention_model_description>
