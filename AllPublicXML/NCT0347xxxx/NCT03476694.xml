  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus block as done by landmark technique use large volume of local anaesthetics
      (at least 30-40 ml), leading to higher incidence of phrenic nerve involvement and
      diaphragmatic dysfunction. With use of ultrasound dose of local anaesthetic can be reduced.
      Volume as low as 20 ml when use by ultrasound guidance has shown to provide successful block
      with no hemidiaphragmatic palsy when compared with nerve stimulation technique. But no study
      has compared the different volumes of drug on success rate and diaphragmatic motility.So in
      this study , the investigators want to compare the incidence of hemidiaphragm paralysis and
      success of block with different volumes of local anaesthetic , so that the lowest effective
      dose with higher safety profile can be determined.
