  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and dysphagia will be included into this
      randomised controlled double-blinded parallel group clinical trial. The treatment consists of
      two different stimulation settings using (i) conventional stimulation of the subthalamic
      nucleus [standard STN] as active comparator and (ii) combined stimulation of active electrode
      contacts located in both the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata
      [STN+SNr]. Both groups receive additional swallowing therapy as standard of care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of combined
      [STN+SNr] stimulation by &quot;interleaving stimulation&quot; as compared to [standardSTN] after 8
      weeks on dysphagia. The Trial is designed as superiority study with an 81% power to detect a
      clinically relevant mean improvement of 2 points on the Penetration Aspiration Scale for
      fluids (two-tailed p &lt; 0.05). To this end 20 patients will be randomized. After a common
      baseline assessment in [standardSTN], patients will be randomized to either [standardSTN] or
      [STN+SNr] in 1:1 ratio (10 per arm). The primary endpoint assessment is scheduled 8 weeks
      from baseline assessment (V2). Both treatment arms will receive swallowing therapy as
      standard of care.

      The rationale for this study comes from the association of swallowing and oral transport to
      neuronal integration upon the substantial nigra pars reticulate (SNr)-superior colliculus
      (SC) pathway (Rossi et al., 2016). Deep brain stimulation of the SNr has been put forward to
      modulate brainstem circuitry through its monosynaptic brainstem projections to the SC and to
      the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) (Chastan et al., 2009, Weiss et al., 2013, Rossi et al.,
      2016).

      Secondary outcome measures include anamnestic assessments on dysphagia, clinical global
      impression, freezing of gait and falls, balance, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms
      and suicidality. Secondary outcome measures also include clinical assessment of dysphagia
      (Site of Swallow Reflex Initiation, Test of Mastication and Swallowing solids, pharyngeal
      residue) as well as motor symptoms with MDS-UPDRS III, Capsit-PD and Freezing of Gait
      Assessment Course.

    <description>Patients were asked to sit down on a chair, then stand up and walk to a floor mark .Within the mark they performed two 360° turns, clockwise (cw) and counter-clockwise (ccw). Then: open and walk through the door, turn outside, and come back to their chair.
Four situations were rated: The start to walk, the turning (cw and ccw), and the passing through the door. 0 points: no festination and no FOG , 1 point: festination or any hastening steps. 2 points: FOG (trembling-in-place or total akinesia), which the patient could overcome himself. 3points: abortion of the task or need of interference by the examiner. Three levels of multiple tasking were applied: First passage;: no additional task (&quot;walking&quot;). Second passage: carrying a tray with a plastic cup full of water. Third passage: motor task and a mental task (&quot;carrying and calculation&quot;). (Ziegler et al. 2010)</description>
