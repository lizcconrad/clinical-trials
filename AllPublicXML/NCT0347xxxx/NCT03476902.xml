  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
      usefulness of using a mobile application (nOCD) for treatment of obsessive compulsive
      disorder (OCD) in a sample of 25 adults (ages 18-65) in an 8 week trial. nOCD is a free
      iOS/Android application that provides treatment strategies. The study team will evaluate the
      effect of the application using gold-standard clinician-administered and self-report
      measures. Prior to downloading the application, participants will receive 4 (up to 5)
      in-person visit (orientation to the app and psychoeducation) and receive brief weekly phone
      check-ins. The long-term goal of this study is to use this information to develop new
      treatments for patients with OCD. All study procedures will be conducted on site at the New
      York State Psychiatric Institute.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
      usefulness of using a mobile app (nOCD) for treatment of OCD in a sample of 25 adults (ages
      18-65). nOCD is a free iOS/Android app that provides EX/RP-consistent treatment strategies.
      The study team will evaluate the effect of the app using gold-standard clinician-administered
      and self-report measures. Prior to downloading the app, participants will receive 4 (up to 5)
      in-person visits and receive brief weekly phone check-in. The long term goal of this line of
      research is to increase access to evidence-based treatment and to ultimately reach more
      patients giving them access to tools to reduce their OCD symptoms and improve their quality
      of life.
