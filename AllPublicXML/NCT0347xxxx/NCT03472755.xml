    <textblock>
      Recent increased interest in tissue-sparing and minimally invasive arthroplasty has given
      rise to a sharp increase in the utilization of direct anterior total hip arthroplasty.

      -  Purpose: The direct anterior approach to the hip has been suggested to have several
           advantages compared to previously classical approaches. However, no studies focused on
           the effects of these different surgeries on patients' perception recovery and walking
           efficiency according the initial physical fitness. Therefore, the purpose of this study
           is to compare the effects of surgical procedures on perceptual walking skills and
           efficiency according to the patients' physical fitness.

        -  Abstract : Some earlier studies report differences between surgery types in self-
           reported mobility, functional recovery and residual hip pain [22, 23]. The direct
           anterior approach to the hip has been suggested to have several advantages compared to
           previously popular approaches through its use of an intra-muscular and intra-nervous
           interval between the tensor fasciae latae and sartorius muscles [16, 17]. However,
           patients' physical fitness, postural response and perceptual walking skill relation was
           not taking account. 80 patients will be tested, one before and at various times after
           hip surgery. In randomized conditions, our patients will be divided in two groups,
           according the surgery approaches and their physical fitness. All patients performed a
           Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment Walking test with and without step and the PMA,
           Harris, Oxford 12 and Womac (87, 88, 89, 90) scores will be evaluated before, 3 weeks, 6
           weeks, 3 months and 1 year after the surgery. During the Performance-Oriented Mobility
           Assessment Walking test, self-reported walking capacity, rating of exertion perception
           and walking parameters will be measured.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients provided written informed consent to participate in this study, as approved by the local ethics committee. Prior to surgery, patients were informed about the benefits and risk of the conventional posterolateral and direct anterior approaches. Then they performed postural test and a Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment Walking test with and without step. After randomization, patients were operated according the conventional posterolateral or direct anterior techniques.</intervention_model_description>

In the direct anterior technique, patients were fixed in a supine position, a small entry incision was made in the vessel free interval between the tensor fasciae latae and the sartorius muscles and the prosthesis socket were put in place. Via a second dorsal incision, after releasing the external rotators, the prosthesis stem and ball were implanted and the two parts of the prosthesis were attached.</description>
