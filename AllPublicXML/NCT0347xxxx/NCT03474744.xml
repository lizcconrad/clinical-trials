  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) Rituximab in combination with conventional chemotherapy is
      widely used for those patients who fail local therapy or do not qualify for such. Depending
      on the MZL subtype Rituximab/chemotherapy is able to induce in part long remissions, but do
      not prevent relapse later on. In addition, chemotherapy associated toxicity is often
      problematic in MZL patients, who are mostly of advanced age. Thus, chemotherapy - free
      approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Rituximab single agent is a widely
      used chemotherapy - free approach in MZL, but was significantly inferior compared to
      Rituximab/chlorambucil in a large randomized prospective clinical trial in treatment naïve
      MZL with a CR rate of 56 % vs. 80%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Thus, it is the major aim to
      develop chemotherapy - free approaches for MZL, which approach efficacy of
      Rituximab/chemotherapy combinations, but avoid chemotherapy associated toxicities. This in
      particular important in MZL as many physicians are reluctant to treat these often elderly
      patients with more intense treatments and prefer single agent therapies in these very often
      well and long responding lymphoma subtype. The PI3K inhibitor Copanlisib has shown high
      clinical activity in indolent B - cell lymphomas among them MZL. Based on these observations
      it is the aim of this study to test the toxicity and efficacy of Copanlisib in combination
      with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed MZL in
      need of treatment, who are not eligible or failed local therapy, following the assumption
      that this novel chemotherapy - free combination is significantly more effective than
      Rituximab single agent therapy and at least as efficient as Rituximab/chemotherapy, but
      avoids chemotherapy - related toxicity.

      The objective of the trial is to test the efficacy and toxicity of the treatment of
      Copanlisib/Rituximab in patients with MZL in need of treatment, who have failed or are not
      eligible for local therapy or relapsed after local or systemic therapy. For efficacy the rate
      of complete remissions (according to the GELA criteria for gastric MALT or to the Cheson 2007
      criteria for non-gastric extranodal, nodal and splenic MZL) after induction therapy will be
      primarily analysed. For toxicity treatment associated adverse events, quality of life and
      cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies will be documented.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation
        in this study:

          -  Confirmed CD20 positive MALT Lymphoma de novo or relapsed following or being not
             eligible for local therapy (including surgery, radiotherapy) and antibiotics for H.
             pylori-positive gastric lymphoma arisen at any extranodal site OR

          -  Confirmed CD20 positive de novo or relapsed splenic MZL following or not being
             eligible for local therapy (including surgery and antiviral therapy for Hepatitis C
             Virus) with symptomatic disease OR

          -  Confirmed CD20 positive de novo or relapsed nodal MZL Tissue diagnostic procedures
             must be performed within 12 months prior to study entry and have to include
             diagnostics by a reference pathology center. Biopsy material from an excisional or
             core biopsy must be submitted for retrospective central confirmation. Tissue samples
             dated &gt; 12 months prior to informed consent can be accepted only if tissue material is
             available for retrospective confirmation, if there is no clinical indication for
             transformation of disease, and if the request for additional biopsy would be unethical
             treatment of the patient.

        In patients with splenic MZL without splenic tissue available for histologic review, the
        diagnosis may be confirmed by the presence of splenomegaly and typical morphologic and
        immunophenotypic findings in the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow must be submitted for
        retrospective central confirmation.

          -  Patients in need of treatment:

        For patients with symptomatic splenic, nodal, or non-gastric extranodal MZL disease that is
        de novo or has relapsed following local therapy (i.e., surgery or radiotherapy) and
        requires therapy, as assessed by the investigator.

        For patients with symptomatic gastric extranodal MZL: Helicobacter pylori-negative disease
        that is de novo or has relapsed following local therapy (i.e., surgery or radiotherapy) and
        requires therapy, as assessed by the investigator, or H. pylori-positive disease that has
        remained stable, progressed, or relapsed following antibiotic therapy and requires therapy,
        as assessed by the investigator

          -  At least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (≥ 1.5 cm in its largest dimension by
             CT scan or MRI).

        In patients with splenic MZL, an enlarged spleen on CT scan or extending at least 2 cm
        below the costal margin by physical examination will constitute measurable disease
        providing that no explanation other than lymphomatous involvement is likely. For an
        enlarged liver to constitute the only measurable disease parameter, a liver biopsy showing
        proof of NHL in the liver is required.

        Others:

          -  Age greater than 18 years

          -  Life expectancy greater 3 months. Baseline platelet count 50, 109 pro L if not due to
             BM infiltration by the lymphoma, absolute neutrophil count 0.75, 109 pro L.

          -  Meet the following pretreatment laboratory criteria at the Screening visit conducted
             within 28 days of study enrollment (unless due to underlying lymphoma):

               -  ASAT (SGOT): 3 times the upper limit of institutional laboratory normal value

               -  ALAT (SGPT): 3 times the upper limit of institutional laboratory normal value

               -  Total Bilirubin: 2 mg/dL or 2 times the upper limit of institutional laboratory
                  normal value, unless clearly related to the disease (except if due to Gilbert's
                  syndrome)

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2mg/dl

          -  Negative HIV antibody

          -  Positive test results for chronic HBV infection (defined as positive HBsAg serology):
             patients with occult or prior HBV infection (defined as negative HBsAg and positive
             total HBcAb) may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable, provided that they are
             willing to undergo monthly DNA testing. Patients who have protective titers of HBSAb
             after vaccination or prior but cured hepatitis B are eligible.

          -  Positive test results for hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody serology
             testing): patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if PCR is negative for

             beta-HCG must be negative during screening and at study enrolment visit

          -  Premenopausal fertile females must agree to use a highly effective method of birth
             control for the duration of the therapy up to 12 months after end of therapy. A highly
             effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low failure
             rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner.

          -  Men must agree not to father a child for the duration of therapy and 6 months after
             and must agree to advice a female partner to use a highly effective method of birth
             control.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
             imaging studies, laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is aware
             of the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed of the procedures to be
             followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits,
             possible side effects, potential risks and discomforts, and other pertinent aspects of
             study participation.
