  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pain following lumbar spine fusion is frequently difficult to manage and can
      lead to increased doses of opiate pain medications to control pain. In this study, the use of
      subcutaneous local anesthesia will be studied to determine its efficacy at reducing
      post-operative pain following spinal fusion surgery.

      For patients randomized to the experimental or to the placebo groups, two subcutaneous
      catheters will be tunneled under the skin with large hollow-bore needles along the entire
      length of the incision on either side prior to closure. These catheters will deliver study
      drug (0.25% Marcaine) directly into the incision. They will be affixed to the skin with
      steri-strips. The catheters will then be attached to a drug delivery pump at 2mL/hour and
      will be removed prior to discharge.

    <intervention_model_description>This trial is a comparative trial investigating outcomes in 3 parallel groups. The control group will receive standard of care pain control following surgery, the Marcaine group will receive infusion of FDA approved Marcaine around the operative site following surgery through an FDA approved surgical device. The Placebo group will have the drug delivery device implanted with delivery of saline.</intervention_model_description>
