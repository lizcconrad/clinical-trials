  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative paediatric cerebellar mutism syndrome (pCMS) is a well-recognised complication
      of resective surgery for brain tumours of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle in children.
      Occurring in around 25% of infratentorial craniotomies, it is characterised by a delayed
      onset of mutism and emotional lability, and may comprise motoric and cognitive cerebellar
      deficits. Transient mutism gives way to prolonged, and often incomplete, recovery.
      Neuroimaging studies are beginning to reveal anatomical and functional aberrancies in the
      brain of children with pCMS. The cerebellar efferent pathways are likely to be implicated as
      a neuroanatomical substrate in the development of pCMS, as shown by a handful of diffusion
      tractography studies to date. However, the pathophysiology of this condition still remains
      unclear. Hypoperfusion of supratentorial cortical and subcortical structures may mediate the
      speech and behavioural deficits seen in pCMS, and is a candidate for a causal
      pathophysiological mechanism.

      This study aims to prospectively image children with pCMS using advanced MRI techniques
      including diffusion tractography and arterial spin labelling, and to correlate this with
      clinical descriptions of the syndrome.

      All children referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children with a posterior fossa
      brain tumour will be imaged pre-operatively, post-operatively and at delayed follow-up. In
      tandem with this, clinical assessments will be made of children post-operatively to ascertain
      which patients develop pCMS. In addition, anonymised advanced MRI data on healthy controls
      will be used as a comparator group.
