      Background:

      Prevalence of de Quervain's Tenosynovitis (dQt) is estimated at 0.5% among men and 1.3% among
      women. As there is an increasing length of time in smart phone usage, the prevalence is
      believed to be higher in the future. However, the public has a common avoidance of
      corticosteroid usage.

      Although the surgical treatment of the disease is reported to be effective in providing long
      term relief, its complications include radial sensory nerve injury, incomplete decompression,
      and volar subluxation of the tendons. The above factors raised the need of alternative
      treatments.

      Sinew Acupuncture is a new acupuncture technique developed based on the Jing-jin theory from
      &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; the tradition Chinese Medicine classic literature. Previous observational
      studies indicated that sinew acupuncture had the immediate analgesic effect on soft tissue
      injuries at various locations. It is a subcutaneous and transverse needling which minimizes
      the pain, sore, swelling sensations of acupuncture. A controlled study includes longer
      follow-up is needed for providing evidence for this alternative treatment , which is safe and
      with the least undesired sensation.

      Aims:

        1. To determine whether sinew acupuncture can reduce pain (measured by Visual Analogue
           Scale VAS) of dQt patients.

        2. To determine whether sinew acupuncture can reduce disability (measured by pinch
           strength, grip strength and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Q-DASH
           questionnaire ) of dQt patients.

        3. To determine whether sinew acupuncture can improve life quality (measured WHOQOL-BREF
           Quality of Life Questionnaire) of dQt patients

      Design:

      A randomised subject trial will be employed. A total of 68 cases will be recruited in the
      study and allocated into study and wait-list control group under ratio 1:1. Treatment group
      participants will receive 5 treatments in 2 weeks and follow-up sessions after 6 and 12
      weeks. Wait-list control group participants will receive same treatment and assessment after
      waiting and follow-up period. Both groups will receive health education session on dQt. The
      subjects are prohibited from receiving corticosteroid injection for treating de Quervain's
      Tenosynovitis. The subjects are recommended not to receive any other treatments for dQt
      during the trial period; Rescue medication for pain is allowed if patients have intolerant
      pain. Any treatments or medications for dQt received should be reported and recorded.

      Setting:

      The Hong Kong Tuberculosis Association - The University of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre
      for Training and Research (Aberdeen)

      Participants: 68 subjects with dQt

      Treatment:

      According to the theory of Sinew Acupuncture, acupoints are chosen based on 3 criteria, 1.
      the tender spots, 2.the spots which induce relief of symptoms and 3.the &quot;knots&quot; (elevated
      spots of the soft tissues, can be located by Chinese Medicine Practitioner (CMP) with Sinew
      Acupuncture training), these spots should locate along the &quot;Jing-Jin&quot; where the diseased spot
      lies, in this case the &quot;Jing-Jin&quot; of the Lung meridian and the Large Intestine meridian.
      Acupoints chosen for Sinew Acupuncture should lie within the forearm area. Subcutaneous
      acupuncture with the needle tips pointing towards the radial styloid activates the &quot;Wei-Qi&quot;
      to achieve analgesic effect and to promote healing.

      Measures:

      Primary outcome: change of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score in the 5th treatment (week 2)
      from baseline.

      secondary outcome: Q-DASH (Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand), WHOQOL-BREF
      Quality of Life Questionnaire, pinch strength, grip strength and averse events.

      Data analysis:

      The scores of VAS and Q-DASH at different time points are reported as means ± standard
      deviation. The scores are analysed by the intent-to-treat analysis. The last observation
      carried forward analyses will be employed for missing value. The difference between two
      groups at a time point or the difference between the two time-points in a group is tested by
      the student t-test. The level of the statistical significance is set P&lt;0.05. Subgroup
      analysis and multiple regression analysis will be conducted to eliminate the possible bias
      due to the length of waiting time, the use NSAIDs, or other factor.
