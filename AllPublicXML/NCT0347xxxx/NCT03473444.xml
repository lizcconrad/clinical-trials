  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of hyperuricemia has rarely been investigated in developing countries
      Hyperuricemia, or raised serum uric acid (SUA), is the condition closely associated with gout
      due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in peripheral joints and soft tissues.
      Hyperuricemia is associated with an increased risk for incident hypertension, independent of
      traditional hypertension risk factors. This risk appears more pronounced in younger
      individuals and women. Cross-sectional studies show an association of hyperuricemia with the
      presence of CKD. Insulin resistance plays a potentially key role in the causal relationship
      between metabolic syndrome, type 2 Diabetes and hyperuricemia. Furthermore, it is likely that
      hyperuricemia and insulin resistance share a bidirectional causal effect. The rationale of
      this study is to determine prevalence of hyperuricemia in Pakistan.

      Informed consent will be obtained from all patients and their attendant coming to clinics.
      Those who will agree to be part of this study were asked a questionnaire about co-morbidity
      and symptoms.

      Uric acid levels will be assessed by using UASure Blood Uric Acid Monitoring System. Male
      with uric acid levels greater than 7 mg/dl and female greater than 6 mg/dl were classified as
      hyperuricemia.
