  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators expect to develop an algorithm that can interpret OCT images and automated
      determine whether the macula is normal or not by using OCT image-based deep learning
      techniques. And investigators wish to develop software applications that will help better
      screen and diagnose macular diseases in resource-limited areas.

      The investigators will apply deep learning convolutional neural network by using ImageNet for
      an automated detection of multiple retinal diseases with OCT horizontal B-scans with a
      high-quality labeled database. Datasets, including training dataset, testing dataset and
      validation datasets, will be built by ophthalmologists of the First affiliated hospital of
      Nanjing Medical University according to the standardized annotation guidelines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients attending the Ophthalmology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital
             of Nanjing Medical University within 5 years and who received known, clear diagnoses
             with digital retinal imaging (including OCT, fundus digital photographs and fundus
             fluorescein angiography, at least with OCT images) as part of their routine clinical
             care, will be eligible for inclusion in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hardcopy examinations (i.e., photos of paper reports of OCT imaging performed at other
             hospitals) will be ineligible.

          -  Data from patients who have previously manually requested that their data should not
             be shared, even for research purposes in anonymised form, and have informed the
             Ophthalmology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical
             University of this desire (even in previously conducted studies or other on-going
             studies in this hospital), will be excluded, and their data will not be upload to the
             cloud platform before research begins.

          -  Data from eyes tamponed with silicone oil or gas (i.e., C3F8) will be ineligible.

          -  Data with poor image quality, such as incomplete images, inverted images, blurred or
             cracked images and images with a very weak signal (i.e., vitreous haemorrhage), will
             be ineligible.
