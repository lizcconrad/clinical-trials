  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, observational multi-center cohort study. The study will consist
      of patients undergoing heart transplantation. The main purpose is to test a new biomarker for
      rejection against the gold-standard, the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). 80 patients will be
      included, both children and adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is a comparison of an the established, invasive diagnostic test, the
      endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) against a new, non-invasive test. The new test is the measurement
      of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) circulating in the blood stream of the recipient,
      quantified by droplet digital PCR (polymerase-chain reaction) after targeted multiplex
      preamplification. Sensitivity is calculated with EMB as the gold standard. The patients will
      be followed during one year post-transplantation with simultaneous blood samples and EMB. The
      patients will further be followed clinically for 5 years. A suitable cut-off for the ratio of
      dd-cfDNA will be calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

      Secondary objectives are description of patient outcomes with respect to organ function,
      quality of life and adverse events.

      Secondary objectives are the calculation of the costs related to the transplantation process
      as well as to the follow-up with EMB. A simulation will be done with respect to possible
      savings achieved if the new biomarker could be implemented.

      The study consists of two cohorts: all adult recipients of heart transplantation at
      Sahlgrenska University Hospital (one of two center conducting heart transplantation in
      Sweden): regional study. The other cohort consists of all children undergoing heart
      transplantation in Sweden:national study. Patients will undergo transplantation at
      Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg as well as at Skåne University Hospital in
      Lund. Follow-up with blood samples and EMB of these patients will be in Gothenburg, Lund and
      at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm.
