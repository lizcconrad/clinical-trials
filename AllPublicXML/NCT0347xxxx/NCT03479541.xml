  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year 1.7 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the United States and
      of these, 84 % are considered mild TBI (mTBI). mTBI is common both in civilian and military
      populations and can be debilitating if symptoms do not resolve after injury. Balance problems
      are one of the most common complaints after sustaining a mTBI and often prevent individuals
      from returning to their previous quality of life. However, the investigators currently lack
      clear guidelines on when to initiate physical therapy rehabilitation and it is unclear if
      early physical therapy is beneficial. The investigators believe that the underlying problem
      of imbalance results from damage to parts of the brain responsible for interpreting sensory
      information for balance control. The investigators hypothesize that retraining the brain
      early, as opposed to months after injury, to correctly interpret sensory information will
      improve recovery. The investigators also believe this retraining is limited when
      rehabilitation exercises are performed incorrectly, and that performance feedback from
      wearable sensors, can improve balance rehabilitation. There are three objectives of this
      study: 1) to determine how the timing of rehabilitation affects outcomes after mTBI; 2) to
      determine if home monitoring of balance exercises using wearable sensors improves outcomes;
      and 3) to develop a novel feedback system using wearable sensors to provide the physical
      therapist information, in real-time during training, about quality of head and trunk
      movements during prescribed exercises. The findings from this research could be very readily
      adopted into military protocols for post-mTBI care and have the potential to produce better
      balance rehabilitation and quality of life for mTBI patients and their families.

      Although balance is one of the most common and debilitating complaints after mTBI, the
      investigators currently lack clear guidelines on when to initiate balance rehabilitation and
      it is unclear if early physical therapy is beneficial. There is a clear gap in clinical care
      guidelines after mTBI and it is unclear if initiating rehabilitation early would improve
      outcomes related to imbalance. Measures of imbalance are subjective and are easily overlooked
      as a treatable deficit. Even with rehabilitation, recovery of balance in people with mTBI is
      challenging, particularly in people with central vestibular and sensory integration deficits.

      Although vestibular and balance rehabilitation after mTBI relies heavily on a home exercise
      program and repetition is essential for recovery; The slow progress in balance rehabilitation
      may be partially due to an inability of people with mTBI to correctly perform the prescribed
      rehabilitation exercises on their own. Biofeedback is a clinical technique that provides
      physiologic information that would otherwise be unknown to patients and may improve outcomes
      after mTBI. There are no commercially available systems to provide the physical therapist
      and/or patient objective information on the quality of head movements during training of
      rehabilitation tasks that involve balance and walking.

      Therefore, the three objectives of this study are: 1) to determine how the timing of
      rehabilitation affects outcomes after mTBI; 2) to determine if home monitoring of balance
      exercises using wearable sensors improves outcomes; and 3) to develop a novel feedback system
      using wearable sensors to provide the physical therapist information, in real-time during
      training, about quality of head and trunk movements during prescribed exercises.

      160 individuals with acute mTBI within 12 weeks of the injury will be randomly assigned to
      receive early onset of physical therapy (n=80) right away or be randomly assigned to receive
      delayed rehabilitation by 3 months in the standard of care physical therapy group (n=80). A
      subgroup of participants in the early physical therapy (n=40) and standard of care physical
      therapy (n=40) will be randomly assigned to home monitoring. The participants will wear
      wireless sensors while completing the rehabilitation program in order to better inform the
      physiotherapist of their progress.

      The outcome measures will consist of a battery of self-reported questionnaires, balance and
      gait measures, as well as vestibular measures and will be tested at Pre I (baseline), Pre 2
      (3 months later for the delayed rehabilitation group), Post (after the intervention), and
      Retention (3 month follow-up).

      The central hypothesis is that rehabilitation after mTBI is suboptimal due to late initiation
      of and inadequate performance of exercises that do not adequately challenge vestibular and
      sensory integration function. The long-term goal is to clarify best practices for the
      rehabilitation of balance deficits in people with mTBI by comparing early vs late (standard
      of care) initiation of physical therapy with and without wearable sensors on balance deficits
      after mTBI. The findings from this research could be very readily adopted into military
      protocols for post-mTBI care and have the potential to produce better balance rehabilitation
      and quality of life for mTBI patients and their families.

    <description>Participants will see a physiotherapist one-on-one twice per week for 2 weeks and once per week for 4 weeks for a total of 6 weeks. These sessions will consist of cardio, cervical flexion exercises and vestibule-ocular exercises for one hour. Participants will also have similar daily home exercises to complete for approximately 30 minutes. Both the one-on-one physiotherapy and home exercises will be individualized and progressive in the sense that each exercise can increase in the level of difficulty at the discretion of the physiotherapist depending on the performance of the participant.
For the group allocated to home monitoring, they will perform the vestibular exercises while wearing one wireless sensor on the head and one on the sternum. When the participant brings the sensors in to the physiotherapy session each week, the physiotherapist will examine the home data and likely make a more informed decision as to whether or not to increase the level of difficulty of the task.</description>
