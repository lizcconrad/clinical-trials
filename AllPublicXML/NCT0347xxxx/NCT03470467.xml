      Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome prospective (PRES) registry. Data collection
      using a standardized form : demographic data and data related to the PRES, including
      circumstances of onset, dates and times of onset and of symptoms control, on-scene clinical
      findings, clinical and radiological features of PRES, pre-hospital and hospital care
      providers, timing of antiepileptic, antihypertensive drugs and supportive treatments, results
      of etiological investigations, cause of PRES, type and dosage of antiepileptic and
      antihypertensive drugs. Dates and times of EEG monitoring, EEG results, radiological and
      biological investigations. Outcomes including vital status and Glasgow Outcome Scale score at
      ICU and hospital discharge, day-90 and 1-year after SE and determined based on data in the
      ICU and/or neurologist charts and/or patients phone interview
