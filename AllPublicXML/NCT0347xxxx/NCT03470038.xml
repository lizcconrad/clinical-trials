  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate responses of NGF and the maintenance of
      mechanical muscle hypersensitivity over time following an acute exercised-induced ischemic
      condition in an NGF-sensitized muscle.

      The hypothesis is that an ischemic conditioning in a NGF-sensitized muscle is able to
      potentiate NGF responses, induce pain, and prolong muscle hypersensitivity in comparison with
      a NGF-sensitized muscle alone.
