      The purpose of this study is to determine that effects of an intervention called

      1 Primary Hypertension (systolic BP 130-139, and/or diastolic BP 80-89).

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects of a technique called
      High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM®), for
      hypertension. HIRREM uses scalp sensors to monitor brain electrical activity, and computer
      software algorithms translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones in real time.
      Those tones are reflected back to participants via ear buds in as little as four to eight
      milliseconds, providing the brain an opportunity for self-adjustment of its electrical
      pattern.

      This study will compare acoustic stimulation linked to brainwave activity (HIRREM, along with
      continued current care, HCC), with continued current clinical care alone (CCC). Both groups
      will continue their other current care throughout, including non-pharmacological, and
      lifestyle modification therapies.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-14 days post final session, 4-6 weeks post final session, 12-14 weeks post final session</time_frame>
    <description>BP will be obtained in the left arm, with the participant sitting comfortably, and the left arm resting on a desk/table. Three samples will be obtained and the last two averaged to get the value that will be used as the reading.</description>

    <measure>Change in Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-14 days post final session, 4-6 weeks post final session, 12-14 weeks post final session</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure and heart rate are acquired from 10 minute recordings of noninvasive finger arterial pressure measurements and ECG with participants lying quietly, supine. Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR intervals files generated via the data acquisition system (BIOPAC acquisition system and Acknowledge 4.2 software, Santa Barbara, CA), at 1000 Hz, are analyzed using Nevrokard BRS software (Nevrokard BRS, Medistar, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Analysis is conducted on the first complete 5-minute epoch that is considered to be acceptable for analysis. Heart rate variability is measured in the time domain as standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval (SDNN, milliseconds). For calculation of SDNN, the R-R intervals are visually inspected, and data considered as artifact is manually removed.</description>

Rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), it evaluates their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. Lower scores denote a lower level of daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Change in Drop Stick Reaction Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-14 days post final session, 4-6 weeks post final session, 12-14 weeks post final session</time_frame>
    <description>Reaction testing will be evaluated by a drop-stick, clinical reaction time apparatus. The apparatus is placed between the thumb and index finger of the subject and released at a random time during a countdown. The subject catches the apparatus and the distance fallen (cm) is converted to reaction. Following two practice trials, participants perform eight trials, and a mean distance value is calculated. This is repeated with a second set of 8 trials later during the enrollment visit, and the mean distance value from the second trial will be used as the baseline value. Use of the average distance from the second set of trials will be used as the baseline value so as to avoid the impact of learning effect for this test. Only one set of trials will be used for comparison at follow up data collections. A lower average indicates a faster reaction time.</description>

    <measure>Change in Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-14 days post final session, 4-6 weeks post final session, 12-14 weeks post final session</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength will be evaluated using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer). Participants will squeeze the dynamometer three times in each hand. The scores from each hand will be averaged separately. A higher score indicates stronger grip strength.</description>

Each question has five possible answers ranging from of 0-4 with a total scoring scale of 0-12. A total score of three or more in women and a score of four or more in men is suggestive of hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders.</description>
