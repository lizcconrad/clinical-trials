  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, prospective, multi-center, interventional study to evaluate the benefit and
      efficacy of individualized self-efficacy coaching for women with high-risk early breast
      cancer.

      In total, 6 sites will be assigned 1:1 to either the experimental arm (Group A) or the
      control arm (Group B). The controlled site assignment will assure a balanced site-specific
      QoL between both groups at baseline. All patients will be medically treated according to
      guidelines. The experimental Group A will in addition receive regular self-efficacy coaching.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer represents the leading cause of cancer in women in Switzerland with around
      6,000 newly diagnosed cases per year. Beside the therapy- and cancer-associated somatic
      illness, about one third of patients develop anxiety disorders or depression and need
      psychotherapeutic or psychiatric care. Women with breast cancer display the highest psychic
      comorbidity compared to patients with other cancer entities (40% point prevalence) .

      To assist with psychological coping with the disease several psycho-oncological interventions
      have been established in the past decades.

      Self-efficacy describes the extent or strength of one's belief in one's own ability to
      complete tasks and reach goals. Nagel &amp; Schreiber have developed an individualized
      self-efficacy coaching for cancer patients to mobilize and strengthen the belief in one's own
      ability to deal with and fight the disease. The SECOM-PSWE study evaluates the impact of
      regular self-efficacy coaching on the perceived self-efficacy and the quality of life (QoL)
      in patients with early breast cancer.

    <time_frame>The questionnaire SWE is collected at the timepoint of relapse or after 7.5 months, whichever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall perceived self-efficacy is measured by a specifically developed questionnaire (questionnaire SWE). Analysis will be descriptive, separate for each group and performed according to the analysis manual. A difference between the groups is defined as 10% difference in median between the groups. The scale ranges from 10 to 40 points. The higher the score, the higher is perceived self-efficacy of the patient.</description>
