  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the early detection of sepsis and the decision,
      by the Investigator to start or not, or to change, antibiotics in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
      patients at high risk of sepsis, based on standard of care (clinical, laboratory and imaging
      data but not on PSP values), as well as timing of antibiotic de-escalation versus the the
      retrospective assessment (i.e., at the end of the study) of a First Endpoint Adjudication
      Committee (EAC) which is aware of the clinical data and of the PSP values but not of the
      Investigator's decision(s), and of the retrospective assessment of a Second Endpoint
      Adjudication Committee which is only aware of the PSP values.

      This study will follow the site's routine clinical practice for the diagnostic, assessment
      and treatment of the enrolled patients, with the exception of daily blood samples which will
      be taken for the PSP measurement using the AbioScope as well as another daily sample taken
      for central analysis of biomarkers of inflammation, infection and/or sepsis (including but
      not limited to C-reactive protein [CRP] and Procalcitonin [PCT]).
