  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 2 CSEG101B2201 study is to confirm and to establish appropriate
      dosing and to evaluate the safety in pediatric patients ages 6 months to &lt;18 years with a
      history of VOC with or without HU/HC, receiving crizanlizumab for 2 years. The efficacy and
      safety of crizanlizumab was already demonstrated in adults with sickle cell disease. The
      approach is to extrapolate from the PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) already established in the adult
      population. The study is designed as a Phase II, multicenter, open-label study.

             pneumococcal immunization, and parental education

          -  Transcranial Doppler (TCD) considered low risk within the past 6 months (for 2 to 16
             years).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of stem cell transplant.

          -  Received any blood products within 30 days of Day 1 dosing.

          -  Participating and maintaining in a chronic transfusion program (preplanned series of
             transfusions for prophylactic purposes).

          -  Patients with bleeding disorders

          -  Planning on undergoing an exchange transfusion during the duration of the study.
             Patients requiring episodic transfusion in response to worsened anemia or VOC are
             permitted.

          -  Contraindication or hypersensitivity to any drug from similar class as study drug or
             to any excipients of the study drug formulation.

          -  Planning to initiate or terminate HU/HC while on study, other than for safety reasons

          -  Significant active infection or immune deficiency (including chronic use of
             immunosuppressive drugs) in the opinion of the investigator.
