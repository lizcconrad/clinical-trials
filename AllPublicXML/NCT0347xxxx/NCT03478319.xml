  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of ACE-2494 in healthy postmenopausal women.

      Subjects will be evaluated for study inclusion/exclusion criteria during the screening period
      (within 4 weeks prior to Day -1) and eligible subjects who have signed the informed consent
      form (ICF) will be enrolled and treated with study drug (ACE-2494 or placebo) on Day 1.
      Subjects will be randomized (3:1, ACE-2494: placebo) to receive either one dose (on Day 1 in
      Part 1) or three doses (on Days 1, 29, and 57 in Part 2) of study drug.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and
      multiple ascending doses of ACE-2494 in healthy postmenopausal women. The secondary
      objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and pharmacodynamic (PD)
      effects, including serum biomarkers, fat, lean, and bone mass (DXA), muscle volume and
      intramuscular fat fraction (MRI), and strength (QMT).
