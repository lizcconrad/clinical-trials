      Patient satisfaction is an important subjective measure of healthcare quality which
      contributes to evaluation of the structure, process and outcome of services. The key factor
      in patient satisfaction is adequate perioperative information of the patient and
      communication between healthcare providers and patient or patient's kin.

      There are few studies in anesthesia that have assessed patient satisfaction and mood-state
      during regional anesthesia.

      The investigators aimed to evaluate factors associated with patient satisfaction from
      regional anesthesia procedure and mood-state of patients who underwent surgery under regional
      anesthesia.

      Patient satisfaction is an important subjective measure of healthcare quality which
      contributes to evaluation of the structure, process and outcome of services. Many factors
      contribute to patient satisfaction, including institutional structure, interpersonal
      relationships, and a patient' expectations. Age, gender, social insurance, educational and
      social statue also play role in patient satisfaction. The key factor in patient satisfaction
      is adequate perioperative information of the patient and communication between healthcare
      providers and patient or patient's kin.

      The success of regional anesthesia is influenced by several factors. Most patients expect
      uneventful perioperative process. Nevertheless, recovery from surgery and anesthesia is
      sometimes complicated by major and minor complaints including pain, nausea, vomiting and
      other. Although there is no scientific or clinical evidence that regional anesthesia is
      superior to general anesthesia, regional anesthesia has some advantages like keeping
      consciousness of the patient during surgery, continuation of spontaneous breathing, avoiding
      the loss of protective reflexes, allowing early mobilization in the postoperative period and
      shortening the length of hospital stay. However, the major contraindication for regional
      anesthesia is the patient's unwillingness.

      There are few studies in anesthesia that have assessed patient satisfaction and mood-state
      during regional anesthesia.

      The investigators aimed to evaluate factors associated with patient satisfaction from
      regional anesthesia procedure and mood-state of patients who underwent surgery under regional
      anesthesia.
