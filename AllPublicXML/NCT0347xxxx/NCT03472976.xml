      Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 50 males and non-pregnant
      females, 18 to 49 years old, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This
      clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of
      inactivated A/H5N1 influenza vaccine administered intradermally (ID) with topical Aldara or
      control cream as a 2-dose regimen. The vaccine will be administered using the MicronJet600™
      device. Subjects will be assigned to 2 treatment arms (25 subjects per treatment arm). Group
      A will receive two doses of A/H5N1 IIV ID with pre-application of topical Aldara on Days 1
      and 22. Group B will receive two doses of A/H5N1 IIV ID with pre-application of topical
      control cream on Days 1 and 22. The duration of this study will be approximately 20 months
      with patient participation duration approximately 7 months. The primary objectives of this
      study are: 1) to assess the safety and reactogenicity after 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV vaccine
      containing 9 mcg HA per dose administered ID approximately 21 days apart with topical Aldara
      or control cream; 2) to assess the serum HAI antibody responses 21 days after receipt of the
      2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID at 9 mcg HA per dose with topical Aldara or control
      cream.

      This is a Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 50 males and
      non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity,
      and immunogenicity of inactivated A/H5N1 influenza vaccine administered intradermally (ID)
      with topical Aldara or control cream as a 2-dose regimen. The vaccine will be administered
      using the MicronJet600™ device. Subjects will be assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatment arms
      (25 subjects per treatment arm) to receive 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID with topical
      Aldara or control cream. Group A will receive two doses of A/H5N1 IIV (9 mcg HA/dose) ID with
      pre-application of topical Aldara on Days 1 and 22. Group B will receive two doses of A/H5N1
      IIV (9 mcg HA/dose) ID with pre-application of topical control cream on Days 1 and 22. The
      duration of this study will be approximately 20 months with patient participation duration
      approximately 7 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the safety and
      reactogenicity after 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV vaccine containing 9 mcg HA per dose administered
      ID approximately 21 days apart with topical Aldara or control cream; 2) to assess the serum
      HAI antibody responses 21 days after receipt of the 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID at
      9 mcg HA per dose with topical Aldara or control cream. The secondary objectives are: 1) to
      assess unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) following receipt of 2 doses of A/H5N1
      IIV administered ID approximately 21 days apart with topical Aldara or control cream; 2) to
      assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) including new-onset chronic medical
      conditions (NOCMCs), and potentially immune mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs) following
      receipt of two doses of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID approximately 21 days apart with topical
      Aldara or control cream for six months after last vaccination; 3) to assess the serum
      neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses 21 days following receipt of the 1st and 2nd dose of
      A/H5N1 IIV administered ID with topical Aldara or control cream; 4) to assess the serum HAI
      antibody responses 21 days following receipt of the 1st dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID
      with topical Aldara or control cream; 5) to assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses
      7 days following receipt of the 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID with topical Aldara or
      control cream.

             - Stable chronic medical condition - no change in prescription medication, dose, or
             frequency of medication in the last 2 months (defined as 60 days) and health outcomes
             of the specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last 6
             months (defined as 180 days). Any change that is due to change of health care
             provider, insurance company etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in
             the same class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion
             criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease
             outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion.

             -- Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the

             - An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms
             remaining is allowable if, in the opinion of the site PI or appropriate
             sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess
             safety parameters as required by the protocol.

          2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site PI or
             appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study participation.

             - Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for
             at least 90 days, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury,
             render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere
             with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this study.

          3. Have immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use of
