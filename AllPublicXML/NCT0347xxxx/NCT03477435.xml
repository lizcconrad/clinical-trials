  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a Type I hybrid effectiveness/implementation study to evaluate two
      population-based approaches for increasing use of Quitlines and text messaging at two VA
      sites. Specifically, the investigators will test the default bias, examining whether an
      opt-out approach to referral is more effective than an opt-in approach. The investigators
      will randomly assign teams to either an opt-out or opt-in approach to referring smokers to
      treatment. In the opt-out approach, the default is that everyone is referred to treatment
      unless they actively choose not to be. In the opt-in approach, people are offered treatment
      but must actively choose to enroll in it.

      This project is a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness/implementation study to evaluate two
      population-based approaches for increasing use of specific evidence-based approaches for
      behavioral tobacco dependence treatment, Quitlines and text messaging, at the Manhattan and
      Brooklyn campuses of the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System (NYHHS). The project will test
      the default bias, examining whether an opt-out approach to referral is more effective than an
      opt-in approach. Researchers will randomly assign clinical care teams at each VA campus to
      either an opt-out or an opt-in approach to referring smokers to treatment. In the opt-out
      approach, the default is that everyone is referred to treatment unless they actively choose
      not to be. In the opt-in approach, people are offered treatment but must actively choose to
      enroll in it.

    <intervention_name>Staff training and academic detailing</intervention_name>
    <description>Both arms will receive training at baseline to help their patients quit smoking. The training will be a mix of content and process education. We will provide brief updates to staff every 6 months throughout the intervention period, which will focus primarily on process education. We will monitor which staff attend and reach out separately to staff who did not. During the month after implementation of the clinical reminders, two study investigators will make a brief outreach visit to each staff member. We will follow a script, using the seven steps recommended by the National Resource Center for Academic Detailing: 1) Introduction; 2) Needs Assessment; 3) Key Messages/Features/Benefits; 4) Understanding Barriers and Enablers; 5) Identifying and Handling Objections; 6) Summary; and 7) Close. The key message (Step 3) will include demonstration of the clinical reminder, review of the evidence for telephone counseling and text messaging and how to refer patients.</description>
