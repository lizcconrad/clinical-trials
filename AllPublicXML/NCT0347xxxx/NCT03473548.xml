      The purpose of the study is: 1) To assess the feasibility of unmonitored polysomnography and
      2) to compare apnea hypopnea index (AHI), average SPO2, and SPO2 nadir between unmonitored
      polysomnography and in-laboratory polysomnography in pediatric patients.

      The purpose of the study proposed is twofold. First Investigators will test the feasibility
      of conducting portable sleep monitoring in school aged children using the Clevemed Sleepview
      (www.clevelmed.com), one of the smallest portable sleep monitors commercially available at 57
      grams. Second, Investigators will perform a direct comparison between the results obtained
      with this portable sleep monitor and those obtained from a standard-of-care in-laboratory
      attended sleep study performed at the St. Louis Children's Hospital Pediatric Sleep Center.
      These comparisons will be offered to the participants suspected of having sleep disordered
      breathing who present to the Washington University Pediatric Otolaryngology Department.
      Investigators will obtain the medical history and medications and results of the sleep study
      done at SLCH sleep lab from the medical record for research purposes.
