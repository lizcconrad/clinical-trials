  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial designed to analyze the impact of bedrest duration on
      return to functional independence at discharge following sartorius flap for coverage of
      vascular reconstruction in the groin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot prospective study with the purpose of evaluating the impact of bedrest
      duration on outcomes of groin muscle flaps used for groin coverage in patients undergoing
      open, infrainguinal vascular surgery. The investigators plan to target all patients
      undergoing groin muscle flaps for vascular groin coverage at UCSF.

      All patients undergoing groin flaps will be block randomized into two cohorts: Cohort 1 - one
      day of bedrest (mobilize on post-op day 2) versus Cohort 2 - 5 days of bedrest (mobilize on
      post-op day 6).

      The investigators perform approximately 50 infrainguinal muscle flaps per year. They aim to
      enroll 140 patients (70 per cohort).

      The primary outcome is return to functional independence at discharge. Secondary outcomes
      include wound dehiscence, infection, reoperation, interventional radiology intervention,
      seroma, and sequela associated with prolonged bedrest including respiratory infections,
      duration of hospitalization, need for SNF upon discharge, and physiologic deconditioning. The
      investigators will also examine the impact of bedrest on patient reported outcomes one month
      following surgery. Patient outcomes will be followed for 3 months post-operatively.
