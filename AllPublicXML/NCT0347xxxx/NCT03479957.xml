  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supervised exercise is an essential component of contemporary center-based cardiac
      rehabilitation (CR) programs. Despite the proven effectiveness, uptake and adherence to
      supervised exercise-based CR (exCR) remains suboptimal (approximately 50%), especially in
      rural and remote areas of Sweden. The main reasons for low participation rate in centre-based
      exCR are different accessibility barriers i.e. long distances, transportation problems or
      employment commitments. In this randomised clinical trial, the overall aim is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of, home-based, remotely monitored and coached exCR using the REMOTE-CR system
      compared to home-based exCR based on individualized information regarding current exercise
      recommendations but without monitoring and coaching (usual care) to improve exercise
      capacity. Our hypothesis is that remotely monitored and coached exCR will improve exercise
      capacity to a greater extent than home-based exCR without monitoring and coaching (usual
      care).

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire: Results will be presented as a continuous variable, total metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week, where a higher score indicates a higher physical activity level. Result will also be presented as a categorical variable:
High Physical activity level: achieving a total physical activity of at least 3000 MET-minutes/week.
Moderate physical activity: achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET-minutes per week.
Low physical activity level: not achieving the minimum of 600 MET minutes per week</description>
