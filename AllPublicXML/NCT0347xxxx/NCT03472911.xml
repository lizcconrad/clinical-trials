  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the primary objective was to estimate the minimum effective volume of
      bupivacaine 0.5% resulting in successful block in 50% of patients (MEV50) for
      ultrasound-guided retroclavicular approach to infraclavicular brachial plexus block.

      Two rules were used to stop the study. First stopping rule was a fixed-sample-size. The
      investigators used an up-and-down method to estimate the threshold for an all-or-none
      response for present study design. Therefore, for sample size calculation, the investigators
      applied the formula by Dixon and Massey, n=2(SD/SEM)2 (SD: standard deviation and SEM:
      standard error of mean). Second stopping rule included demonstration of minimum of five
      consecutive up-and-down sequences. On the basis of previous studies with similar binary
      outcomes, the investigators estimated that a priori a minimum of five negative-positive
      up-and down deflections was required to calculate MEV50.
