    <textblock>
      The QBECO-CD-02 trial in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) is intended to
      build on past experience with QBECO SSI and further establish the safety and efficacy of
      QBECO SSI for the induction of clinical and/or endoscopic response and remission.

      The study will be conducted in three stages; a Lead-in, Main Induction and Main Maintenance
      .The first 20 patients will be enrolled in the Lead-in study, at approximately 5 study
      centers in Canada. Subsequent patients will be enrolled in the Main study, which aims to
      enroll 150 patients. The Lead-in component will be an open-label study to evaluate endoscopic
      healing endpoints. The Main Induction study will be randomized and placebo-controlled.
      Participants meeting response criteria following the Main Induction study will be eligible to
      continue into the Main Maintenance study, remaining on their initially randomized treatment.
      Participants not meeting response criteria will complete their follow-up and study
      involvement at the end of the Main Induction.

      The QBECO-CD-02 trial in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) is intended to
      build on past experience with QBECO SSI and further establish the safety and efficacy of
      QBECO SSI for the induction of clinical and/or endoscopic response and remission.

      i. Overall Design:

      Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with moderate to
      severe Crohn's disease to establish the safety and efficacy of QBECO SSI for the induction
      and maintenance of clinical and/or endoscopic response and remission. The study will be
      conducted in three stages; a Lead-in, Main Induction and Main Maintenance . The first 20
      patients will be enrolled in the Lead-in study, at selected study centers. Subsequent
      patients will be enrolled in the Main study. The Lead-in component will be an open-label
      study to evaluate endoscopic healing endpoints. The Main Induction study will be randomized
      and placebo-controlled. Participants meeting response criteria following the Main Induction
      study will be eligible to continue into the Main Maintenance study, remaining on their
      initially randomized treatment. Participants not meeting response criteria will complete
      their follow-up and study involvement at the end of the Main Induction.

      Primary Endpoints will be evaluated at various times throughout each stage of the study. In
      the Lead-In study, primary endpoints will be measured at Week 16 and 26 for determination of
      the induction duration and again at Week 52 as initial data on maintenance. In the Main
      Induction, the primary endpoints will be assessed when the last subject completes the
      induction period, either Week 16 or Week 26 depending on the finding of the Lead-In. In the
      Main Maintenance, the primary endpoints will be measured at Week 52. Safety Assessments will
      be carried out throughout the study and at the Week 56 visits for all subjects completing the
      study.

      The study will be run at approximately 50 study centers in Canada, the United States of
      America and Eastern Europe.

      ii. Number of Participants:

      20 participants will be enrolled in the Lead-In study. No Lead-In study participants will be
      enrolled in the Main Induction or Maintenance component of the study.

      150 participants will be randomized to the Main Induction study, resulting in an estimated
      total of 70 subjects proceeding to the Main Maintenance component of the study.

      iii. Intervention Groups and Duration:

      Approximately 170 adult subjects (N=170) with moderate to severe CD, 20 patients in the
      Lead-In study and 150 patients in the Main study, stratified by prior anti-TNFα inhibitor/
      biologic therapy use. Patients will be randomized 2:1, active drug:placebo, and will receive
      52 weeks of QBECO SSI treatment or placebo.
