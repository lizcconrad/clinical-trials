    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, international, double-blind study of the administration of mavacamten
      in participants with symptomatic obstructive HCM (oHCM). Approximately 220 participants will
      be randomized to receive placebo or mavacamten.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 and greater, body weight ≥ 45kg

          -  Has adequate acoustic windows to enable accurate transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs)

          -  Diagnosed with oHCM consistent with current American College of Cardiology
             Foundation/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines
             and satisfy both criteria:

          -  Has documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥55%

          -  NYHA Class II or III

          -  Has documented oxygen saturation at rest ≥90% at Screening

          -  Is able to perform an upright CPET and has a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) ≥1.0 at
             Screening per central reading

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A participant who meets any of the following exclusion criteria may not participate in this
        study:

          -  Known infiltrative or storage disorder causing cardiac hypertrophy that mimics oHCM,
             such as Fabry disease, amyloidosis, or Noonan syndrome with LV hypertrophy

          -  Has a history of syncope or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia with exercise within
             6 months prior to Screening

          -  Has a history of resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest (at any time) or known history of
             appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) discharge for
             life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia within 6 months prior to Screening

          -  Has paroxysmal, intermittent atrial fibrillation with atrial fibrillation present per
             the investigator's evaluation of the participant's ECG at the time of Screening

          -  Has persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation for at least 4
             weeks prior to Screening and/or not adequately rate controlled within 6 months prior
             to Screening

          -  Current treatment (within 14 days prior to Screening) or planned treatment during the
             study with disopyramide or ranolazine

          -  For individuals on β-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem, any dose adjustment of that
             medication &lt;14 days prior to Screening or any anticipated change in treatment regimen
             using these medications during the study

          -  Has LVOT gradient with Valsalva maneuver &lt;30 mmHg at Screening

          -  Has been successfully treated with invasive septal reduction (surgical myectomy or
             percutaneous alcohol septal ablation [ASA]) within 6 months prior to Screening or
             plans to have either of these treatments during the study

          -  ICD placement within 6 months prior to Screening or planned ICD placement during the
             study

          -  Has pulmonary disease that limits exercise capacity or systemic arterial oxygen
             saturation

          -  Has a history or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition, or
             disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a risk to participant
             safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion

          -  Prior treatment with cardiotoxic agents such as doxorubicin or similar
