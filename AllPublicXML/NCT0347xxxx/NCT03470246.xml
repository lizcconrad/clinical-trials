  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PACO trial is a randomized clinical trial conducted in Heart Centers of Kuopio and Turku
      university hospitals. The coronary artery disease, aortic valve stenosis and mitral valve
      insufficiency patients preparing for elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic
      valve replacement (AVR) or mitral valve repair (MVR) will be randomized to either
      intervention or control group. The specific operation groups (CABG, AVR and MVR) will be
      analyzed separately. The 7-day baseline measurements of sedentary behaviour (SB), physical
      activity (PA) and sleep will be conducted to the patients by using the RM42 accelerometer
      during the pre-operative month.

      After the cardiac procedure is completed and the patient is moved to post-operative ward, the
      control group patients will begin the standard post-operative rehabilitation program of the
      participating hospitals (activity guidance given by a physiotherapist). Patients in the
      intervention groups will follow the identical program but after discharge they will also
      receive personalized activity guidance through the combination of ExSed smart phone
      application, Suunto MoveSense accelerometer and cloud system during the first 90 days of
      post-operative rehabilitation. Weekly evolving daily goals to replace SB with PA (daily goals
      for steps, moderate PA, light PA and standing, and sitting time limit) will be designed for
      each patient of the intervention groups. A new daily step goal will be delivered from the
      cloud system to the patient's smart phone in the beginning of each week of the intervention.
      The daily step goal of the first intervention week is based on patient's walking distance
      assessed by a physiotherapist in post-operative ward. The following goals will be
      automatically evolved in the basis of patient's personal average step count of the previous
      week. The MoveSense accelerometer will measure accumulated levels of SB, PA and sleep, and
      transmit the data to user's ExSed application with Bluetooth. With information about
      accumulated levels of SB and PA, the application is able to guide the patient to accomplish
      the predefined activity goal. The guidance and motivation will be offered with pop-up
      notifications and histograms (columns are fulfilled according to patient's accumulated daily
      activity). The researches retain a remote access to the activity data of patients in the
      cloud system. The ExSed application will be connected to the cloud system with internet
      connection.

      In addition, the patients of the intervention groups will receive short video files (lasting
      from 1 to 3 minutes) containing exercise guidance from a physiotherapist specialized to
      cardiac operation patients. These videos are available on the ExSed application during the
      intervention. The physiotherapist will also contact each patient (by mobile phone) with
      structured contact form from 1 to 4 times in a month to make sure that the intervention is
      proceeding as designed.

    <intervention_model_description>The PACO trial is based on randomized clinical trial. Besides the standard post-operative care, the cardiac operation patients of the intervention groups will receive activity guidance during a 90-day intervention after elective coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement or mitral valve repair. In addition, exercise guidance (short video files) and regular mobile phone contacts from physiotherapist will be provided to the intervention patients.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The improvement in mean daily number of steps after 3 months from discharge. In addition, the follow-up will be continued until 12 months after discharge. The baseline values of mean daily number of steps will be determined in a 7-day accelerometer measurements conducted to the patients before the elective cardiac operation. The mean daily number of steps after the first 3 and 12 months of post-operative rehabilitation at home will be also determined in 7-day (24 h) accelerometer measurements. The raw accelerometer data will be analyzed with Mean Amplitude Deviation and Angle for Posture Estimation -algorithms to recognize the daily steps for the 7 days of which average will be calculated for each study patient.</description>
