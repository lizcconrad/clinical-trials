    <textblock>
      The shoulder joint is the second most affected body part of all overuse injuries in overhead
      athletes. Due to the repetitive throwing motion overhead athletes show the following
      characteristic adaptations of their dominant shoulder: Loss of internal rotation (IR) and
      gain of external rotation (ER), reduced muscle strength of the shoulder external rotators and
      scapular dyskinesis. On the one hand these adaptations are normal and necessary for a
      powerful throwing performance. On the other hand the amount of adaptation seems to play a
      crucial role in developing overuse symptoms and therefore becoming a risk factor. Most
      previous studies investigating throwing specific adaptations and risk factors focused on
      overhead sports like baseball, handball or tennis, whereas similar research in volleyball is
      still insufficient. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate if sport specific
      adaptations are present in female volleyball players and if yes, if there is a difference of
      the extent of these adaptations in volleyball players with overuse symptoms and players
      without.

      Background The shoulder joint is the second most affected body part of all overuse injuries
      in overhead athletes.Prevalence of a history of shoulder problems related to overuse in
      volleyball players was reported to be approximately 60%. Typical overuse symptoms like pain
      seriously limit progress in performance and the individual career options of volleyball
      players.

      Due to the repetitive throwing motion overhead athletes show the following characteristic
      adaptations of their dominant (Ds), compared to the non-dominant (NDs) shoulder: 1) Loss of
      internal rotation (IR) and gain of external rotation (ER), by preserving the total rotational
      motion (TROM). 2) Reduced muscle strength of the shoulder external rotators (ER). 3) Scapular
      dyskinesis. On the one hand these adaptations are normal and necessary for a powerful
      throwing performance. On the other hand the amount of adaptation seems to play a crucial role
      in developing overuse symptoms and therefore becoming a risk factor; e.g. loss of IR, also
      known as glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) of more than 20° side difference, and
      a loss of TROM of the Ds, were defined as risk factors in baseball players. Moreover
      decreased muscle strength of ER (OR: 0.71 per 10N decrease) in the Ds as well as obvious
      scapular dyskinesis were associated with increased risk of overuse related shoulder symptoms
      (ORSS). Nevertheless there are still overhead athletes showing these adaptations or risk
      factors without being symptomatic.

      Recently, several authors underlined the importance of core stability related to the kinetic
      chain during an overhead throwing task. It is hypothesised that symptomatic athletes may
      overload the shoulder girdle through altered biomechanics in an effort to compensate for
      insufficient power generated by the core musculature. The most reliable measurements to asses
      core stability components are core endurance tests.

      Most previous studies investigating throwing specific adaptations and risk factors focused on
      overhead sports like baseball, handball or tennis, whereas similar research in volleyball is
      still insufficient. Moreover, no one ever investigated core endurance and its possible
      association with (ORSS) in volleyball players.

      Objective The first aim is, to evaluate if sport specific adaptations such as IR ROM deficit,
      gain of ER ROM, ER strength deficit, alterations in TROM and scapular dyskinesis are present
      in female volleyball players and if yes, if there is a difference of the extent of these
      adaptations in volleyball players with ORSS and players without.

      The second aim is, to evaluate if there is a difference in core endurance in volleyball
      players with ORSS and players without and if there is a correlation of core endurance and
      shoulder related risk factors such as ER strength deficit and scapular dyskinesis?

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>isometric strength of shoulder internal and extern rotators</measure>
    <time_frame>2017</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric strength is measured in Newton (N) using a digital handheld dynamometer (HHD; Model 01165, Lafayette Instrument Company, USA). The participants are placed in supine with their shoulder in 0° abduction (ABD) a small towel roll is used to maintain the humerus in a neutral position and their elbow flexed to 90°. The forearm is fixed to the core using a fixation band. The HHD is placed on the dorsal or ventral aspect of the forearm for ER and IR, directly proximal to wrist joint line. Players are asked to perform all strength measures twice with a rest of 30 sec. between the two attempts. The mean of the two attempts is recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>passive glenohumeral range of motion in internal and external rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>2017</time_frame>
    <description>Glenohumeral ROM is measured in degrees (°) on both sides using a digital application Clinometer (Plaincode Software Solutions, Peter Breitling, Stephanskirchen Germany, version 4.5 (1511062) on iOS). Participants are placed supine, the shoulder positioned in 90° of abduction, a small towel roll is used to maintain the position of the humerus in neutral and their elbow is flexed to 90°. A splint is fastened around the forearm, to attach the smartphone. The assessor palpates the coracoid process with the thumb and the spine of the scapula with the fingers to control for scapular movement. The shoulder is passively moved to the end of ROM (EOR) into IR and ER. EOR of IR and ER is defined at the point at which the scapula is moving. The mean of two trials for IR and ER is used for data analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>scapular dyskinesis</measure>
    <time_frame>2017</time_frame>
    <description>Scapular control is evaluated using the scapular dyskinesis test (SDT). In standing position players held two dumbbells each in one hand. Players are instructed to bilaterally elevate their arms overhead as far as possible to a 3-second count with thumbs positioned upwards and then lower to a 3-second count. Five repetitions are performed while they are visually observed from posterior. The final rating classifies scapula control as normal, subtle abnormal or obvious abnormal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>core stability</measure>
    <time_frame>2017</time_frame>
    <description>Core stability is assessed using core endurance tests in seconds (s). Tests are performed in a sit up position in 60° Flexion and in side plank position on both sides. Players are instructed to hold their back and hip to the upright position for as long as possible. The test terminates, when the player is not able to hold the position anymore.</description>
