      This study will investigate the effect of early hospital discharge versus traditional one on
      maternal outcome for women undergoing elective cesarean sections.

      aim of the work is to assess rate of maternal hospital revisits after early hospital
      discharge at 8-12 hours following elective cesarean delivery compared to the current practice
      of discharge at 24-48 hours postoperatively.

      The effect of early versus traditional hospital discharge on maternal outcome for women
      undergoing elective cesarean section

      What is already known on this subject? What does this study add? The rate of cesarean
      delivery is increasing, in developing countries, its rate ranges from 13 to 47% of all cases
      of delivery (Gibbons et al 2010). Current practice is to discharge women from hospital 24-48
      hours after cesarean delivery, however in some rural areas there is a common practice of
      earlier discharge. The effect of earlier discharge on women health is controversial. The
      present study will investigate the possibility of earlier discharge to reduce the cost of
      hospitalization and postoperative care, increase the turnover rate of obstetric hospitals and
      improve maternal outcome.

      Many studies were concerned by early discharge of patients as there is evidence for
      colorectal surgery suggests that enhanced recovery programmes can reduce hospital stays by
      0.5-3.5 days compared with conventional care (Fiona Paton et al 2014).

      The average hospital stay following Cesarean delivery in most hospitals is 2 to 4 days (Tan
      et al 2012). Hospitalization allows close monitoring of women and early discovery and
      management of complication. Early discharge would, therefore, be a disadvantage and may delay
      identification and treatment of maternal and infant morbidity (National Institute of Health
      2011). In contrast, several studies concluded that early discharge after Cesarean delivery is
      not associated with maternal readmissions (Brown et al 2011) and is associated with more
      maternal satisfaction and lesser cost (Umbeli et al 2010) and will decrease burden on medical
      facilities, increase turnover of obstetrics, reduce the cost of postoperative care, reduce
      rate of hospital acquired complications and Improve maternal neonatal relationship.
