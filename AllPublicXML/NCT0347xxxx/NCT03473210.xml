  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial that involved 100 women diagnosed with PPROM between 24 and 34
      weeks of gestational age. Participants were randomized equally into 2 groups. Group I in
      which amniopatch was done (an amnioinfusion of platelet concentrate followed by fresh frozen
      plasma in addition to the routine management used in the control group. Group II were treated
      with routine management including antibiotics and corticosteroids

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients were started on a regimen of hospital bed rest and received antibiotic
      prophylaxis consisting of ampicillin 2g IV every 6hours for 48 hours, followed by
      erythromycin 250mg every 6hours for 5days . Antenatal corticosteroids were given in the form
      of dexamethasone 8mg intramuscular every 12hours for 48 hours i.e. in four divided doses.

      Fifty to two hundred ml of normal saline was infused to create an adequate pocket in which
      the infusion needle can be stabilized. After injection of normal saline, alternate infusions
      of 20 mL of platelets, normal saline (which does not contain Calcium, needed for the clotting
      process), and 20 mL of (FFP). The infused substances were warmed to a temperature of 37Â°c.
      Avoiding contact between the blood products prevents clotting in the lines.

      During infusion, the fetal heart rate as well as the accumulation of amniotic fluid was
      monitored by ultrasound. Usually a total of around 60-80 mL of platelets, 100-150 mL of FFP
      and 100-150 mL of amnioinfusion fluid was used throughout the procedure
