  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to develop and evaluate a physical activity promotion program among
      elderly African Americans with a long-term goal of reducing risk of Alzheimer's disease. The
      motivation for this study is that previous exercise interventions have improved cognitive
      function in older adults with and without cognitive impairments, but these studies were
      largely conducted without substantial African American representation. Due to genetic and
      environmental differences between African American and other populations, it is unclear
      whether positive findings from previous interventions will translate to African American
      individuals. We hypothesize that a community-based physical activity intervention will a) be
      tailored to African American adults, b) increase daily amounts of physical activity, and c)
      improve cognitive function in sedentary older African American adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will randomize 56 older African American adults into 1) a physical activity intervention
      specifically tailored to older African American or 2) a successful aging group. The 12-week
      physical activity intervention will consist of group based exercise sessions at a community
      facility and the successful aging groups will occur at Pennington Biomedical. Cognitive
      functioning and blood markers of circulating neurotrophic factors will be assessed to
      determine the brain effects of physical activity in this understudied population.

      Specific Aim 1: To tailor a physical activity promotion intervention to community-dwelling
      African American elderly adults. We will use focus groups to gather information needed to
      tailor a physical activity program to elderly African Americans.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if a physical activity promotion intervention in African
      American adults is effective in modifying physical activity and biological markers.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine if a physical activity promotion intervention in African
      American adults benefits cognition and brain health. Change over the course of the
      intervention will be assessed in key AD related cognitive domains (memory, executive
      function, and processing speed).

      Collecting this data sets the stage for the definitive study of exercise benefits on measures
      of amyloid, tau, inflammation, brain metabolism, and other AD-relevant pathways in elderly
      African Americans, which could in turn increase understanding of neurobiological mechanisms
      and optimal physical activity recommendations for elderly African Americans.
