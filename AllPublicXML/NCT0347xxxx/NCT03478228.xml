  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether individuals with fall-related wrist fractures
      have impaired posterior control, reduced proprioception in their lower limbs and/or
      vestibular asymmetry compared with those who have not fallen and sustained a fracture.
      Secondly to investigate the effects of a new balance training method, directed at the sensory
      systems and training of fall-preventive movements on postural control and how it impacts the
      function of the sensory systems. Postural instability falls and fractures form one of the
      major problems associated with ageing. An association of vestibular- asymmetry with falls and
      fractures has been found and reduced vibration sensation in the lower limbs has been
      connected with imbalance. Wrist fractures are often precursor to the more serious hip
      fractures, which often result in decreased quality of life, even death and are costly for the
      society. Subjects will be individuals 50-75 years of age having sustained a fall-related
      wrist fracture. Measurements of sensory functions, postural control and functional ability
      will be conducted before and after balance training. Confidence in daily activities and
      self-perceived dizziness handicap will be obtained with questionnaires. The same evaluations
      will be performed on age and gender matched individuals without previous history of
      fall-related wrist fractures. This research might reveal the presence and frequency of
      vestibular asymmetry or/and other age related degenerative changes in the sensory systems,
      which decrease stability and increase the risk of falls and fractures. It could show
      preventive effects of specific balance training on fall risk, and thus increase quality of
      life of the individuals, improve healthcare services and decrease costs associated with falls
      and fractures.
