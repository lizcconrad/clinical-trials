  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the bile acid circulation is changed after
      gastric bypass surgery. Further, to account for how the changed anatomy of the gut influences
      how the bile acid and food is mixed in the gut and how this is associated with the changes in
      gut hormone release after the surgery.

      Our hypothesis is that bile acid reabsorption from the gut is increased as animal models
      suggest so and bile acid blood concentration increases after surgery.
