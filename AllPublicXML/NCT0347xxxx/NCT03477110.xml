      This pilot early phase I trial studies the side effects of temozolomide, radiation therapy,
      and tumor treating fields therapy using Novo tumor treatment fields (TTF)-200A device in
      participants with glioblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. NovoTTF-200A device is a portable device that
      produces alternating electrical fields that may disrupt growth of cancer cells. Giving
      temozolomide, radiation therapy, and tumor treating fields therapy using NovoTTF-200A device
      may work better in treating participants with glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of combination chemoradiotherapy with NovoTTF-200A
      device (Optune) treatment in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide plus Optune.

      II. To evaluate the median overall survival, 1-year overall survival, and event-free
      survival.

      III. Collect tumor O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status and
      isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status.

      IV. To evaluate the level of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in glioblastoma
      patient serum during treatment.

      V. To evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with radiotherapy with concurrent and
      adjuvant temozolomide plus Optune.

    <description>Discontinuation events are defined as the discontinuation of NovoTTF-200A device for &gt; 7 consecutive days due to skin toxicity of grade 3 or higher. For discontinuation rates, the method of Atkinson and Brown will be used to allow for the two-stage design. Descriptive analysis will be performed on the acute toxicity data.</description>

    <description>Participants receive temozolomide PO QD starting day 1 to the end of radiation therapy and undergo 30 fractions of radiation therapy over 15-20 minutes each, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday) for 6 weeks. Beginning day 1 of radiation therapy, participants undergo tumor treatment fields therapy using NovoTTF-200A device over 18 hours or more daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 28 days after the last dose of radiation therapy, participants receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
