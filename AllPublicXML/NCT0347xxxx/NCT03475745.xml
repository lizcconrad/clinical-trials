      Background &amp; objectives:

      Language impairment after aphasic stroke is both common and debilitating. However the
      mechanisms of language recovery after aphasic stroke is not fully understood. Investigators
      plan to detect the changes of functional and structural language networks after aphasic
      stroke by high-resolution MRI.Then Combined analyse functional and structural language
      network changes, establishing a prediction model for language outcome.

      Methods:

      The proposed study is a observational trial that will include 50 patients diagnosed with post
      stroke aphasia from the neurology clinics at The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang
      University. Aphasia battery of Chinese(ABC) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      will be performed at acute(~2weeks),subacute(3 months) and chronic phase(6months). Only
      routine drug therapy will be used.

      Relevance:

      Currently there is little known about the recovery mechanisms of post-stroke aphasia.The
      proposed study intends to analyse functional and structural language network changes by high
      resolution MRI, which may reveal the potential recovery mechanism underlying post stroke
      aphasia..
