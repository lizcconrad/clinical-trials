  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of palbociclib when given together
      with dexamethasone in treating participants with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has
      come back after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Palbociclib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Dexamethasone is a steroid medication that is used in combination with other medications to
      treat B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Giving palbociclib together with dexamethasone may
      work better in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose and schedule of the combination of palbociclib and dexamethasone in
      patients with relapsed or refractory adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      ii. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of palbociclib and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory adult B-cell ALL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the activity of palbociclib in combination with dexamethasone in patients with
      relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL.

    <description>INDUCTION: Participants receive palbociclib PO daily and dexamethasone PO daily for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with disease response (M0, M1, or M2) continue to Maintenance. Patients without a disease response discontinue treatment.
MAINTENANCE: Participants receive dexamethasone with a taper PO daily on days 1-7. Participants also receive palbociclib daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
