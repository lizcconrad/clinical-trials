      During one month, from 1st to 30th November 2016, all patients admitted in one of the medical
      Dpt of our Hospital (Internal Medicine Dpt, Endocrinology, ICU) will be screened for
      multi-drug resistant bacteria carriage (after written consent). They will answer to a
      questionnaire about previous travel in a foreign country during the previous year,
      hospitalization or not during this travel.

      During one month, from 1st to 30th November 2016, all patients admitted in one of the medical
      Dpt of our Hospital (Internal Medicine Dpt, Endocrinology, ICU) will be screened for
      multi-drug resistant bacteria carriage (after written consent), regardless a travel in a
      foreign country during the past year, or not. They will answer to a questionnaire about
      previous travel in a foreign country during the previous year, hospitalization or not during
      this travel. The aim of the study will be to compare the rate of carriage of multi-drug
      resistant bacteria among previous travelers, or not.
