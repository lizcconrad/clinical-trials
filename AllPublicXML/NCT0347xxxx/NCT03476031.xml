  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus infection is a major public health problem with an estimated global
      prevalence of 3% and an estimated 5-20% of infected patients will develop liver cirrhosis
      .The Prevalence of Hepatitis C infection in end stage renal disease is greater than in the
      general population especially in those on hemodialysis which reflects nosocomial transmission
      of the disease in the hemodialysis environment.

      Hepatitis C associated glomerulonephritis is an immune complex disease that occurs in 21% of
      patients who have HCV infection. It most commonly presents as membranoproliferative and mixed
      cryoglobulinemia It characterized by an indolent course in one third of patients , remission
      in another third and relapsing course in the remaining patients with potential progression to
      advanced chronic kidney disease.

      mechanism of injury : Chronic Hepatitis C is primarily associated with type II
      cryoglobulinemia , in which the primary mechanism of injury is vasculitis that occurs via
      immune complex deposition.

      hepatitis C virus related glomerular disease :

      Type I membranoproliferative was the most common finding associated with mixed
      cryoglobulinemia but other forms of glomerulonephritis were associated with Hepatitis c like
      mesangial glomerulonephritis,focal and segmental glomerulonephritis,minimal change
      nephropathy,membranous nephropathy , Fibrillary glomerulonephritis,immunotactoid
      glomerulopathy,IgA nephropathy, vasculitic renal involvement ,poly arteritis nodosa and
      interstitial nephritis .
