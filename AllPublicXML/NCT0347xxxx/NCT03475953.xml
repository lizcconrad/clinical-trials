      Assessment of the efficacy and safety of Regorafenib and Avelumab in four cohorts of patients
      with advanced or metastatic digestive solid tumors (four cohorts), once the Recommanded Phase
      II Dose (RP2D) has been determined (phase I trial).

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective open-labeled phase Ib trial based on a dose escalation
      study design (3+3 traditional design) assessing three dose levels of Regorafenib given in
      combination with Avelumab (no dose escalation for Avelumab) in patients with advanced
      digestive solid tumors followed by a phase II trial to evaluate the association of
      Regorafenib at the RP2D with Avelumab in 4 cohorts of advanced or metastatic tumors :

        -  Cohort A: Colorectal cancer not MSI-H or MMR-deficient

        -  Cohort B: GIST

        -  Cohort C: Oesophageal or gastric carcinoma
