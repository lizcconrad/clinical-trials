      Neurostimulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and spinal cord stimulation
      (SCS) have been used to treat DOC. Although these techniques have been shown to increase
      patient response, there are still some limitations. For example, DBS requires craniotomy and
      may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and infection. In addition, the complexity
      and cost of these technologies also limit their potential applications.

    <description>the treatment of vagus nerve stimulation by the neck without invasive. Based on the anatomy of the vagus nerve, single nerve stimulation can be used to affect many different organs and diseases. The end of the vagus nerve in the brain stem structure is called the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). 3 times a day, 2 minutes each time</description>
