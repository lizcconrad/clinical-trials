    <textblock>
      This study will establish a multi-center, prospective registration database. The included
      population are stage II and IIIA NSCLC patients undergoing R0 resection and will be scheduled
      for adjuvant chemotherapy. Before the first adjuvant chemotherapy, under the recommendation
      of a doctor, patients will voluntarily choose to use (exposed group) or not to use (control
      group) Shenlingcao Oral Liquid, which donated by Jiangzhong Group for 30 bottles. The
      research centers need to be consecutively enrolled patients according to the allocation of
      the number of cases according to the ratio of 3: 1 in exposure group and control group.

      The exposed and control groups will be followed up to 36 months (non-allelic follow-up).
      Information from patients will be prospectively collected, including baseline,
      chemoradiation, use of Shenlingcao Oral Liquid and the other complementary drugs, and various
      outcome measures (the questionnaire of EORTC QLQ, death, tumor recurrence, tumor metastasis,
      and chemotherapy-induced side effects of the blood system, etc.). Follow-up points included:
      Baseline (before giving chemotherapy), 2-3 days after each chemotherapy cycle, and
      6,12,18,24,30,36 months after enrollment.

    <description>Exposure group patients are those who voluntarily choose to use Shenlingcao Oral Liquid recommended by the doctor in NSCLC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Jiangzhong Group will donate the first 30 bottles of medicine, and afterwards, patients may purchase if they still need to take it. The length of time and dose of Shenlingcao Oral Liquid are unlimited and other adjunctive treatments may be used at the same time.</description>
