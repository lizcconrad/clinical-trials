      This study is a non-inferiority study comparing efficacy and onset of action between the
      herbal extracts topical solution, Bonipar, and diclofenac sodium topical solution, diclofenac
      gel 1% (approved by the FDA as a topical analgesic). Approximately 168 Duke patients will be
      recruited from Duke Pain Clinic, and selected Duke primary care practices. Individuals who
      report acute (less than 3 months duration) or chronic musculoskeletal pain of any intensity
      will be considered for enrollment into the study. After obtaining consent, eligible subjects
      will be will be randomized to receive Bonipar or diclofenac gel 1%.
