  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adequate physical activity level has important effects on cardiovascular health of
      children. However, the scientific literature suggests that few children meet the physical
      activity recommendations to obtain these cardiovascular benefits which may have immediate and
      long term consequences in public health. High intensity interval training (HIIT) has emerged
      as an effective strategy for improving physical and mental health in children. To note that
      HIIT can be completed in a shorter period of time and its results in physical health seem to
      be equivalent to those obtained in longer sessions of traditional aerobic training. However,
      there is no information about the dose of HIIT needed to obtain significant effects on
      cardiovascular health of children.

      The adoption of healthy dietary habits is also important in the prevention of obesity and
      cardiovascular diseases.

      School-based programs including physical activity and nutritional education have been
      recommended as important components of programs aiming to prevent obesity and cardiovascular
      diseases.

    <description>Two schools with four classes/groups of 4th degree of children will participate in the pilot study (i.e., age of children 9-10 years old). One of them has two physical education (PE) sessions per week and the other has only one PE session per week. In the school with two PE sessions, two classes will be randomly assigned to HIIT (2 sessions/week) +nutrition group, and two to the nutrition group. Similarly, in the school with one PE session per week, two classes will be randomly assigned to HIIT (1 session/week) + nutrition and two classes to the nutrition goup. Both HIIT and nutritional education sessions will be integrated integrated into the physical education and sciences sessions of the schools. The duration of the intervention will be of eight weeks.</description>
