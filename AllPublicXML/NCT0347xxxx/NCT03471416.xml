  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to investigate the association of nutritional status of a children
      assessed by body mass index (BMI), triceps skinfold thickness (TSFT), and mid upper arm
      circumference (MUAC), with body composition, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
      (DEXA), in 60 children undergoing treatment of ALL at Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica
      (UNOP), in Guatemala City, Guatemala. The study also aims to establish normative values of
      body composition in children residing in an LMIC by examining 160 healthy siblings of
      children under treatment, and to measure habitual physical activity in children with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis and during therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of children with cancer live in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where
      malnutrition, both under and over nutrition, is highly prevalent. Children who are
      malnourished while undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are shown to
      have chances of reduced survival. Children, who are malnourished at diagnosis, if the
      nutritional status is improved over the course of 6 months during the ALL treatment, have
      chances of similar survival as the ones who were nourished throughout. Therefore, it is
      important to study nutritional status in children with ALL, to understand and implement
      better treatment outcomes. Height and weight alone are considered incomprehensive in
      classifying nutritional status, especially in poorly nourished children. A more advanced
      nutritional assessment that distinguishes between fat and muscle mass is required. Treatment
      for ALL results in an increase in weight over the course of therapy with preferential gain in
      fat mass (FM) compared to fat free mass (FFM). Hence, there is a pressing need to advance
      nutritional assessment and implementation in pediatric oncology that includes monitoring of
      FM and FFM.

    <description>Percentage of time awake will be documented in each of 4 activity categories: inactive (lying down), somewhat inactive (SI, sitting down), somewhat active (SA, walking) and very active (VA, those activities that make subject &quot;breathe hard and sweat&quot;). The use of wake-up and bedtimes as well as meal times and durations allow the calculation of the total number of hours per day spent in each of the 4 categories. Total activity (TA) is calculated as SA+VA for each day.</description>
