  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicose veins affect a majority of adult population in the western world. They decrease
      quality of life and may also cause venous ulcers. Therefore varicose vein treatments are
      justified. Currently endovenous thermal ablation is a treatment of choice for varicose veins.
      At the outpatient setting, however, treating both limbs at the same time may be painful to
      the patient especially, if simultaneous phlebectomies are performed.

      The study aims to evaluate, if femoral nerve blockade can significantly decrease pain during
      the procedure without prolonging the stay in the hospital.

      Varicose veins affect a majority of adult population in the western world. They decrease
      quality of life and may also cause venous ulcers. Therefore varicose vein treatments are
      justified.

      Thanks to technical advancement open surgery has been replaced By endovenous means. Currently
      endovenous thermal ablation is a golden standard for main trunk disease. For efficient
      patient and procedure flow majority of thermal ablations are performed at the outpatient
      setting. However, if patient is suffering from significant varicose veins, treating both
      legs, may be unpleasant to the patient.

      Aim of the study is, whether addition of femoral nerve blockade to the tumescent anesthesia
      can decrease pain during the procedure without prolonging the stay in the hospital.
