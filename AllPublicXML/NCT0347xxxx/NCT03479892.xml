    <textblock>
      This study looks at a new study medicine for weight control in people with overweight or
      obesity. The aim of this study is to see if the study medicine is safe for people to take.
      The study also looks at how fast the body removes the study medicine. The participants will
      either get NNC0194-0499 (the study medicine) or placebo (a formula that looks like the
      medicine but does not have active ingredients). Which treatment the participants get is
      decided by chance. The participants will get 1 or more injections into the skin of stomach
      area once each week for 12 weeks. The study will last for about 4 to 5 months. The
      participants will have 18 visits to the clinic.
