  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-gestational performance of hysterosalpingography (HSG) using an oil-soluble iodinated
      contrast medium has been demonstrated to be the main cause of excessive iodine exposure for
      pregnant women. However, its long-term health effects on the mothers and offsprings have not
      been adequately elucidated. A case registry study is designed to follow up all the pregnant
      women with pre-gestational history of ethiodized-oil HSG examination and try to keep track of
      maternal and fetal outcomes.
