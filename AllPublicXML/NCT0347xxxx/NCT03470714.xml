  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is assessed the electromyographic activity response of non-dominant biceps brachii
      muscle during unilateral-dominant concentric, eccentric and isometric biceps brachii muscle
      contractions under kinesiotaping and non-taping conditions. The aim of the study is to
      determine the synergistic effect of kinesiotaping which is applied on non-dominant biceps
      brachii muscle on force irradiation.

      Fourty healthy subjects with no history of neurological or recent musculoskeletal injury will
      participate the study.

      Healthy subjects are arranged in two groups of stimulation: kinesiotaping group
      (kinesiotaping and force irradiation) and control group (only force irradiation). The
      electromyographic response of the resting arm (non-dominant) will be assessed during the
      dominant arm movement for all subjects. Additionally, in kinesiotaping group, kinesiotaping
      will be applied 24 hours before the experiment.

      The electromyographic response of the resting arm will be assessed under three contraction
      type movement (isometric, eccentric and concentric contractions) The SEMG signals are
      analysed by using MATLAB®, suitable signal proccessing techniques (linear envelope, Root Mean
      Square etc) are chosed. The statistical analysis are done by using SPSS®, according to data
      distribution, &quot;Independent Sample T Test&quot; or &quot;Mann-Whitney U Test&quot; is utilized for comparing
      outcomes of control and KT groups.
