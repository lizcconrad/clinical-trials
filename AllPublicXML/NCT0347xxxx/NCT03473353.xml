  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect outcomes related to a quality improvement project
      assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of a medical scribe program in which medical
      scribes accompany clinicians during their visits with patients. The medical scribes involved
      in the project are professional scribes and medical students who will accompany clinicians
      during patient visits and takes notes, enabling the clinician to engage more directly with
      the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has several specific objectives. This study aims to examine the impact of using
      medical scribes on (1) patient experience (e.g. patient satisfaction) (2) clinician
      experience (e.g. stress load, burnout, evaluation of the visit, amount of time spent after
      hours inputting notes), and (3) clinician-patient interaction (e.g. patient and clinician
      engagement during the visit).
