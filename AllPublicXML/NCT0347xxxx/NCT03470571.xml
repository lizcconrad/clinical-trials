  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presentation of myocarditis is heterogeneous, often ranges from being asymptomatic, to chest
      pain, dyspnoea, palpitations, and even sudden cardiac death. Diagnosing myocarditis is
      challenging with no current uniform clinical gold-standard. CMR is a key investigative tool,
      however the predictive value of CMR features is unknown. In this study we assess 670
      consecutive patients with suspected myocarditis who were referred for CMR between 2002 and
      2015 at the BWH. CMR features such as late gadolinium sizing, T1 mapping, extracellular
      volume fraction assessment, strain analysis (feature tracking), clinical data, labortory
      tetsings and electrocardiogramm are linked to the outcome in order to assess its predictive
      value.
