  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After stroke, it is common for individuals to experience hand impairment. This deficit can
      severely restrict functional ability and independence. Recovery of hand function following
      stroke is highly variable. In this study, the investigators will use brain imaging to predict
      individual response to treatment. Survivors of stroke will receive upper extremity therapy
      while they concurrently receive imperceptible vibration to the wrist aimed to enhance therapy
      outcomes.

      The ability to predict individuals' responses to treatment can enable effective allocation of
      a treatment to likely responders. The long-term goal is to determine whether acute changes in
      brain functional connectivity immediately after one treatment session can predict ultimate
      gains in motor function after completing multiple treatment sessions. The objective of this
      study is to determine feasibility and to examine association between change in brain
      functional connectivity after one session and motor gains after completion of all treatment
      sessions. This study is a prospective single-cohort longitudinal study. The treatment is
      task-practice therapy (3d/wk, 18-session) accompanied with concurrent imperceptible wrist
      vibration that is intended to prime the cortical sensorimotor network and enhance hand
      functional recovery in chronic stroke survivors. Hand function will be assessed before/after
      therapy and at 1-month follow-up. Connectivity will be assessed using fMRI and EEG before and
      after a treatment session.
