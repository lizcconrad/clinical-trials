  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of avelumab in combination with
      axitinib in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have
      received at least one prior platinum containing therapy, and in treatment naïve patients with
      advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, who are ineligible for cisplatin containing
      chemotherapy for their advanced disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Cohort: Histologically or cytologically confirmed
             diagnosis of NSCLC that is locally advanced or metastatic; No activating EGFR
             mutations, ALK or ROS1 translocations/rearrangements where testing is standard of
             care; received at least 1 prior platinum‑based chemotherapy regimen for locally
             advanced or metastatic NSCLC; No more than 2 prior lines of systemic therapy for
             locally advanced or metastatic disease (If disease progression occurred during or
             within 6 months after neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy‑chemotherapy,
             the regimen is counted as 1 prior treatment regimen towards the allowed limit of prior
             treatment regimens); Checkpoint inhibitor naïve.

          -  Urothelial Cancer (UC) Cohort: Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urothelium (if mixed, more than 50% TCC
             component) including bladder, urethra, ureters, or renal pelvis that is locally
             advanced or metastatic; No prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic
             disease; Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy is permitted if disease progression
             occurred &gt;12 months after the completion of therapy; Checkpoint inhibitor naïve;
             Ineligible for receiving cisplatin‑containing front‑line chemotherapy based at least
             one of the following criteria: ECOG performance status (PS) 2; Renal dysfunction

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. For UC
             patients, ECOG performance 2 is permitted (cisplatin ineligibility criterion)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior immunotherapy with an anti‑PD‑1, anti‑PD‑L1, anti‑PD‑L2, anti‑CD137, anti‑OX‑40,
             anti‑GITR, anti‑LAG‑3, anti‑TIM‑3 or anti‑CTLA‑4 antibody (including ipilimumab).

             steroids.

          -  Radiologically documented evidence of major blood vessel invasion or encasement by
             cancer or intratumor cavitation, regardless of tumor histology.

          -  Active autoimmune disease (that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory
             agent).

          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication (except for those listed in protocol).

          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to the investigational products /monoclonal
             antibodies.

          -  Known history of immune‑mediated colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, immune‑mediated
             pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  NCI CTCAE Grade 3 hemorrhage within 28 days prior to study enrollment.
