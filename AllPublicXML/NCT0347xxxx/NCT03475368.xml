  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely known that the quality of the diet is able to modify the expression of many
      bacterial genes populating the intestine of the host, as well as the type of bacteria
      themselves. This is also expressed with a more or less evident and troublesome after meals
      symptomatology that many patients complain to the health care staff.

      A good composition of the microbiota is crucial for the health of the individual, both at the
      intestinal level as well as at the systemic level because, depending on the type of food
      substrate available at the intestinal level, metabolites will be produced capable of
      positively or negatively affect the health of the individual.

      In fact, scientific evidence shows the existence of the causal link between the health of the
      microbiota and the genesis of inflammatory diseases not only intestinal, but also systemic,
      and even of cancer, obesity, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.

      The recent diffusion of gene sequencing techniques has brought significant developments in
      the study of the human and bacterial genome, which allow to produce enormous quantities of
      sequences at a lower cost and at a higher speed than previous techniques.

      Therefore the clinical Nutrition Clinic of the IRCCS De Bellis in Castellana Grotte (BA)
      proposes to check if changes in the intestinal microbiota correlate, not only with
      anthropometric and clinical-laboratory parameters, but also with the typical symptoms of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a functional pathology very widespread with the advent of the
      modern era, in which, a diet rich in sugars and proteins of animal origin and poor in plant
      foods, is unfortunately common also in the areas of the Mediterranean basin.
