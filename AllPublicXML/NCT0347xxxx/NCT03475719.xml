             disease.

          4. Subject that is considered appropriate for participating in the study by an
             investigator, based on clinical laboratory test (hematology, clinical chemistry,
             urinalysis) that is performed according to the characteristics of investigational
             drugs.

          5. Subject that agree to apply sun cream in case of daylight exposure for more than
             1hours

          6. Subjects must be able to listen to and understand the detailed statement of informed
             consent, and willing to decide to participate in the study, follow the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A clinically significant disease or history in hepatobiliary system, kidney, digestive
             system, respiratory system, hemato-oncological system, endocrine system,
             neuro-psychiatric system, musculo-skeletal system, immune system,
             otorhinolaryngological system or cardiovascular system.

          2. A history of hypersensitivity to investigational drugs and its additives or clinically
             significant hypersensitivity to any other drug.

          3. History of drug abuse, or positive in drug screening test.

          4. Use of inducer or inhibitor of metabolic enzymes for drugs like barbiturate.

          5. Use of any prescribed drugs or herbal remedies within 2 weeks, or use of any
             over-the-counter medication within 1 week prior to the first administration of
             investigational drug, and this will affect this study or the safety of the subjects at
             discretion of study investigator.

          6. Participation in another clinical trial or a bioequivalent study within 3 months prior
             to the first administration of investigational drug (The finish time of previous study
             is the day of the last administration of study drug)

          7. Whole blood donation within 2 months or component donation within 1 month, prior to
             the first administration of investigational drug, or transfusion within 1 month prior
             to the first administration of investigational drug.

          8. Prolonged excessive alcohol consumption (&gt;21 units/week, 1 unit=10g of pure alcohol),
             or subjects who can not abstain from drinking from 24 hours prior to hospitalization
             until the discharge.

          9. Smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day, excessive caffeine consumption (example:
             instant coffee &gt; 5 cups/day)

         10. Subjects who are judged to be inappropriate for this study by investigators according
             to other reasons including clinical lab test result
