    <textblock>
      This pilot study uses TESA-HB therapy for treatment of depressive symptoms associated with
      mild and moderate depression episodes. Primary objectives of this pilot study are to
      demonstrate the safety of TESA-HB Therapy, and to investigate the efficacy of TESA-HB Therapy
      for depressive symptoms.

      The primary indicator variable in this study is the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HAM-D21), and secondary efficacy outcomes will be measured using:

        -  Major Depression Inventory

        -  Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)

        -  Beck's Depression Inventory

        -  Beck's Anxiety Inventory

        -  Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)

        -  The Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB-S)

      The safety endpoints include:

        -  Medication Usage Log

        -  Adverse Event Log

      Study Population includes men and women who are:

        -  Diagnosed with a mild to moderate depressive episode

        -  Have no recent history of taking antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication within 3
