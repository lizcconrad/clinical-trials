      This study is a biomarker study designed to characterize how ketamine impacts the reward
      circuits of the human brain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the effect of acute ketamine modulation on the functioning of
      reward-related human brain circuits. Reward-related brain circuits will be assessed using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging.

      Participants will include volunteers who report more than two prior uses of ketamine (also
      known as &quot;Special K&quot;), when they were 18 years or older.

      The investigators will recruit individuals who have previously tried ketamine rather than
      those who are ketamine-na√Øve.

      Participants will receive an IV infusion of ketamine (~.05mg/kg and 0.5mg/kg) or placebo
      (saline). Following established procedures, these three sessions will be randomized in a
      blinded protocol in order to limit expectancy effects.

      Throughout each session, participants will be monitored. Functional imaging will commence
      after the drug has reached peak levels, following previously established time courses for
      ketamine infusion. Participants will also be monitored after the functional imaging session.
      Secondary effects of ketamine on behavior and self-reported experience will be assessed.

      In the assessment of the acute effects of ketamine, the investigators will take into account
      the cumulative effects of prior drug exposure.

    <measure>Reward circuit activation as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks after infusion of ketamine or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>During functional magnetic resonance imaging the reward circuit will be engaged by reward and related emotional tasks, and circuit activation will be quantified by blood flow in regions of interest and the extent of functional connectivity between them</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral responses on the WebNeuro computerized test battery assessing cognitive capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 hours after infusion of ketamine or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy data are quantified as number of errors and lower values indicate better performance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported responses as assessed by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 hours after infusion of ketamine or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Responses are quantified on a 4-point scale and summed for total DASS score and for each Depression, Anxiety and Subscale score. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported responses as assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 hours after infusion of ketamine or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Responses are quantified as summed scores for negative and positive mood states</description>

    <measure>Level of subjectively experienced intoxication as assessed by a visual analogue intoxication scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 hours after infusion of ketamine or placebo</time_frame>

    <description>Participants will receive an IV infusion of ketamine (~.05mg/kg and 0.5mg/kg) or placebo.
Ketamine is an FDA-approved dissociative anesthetic. The study doses are in the subanesthetic range. During the infusion, an ACLS-certified psychiatrist or anesthesiologist will provide continuous monitoring.
Afterwards, patients will be monitored on-site by an ACLS-certified MD or highly skilled research nursing staff, and an on-call emergency response team for 4 hours (ketamine's half-life is 15 min; 4 hrs= 16 half-lives).</description>
