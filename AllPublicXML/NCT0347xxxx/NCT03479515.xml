  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposal is to evaluate the ability of ultrasound to predict the
      body composition of toddlers in the outpatient clinical setting and to evaluate the
      relationship between body composition and neurodevelopment.

      The investigators will address the hypothesis in the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Validate ultrasound as a method to measure whole body fat mass and fat-free
      mass in toddlers. Body composition will be assessed using ultrasound measurements and the
      validated method of air displacement plethysmography (ADP).

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of a handheld Force-Measuring Ultrasound Probe on intra-
      and inter-observer variability in ultrasound measurements. A device which measures the force
      applied to the ultrasound probe will be used to obtain measurements of muscle and adipose
      tissue thickness (biceps, abdomen, and quadriceps) in toddlers.

    <description>Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at 3 and 4 years of age will be used to measure neurodevelopmental status for toddlers 3, 4, or 5 years of age.
