  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only one third of patients with schizophrenia are observant to their treatment knowing that
      the lack of adherence to treatment is one of the most important predictors of relapse.

      Recent work shows that the erroneous or negative beliefs of patients with schizophrenia
      regarding antipsychotic treatment are associated with poor compliance.

      The hypothesis is that negative beliefs about the antipsychotic treatment of caregivers of
      patients with schizophrenia may be associated with a higher risk of poor compliance compared
      to caregivers with positive beliefs about treatment.

      The primary purpose is to explore the correlation between caregiver beliefs about treatment
      and patient compliance, taking into account the level of caregiver-patient link.
