  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a complex metabolic state at which many pathophysiological pathways seem to
      interfere, like imbalance of autonomic nervous system, as well as
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation. Latest studies have shown that the
      increase of peripheral fat in obese patients, alongside with the increase of P-450 aromatase
      leads to hyper-aldosteronism, which results to increased sodium intake and rise of blood
      pressure. The present study aims to investigate the potential superiority of an aldosterone
      antagonist based therapy (eplerenone) over the renin-angiotensin antagonists (ARBs)
      (valsartan) based therapy in hypertensive obese patients regarding reduction of blood
      pressure (office, home and ambulatory) over a 24-week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study plans to enroll obese patients (BMI= 30-40 kg/m2) of 30-75 years of age,
      with untreated or never-treated essential hypertension to either eplerenone-based or
      valsartan-based therapy Patients visiting hypertension center(s), eligible to participate in
      the study and meeting study's inclusion criteria, will at first thoroughly be informed of
      study's protocol rationale, including scheduled follow-up visits. There will be a period of
      2-4 weeks, at which medical history will be taken, as well as somatometrics, including
      height, weight, BMI and waist circumference. Moreover, a thorough clinical examination will
      take place, including office blood pressure, ECG, heart-echo, renal ultrasound, blood and
      urine ultrasound. All women of gestational age should have pregnancy test.

      At randomization visit, patients still meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomized (1:1) to either eplerenone (E) 25mg bd or valsartan (V) 160mg od for 8 weeks. At
      8, 16 and 24 weeks, patients at both arms will be evaluated with ambulatory BP measurements
      primary, as well as home and office BP measurements. At week 8, patients with controlled
      hypertension (mean ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) &lt;130/80mmHg), will continue
      in monotherapy with eplerenone or valsartan and patients with uncontrolled hypertension (mean
      24-h ambulatory≥130/80mmHg) will continue with the addition of calcium-channel blocker,
      amlodipine (C) 5 mg od. At week 16, patients achieving BP control will continue in either
      monotherapy (E), (V) or dual therapy (E+C), (V+C). However, in patients not achieving blood
      pressure target, a third drug, thiazide-like-diuretic will be added [indapamide (D) 1.25 mg
      od]. All groups at both arms will be finally evaluated at 24 weeks.
