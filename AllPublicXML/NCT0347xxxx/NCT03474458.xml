  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic amyloidoses are rare diseases affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 persons each
      year.

      In systemic amyloidoses abnormal proteins deposit in bodily organs and severely impair their
      function, causing death if not treated effectively. Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is caused by
      a usually small population of plasma cells (the cells that produce antibodies). These cells
      produce part of antibodies, the light chains (LC) that form amyloid deposits. Almost every
      organ, with the exception of the brain, can be affected by AL amyloidosis. The heart is
      involved in three fourths of patients and is responsible for almost all the deaths occurring
      in the first 6 months after diagnosis. Current therapy of AL amyloidosis is based on drugs
      targeting the plasma cells producing the amyloid-forming LC. At present, most patients
      receive a powerful anti-plasma cell drug, bortezomib, as part of their initial treatment.
      However, bortezomib-based therapy, can improve heart involvement only in less than one third
      of patients with AL amyloidosis, and many patients (approximately one third) still die within
      12 months from diagnosis. Early cardiac deaths remain an acute unmet need and the major
      determinant of overall outcome in this disease. Thus, there is the need of alternative means
      to treat heart involvement in AL amyloidosis. Doxycycline is a widely used, well tolerated,
      antibiotic that has been marketed for decades and used to treat a number of different
      infectious diseases caused by bacteria. This molecule has been extensively studied in the
      laboratory, in animal models and, more recently, in small studies involving patients, for its
      potential of improving cardiac damage in amyloidosis. These studies showed that doxycycline
      disrupts amyloid deposits, reduces the amyloid load in a mouse model, and counteracts the
      toxicity exerted by amyloid-forming LCs on C. elegans, a worm whose pharynx is used as a
      model resembling human heart. In a small clinical study, doxycycline was given to patients
      with cardiac AL amyloidosis during treatment for their underlying plasma cell disease. This
      resulted in a remarkable improvement of survival compared to &quot;matched historical controls&quot;
      (i.e. similar patients who had received only anti-plasma cell therapy without doxycycline in
      the past). Based on these promising preliminary results, we designed the present clinical
      trial to assess whether the addition of doxycycline to anti-plasma cell therapy can improve
      survival in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis who were not previously treated. The rate of
      survival at 12 months will be compared in patients receiving doxycycline and in controls
      receiving standard antibiotic therapy, together with anti-plasma cell therapy. Patients will
      be assessed for parameters of plasma cell disease, heart involvement and possible involvement
      of other organs, as well as for quality of life. To make sure that patients who will receive
      doxycycline and those who will not have comparable severity of cardiac disease, patients will
      be stratified according to the stage of cardiac involvement. Patients with very advanced
      heart dysfunction will not be enrolled in the trial, because preliminary data indicate that
      doxycycline is of little or no benefit in these subjects. Patients will be randomized to
      receive doxycycline or standard antibiotics in combination with anti-plasma cell therapy.
      Bortezomib-based treatment directed against plasma cells will be delivered according to each
      participating institutions' guidelines. Doxycycline will be administered at a dosage of 100
      mg two times a day, which is usual in the treatment of bacterial diseases. Standard
      antibiotics will be delivered according to each participating institutions' guidelines
      (provided that drugs of the same class as doxycycline are not administered) in the control
      arm. Patients will be provided a diary to record possible adverse events and will be
      instructed accordingly. Patients will be evaluated at trial centers every 2 months for
      treatment efficacy and toxicity. In case of unsatisfactory response second-line therapy will
      be initiated. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, doxycycline administration will be
      continued for the entire duration of follow-up (12 months).
