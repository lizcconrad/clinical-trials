    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implement a standardized protocol to initiate nasal
      non-invasive ventilation with RAM nasal cannula (NIV/RAM-NC) with Trilogy mechanical
      ventilator at Children Memorial Hospital inpatient and outpatient sites, as well as to
      explore the side effects and complications associated with the use of NIV/RAM-NC in children.

    <description>Pediatric Pulmonary Team will be consulted on inpatient or outpatient patients that fail to wean from chronic respiratory support (CPAP, BiPAP, High flow Nasal Cannula) in whom long-term ventilation is considered. Pediatric Pulmonary Team, as a consultant, will consider patient history, physical examination, previous imaging and laboratories and previous attempts to wean from respiratory support and causes of failure to wean. The Pulmonary team will determine which patients would potentially benefit from use of NIV/RAM-NC for long-term respiratory support and will recommend initiation of NIV/RAM-NC.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children admitted to the Children Memorial Hermann Hospital and consulted to Pediatric

          -  Children who fail to wean from chronic respiratory support (CPAP, BiPAP, HFNC) in whom

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with minimal setting (CPAP &lt; 5cmH2O, HFNC &lt; 3LPM) able to be weaned to
             regular nasal cannula.

          -  Patients with upper airway obstruction that may be candidates for surgical procedure
             will be excluded.
