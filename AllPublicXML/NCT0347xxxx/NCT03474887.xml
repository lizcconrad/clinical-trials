  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND/SIGNIFICANCE: With developments in mobile health and the abundance of smartphones,
      online consultations have emerged as a popular form of primary care in Sweden. Controversy
      exists regarding diagnostic accuracy, appropriate prescription of antibiotics, and effects on
      care-seeking patient behavior following implementation of online consultations. As empirical
      research is lacking, the investigators seek to evaluate online primary care consultations
      compared to physical consultations with regards to non-inferiority of antibiotic prescription
      for chief complaint of sore throat.

      METHODS: Medical record data is used to identify patients with a chief complaint of sore
      throat, cough/common cold/influenza, or dysuria after choosing online (DIGI) or physical
      (PHYSI) consultations. A cohort of patients with similar chief complaints prior to
      implementation of online consultations was used as a control group (CONTROL). Prospective
      data from local registries and medical records was gathered 14 days the consultation. The
      primary outcome was rate of antibiotic prescription after sore throat. Secondary outcomes
      included patient revisits (including hospital admissions), patient satisfaction, time to
      physician contact, registered diagnosis, and documentation or Centor Criteria and Urinary
      Tract Infection (UTI)-Criteria.

      SIGNIFICANCE: Results will shed light on whether antibiotic prescription differs
      significantly between digital and physical primary care consultations. Hypotheses may also be
      generated as to how patients seek care in light of improved availability in a tax-sponsored
      healthcare system.
