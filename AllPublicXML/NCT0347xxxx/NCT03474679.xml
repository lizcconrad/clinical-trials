  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of ibrutinib in Japanese participants with
      steroid dependent/refractory chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) by measuring overall
      cGVHD response (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR] defined by National
      Institutes of Health [NIH] consensus development project criteria [2014]).

CR: Resolution of all manifestations in each organ or site. PR: Improvement in at least 1 organ or site without progression in any other organ or site. cGVHD Progression: Clinically meaningful worsening in 1 or more organs regardless of improvement in other organs.</description>

    <description>Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale is a participant-reported symptom scale. It includes a total of 30 items within the following 7 domains: Skin, eyes and mouth, breathing, eating and digestion, muscles and joints, energy, mental and emotional for evaluating overall response. Response options range from 0 to 4 and includes: &quot;not at all&quot; (0), &quot;Slightly&quot; (1), &quot;Moderately&quot; (2), &quot;Quite a bit&quot; (3), and &quot;extremely&quot; (4), and yield an overall score. A change greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 7 points on the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale will be considered significant and relates to improvement in quality of life (QoL).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>From signing Informed Consent Form until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (approximately up to 4.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Steroid dependent/refractory chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) defined at any
             time post-hematopoietic cell transplant (post-HCT) as: a) Dependent disease, defined
             as, when glucocorticoid (prednisolone doses greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 0.25
             milligram per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day)or &gt;=0.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg)
             every other day) are needed to prevent recurrence or progression of manifestations as
             demonstrated by unsuccessful attempts to taper the dose to lower levels on at least 2
             occasions, separated by at least 8 weeks b) Refractory disease, defined as, when cGVHD
             manifestations progress despite the use of a regimen containing glucocorticoid
             (prednisolone at &gt;=1 mg/kg/day for at least 1 week) or persist without improvement
             despite continued treatment with glucocorticoid (prednisolone at &gt;=0.5 mg/kg/day or 1
             mg/kg every other day) for at least 4 weeks

          -  Participants must be receiving baseline systemic glucocorticoid therapy for cGVHD at
             study entry. The dose of steroids must be stable for 14 days prior to starting
             ibrutinib

          -  At the time of trial enrollment, participants may be receiving other immunosuppressive
             therapies in addition to glucocorticoids. Immunosuppressant doses must be stable for
             14 days prior to starting ibrutinib

          -  Clinically stable or worsening cGVHD for a minimum of 14 days between screening and
             Day 1 cGVHD response assessment

          -  Karnofsky or Lansky (participants less than [&lt;]16 years) performance status &gt;=60

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active acute graft versus host disease (GVHD)

          -  More than 3 previous systemic treatments for cGVHD. Treatment with glucocorticoids is

             previous treatments

          -  History of treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (example [e.g.] imatinib),
             purine analogs, or other cancer chemotherapy in the 4 weeks prior to starting
             ibrutinib. Participants may have received ibrutinib pre-transplant for other reasons
             besides cGVHD such as for the treatment of leukemia or lymphoma

          -  History of treatment with monoclonal T and B cell antibodies in the 8 weeks prior to
             starting ibrutinib

          -  Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of ibrutinib
