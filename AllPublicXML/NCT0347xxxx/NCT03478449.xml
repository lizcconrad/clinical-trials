  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is intending to provide the optimal procedures of lymph node sorting
      for pathological examination after curative surgery for gastric cancer, which can
      discriminate the differences of the status of lymph node metastasis, pTNM classification and
      prognostic outcome of gastric cancer patients.

    <description>In this study, intervention methods include two kinds of lymph node sorting for pathological examination in gastric cancer samples after curative surgery. One is the fine sorting lymph nodes, representing the lymph nodes should be sorted one by one from the tissues around the stomach, celiac axis, and the main brunches of celiac axis. The other is the group sorting lymph nodes, representing the lymph nodes should be simply sorted in the soft tissues around the stomach, celiac axis, and the main brunches of celiac axis.</description>
