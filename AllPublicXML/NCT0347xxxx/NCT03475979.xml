      Study Purpose:

      A multicenter prospective study to evaluate the outcome of second breast cancer surveillance
      with abbreviated breast MR (AB-MR) or ultrasound (US) in addition to annual mammography in
      women with BRCA1/2 mutation testing

      Study Scheme:

        -  AB-MR, US, and digital mammography will be performed on the same day and interpreted
           independently at baseline and then after 1 year.

        -  After completion of study, patients are followed-up for at least 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For women with a BRCA1/2 mutation who are treated for breast cancer, screening of remaining
      breast tissue with annual mammography and breast MRI is recommended. For women who met BRCA
      testing criteria but show an uninformative negative result or a variant of unknown
      significance (VUS) result, there is no established recommendation for second breast cancer
      surveillance.

      Abbreviated breast MRI (AB-MR) is a fast and low-cost examination that show equivalent
      diagnostic accuracy to that of the standardized dynamic protocol breast MRI. Breast
      ultrasound (US) can detect additional cancers that are occult on mammography and is indicated
      in high-risk patients who cannot tolerate MRI.

      The purpose of this multicenter prospective study is to evaluate the outcome of second breast
      cancer surveillance with AB-MR or US in addition to annual mammography in women with BRCA1/2
      mutation testing.

      AB-MR, US, and digital mammography will be performed on the same day at baseline and then
      after 1 year and images will be interpreted independently according to the Breast Imaging
      Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) by experienced radiologists. The BI-RADS category 3 or
      higher is defined as test-positive. The reference standard will be a biopsy or at least 1
      year of follow-up.
