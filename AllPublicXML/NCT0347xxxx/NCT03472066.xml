  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of precancerous lesions of the cervix by conization has been shown to increase the
      risk of premature delivery and premature rupture of the membranes. It has now been clearly
      established that the cervix is a growing organ during adolescence and early adulthood, It has
      been hypothetized that cervical conization during the growth phase reduced its growth
      potential, and induced shorter cervix during the upcoming pregnancy. No studies have been
      conducted investigating the age at which conization no longer had an impact on cervical size
      during pregnancy. This will help to identify the age at conisation below which patients will
      be identified as being at risk event, and thus offer increased monitoring and possibly
      prophylactic management by programmed strapping. We propose to measure the length of the
      cervix of pregnant patients who have benefited from conization, which is currently
      recommended by the Collège National des Gynécologues Obstetriciens Français .In addition, the
      investigators will use a control group consisting of non-con conical, parity-matched pregnant
      patients in whom a cervical measurement will also be performed.

        Including 84 evaluable patients for the primary endpoint would show a Pearson correlation
        of at least 0.3 between cervical size and age at conization. These calculations were
        carried out with a 5% risk of first bilateral species and 80% power. Taking into account
        the risk of incomplete data, we plan to include 90 patients. A control group of 90 patients
        will also be recruited.
