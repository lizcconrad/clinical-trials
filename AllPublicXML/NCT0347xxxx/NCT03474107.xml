  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the overall survival (OS) of participants with
      locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer treated with enfortumab vedotin (EV) to the
      OS of participants treated with chemotherapy.

      This study will also compare progression-free survival on study therapy (PFS1); the overall
      response rate (ORR) and the disease control rate (DCR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.1 of participants treated with EV to participants treated with
      chemotherapy.

      In addition, this study will evaluate the duration of response (DOR) per RECIST V1.1 of EV
      and chemotherapy and assess the safety and tolerability of EV, as well as, the quality of
      life (QOL) and Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) parameters.

    <description>The QLQ-C30 was developed to measure aspects of Quality of Life (QoL) pertinent to participants with a broad range of cancers who are participating in clinical trials. The current version of the core instrument (QLQ-C30, Version 3) is a 30-item questionnaire consisting of the following: functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea &amp; vomiting); single items for symptoms (shortness of breath, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhea) and financial impact of the disease; and 2 global items (health, overall QoL). Questions 1-28 range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much); questions 29-30 range from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent).</description>

    <measure>Patient reported outcome assessed by quality of life: EuroQOL 5-dimensions (EQ-5D -5L) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a generic, preference-based measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item self-reported measure of functioning and wellbeing, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples.</description>
