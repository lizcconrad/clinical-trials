  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, 4-visit, double-masked, 2x3 bilateral crossover, dispensing
      trial. The study lenses will be worn as daily wear (DW) for a period of two weeks each with
      one of the study lenses being worn twice. Each study lens is expected to be worn at least
      five (5) days per week for at least six (6) hours per day worn. There will be no washout
      period between study lenses.

    <time_frame>2 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint overall comfort scores will be assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)™ questionnaire at the two-week follow-up. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the
             study:

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.

               2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical
                  protocol.

               3. Healthy adult males or females age ≥18 years of age with signed informed consent.

               4. Eligible presbyopes will be those that wear full distance contact lenses in both
                  eyes, then wear reading glasses over them.

               5. The subject is a current spherical soft contact lens wearer (defined as a minimum
                  of 6 hours of DW per day, at least 5 days per week, for a minimum of 1 month
                  prior to the study) and willing to wear the study lenses on a similar basis.

               6. Subjects must be able and willing to wear the study lenses at least 6 hours a
                  day, a minimum of 5 days per week.

               7. The subject's vertex-corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be
                  in the range of -1.00 to -6.00 (inclusive) in each eye.

               8. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤ -1.00 D in each eye.

               9. Have spherocylindrical best corrected visual acuity of 20/25+3 or better in each
                  eye.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from
             participating in the study:

               1. Currently pregnant or lactating.

               2. Any active or ongoing systemic disease (e.g., Sjögren's Syndrome), allergies,
                  infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis), contagious immunosuppressive
                  diseases (e.g., HIV), autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), or other
                  bodily diseases or infections, by self-report, which are known to interfere with
                  contact lens wear and/or participation in the study.

               3. Use of systemic medications (e.g., chronic steroid use) that are known to
                  interfere with contact lens wear. Habitual medications taken by successful
                  contact lens wearers are generally considered acceptable.

               4. Habitual toric, extended wear, or multifocal contact lens wear.

               5. Any current use of ocular medication.

               6. Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to Optifree PureMoist.

               7. Any previous, or planned (during the course of the study) ocular surgery (e.g.,
                  radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.).

               8. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14
                  days prior to study enrollment.

               9. Employee or immediate family member of an employee of clinical site (e.g.,
                  Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).

              10. Any active or ongoing ocular allergies, infections or other ocular abnormalities
                  that are known to interfere with contact lens wear and/or participation in the
                  study. This may include, but not be limited to entropion, ectropion, extrusions,
                  chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions,
                  aphakia, or corneal distortion.

              11. Any Grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal
                  neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival
                  injection) on the FDA slit-lamp scale.

              12. Binocular vision abnormality or strabismus.

              13. Any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal inflammatory
                  event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular
                  abnormality that would contraindicate contact lens wear.
