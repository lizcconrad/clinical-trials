  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty is very important in terms of range of motion of
      the knee, muscle power, normal gait, pain control and consequently the patient's
      satisfaction. Convectional rehabilitation methods in assist of therapist required high demand
      of resources. Recently, outpatient clinic or tele-communication tool based rehabilitations
      were investigated and reported equivalent results. However, those methods also required group
      or one-to-one facing that restricted availability of the exercise.

      With development of the motion tracking technology, new device that gives real time feedback
      with augmented reality images can be used for rehabilitation in home-based setting.

      This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes after the rehabilitation by interactive
      home-based device or conventional inpatient setting.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this work is to compare the pain, stiffness, function and satisfaction
      between groups at 6 months after the total knee arthroplasty.

      The investigators hypothesized that the clinical outcomes of rehabilitation by interactive
      home-based device are not inferior than that by conventional inpatient setting.

      The study design is a single-blind non-randomized controlled trial. Patients takes different
      rehabilitation method but the outcome assessor is blinded. The clinical outcome is compared
      at preoperative, postoperative 6weeks, 3months. And clinical outcome consists of Range of
      Motion (ROM), WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index ) score, Knee
      Society Score, Time-up-go (TUG) test.
