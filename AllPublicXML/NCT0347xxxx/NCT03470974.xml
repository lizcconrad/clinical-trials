      This study aims to investigate the relationship among self-efficacy, anxiety, depressive
      symptoms, quality of life, lifestyle, heart rate variability and blood pressure control; and
      to examine the effects of self-titration strategy on self-efficacy, anxiety, depressive
      symptoms,heart rate variability, sodium excretion, lifestyle modification,quality of life,
      and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension.

      Background: Hypertension is the major cause of mortality for the cardiac, vascular and renal
      disease. The effective control of elevated blood pressure may reduce the damages of several
      target organs. World Health Organization points out &quot;Innovation and Empowerment for health&quot;.
      The self-titration strategy may empower patients to self-control their diseases, share
      decision-making and increase their ability to self-management their situations and improve
      their home blood pressure.

      Methods: This experimental study included 222 hypertensive patients from outpatient services
      of cardiology departments of a medical center in northern Taiwan. We randomly divided the 72
      patients into the experimental group (n=111) and control group (n=111). The experimental
      group received self-titration strategy training and lifestyle modification education; the
      control group received usual care and lifestyle modification education.

      Data were collected for self-efficacy, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, lifestyle and
      health-related quality of life using self-report questionnaires. Heart rate variability was
      measured with CheckMyHeart device (DailyCare BioMedical, Chungli, Taiwan). Patients evaluated
      their home blood pressure by corrected sphygmomanometer. We used the generalized estimating
      equation to evaluate the effects of the intervention.

      Purpose: Primary outcome to evaluate the effects of self-titration strategy on the
      improvement of home blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Secondary outcomes to
      evaluate the effects of self-titration strategy on the improvement of self-efficacy, anxiety,
      depressive symptoms and lifestyle quality of life in patients with hypertension.

    <description>The self-titration strategy allows patients or medical professionals to adjust their medicine (additional, maintain, or decrease dose) depending on a bespoke plan. The bespoke plan for hypertensive patients involves setting target blood pressure, self-monitoring blood pressure, recording blood pressure readings and constructing a medication titration schedule. Each medication titration step is conducted based on the average home BP measurement readings.</description>
