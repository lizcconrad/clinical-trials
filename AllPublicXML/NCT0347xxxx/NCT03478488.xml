  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group multi-center study of Phase 3 study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of KN035 compared to standard of care (SOC) Gemcitabine-based
      chemotherapies in the treatment of participants with previously untreated locally advanced or
      metastatic biliary tract cancer.

      The primary hypothesis of this study is that participants will have a longer overall Survival
      (OS) when treated with combined therapy than SOC.
