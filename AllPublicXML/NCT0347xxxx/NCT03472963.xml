  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if the uptake of anti-HIV medications called
      Genvoya® and darunavir is different at several body sites, including mucosal tissues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV. The
      majority of MSM acquire HIV after exposure to the rectal mucosa through unprotected receptive
      anal intercourse. Post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP) is an intervention that is used to prevent
      HIV infection soon (72 hours) after a potential exposure. HIV-negative people with a possible
      exposure to HIV are instructed to take 28 days of a combination anti-HIV medication regimen,
      Truvada® + Raltegravir. This study is being conducted to determine if the uptake of other
      anti-HIV medications called Genvoya® and darunavir is different at several body sites,
      including mucosal tissues. These other medications might be considered for PEP regimens in
      the future.
