  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two doses (475 mg and 950 mg) of Sideritis Scardica (SS or 'mountain tea') are investigated
      for cognitive, mood, blood pressure and cerebral blood flow effects in a healthy group of
      50-70 yr olds, both acutely and following 28 days of consumption.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of polyphenols such as ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid and apigenin in Sideritis
      Scardica (SS or 'mountain tea') are likely responsible for the cognitive and mood effects of
      its consumption and this could be underpinned by the ability of such polyphenols to prevent
      monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake and to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF).

      The current randomised, placebo controlled, parallel groups study extends on the
      abovementioned small amount of literature; assessing both cognitive and mood outcomes in a
      sample of older (50-70 yrs) adults, as well as blood pressure (BP) and CBF, in a sub-sample,
      utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The above will be assessed acutely (pre-dose and
      90- and 310-mins post dose) on day 1 and following 28 days consumption of either a placebo
      control, and active control of 240 mg ginkgo biloba, 475 mg SS or 950 mg SS.

    <description>Acute and chronic change in cognitive function via the following cognitive tasks: numeric working memory, choice reaction time, corsi blocks, serial 3 and 7 subtractions, rapid visual information processing, peg and ball, name to face recall, picture recognition, word recognition, immediate word recall and delayed word recall.

    <description>Blood flow changes measured in the pre-frontal cortex utilizing Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Outcome measures include; oxygen saturation, oxygenated haemoglobin, deoxygenated haemoglobin and total haemoglobin.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mood</measure>
    <time_frame>On day 1 and following 28 days of consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Acute and chronic changes in mood as assessed by the State-Trait anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983) and Bond-Lader (1974) visual analogue scales. For both measures a baseline score is calculated and all subsequent post-dose scores are subtracted from this to produce change (change from baseline) scores. Both the STAI and Bond-Lader scales produce numerical values and the outcome measure for both will be the same; i.e. changes in this numerical value from baseline mood.</description>
