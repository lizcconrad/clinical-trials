      Investigators aim to directly investigate the molecular properties of bacteria from tracheal
      and urinary samples routinely taken in intensive care units (ICU) patients.

      Investigators goal is to determine major bacterial activities and properties in the infected
      patient as a basis for more targeted, efficient antimicrobial discovery. Investigators will
      determine the abundance of dozens to hundreds of pathogen proteins in the samples and in in
      vitro cultures of the same pathogen strains using cutting-edge ultra-sensitive proteomics
      approaches (Parallel reaction Monitoring (PRM), Sequential Windowed Acquisition of All
      Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS). Data will be analyzed using dedicated mass
      spectrometry and proteomics packages using parametric and non-parametric statistics (false
      discovery rate determination based on decoy databases; t-tests of log-transformed abundance
      data with Benjamin-Hochberg corrections for multiple testing, normal distribution of the data
      will be evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

      Based on experience from in vitro and animal infection experiments, a sample size of 10 can
      reveal 2fold differences in protein abundance among 500 top proteins at a significance of α =
      0.05 and a power of β = 0.8 (after correction for multiple testing). However, it is possible
      that human patient samples have higher variance compared to animal infection models.
      Investigators will thus use a sequential statistics approach in which they continuously
      adjust sample size estimates based on the variance of the accumulating data. It may be
      possible that no sufficient sample sizes for all bacterial pathogens of interest will be
      reached within two years.
