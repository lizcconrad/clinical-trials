    <textblock>
      Rationale: For locally advanced esophageal cancer the standard treatment consists of 5 weeks
      of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery.1 Surgery is currently performed
      independent of the response to nCRT and is associated with substantial morbidity. Prior
      knowledge of the eventual response to nCRT would greatly impact on the optimal care for many
      esophageal cancer patients for two imperative reasons:

      Firstly, it is argued that patients who achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR, 28-34%)
      may not have benefitted from surgery. Consequently, proper identification of pathological
      complete responders prior to surgery could yield an organ-preserving regimen avoiding
      unnecessary toxicity.

      Secondly, non-responders are exposed to the side effects of nCRT without showing any tumor
      regression. Early identification of the non-responders during nCRT would be beneficial for
      this group as ineffective therapy could be stopped, and for who altered treatment strategies
      could be explored.

      Objective: To develop a model that predicts the probability of pathologic complete response
      to nCRT in esophageal cancer, by integrating diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      (DW-MRI) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in conjunction
      with combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography
      (18F-FDG PET-CT) scans acquired prior to, during and after administration of nCRT.

      Study design: Multi-center observational study

      Study population: Patients (&gt;18 years) with potentially resectable locally advanced squamous
      cell- or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction, receiving nCRT prior
      to surgery.

      Intervention: In addition to the standard diagnostic work-up for esophageal cancer that
      includes a 18F-FDG PET-CT scan at diagnosis and after nCRT, one 18F-FDG PET-CT scans will be
      performed during nCRT, as well as three MRI scans (before, during and after nCRT) within
      fixed time intervals. Furthermore, after response imaging after nCRT has been performed, but
      prior to surgery, patients will undergo (on an opt-out basis) an endoscopy and/or endoscopic
      ultrasonography (EUS) with biopsies of the primary tumor site, other suspected lesions and
      suspected lymph nodes. Furthermore, blood samples will be collected at five time points.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: An accurate prediction model for the patients' individual
      probability of pathologic complete response after nCRT, based on the quantitative parameters
      derived from a longitudinal series of DW-MRI, DCE-MRI and 18F-FDG PET-CT datasets.
