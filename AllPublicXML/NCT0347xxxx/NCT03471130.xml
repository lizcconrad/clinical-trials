             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs; or which may jeopardise the subject in
             case or participation in the study. The Investigator should be guided by evidence of
             any of the following histories:

               1. Inflammatory bowel syndrome, gastritis, ulcers, GI or rectal bleeding
