  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme deficiency results in severe combined immunodeficiency
      (SCID), a fatal autosomal recessive inherited immune disorder. Strimvelis (or GSK2696273) is
      a gene therapy intended for patients with ADA-SCID and for whom no suitable human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) matched related stem cell donor is available. This therapy aims to restore ADA
      function in hematopoietic cell lineages, and in doing so prevents the pathology caused by
      purine metabolites (i.e., impaired immune function). This registry will evaluate the long
      term safety and effectiveness outcomes of subjects who have received Strimvelis (or
      GSK2696273).

    <description>The Peds-QL is a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population. It captures the following domains: general health/activities, feelings/emotional, social functioning, school functioning. Higher scores indicate better quality of life (QOL) for all domains of the Peds-QL. This modular instrument uses a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. 4 dimensions (physical, emotional, social, &amp; school functioning) are scored</description>

    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgement will be categorized as SAE</description>
