        Patients who are prescribed Deltyba速 per prescribing information (PI) for the purpose of
        treatment can be included.

        The expected number of patients during the enrollment period is 248 patients based on the
        number of patients who might be taking Deltyba, which was estimated considering annual mean
        change rate from 2009 to 2014 and the rate of patients who had no resistance to pulmonary
        MDR-TB therapies2, 3.

        Therefore, the target number of subjects is about 150, which is 60 % of the number of
        patients who are expected to take Deltyba during the registration period (n=248).

        The number of subjects may vary from one investigator to another.
