  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to estimate the incidence and recovery of aphasia, dysarthria
      and dysphagia in an acute setting (first week) with the NIHSS sub-item scores for language
      and speech and a dysphagia screening.

      Furthermore, we will evaluate the severity of aphasia, dysarthria and dysphagia in an acute
      setting (first few days) with standardized measurements (ScreeLing, BNT, NSVO-Z, perceptual
      assessment, MASA/FOIS).

      To evaluate the effect of early IVT/EVT in patients with ischemic stroke on functional
      outcomes for language and speech via the NIHSS scale.

      Study population:

      Patients who are admitted to the acute Stroke Unit of the University Hospital Ghent will be
      recruited.

      Study course:

      The study has a prospective, observational design, with each participant receiving regular
      standard of care as follows: patients will undergo a clinical examination by a staff
      neurologists or the present attending in the emergency room. Tailored medical treatment will
      be given to each patient considering the type of stroke etc. as is standard of care (e.g.
      thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy for patients with ischemic stroke). Patients that are stable
      enough are transferred to the Stroke Unit where the neurologist or attending of the unit will
      reassess all stroke patients. NIHSS scores will be reported at least at day 2 +/- 1. A
      dysphagia screening is performed by the Stroke Unit nurses when the patient arrives at the
      Stroke Unit. The scores of the sub-items language and speech of the NIHSS and the dysphagia
      screening combined with a general screening by a speech language pathologist will be used to
      confirm or discard aphasia, dysphagia and dysarthria (incidence). When aphasia, dysarthria
      and/or dysphagia is confirmed, standardized tests will be performed. For this study, data of
      the following tests will be included for analysis: ScreeLing and/or BNT (aphasia), NSVO-Z and
      a perceptual assessment (dysarthria), MASA and/or the FOIS (dysphagia). At day 7 +/- 1, NIHSS
      scores will be reassessed (recovery in time). The diagnostic assessments and the NIHSS
      sub-items speech/language will be used to investigate the severity and recovery of the
      symptoms in time. Reports of the neurological clinical examination at follow-up will be
      retrospectively investigated if possible for additional information about recovery in time.

      The total duration of data collection will be approximately 1 week and if possible three
      months follow-up.

    <description>Incidence is based on the National Institute for Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), subscale 9. The NIHSS is used to quantify the impairment in patients after stroke. For the incidence of aphasia, subscale 9 of the NIHSS scale is used (best language). It investigates whether a patient has aphasia and what degree if present. Scores on this subscale range from 0 (= normal) to 3 (= mute/global aphasia)</description>
