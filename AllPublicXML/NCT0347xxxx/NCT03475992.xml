  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trialed investigational medical imaging device is a low-power microwave breast imaging
      system for cancer screening purposes. It is an active device which uses non-ionizing
      radiation.

      Microwave imaging is an emerging imaging modality for the early detection of the breast
      cancer. The physical basis of microwave imaging is the dielectric contrast between healthy
      and cancerous breast tissues at microwave frequencies. Microwave imaging can potentially be
      used for monitoring neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment, breast health monitoring, and for
      routine screening and diagnosis of the breast cancer at the early-stage. The non-invasive and
      the non-ionizing characteristics of microwaves should allow for frequent scans of the breast
      using microwave imaging, unlike X-ray mammography. In addition to safety, microwave imaging
      does not require uncomfortable breast compression and it is potentially a lower-cost
      modality.

      This is a first-in-human clinical test of the investigational device, which has been so far
      tested only with experimental phantoms modelling the human female breast.

      The clinical data that will be collected in the context of this study is intended to provide
      early safety information for the investigational medical imaging device. In addition, this
      exploratory data will guide the refinement of the device hardware and the imaging algorithm
      design, before decision to proceed (or not) with further clinical tests.

      Furthermore, this study will be used to guide sample size calculation for a subsequent study
      designed to evaluate efficacy should that appear warranted once this study is completed.

      This is a single-site early-phase pilot clinical study, taking place at Galway University
      Hospital/HRB Clinical Research Facility, Galway. The study is orientated to women presenting
      to the symptomatic breast unit with a palpable breast lump.

      Patients have a conventional history and breast examinations (Mammogram and / or Ultrasound
      and Clinical assessment) performed by the physician, as per normal practice in the
      Symptomatic Breast Unit of University Hospital Galway.

      Patients willing to participate provide informed consent on the day of presentation for their
      triple assessment. The physician discusses the trial in detail with the patient. Following
      detailed discussion, the patient is invited to participate in the study. The physician
      explains to the patient that she may or may not be enrolled, depending on the outcome of her
      triple assessment.

      The investigational medical imaging device consists of two subsystems, both performing a
      non-invasive examination:

        -  the Microwave Breast Imaging subsystem (MBI subsystem);

        -  the Optical Breast Contour Detection subsystem (OBCD subsystem);

      The MBI subsystem is an active device which uses non-ionizing radiation. It illuminates the
      breast with low-power electromagnetic waves in the microwave frequency spectrum, which
      penetrate the breast under examination. The subsystem collects the scattered electromagnetic
      waves and recovers useful information on the breast tissue consistency, given the dielectric
      contrast of these tissues.

      Multi-static radar detection technology is employed in the MBI subsystem for breast image
      formation.The well-established Microwave Vision Group (MVG) technology for fast antenna
      measurement, using multiple sensors in a vertical arch configuration, has been transposed to
      a horizontal arch of sensors. In addition, vertical translation of the horizontal arch has
      been enabled, such that 3D multi-static short-range radar imaging is possible.

      The sensors are in contact with a cylindrical container filled with a liquid; the so-called
      coupling liquid has been designed to have electromagnetic (EM) properties appropriately
      selected such that the EM wave penetration in the breast is maximized.

      During the MBI scan, the patient is lying in a face down position on a special bed,
      integrated with the MBI subsystem. The breast under examination is immersed in the coupling
      liquid, through a dedicated circular opening of the bed. The breast is then scanned. This
      vertical scan takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete, depending on the size of each
      breast.

      In order to compute the required volume of coupling liquid, such that the container of the
      MBI subsystem is optimally filled after immersion of the breast, a simple process for optical
      assessment of the total volume of the breast takes place just before starting the MBI scan.

      The Optical Breast Contour Detection (OBCD) subsystem serves to provide the total volume of
      the breast, and also its external contour, as a priori information to the MBI subsystem. The
      OBCD subsystem consists of a 3D optical camera placed below the examination table, at a
      distance of several tens of centimetres below the breast. An azimuthal scan of the 3D camera
      permits to reconstruct the external surface of the breast.

      In order for the breast contour to be a useful a priori information for the MBI subsystem, it
      is important that the patient is lying in the same face down position during both the MBI and
      OBCD scans. Thus, an identical examination table, as the one integrated with the MBI
      subsystem, is also integrated with the OBCD subsystem.During the OBCD scan, the patient is
      lying on the examination table, with her breast under examination inserted in the circular
      opening of the examination table. For this scan, there is no coupling liquid; the breast is
      in the air, hanging below the examination table.

      Both the breast bearing the palpable lump and the contralateral breast are scanned. The
      contralateral breast scan serves as control in the data analysis.

      The total duration of the microwave breast investigation (including OBCD scan of both breasts
      for breast volume assessment, preparation of the MBI subsystem, MBI scan of both breasts, and
      data verification) does not exceed 1 hour.

      MBI data analysis is performed off-line and is expected to be completed few months after the
      end-date of data collection.The written radiology reports from conventional imaging are
      acquired and used as reference data to evaluate the performance of the MBI subsystem in terms
      of detecting and estimating the size and consistency of the breast lump.

      The patients are followed up 7 days after the microwave breast investigation or before
      surgery, whichever comes first.

      The patients are assessed for their experience of the microwave breast investigation, and for
      adverse events.
