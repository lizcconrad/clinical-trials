    <textblock>
      This study will examine the prevalence of four previously identified non-motor markers in a
      population of cervical dystonia patients, unaffected family members, and healthy volunteers
      in an attempt to identify a distinct combination of non-motor symptoms that may be indicative
      of disease development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to identify the prevalence of four previously identified
      non-motor markers - (1) spatial discrimination threshold, (2) temporal discrimination
      threshold, (3) vibration-induced illusion of movement, and (4) kinesthesia - in a population
      of cervical dystonia patients, unaffected family members, and healthy volunteers (control
      group). Consenting participants will receive a neurological examination performed by a
      movement disorders neurologist, followed by an assessment of the four non-motor symptoms.

      The investigators hypothesize that a distinct combination of non-motor symptoms will be more
      prevalent in the CD group, and therefore this set of symptoms may be indicative of disease
      development. This combination will be identified through analysis of the concurrence of the
      non-motor features across the three groups of participants. This study will fill an important
      unmet need, as to the investigators' knowledge there are no published studies assessing the
      comorbid presentation of these four non-motor symptoms in a single cervical dystonia
      population. The exploration of a distinct combination of concurrent non-motor symptoms as a
      marker for the development of cervical dystonia will improve the ability of movement
      disorders neurologists to diagnose the condition.

      The results of this study will facilitate the investigators' longstanding aim of improving
      rates of cervical dystonia diagnosis. Cervical dystonia is currently diagnosed based upon the
      exclusion of other movement disorders; therefore, characterization of non-motor features in
      cervical dystonia patients will help to refine the diagnostic criteria for this condition.
      This investigation will also improve understanding of the factors associated with CD. Future
      studies can examine the source of these associated factors in order to help understand the
      cause of CD, since the etiology is currently unknown.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>For participants in all groups, the investigators will examine the prevalence of spatial discrimination threshold. Prevalence of spatial discrimination threshold will be determined with a task using Johnson-Van-Boven-Phillips (JVP) domes. The spatial discrimination threshold will be recorded as the mean of both hands at the 75% level of accuracy. The research coordinator will report prevalence of spatial discrimination threshold as a descriptive statistic.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>For participants in all groups, the investigators will examine the prevalence of temporal discrimination threshold. Prevalence of temporal discrimination threshold will be determined with a visual-visual discrimination task.The research coordinator will report prevalence of temporal discrimination threshold as a descriptive statistic.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>For participants in all groups, the investigators will examine the prevalence of vibration-induced illusion of movement. Prevalence of vibration-induced illusion of movement will be determined by recording the change in displacement of the tracking arm during a vibration-induced illusion of movement task. The research coordinator will report prevalence of vibration-induced illusion of movement as a descriptive statistic.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>For participants in all groups, the investigators will examine the prevalence of impaired kinesthesia. Kinesthesia will be determined by a neurologist during the neurological examination. The research coordinator will report prevalence of impaired kinesthesia as a descriptive statistic.</description>

    <measure>Probability of concurrence of multiple non-motor features</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>The concurrence of multiple non-motor symptoms will be assessed using a multinomial logistic regression model to determine if a distinct combination of non-motor symptoms is more prevalent in the cervical dystonia patient group than in the unaffected family members or healthy volunteer groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Potential new demographic indicators of cervical dystonia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of demographic factors will be performed to identify additional environmental factors that are more prevalent in the CD patient population than in healthy controls and unaffected family members. Through exploration of potential new indicators, the investigators hope to progress the long-term goal of improving the rate of cervical dystonia diagnosis.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Potential new medical indicators of cervical dystonia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of medical history and specific elements of the neurological examination will be performed to identify additional symptoms and environmental factors that are more prevalent in the CD patient population than in healthy controls and unaffected family members. Emphasis will be placed on sensory tricks, as previous studies and clinical experience have shown that patients often use sensory tricks such as touching the face, hand, or neck to temporarily relieve muscle contraction. Through exploration of potential new indicators, the investigators hope to progress the long-term goal of improving the rate of cervical dystonia diagnosis.</description>
