  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center trial that will be conducted at Shanghai
      Ninth People's Hospital, Renji Hospital and Xinhua Hospital. In this study, the investigators
      aim to establish the HVPG using biofluid mechanics (HVPGBFM) model using biofluid mechanics
      methods and validate the HVPGBFM model. First, in the original cohort, the investigators will
      use some of the patients' clinical data to establish and improve the HVPGBFM model; then, in
      the validation cohort, the investigators will calculate the HVPGBFM of the other patients,
      compare the HVPGBFM and HVPG, and assess the model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is mainly divided into two stages:

        1. Establishment and improvement of the HVPGBFM model: 79 patients will be enrolled to the
           study as an original cohort. Biofluid mechanics specialists will calculate patients'
           HVPGBFM after HVPG measurements according to patients' blood test, Doppler ultrasound
           and computed tomography results. Biofluid mechanics specialists will know patients' HVPG
           in this cohort. Weighting factors and parameters of the model will be adjusted to reduce
           the difference between HVPGBFM and HVPG.

        2. Assessment of the HVPGBFM model: at least 16 patients will be enrolled to the study as a
           validation cohort. Biofluid mechanics specialists will make no changes to the model and
           will calculate patients' HVPGBFM after HVPG measurements according to patients' blood
           test, Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography results. Biofluid mechanics specialists
           will not know patients' HVPG in this cohort. And the investigators will compare the
           HVPGBFM and HVPG to make assessment of the HVPGBFM model.

      HVPG measurements will be performed after finishing blood test, Doppler ultrasound and
      computed tomography; and specialists for HVPG measurements will not have access to patients'
      clinical data to prevent certain biases. Blood test, Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography
      and HVPG measurements will be performed within 5 days and treatments that may affect HVPG
      will be avoided during this possess.
