    <description>The Investigators defined Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) as
any treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or greater,
grade 3 or greater immune-mediated toxic effects (defined as an inflammatory process that compromised the function of any organ and was not attributable to another cause) that had the potential to be life threatening with continuation of therapy,
immune-mediated toxic effects that did not resolve or improved to grade 2 or less within 14 days of onset</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>85 days</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. Confirmed CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study ≥4 weeks after initial documentation of response.
Pilot efficacy assessment is not the primary objective of this study and will be conducted by surrogate endpoints describing the direct antitumor effect of the drug.</description>
