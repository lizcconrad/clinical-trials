  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide, and contributes to approximately 750,000
      hospitalizations per year, a third of which may die. International guidelines recommend
      timely interventions, including cultures, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. Following
      guideline bundles is associated with a decrease in mortality. Key to timely intervention is
      timely diagnosis.

      Using the Epic sepsis predictive analytic tool, investigators will trigger vital sign and
      delirium monitoring in patients determined to be at increased risk for developing future
      sepsis.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate reduced mortality in patients for whom
      the pre-sepsis algorithm threshold is met, and who enhanced monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A means to identify patients before they become ill may improve the effectiveness of
      established therapies.Epic's electronic medical record (Epic systems, Verona, WI) contains a
      surveillance tool that uses predictive analytics to identify patients at risk of becoming
      septic four hours after the alert becomes active. This affords the opportunity to intervene
      sooner, but it remains unclear what the best course of action should be in a population at
      risk of sepsis, only some of which may go on to develop the illness. We propose an automatic
      intervention, consisting of enhanced monitoring, that is tied to the alert. No therapeutics
      will be mandated. Instead, additional monitoring information will lead to faster diagnosis
      and therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.
