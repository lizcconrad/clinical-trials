    <textblock>
      Bladder spasms after spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in incontinence, urinary tract
      infections, kidney damage, trigger dangerous increases in blood pressure and decrease
      independence and quality of life. The investigators' long-term goal is to develop and provide
      a &quot;bladder pacemaker&quot; able to restore bladder continence for Veterans with SCI. Electrical
      stimulation of sensory nerves can stop bladder spasms during a doctor visit. However, this
      approach has not been tested during long term home use. This proposal will 1) determine how
      well sensory stimulation reduces incontinence and improves quality of life for Veterans with
      SCI during 1 year of home use, and 2) produce an effective take home system that can be used
      by more Veterans and other VAs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical problem of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (bladder hyper-reflexia) is among
      the most serious problems encountered by Veterans with neurologic injuries such as spinal
      cord injury (SCI). The majority of persons with SCI suffer from neurogenic bladder (73%) and
      only 17% of persons with traumatic SCI manage their bladders with voluntary micturition. The
      investigators' long-term goal is to develop and clinically implement a &quot;bladder pacemaker&quot;
      able to restore bladder continence for Veterans with spinal cord injury (SCI). This proposal
      will 1) determine the long-term effectiveness of genital nerve stimulation (GNS) to
      chronically ( 1 year) reduce urinary incontinence and improve quality of life for Veterans
      with SCI, and 2) develop and produce an effective take home GNS system that can be used by
      more Veterans, given to Veterans at the end of the study and used in future multi-VA studies.

      The rationale for studying chronic GNS is based on the demonstration in humans with SCI that
      abnormal hyper-reflexive bladder contractions can be acutely inhibited and bladder capacity
      acutely increased using GNS. The peripheral and easily accessible location of the dorsal
      genital nerve (DGN) allows surface stimulation and therefore provides the potential for a
      less complicated surgical intervention than is currently available, increasing the number of
      individuals who could benefit from bladder control neural prostheses. While GNS has been
      demonstrated to be effective acutely by multiple groups, relatively few groups have attempted
      to test this approach for more than a day.

    <description>Study participants in this arm will use take-home genital nerve stimulation for 24+ months in order to assess its effectiveness at decreasing urinary incontinence. In order to set effective genital nerve stimulation parameters, study participants will undergo clinical urodynamics every 6 months in which sensitivity to and tolerance of electrical stimulation are assessed.</description>

    <intervention_name>Genital Nerve Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Genital nerve stimulation activates sensory afferents that travel through the pudendal nerves and enters the spinal cord through the sacral dorsal root ganglia. Inhibitory spinal reflex pathways are activated, causing increased sympathetic outflow through the inferior mesenteric ganglion and hypogastric nerve and also decreased parasympathetic efferent drive through the pelvic nerve, resulting in inhibited bladder contractions.</description>
