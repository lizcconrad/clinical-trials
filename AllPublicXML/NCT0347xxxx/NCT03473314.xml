  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open labeled Study (NCT03331445) is demonstrating encouraging safety and efficacy results
      for most subjects receiving 160ppm nitric oxide gas (gNO) for treatment of non-tuberculous
      mycobacteria (NTM) over a 15 day treatment regimen. In one subject, who had a reduction in
      sputum culture concentration of Bacterium bolletii from plus 3 to plus 1 corresponding to a
      2-3 log10 cfu/gm reduction during the treatment, the one-week post treatment follow-up sputum
      culture had increased to plus 2. It is hypothesized that a longer treatment period may be
      necessary to fully eradicate NTM from the sputum culture in chronic lung disease. This study
      will extend the period of gNO exposure for a prolonged period of time (3 months) to attempt
      to fully eradicate the NTM in this single subject. This study will transition from the
      medical clinic to supervised delivery in the patient's home environment.

      Primary Objective: Determine the efficacy of prolonged delivery of inhaled nitric oxide to
      treat an adult patient with pulmonary NTM Primary Endpoint: Eradication of NTM growth in
      sputum cultures. Efficacy will be assessed by the antimicrobial effect of inhaled NO on the
      density of NTM species and other microorganisms in the sputum.

      • as confirmed by measurement of semi-quantitative culture sputum growth which has been
      verified with serial dilution technique on Day 7, 14, 21 and every 21 days thereafter for 90
      days as compared to pre-treatment baseline sputum culture.

      Secondary Objective(s): Determine the safety &amp; efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide

      Secondary Endpoint(s):

        1. Safety

           • as evaluated by the number of unanticipated adverse events during home delivery in
           clinical labs (hematology, coagulation, and serum chemistries); in vitals; in inspired
           concentration of NO, O2 and NO2 delivered to subject and; in methemoglobin and oxygen
           saturation levels.

        2. Efficacy

             -  as determined by improvement in lung function as measured by spirometry, endurance
                as measured by six minute walk-test and quality of life as determined by
                self-reporting quality of life questionnaire (CFQ-R) on Day 7, 14, 21 and every 21
                days thereafter for 90 days as compared to pre-treatment baseline data.

             -  as assessed by recurrence of NTM in sputum as confirmed by measurement of
                semi-quantitative culture sputum growth on Day 30 and 60 post treatment.

For item 1 (difficult to breathe), item 2 (feel feverish), item 3 (tired), item 6 (mucus), and item 7 (chest tightness) the response options are: 0=No symptom, 1=a little, 2=somewhat, 3=a good deal, 4=a great deal.
