  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RV 507 is a Phase I, open-label study to examine safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      an investigational Marburg vaccine given by intramuscular (IM) injection to healthy adults.
      The study is a dose escalation of VRC-MARADC087-00-VP, a chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 3
      vector vaccine, which encodes wild type (WT) glycoprotein (GP) from Marburgvirus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that about 100 volunteers will be screened in order to enroll a total of 40
      participants. The 40 enrolled participants will be evenly split, with 20 in each of the two
      dosage groups for cAd3-Marburg. The dose escalation plan includes daily review of any new
      safety data by a study clinician, regular review of safety data by the protocol team and a
      staged enrollment plan with required interim safety reviews. The study will begin with
      enrollment of 3 participants into Group 1 at a rate of 1 participant per day. After at least
      7 days of follow-up for the first 3 vaccinated participants, an interim safety review will
      occur before enrollment of additional participants into the group. If no safety issues are
      identified, an additional 17 participants will be enrolled to complete Group 1. When there is
      a minimum of seven days of follow-up safety data from the last enrolled participant in Group
      1, an interim safety review will occur. Once no safety issues are identified, enrollment of
      participants into the next dose level will begin with the enrollment of 3 participants at a
      rate of 1 participant per day. After at least 7 days of follow-up for the first 3 vaccinated
      participants in Group 2, an interim safety review will occur before the enrollment of
      additional participants into Group 2. If no safety issues are identified, an additional 17
      participants will be enrolled to complete Group 2.
