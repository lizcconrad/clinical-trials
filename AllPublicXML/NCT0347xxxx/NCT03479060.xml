      This study evaluates the short and long-term effects of application of Wet Cupping Therapy
      (WCT) in the treatment of migraine headaches in adults.Half of the participants will continue
      WCT application and the other half will not.

    <textblock>
      In literature, Cupping therapy(CT) has been shown to be used mostly for pain control and the
      majority of RCT studies have shown that CT has potential benefits in pain conditions.
      Previous studies have reported the effect of pain mediator substance-P, endorphins,
      encephalins and dynorphins on pain(1) In addition to pain control, it is recommended for use
      as additional treatment in neurological diseases such as paralysis, Parkinson's disease and
      stroke Studies have shown successful results in the short term with the application of CT for
      migraine and tension-type headaches (2,3) Patients with a history of migraine diagnosis who
      presented at the Research Polyclinic of Karabuk University Training and Research Hospital for
      wet-cupping therapy in the period 2017-2018 were included in the study. Patients were
      excluded if they had a history of head and neck surgery, a diagnosis of sinusitis, a
      diagnosis of fibromyalgia and inflammatory disease (rheumatism, infection etc.), were
      pregnant, had a diagnosis of cancer, bleeding disorder and widespread skin disease, malignant
      hypertension or any other disease which could cause headache. The diagnosis of migraine was
      confirmed by an experienced neurologist and the migraine type was determined. The medical
      treatments of the patients were reviewed and MIDAS was applied to determine the baseline
      score. In addition to the medical treatment, WCT was applied once a month, 3 times (Day 0,
      30, 60). At the end of the 3rd month patients were separated into two parallel arms according
      to their wish. It was explained to them that they could continue with the treatment or stop
      it depending on their own decision. The patients who decided to continue with the treatment
      were allocated in the intervention group whereas the rest in the control group. MIDAS was
      applied again at the end of the 6th and 12th months to both of the groups. Disability values
      in the 6th and 12th months were evaluated with MIDAS between those who continued treatment
      (Group 1) and those who did not (Group 2). Approval for the study was granted by Turgut Ozal
      University Ethics Committee, with number 99950669/236, dated 30.06.2014.Study design,
      application procedures and any possible side effects were explained to the study participants
      and informed consents obtained. All procedures performed in studies involving human
      participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or
      national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments
      or comparable ethical standards.

      MIDAS The migraine disability score is a scale evaluating disability and loss associated with
      migraine. It consists of 7 questions, the 1st, 3rd and 5th of which evaluate the days lost
      from school, work, housework or leisure activities because of headaches in the last 3 months.
      The 2nd and 4th questions evaluate the number of additional days lost from work or housework
      in the last 3 months due to a reduction in productivity (defined as at least a 50% reduction
      in productivity). An additional two questions (MIDAS A and B) evaluate the frequency of
      headaches and the severity of the headaches using a visual analog scale (VAS), but these are
      not added to the total MIDAS score. The total MIDAS points are obtained from the total of the
      first 5 questions. Total points of 0-5 = 1st degree (very little or no restriction), 6-10
      points =2nd degree (mild or occasional restriction), 11-20 points = 3rd degree (moderate
      level of restriction), and 21 + points = 4th degree (severe restriction).
