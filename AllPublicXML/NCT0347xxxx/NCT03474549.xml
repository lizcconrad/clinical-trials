  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tigertriever is a CE marked mechanical revascularization device indicated to restore blood
      flow by removing thrombus from a large intracranial vessel in patients experiencing ischemic
      stroke within 8 hours of symptom onset. Patients who are ineligible for IV t-PA or who fail
      IV t-PA therapy are candidates for treatment.

      The objective of the TIGER Study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Tigertriever device in restoring blood flow in the neurovasculature by removing thrombus in
      patients experiencing ischemic stroke due to a large vessel occlusion (LVO). This study is
      designed to support substantial equivalence to approved and marketed products such as the
      Solitaire or Trevo Retriever.

             target vessel) can be achieved within 8 hours of symptom onset.

          4. Patient either: a) eligible for, and received, IV t-PA within 3 hours of symptom
             onset, at the correct 0.9 mg/kg dose, or b) ineligible for IV t-PA.

          5. NIH Stroke Scale score of 8-29.

          6. No known significant pre-stroke disability (prestroke mRS 0 or 1).

          7. Catheter angiographic confirmation of a large vessel occlusion in the intracranial
             internal carotid artery, the M1 or M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery, the
             intracranial vertebral artery, or the basilar artery that is accessible to
             Tigertriever device.

          8. For strokes in the anterior circulation, the following imaging criteria should also be
             met:
