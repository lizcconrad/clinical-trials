  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies showed the therapeutic benefit of lymphadenectomy in advanced stage urothelial
      carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, but there is still a lack of prospective studies. Thus,
      the current guideline recommends lymph node dissection for invasive upper tract urothelial
      carcinoma (UTUC) on the basis of insufficient evidence. Also, the preoperative judgment of
      muscle invasive pathological stage T 2+,or N+ is difficult from preoperative imaging. In the
      investigators' clinical practice, the surgeons performed dissection of regional lymph nodes
      only in patients with enlargement of lymph nodes found in preoperative imaging or during
      surgery. The aim of this multi-institutional study was to examine the role of lymphadenectomy
      in urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract.
