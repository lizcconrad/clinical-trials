  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The maintenance of health and the progression of disease are associated with an individual's
      genetic make-up and environmental factors, including lifestyle choices (such as diet,
      exercise, behaviors, stressors, sleep, tobacco and alcohol use), environmental exposures and
      socioeconomic determinants. Environmental factors have been shown to influence, sometimes
      rapidly, epigenetic processes thereby influencing genetic expression. Regulation of the human
      genome by the epigenome is now regarded as a cornerstone, heritable, physiologic process,
      playing a key role in phenotypic expression of health and disease.

      DNA methylation is a well-researched, primary epigenetic process. Aberrant DNA methylation
      resulting in hyper- or hypomethylated regions of the genome, generally results in inhibition
      or expression of certain genes and has been associated with the pathogenesis of numerous
      conditions, ranging from inflammation and accelerated aging, to cancer, autoimmunity,
      diabetes, heart disease, dementia, allergic disease, posttraumatic stress disease and others.
      Likewise, certain healthy diet and lifestyle habits have been demonstrated to favorably
      influence DNA methylation patterns.

      Understanding that environmental factors can potently and sometimes rapidly, favorably or
      negatively influence epigenetic expression, a short-term diet and lifestyle intervention may
      significantly augment DNA methylation expression.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a 9-week diet and lifestyle intervention on
      patient-reported quality of life, symptoms, and DNA and biochemical methylation-related
      biomarkers in healthy males ages 50-72.
