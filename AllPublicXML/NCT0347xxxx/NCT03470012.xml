      The objective of this study is to determine the relative gentleness of a new medical tape. A
      three-prong multidimensional evaluation consisting of expert grader, subject discomfort
      assessment, and laboratory assessments was used. One pre-study visit took place up to 7 days
      prior to the start of the study. The study was conducted over two days with one tape sample
      applied and removed. Assessments were taken on the final day. This was to mimic a normal tape
      application in health care practice. Assessments were compared to those taken in a previous
      study.

             study start date

          5. Whose parent or legal representative agrees to sponge bathe their child during the
             study but agrees to not bathe their child 1 hour before each visit.

          6. Whose parent or legal representative agrees to not soak the tape during a sponge bath.
             If the site gets wet, parent or legal representative agrees to pat their child's back
             dry (no rubbing).

          7. Whose parent or legal representative is willing to sign the Informed Consent Form

          3. Who have sunburn, skin infection or scars, moles, or other blemishes on the back that
             would obscure grading of the test site

          4. Who have had any exposure to other topical medications, creams, powders, or ointments
             on the test sites 24 hours prior to the start of the study

             period.

          8. Has any other skin disorders that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere
