    <textblock>
      The Tzu Chi Vegetarian Study (TCVS) recruited 12062 community volunteers of the Buddhists Tzu
      Chi Foundation throughout Taiwan in the year 2005. All participants completed a
      self-administered questionnaire on basic information, medical history, lifestyle, and diet.

      The Tzu Chi Health Study (TCHS) recruited 6002 participants who came to the Buddhist Tzu Chi
      Dalin General Hospital for health examination. All participants were interviewed on basic
      information, medical history, lifestyle, and diet. Biochemical and anthropometric data was
      collected through a health examination:

      Biochemical variables: CBC, fasting glucose, lipid profile (TCH, LDL, HDL, TG), BUN, Cr, ALT,
      AST, and UA. In addition, homocysteine, serum vitamin B12, folate, and C-reactive protein
      (CRP) are available for 1500 subjects.

      Blood: Extra blood samples have been obtained and stored for 3500 subjects and will be
      available for future investigation.

      Anthropometric variables: body weight, height, waist circumference, % body fat (with BIA),
      blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, bone mineral density through DXA (at spine for female
      and hip for male), lung function test (spirometric), abdominal sonography, colonoscopy,
      esophageal-gastro-duodenal-scopy, chest X-ray, KUB.

      Follow-up: Individual baseline data were linked to the National Health Insurance Database and
      the National Death Registry to ascertain disease outcomes at the Health and Welfare Data
      Science Center.
