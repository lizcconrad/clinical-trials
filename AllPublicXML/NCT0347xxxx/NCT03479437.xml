  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A voluntary prospective study that will allow registration and follow-up of individuals with
      MC4R pathway genetic obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential patients will be referred to coordinating centers by their healthcare provider
      (treating physician, diagnosing physician or primary care physician) and if eligible will be
      invited to enroll in the registry. The Registry Coordinating Center will be responsible for
      obtaining consent from adult patients and caregivers of minor patients (as well as assent
      from minors when appropriate), screening patients and enrolling them in the registry.

      The registry will capture data entered by the patient, the patient's healthcare provider, and
      the patient's caregiver using online (electronic) survey tools administered at baseline, and
      annually thereafter. The patient's healthcare provider will complete the baseline Healthcare
      Provider survey tool, reporting the patient's baseline demographics, medical history,
      clinical information, and disease characteristics. The patient and caregiver will complete
      their dedicated baseline survey tools answering questions on the impact of disease on their
      everyday life. Survey tools include questions on patient and caregiver demographics, patient
      physical activity, patient food and hunger episodes, patient quality of life, and caregiver's
      perspective of disease burden on the family. Registry patients, caregivers, and healthcare
      providers will be contacted annually (approximately every 12 months) by the Registry
      Coordinating Center to complete an online follow-up survey tool including a smaller subset of
      questions from the baseline survey tools.

  <condition>Genetic Forms of Extreme Obesity</condition>
  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Extreme obesity in adults age 18 or older defined as a BMI &gt;40 kg/m2 or subjects from age 2
        through age 18 years with a BMI value that is &gt;1.4 times the corresponding age/gender 95th
        percentile value will be eligible.

        Second, specific genotypic criteria involving defined major genes contributing to genetic
        obesity disorders will also be required for enrollment.

        Patients will be eligible to participate in the registry regardless of gender or geographic
        location. Other genetic forms of obesity may be added to this list as pathogenetic
        etiologies and the potential involvement of specific genes in the hypothalamus upstream or
        downstream of the MC4R become better understood.

        All known patients, or their caregivers, will be invited to participate. As new patients
        resulting from novel gene variants or defects are identified, registry patient enrollment
        will continue on an ongoing basis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Extreme obesity patients aged 2 years and older.

          2. Extreme obesity defined as:

               1. BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 in patients 18 years of age or older.

               2. BMI value that is &gt;1.4 times the corresponding age/gender 95th percentile value
                  in patients who are 2 through 17 years of age.

          3. At least one of the following genotypes:

               1. Bi-allelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) POMC, PCSK1, LEPR variants
                  leading to the physician-confirmed diagnosis of either POMC or LEPR deficiency
                  obesity.

               2. The presence of high-confidence, high-impact genetic variations (homozygote,
                  compound heterozygote, heterozygote or composite heterozygote [i.e., heterozygous
                  variants in more than a single gene]) in these same 3 genes (POMC, PCSK1 and
                  LEPR) associated with the clinical presentation of extreme obesity

               3. The presence of other high-confidence, high-impact genetic variations
                  (homozygote, compound heterozygote, heterozygote or composite heterozygote in the
                  MC4R gene or other upstream MC4R-pathway genes and selected variants downstream
                  in the MC4R-pathway (Table 1) that are carried by extreme obesity patients who do
                  not demonstrate specific syndromic obesity clinical presentations. Selected
                  Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS1 through BBS21) genetic variants or Alström syndrome
                  (ALMS) genetic variants possibly contributing to non-syndromic forms of clinical
                  extreme obesity will be eligible for enrollment.

          4. Study participant and/or parent or caregiver can understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study, and able to understand and sign the written informed
             consent (IC)/assent, after being informed about the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with syndromic forms of obesity such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome or Alström
             syndrome. These patients will be referred to existing registries for these specific
             syndromic obesity (e.g., Clinical Registry in Bardet-Biedl syndrome [CRIBBS] for BBS
             patients).

          2. Individual is, in the opinion of the study investigator, not suitable to participate
             in the study.
