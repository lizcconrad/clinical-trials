      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the correlation between the intensity of
      the protein big-h3 expression at tumoural microenvironment and the TNM/UICC staging (from I
      to IV) of pancreatic adenocarcinoma lesion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most common pancreatic cancer. Currently, it represents
      the fourth cause of death by cancer in France. The diagnosis is often realized when the
      disease is at an advanced stage because of its delayed clinical expression. Only 20% of the
      patients are diagnosed at a stage enabling a tumour resection.

      Scientists discovered a protein playing a key role: the βig-h3 protein. In mouse models, this
      protein is present in several stages of the tumorigenesis. A mutation of the gene Kras leads
      to the development of PANin (Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) type precancerous lesions.
      The βig-h3 protein is early and highly expressed in the stroma around these lesions and in
      the pancreatic adenocarcinoma stroma. Moreover, studies showed that protein neutralization
      leads to a tumour size reduction by increasing the CD8+anti-tumor activity.

      This protein is detected in the blood serum of patients suffering from a pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. So, this protein which is secreted by the extracellular matrix could be a
      predictive marker for the pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      In this prospective, multicentric non-interventional study, it is anticipated to recruit 80
      patients (20 per TNM/UICC stage).

      Included patients will undergo two samples: A blood sample (5 ml) and a tumour sample
      (surgical exeresis piece or tumour tissue obtained for the initial diagnosis). In case of
      relapse, new samples will be performed.
