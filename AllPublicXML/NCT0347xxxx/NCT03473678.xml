    <textblock>
      This study investigates the influence of dietary nitrate supplementation on cardiovascular
      health and physical and cognitive performance in older adults. Participants will receive both
      a nitrate containing beetroot juice for 10 days and a nitrate depleted beetroot juice for 10
      days

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent exciting finding is that dietary nitrate supplementation (in the form of beetroot
      juice) appears to reduce the amount of oxygen needed to complete moderate intensity walking
      in healthy, young individuals. Nitrate is known to be converted in the body to nitric oxide
      (NO), a substance which reduces blood pressure and may affect the energy-producing mechanisms
      inside muscle cells. Exercise tolerance and muscle function typically declines with age and
      nitrate supplementation therefore may help improve cardiovascular health and the ability to
      carry out low-intensity daily activities in aging populations. The purpose of this study is
      to see if healthy, elderly individuals benefit from beetroot juice intake similarly to the
      effects seen in young adults. If this is indeed the case, then it may suggest that dietary
      supplementation with a relatively cheap, widely available, and natural food product may
      improve the ability of healthy elderly individuals to undergo everyday tasks and ultimately
      improve their quality of life.
