  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of airways and lungs that results in
      hyper-reactivity and clinically relevant episodes of wheezing. This study has been designed
      to assess the correct use and ease of use of the ELLIPTAÂ® DPI in pediatric subjects with
      asthma. ELLIPTA DPI is easy to use, requires few steps, is consistent in dosing and
      eliminates the hand-breath co-ordination required for metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Subjects
      will be stratified by age into two strata: Stratum 1: subjects in the age group of 5 to 7
      years and Stratum 2: Subjects in the age group of 8 to 11 years. All subjects will be trained
      by Health care professionals (HCP) for the correct use of ELLIPTA DPI. Subjects will be given
      three chances to attempt correct use of ELLIPTA DPI; subsequently, if the subject is not
      successful, the parent/guardian will be able to help instruct the subject on the correct use
      of the ELLIPTA DPI. The subjects who will be enrolled in the study will take placebo ELLIPTA
      DPI once daily. After 28 days subjects will be randomized in 1:1 to receive a questionnaire
      (Version A and B). After completion of the questionnaire on ELLIPTA DPI ease of use,
      subject's ability to use ELLIPTA DPI correctly will be re-assessed. Approximately 219
      subjects will be screened to participate in the study. The study will be conducted for 28
      days. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of companies.
