  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 13.7 million Americans currently living with a history of cancer. With continued
      improvements in cancer treatment and increasing life expectancy, this number is expected to
      reach nearly 18 million within the next decade. The care of these cancer patients, including
      surveillance during the post-treatment survivorship phase, is an increasingly important major
      health care concern and expenditure. As the fourth leading diagnosis among cancer survivors,
      lung cancer is emerging as a chronic problem that currently affects over 450,000 Americans
      and is expected to grow by nearly 20% by 2022.

      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States. Of the estimated 182,550
      patients newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) this year, approximately 35%
      will present with localized disease and be eligible for curative resection. For patients with
      limited NSCLC, surgical resection is the most effective method of controlling the primary
      tumor and provides the best opportunity for cure. A recent analysis by this group
      demonstrated that the number of lung cancer resections has increased over the past decade,
      with over 45,000 lung cancer resections performed annually in the US.

      This research will address a critical gap in knowledge because the optimal approach to
      post-treatment surveillance following lung cancer resection is unknown. The intensity of
      recommended surveillance visits ranges from every 3 months during the first two years to an
      annual visit. Imaging modalities range from CT scans to chest radiographs to no routine
      imaging for asymptomatic patients. The reason for these significant differences is a lack of
      quality data on lung cancer surveillance and clinical guidelines based largely on small
      retrospective analyses and expert opinion.

      The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) provides real world national lung cancer resection and
      surveillance data on over 70% of newly diagnosed lung cancers from more than 1,500
      institutions. This study will compare the effectiveness of the three most common surveillance
      intensities (CT scans every 3 months vs. 6 months vs. annually) on the stakeholder selected
      outcome of survival. All analyses will be risk adjusted for differences in patient
      characteristics at baseline, including tumor characteristics, patient age, comorbid disease,
      and other potential confounders. Analyses will also be adjusted for the competing risk of
      death.

      This study will use a special study of the National Cancer Database to develop a cohort of
      NSCLC survivors undergoing surveillance. Cox proportional hazards regression and competing
      risk analyses will compare the effectiveness of the three most common surveillance
      intensities (3 months vs. 6 months vs. annually) on survival.

      There is also a plan to engage cancer survivors to guide the development of our study
      comparators, outcomes and demonstration of results.

    <description>Use existing data to define surveillance strategy in use for patients in this cohort. We will use 10 randomly selected lung cancer resection patients from each accredited institution with stage I-III NSCLC (potentially curative resection) diagnosed in 2006-2007 and with 5 years of complete follow up or reported as deceased before 2012.</description>
