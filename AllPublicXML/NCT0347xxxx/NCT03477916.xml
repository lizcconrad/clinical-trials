  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is increasing in western society at a rapid rate and is associated with metabolic and
      cardiovascular disease. Although genetics, improper diet, and sedentary lifestyle are known
      to be factors that can cause obesity, there is a new idea that certain gut microbes may also
      be involved. Patients who are obese tend to have different kinds of gut microbes compared
      with lean healthy individuals. Previous studies have shown that changing the gut microbes of
      obese individuals by doing a fecal transplant (FMT) using gut microbes from a lean individual
      improves insulin resistance. However, the effects were not maintained. In addition, research
      has highlighted a necessary role for dietary fiber in the maintenance of microbes required
      for human health and also that increasing dietary fiber can reduce inflammation that is
      associated with insulin resistance. This project builds on the findings that gut microbes can
      be modulated by both FMT and dietary fiber supplementation and will examine if combining
      these two treatments can increase the effectiveness of these treatments.

      The objective of this study is to use fecal microbial transplant to change the gut microbes
      of obese individuals to those seen in lean individuals and then to use fiber supplements to
      help maintain the beneficial effects. In this study, overweight individuals who have
      metabolic syndrome will receive a fecal transplant using a pill form and then consume a
      variety of fiber supplements for 6 weeks. Effects on metabolic parameters, quality of life,
      weight, and dietary intake will be followed. Microbial composition will be measured in stool
      samples.

      Alberta

      Objectives:The objective of this study is to determine if fecal microbial transplantation
      (FMT) combined with supplementation with a combined fiber supplement of resistant starch type
      4, acacia gum, and soluble corn fiber has a clinically significant effect on metabolic
      outcomes in obese subjects with metabolic syndrome

      following treatment.
