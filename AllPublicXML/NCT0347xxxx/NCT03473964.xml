  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect nearly any organ in the
      body. While most commonly affecting the lungs, vision threatening eye involvement occurs in
      approximately 25% of patients with sarcoid. Eye involvement may lead to a chronic,
      sight-threatening uveitis which may result in cataract, glaucoma, and macular edema. The
      treatment of sarcoid uveitis involves the use of topical and systemic corticosteroids or
      potent immunosuppressive agents (medications that suppress the body's immune system) both of
      which can cause severe long-term side effects. The adverse effects of steroids may be avoided
      by treatment with the use as H.P. Acthar® Gel. The effectiveness of H.P. Acthar® Gel in the
      treatment of sarcoid uveitis and patient quality of live have not been previously examined.
      These issues, will be explored in this research.

      The Investigator seeks to determine the efficacy of H.P. Acthar® Gel (40 units twice weekly
      injection) of on disease activity and severity in patients with sarcoid uveitis. The
      retrospective study will evaluate a series of quantitative outcome measures:

      The degree of aqueous and vitreous inflammatory cells as graded by the criteria established
      by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria at intervals of 0 weeks, 3
      weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

      The degree of aqueous flare as graded by the criteria established by the Standardization of
      Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria at intervals of 0 weeks, 4 weeks,12 weeks and 24 weeks.

      Best Corrected Visual Acuity at intervals of 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

      Central Macular Thickness at intervals of 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks as measured
      by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).

      Intraocular pressure at intervals of 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks as measured by
      applanation tonometry

      Quality of life assessment using National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire
      (VFQ-25)

      The Investigator expects to retrospectively review the charts of 10 sarcoid associated
      uveitis patients treated with Acthar® Gel over a period of 1 year.

    <description>Quality of life assessment using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25). The VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions representing 11 vision-related constructs, plus an additional single item general health rating question. The scoring ranges in scores from 1-6, 1 being activity presents no difficulty and 6 being can no longer perform this activity due to vision. The VFQ-25 generates the following vision-targeted subscales : global vision rating (1), difficulty with near vision activities (3), difficulty with distance vision activities (3), limitations in social functioning due to vision (2), role limitations due to vision(2), dependency on others due to vision (3), mental health symptoms due to vision (4), driving difficulties (3), limitations with peripheral (1) and color vision (I), and ocular pain (2).</description>
