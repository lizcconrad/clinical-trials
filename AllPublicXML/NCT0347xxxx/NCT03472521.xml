  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our previous work has identified the group of women at risk for prolonged pain, opioid use
      and poor functional recovery after childbirth. The optimal intervention to mitigate this risk
      is unknown. We propose to test an analgesic adjutant that is commonly used for post-operative
      pain compared to placebo to improve post-partum recovery.

    <textblock>
      A small percent of the large population of women who give birth have difficulty with
      prolonged pain, opioid use and poor functional recovery. This may be the first opiate
      exposure and significant health challenge in a young woman's life.

      In our previous work, we have identified 20% who are at highest risk for prolonged pain and
      delayed opioid cessation and functional recovery with usual care. Moderate to severe pain on
      postpartum day 1 is a significant predictor of being in the risk group.The optimal
      intervention to mitigate this risk is unknown.

      We plan to test an intervention of low dose gabapentin or placebo to be escalated by a pain
      medicine doctor as needed. We hypothesize that additional care of women predicted to be
      higher need by virtue of their postoperative day one pain score (&gt;6 x2) despite usual
      multimodal analgesic care will lead to reduced need for opioid, less pain and more rapid
      functional recovery.
