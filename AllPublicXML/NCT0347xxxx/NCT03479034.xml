      A prospective qualitative and quantitative controlled study, exploring the impact of patient
      centred digital prescriptions on health, in patients with chronic health conditions.

    <textblock>
      ScalaMed is an innovative new consumer centred solution for securing prescriptions through a
      blockchain solution - a cryptographic distributed database, that can give consumer access to
      their prescriptions at all times. It aims to solve interoperability challenges that exist in
      healthcare, by creating a ledger of prescriptions, and giving consumers access to this
      information to own and share as they need. The solution will be accessed through an
      application available on a smart phone, will be fully compliant with security and privacy
      laws, and will be made available to consumers, clinicians, and pharmacies enrolled in this
      study free of charge. The system also allows patients to monitor the usage of their
      prescriptions - eg when they need a new one, and allows them to choose how and where they
      want to use their prescriptions like with paper.

      This study will explore whether empowering consumers with their digital prescriptions in a
      digital format through a blockchain based methodology of storing and accessing their data,
      will improve the flow of clinically important information, improve the frequency of data
      sharing, improve the self-management of the patient, improve adherence to treatments, reduce
      interactions and adverse events associated with medications, reduce the burden on clinical
      practice, improve efficiency, reduce the amount of paper, increase consumer engagement and
      improve patient satisfaction.
