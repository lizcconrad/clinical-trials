  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The continuing spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      (ESBL-PE) is among the most important problems in antimicrobial resistance. It is also a good
      model to investigate the epidemiological complexity of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.
      Available data on the transmission determinants of ESBL-PE in community settings are scarce,
      methodologically limited and mostly based on single centre studies. A comprehensive
      investigation using present typing and modelling techniques is warranted to develop a sound
      quantitative understanding of the interactions involved. A consortium of investigators with
      diverse expertise from countries with high and low endemicity of ESBL-EP has been created.
      Transmission and persistence of ESBL-PE within households and long-term care facilities will
      be studied. Individual and group-level determinants for transmission and persistence will be
      quantified, together with other ecological variables including environmental, food and
      wastewater contamination. Advanced molecular typing techniques and state of the art
      analytical methods will be used. Data generated in this project will directly inform a suite
      of mathematical models which, in addition to encapsulating current understanding of the
      processes, will be used to explore the potential effectiveness of different interventions to
      control ESBL-PE spread. The expected outputs are a comprehensive characterisation of ESBL-PE
      transmission considering bacterial clones and mobile genetic elements, as well as individual
      and ecologic-level factors in different settings, to inform public health authorities about
      interventions that should be prioritised to control transmission of these organisms.

    <time_frame>For the cohort 'LTCF': 35 weeks ; For the cohort 'Household': 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess
For the cohort 'LTCF': the number of LTCF residents contaminated with an ESBL-E from other residents or from the environment within 35 weeks.
For the cohort 'Household': the number of people (sharing household with a ESBL-E carrying patient which has been discharged from the hospital) contaminated with ESBL-E within 4 months.
These two measurements will be aggregated to arrive at one reported value : the number of secondary cases from one index case (ratio).</description>
