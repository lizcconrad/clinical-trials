      The primary objective of the Sleep and Stent II is to determine the prevalence of REM-OSA in
      DM versus non-DM patients undergoing clinically indicated PCI.

      The secondary objectives are to investigate the association between REM-AHI and (1) cardiac
      arrhythmia based on ambulatory ECG monitoring, (2) excessive daytime sleepiness, and (3)
      glycemic control in patients with DM. In addition, we will determine the prevalence of
      REM-OSA based on alternative definitions, including (a) overall AHI at least 5 with AHI
      REM/AHI NREM ratio at least 2; (b) overall AHI at least 5 with AHI REM/AHI NREM ratio at
      least 2 and with AHI NREM less than 15; (c) overall AHI at least 5, AHI REM/AHI NREM ratio at
      least 2 and with AHI NREM less than 8.

      The Sleep and Stent II is a cross-sectional study of patients who have undergone PCI for
      coronary artery disease. A total of 200 adult patients who have undergone clinically
      indicated PCI between 6 and 36 months ago are eligible. The study involves the 2 national
      heart centers in Singapore. The National University Heart Center Singapore is the leading
      center and it is responsible for the overall study design and study conduct. The estimated
      duration of the Sleep and Stent II is 3 years (2018-2020).

      All subjects and/or their legally authorized representative must provide written informed
      consent before any study-related procedure can be conducted. As a standard clinical practice
      in Singapore, patients who have undergone PCI will be followed up at the outpatient clinic
      for continuation of care. As such, the recruitment will be conducted at the outpatient
      clinic. All recruited patients will undergo an overnight polysomnography at the National
      University Health System Cardiosleep research laboratory.

      All polysomnography studies will be conducted using a standardized level I diagnostic device
      (Embla RemLogic, Natus Medical Inc. Canada). Outputs recorded from the portable diagnostic
      device will be manually scored by an independent sleep technologist with Registered
      Polysomnographic Technologist credentials, blinded to the patients' clinical characteristics.

      The primary measure of the polysomnography will be the AHI, quantified as the total number of
      apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. An apnea is defined as a 90% or greater decrease in
      airflow from the baseline value for at least 10 seconds. Apneas are further classified as
      obstructive or central based on the presence or absence, respectively, of respiratory-related
      chest wall movement. Hypopnea is defined as a 30-90% reduction in airflow from the baseline
      value lasting 10 seconds or more, in conjunction with â‰¥3% oxygen desaturation. The
      respiratory event scoring will be performed according to the American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine guidelines. For all patients the AHI during total sleep time, the AHI during REM
      (AHI-REM), and the AHI during non-REM sleep (AHI-NREM) will be calculated. REM-OSA is defined
      as (a) an AHI-NREM of fewer than 5 events/h and (b) an AHI-REM of at least 5 events/h with at
      least 30 minutes of REM sleep.
