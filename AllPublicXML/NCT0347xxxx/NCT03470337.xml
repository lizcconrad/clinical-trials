  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral enzyme therapy in patients with acute superficial vein inflammation (thrombophlebitis)
      can serve as an additional treatment option besides standard therapy with compression
      stockings, common pain medication and physical treatments. This randomized, double-blinded
      trial compares efficacy and safety with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enzymes are absorbed in the small intestine and taken up into the bloodstream, at least to
      some extent. There, they act in an anti-inflammatory manner, as was first described for the
      serine protease trypsin. Similarly, the cysteine protease bromelain, extracted from the stems
      of pineapples, is an effective phytotherapeutical drug with anti-inflammatory
      properties.Proteases have also been indicated to show a certain improvement of the fluidity
      of the blood. An additional component of the oral enzyme combination can be rutoside, or
      rutin, a flavonoid known to have cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties.
