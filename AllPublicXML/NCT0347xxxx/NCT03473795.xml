    <textblock>
      This umbrella protocol seeks to develop robust data registries for non-communicable diseases
      (NCDs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with the aim of providing accurate and comprehensive data
      for the evaluation of such diseases in sub-Saharan African countries.Healthy volunteers will
      be included in the study for comparison.

    <description>This protocol will entail prospective collection of data on healthy participants and participants diagnosed with NCDs managed at collaborating institutions in SSA. Information to be obtained includes socio-demographic data, risk factors, disease-specific data, investigation and treatment details, as well as findings during follow-up. Particular reference will be made to outcome measures such as local and distant recurrence, survival and mortality. Follow-up data will be updated during clinic visits and also via phone calls.</description>
