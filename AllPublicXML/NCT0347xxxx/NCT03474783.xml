  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives:

      Promoting quitting smoking and training smoking cessation educators in hospital, school,
      community, and workplace was being vigorously pushed by Health Promotion Administration.
      Since the implementation of the second-generation smoking cessation program by Health
      Promotion Administration, both the general public and medical institutions have worked with
      greater vitality to practice and promote quitting smoking. However, studies on smoking
      cessation in the inpatient remain inadequate. Increasing cessation motivation for inpatient
      smokers and evaluating their nicotine dependence are essential. In this study, we aimed to
      explore the factors that might influence the smoking cessation in the inpatients.

      Method: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on inpatients participants at
      the smoking cessation.

      Questionnaire comprising（1）Demographic characteristics: age, sex, marital status, education,
      （2）physiological factors（concentration of carbon monoxide, nicotine dependence, disease
      severity）,（3）psychological factors（psychological dependence on smoking , smoking cessation
      stages of behavior change, smoking cessation self-efficacy）, （4）Social Factor: social
      support,（5）smoking Behavior indicators: smoked, daily cigarette consumption, smoking
      experience. After giving health education cessation of treatment one month, three months and
      six months, interviewed by telephone quitting behavior index contains daily cigarette
      consumption, quit rates point.
