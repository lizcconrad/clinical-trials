  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of a fresh fruit extract of Indian Gooseberry (AMX160) for
      the attenuation of increased blood cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in patients
      with hypercholesterolemia.

    <textblock>
      Phyllanthus emblica L. fruit (Emblica officinalis) has potent antioxidant properties. Animal
      studies indicate that flavanoids from E. officinalis effectively reduced lipid levels in
      serum and tissues and had a significant inhibitory effect on hepatic
      hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether Phyllanthus emblica L. fruit extract
      AMX160 is an effective treatment for hypercholesterolemia patients as compared to placebo.
      The investigators hypothesize that Phyllanthus emblica L. fruit extract AMX160 will
      significantly lower the total cholesterol as compared to placebo in patients with
      Hypercholesterolemia. A total of 132 patients including males and females with
      hypercholesterolemia will be assigned at random to one of the two investigational products.
      The study is expected to have a treatment duration of 90 Â± 10 days and a total duration of
      118 days including 14 days of grace period and 14 days of screening period per patient.
