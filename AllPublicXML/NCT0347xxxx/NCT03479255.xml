  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Structured exercise therapy is a first line treatment for symptomatic peripheral artery
      disease, but compliance is poor. Coaching programs may help but requires significant
      resources. Smartphone programs may increase the efficiency of such efforts. The study aim is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of a coached, smartphone-enabled exercise program versus
      physician directed exercise therapy (usual care) in patients at Grady Memorial Hospital's
      vascular clinic.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance completed</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and after the 12-week period</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and after the 12-week period</time_frame>
    <description>WIQ measures self-reported walking distance, speed, and stair-climbing ability. In the WIQ distance score, the participant is asked to assess the degree of walking difficulty in walking specific distances on a scale from 0 to 4. A score of 0 represents the inability to walk the distance and a score of 4 represents no difficulty. WIQ speed score assesses the degree of difficulty in walking one block at specific speeds, ranging from walking slowly to jogging, on a scale of 0 to 4. In the WIQ stair-climbing score, the participant is asked to report the degree of difficulty climbing specific numbers of flights of stairs, ranging from one to three flights of stairs, on a scale of 0 to 4. This graded score is multiplied by a prespecified weight for each distance, speed, or number of stair flights. The products are summed and divided by the maximum possible score to obtain a percent score, ranging from 0 (inability to perform any of the tasks) to 100 (representing no difficulty).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Health Composite Score of SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and after the 12-week period</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to use special software. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in claudication onset time during 6MWT</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and after the 12-week period</time_frame>
    <description>One typical symptom of peripheral arterial occlusive disease' (PAOD) is claudication , which is defined as pain, cramps, numbness or a sense of fatigue in the muscles associated with walking, in one or both lower limbs, affecting either the distal or proximal muscle groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and after the 12-week period</time_frame>
    <description>The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is the ratio of the blood pressure at the ankle to the blood pressure in the upper arm (brachium). Compared to the arm, lower blood pressure in the leg suggests blocked arteries due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). The ABPI is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure at the ankle by the systolic blood pressure in the arm.</description>

    <description>This arm involves a smartphone app Movn - rehabilitation platform based on MULTIFIT, a case-management system for secondary prevention and patient surveillance after acute MI.
The key features of the smartphone app include daily reminders to exercise, virtual diary for patients to enter data on exercise sessions, two-way secure messaging with the health coach, and educational videos on heart and vascular health.</description>

    <intervention_name>Smartphone-enabled structured exercise therapy (SE-SET)</intervention_name>
    <description>The SE-SET program lasts a total of 12 weeks per participant. During this time, the application will automatically track physical activity (steps) and subjects will be prompted to enter other health data such as blood pressure and weight, and watch brief educational videos on topics such as smoking cessation, low sodium diet, high fruit/vegetable intake, and medication adherence/education. Patients will be contacted by a member of the study team weekly via phone call in order to identify barriers to patient compliance (issues related to exercise tracking, medication issues that prevent patient from being active, high BP/weight issues) and help patients navigate those barriers. Movn participants can also send direct messages to the study team to ask about non-urgent issues related to their care.</description>

    <intervention_name>Standard exercise therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>The Standard exercise therapy lasts a total of 12 weeks per participant. Participants will be counseled by the physician to perform exercise at home, including 3 times per week of walking 30+ minutes; if applicable, the physician will also counsel on smoking cessation, low sodium diet, high fruit/vegetable intake, and medication adherence/education. These patients will be given a fitness band, which will be set up by the study team using a de-identified study account that will provide additional data on their progress over time.</description>
