  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Total endoscopic thyroidectomy including oral approach and breast approach has
      excellent cosmetic and several functional results. Many patients, especially women,
      undergoing thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the
      neck. The procedure of total endoscopic thyroidectomy by breast approach only left three
      incisions, while by oral approach did not leave any incisions in the body surface, which is
      scarless in the neck, involved with a higher cosmetic result. However, the long-term property
      evaluation of total endoscopic thyroidectomy was not confirmed. The purpose of our study was
      to evaluate the surgical results of total endoscopic thyroidectomy (transoral approach and
      breast approach) versus conventional open thyroidectomy.

      Purpose: Total endoscopic thyroidectomy including oral approach and breast approach has
      excellent cosmetic and several functional results. Many patients, especially women,
      undergoing thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the
      neck. Transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy via vestibular approach (TOETVA) and endoscopic
      thyroidectomy via breast approach were routinely performed in our institute. The procedures
      of total endoscopic thyroidectomy by breast approach only left three incisions, while by oral
      approach did not leave any incisions in the body surface, which is scarless in the neck,
      involved with a higher cosmetic result. However, the comprehensive comparison between
      transoral approach, breast approach and conventional open method was not confirmed. The
      purpose of our study was to evaluate the surgical results of total endoscopic thyroidectomy
      (transoral approach and breast approach) versus conventional open thyroidectomy.
