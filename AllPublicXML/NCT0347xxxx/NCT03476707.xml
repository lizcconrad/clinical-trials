  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to measure the adjusted association between preoperative anemia and total
      hospital costs. We hypothesize that patients with anemia before surgery will have higher
      hospitalization costs than people without anemia.

      This study will examine the association between preoperative anemia (hematocrit less than
      0.39; low blood counts) and hospital total costs from elective colorectal surgery. Total
      costs will be defined as the combination of direct and indirect costs ascertained using
      standardized patient-level costing algorithms (i.e. the standard way that hospital measure
      their costs). Adjustment will be made for factors that are likely to influence both the
      presence of anemia and costs of care.
