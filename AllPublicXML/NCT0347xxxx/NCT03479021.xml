  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine if the Welch-Allyn Spot Vision Screener (SPOT)
      is effective at detecting various risk factors for poor vision in developmentally delayed
      children. These children have a higher percentage of vision disorders than the average
      population. The SPOT screen itself takes about six seconds to complete. It produces a
      photograph of the eye and a print out with amount of hyperopia, myopia, astigmatism and pupil
      size. The subject will have three SPOT screens around the time of their standard of care eye
      exam. The data obtained from the three SPOT screens will be compared among themselves for
      accuracy and to the findings of the clinical eye exam.
