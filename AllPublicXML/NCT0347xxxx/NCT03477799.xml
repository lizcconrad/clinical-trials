  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a double-blind randomised sham-controlled study. Upon enrollment
      into the study, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (i) active
      group: anodal stimulation over the right dlPFC (n = 10) or (ii) sham stimulation group (n =
      10). Participants and raters were blinded to the condition.

      Subsequently, the participants were administered the IGT and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
      by a trained neuropsychologist in a quiet laboratory. A computerized version of standard IGT
      was used. The order of the tasks performed in a single session was randomised.

      After the psychiatric and neurocognitive assessment, participants received three sessions of
      20-minute active or sham anodal tDCS (once a day, every other day).

      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and a modified version of Iowa Gambling Test were readministered
      after the last application. The order of the tasks was randomized again. A brief
      questionnaire on study blinding was also administered. Safety was assessed through open-ended
      questions based on the tDCS adverse events questionnaire

    <measure>Changes in the Iowa Gambling Task net score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after tDCS treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Iowa Gambling Task net score is the total score of the task (between -100 and 100) that generally assesses the decision making under ambiguity, but also assesses the decision making under risk at the later stages. Higher scores in the task represents better decision making and healthy people generally have scores above 8-10 in the task.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the number of perseverative errors in Wisconsin Card Sorting Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after tDCS treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Wisconsin Card Sorting Task is the widely used task to assess frontal lobe functions such as cognitive flexibility, set shifting and abstraction abilities. The participants were required to match response cards to 4 stimulus cards along 1 of 3 dimensions (colour, form or number) on the basis of verbal feedback (correct or incorrect). The participants were not given any information about the dimensions. After sorting a series of 10 cards in 1 category, participants were asked to sort the cards in a different category. The number of perseverative errors in Wisconsin Card Sorting Task is the most robust variable of the task to assess cognitive flexibility. Higher scores show an impairment of cognitive flexibility</description>

    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe method for non-invasively modulating cortical excitability through the use of weak electrical currents (usually of 1-2 mA) circulating between two scalp electrodes (i.e., an anode and a cathode) placed over the target cortical regions. The effects of tDCS on brain activity are polarity-dependent, such that anodal stimulation generally enhances cortical excitability by depolarizing cell membranes and increasing neuronal firing rates, while cathodal stimulation generally results in the opposite effect. Because of its neural effects, tDCS has been increasingly used to gauge the functional relationship between cognitive/behavioural dimensions and putatively relevant neurocircuitry</description>
