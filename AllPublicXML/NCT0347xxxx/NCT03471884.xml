      A novel nonintubated thoracoscopic technique is promising to enhance recovery after thoracic
      surgery. However, the effects of nonintubated technique on specific organ protection in not
      clear yet. In this randomized trial, the effect of nonintubated technique on lung function
      protection will be evaluated via PaO2/FiO2 ratio, oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines
      serially in lung cancer patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Its incidence is
      increasingly arising recently. For early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, surgery is the
      standard treatment that offers best chance of survival. For thoracoscopic lung cancer
      surgery, tracheal intubation with one-lung ventilation is regarded the standard anesthetic
      management to establish a safe operating environment. However, complications associated with
      intubated general anesthesia are not negligible. A novel nonintubated thoracoscopic technique
      is developing and applied in a variety of thoracic diseases. A previous study showed that
      nonintubated thoracoscopic lobectomy was feasible and safe in lung cancer patients.
      Furthermore, nonintubated techniques was also associated with a faster recovery of oral
      intake, less postoperative complications and shorter hospital stay. The effects of
      nonintubated thoracoscopic technique on specific organ protection is not clear yet.

      The aim of this investigation is to explore the effects of nonintubated thoracoscopic
      lobectomy on lung function protection in lung cancer patients, comparing with the standard
      intubated patients as a control. The investigators are going to enrol 82 lung cancer patients
      and randomize them equally to complete thoracoscopic lobectomy with lymphadenectomy either
      with a nonintubated technique (n=41) or an intubated technique (n=41). The assessment of lung
      function will be obtained from serial blood gas analyses using PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Additionally,
      oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines will be measured from serial blood samples
      including 8-isoprostane, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6,
      interleukin-10, S100-β and neuron specific enolase.
