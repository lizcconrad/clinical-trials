  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborns and children with life-threatening heart and lung failure may require support with
      ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). With ECMO, oxygen and carbon dioxide are
      exchanged and circulated throughout the body even if the heart is unable to do so.
      Unfortunately, ECMO can cause breakdown of the red blood cells (known as hemolysis). For
      unclear reasons, newborns are at particularly high risk of hemolysis while being supported by
      ECMO. The amount of hemolysis is measured with concentrations of a breakdown product from red
      blood cells known as free hemoglobin. One possible reason for high free hemoglobin levels in
      newborns on ECMO could be related to another blood protein called haptoglobin. Haptoglobin is
      known to help in clearing free hemoglobin through the kidneys into the urine. However,
      haptoglobin levels in newborns can be very low and increases slowly during the first few
      months of life. Free hemoglobin may be inappropriately high in newborns supported by ECMO
      because of low levels of haptoglobin. The purpose of this study is to characterize
      haptoglobin, free hemoglobin, and hemolysis in newborns and children supported by ECMO and
      compare those values to age-matched newborns and children not on ECMO.

    <description>Serum Haptoglobin (Hp) will be measured daily for 7 days in subjects supported by Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). In particular, the relative deficiency of Hp production in neonates will be associated with higher Hp levels. In older children with normal and adequate Hp production, there will be consistently low fHgb concentrations regardless of the other risk factors for hemolysis during ECMO support.</description>

    <description>Plasma free hemoglobin (fHgb) concentrations will be extracted from the medical record. Periods of high fHgb associated with hemolysis during ECMO support will be associated with deficiency of Hp at that time.</description>

    <time_frame>Daily for 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Serum Hp and fHgb will be measured daily for 3 days in age-matched control subjects to characterize levels in a cohort of critically-ill children comparable to the ECMO cohort. Neonates and children with non-ECMO supported critical illness will have negligible risk for hemolysis and, thus, low plasma fHgb. Serum Hp concentrations will be similar to the previously-characterized norms in healthy subjects (eg. deficient at birth until 6-12 months of age).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ECMO group - Thirty critically-ill children (age newborn to 18 years) who are
             intubated and supported by ECMO. We will target enrollment of 15 subjects less than 12
             months of age (with at least 10 subjects enrolled less than 6 months of age) and 15
             subjects over 12 months of age. These targets are set to address the secondary aim in
             the context of normal adult-level haptoglobin concentrations reportedly achieved by
             6-12 months of age.

          -  Age-matched control group - Sixty critically-ill children (age newborn to 18 years)
             who are intubated with acute respiratory failure due to any cause and not supported by
             ECMO. Two control subjects will be enrolled for every 1 experimental ECMO subject.
             Age-matching will be performed by the following age groups:

               -  Neonates 37-40 weeks gestation

               -  Neonates 40-42 weeks gestation

               -  Neonates 42-44 weeks gestation

               -  Neonates 44-46 weeks gestation

               -  Neonates 46-48 weeks gestation

               -  Infants 2-4 months of age

               -  Infants 4-6 months of age

               -  Infants 6-12 months of age

               -  Children 1-4 years of age

               -  Children 4-8 years of age

               -  Children 8-12 years of age

               -  Children 12-18 years of age

        Age-matched control subjects will proceed through the 3 total blood sample collections even
        if endotracheal extubation occurs within the 3 days of study participation. Age-matching is
        intended to collect a sample population comparable to the ECMO subject population. We will
        not match to gender.

        Exclusion Criteria (both groups, ECMO and age-matched controls):

          -  Personal or family history of thrombotic, hemorrhagic, or hemolytic disease.

          -  Personal history of hematologic malignancy.

          -  Premature neonates less than 37-weeks gestation and/or less than 2 kg in weight.

          -  Infection will not be an excluding factor for either subject group.
