  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study 19131 is designed to evaluate safety, efficacy, RP2D and PK of rogaratinib in
      combination with atezolizumab in patients with untreated FGFR-positive urothelial carcinoma.
      The study comprises two separate parts: Phase 1b (Part A) and Phase 2 (Part B).The study
      parts differ in design, objectives and treatment.

      The primary objectives of this Phase 1b study (Part A) are to determine the safety,
      tolerability,RP2D and pharmacokinetics of rogaratinib in combination with atezolizumab in
      these patients.

      The primary objective of the Part B is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) according
      to RECIST v1.1 of rogaratinib in combination with atezolizumab over placebo in combination
      with atezolizumab in untreated patients with FGFR-positive locally advanced or metastatic
      urothelial carcinoma.

      Of note, patients who participate in Part A are not allowed to participate in Part B.

      Part B will be initiated once the data from Part A supports continuation of the study, even
      if this occurs prior to primary completion of Part A. The sponsor may decide not to continue
      the study as a whole after completion of Part A if the data do not support further
      development.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival(PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 25 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part B Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time (days) from randomization to date of first observed disease progression (radiological or clinical, whichever is earlier) or death due to any cause, if death occurs before progression is documented. The actual date that the tumor scan was performed will be used for this calculation. If a tumor assessment is performed over more than one day (e.g. scans for chest and abdomen done on different days for the same evaluation), the earliest date will be used for the calculation of PFS. For patients without documented radiological or clinical progression or death at the time of analysis, PFS will be censored at the last actual visit date of tumor evaluation.
The primary analysis of PFS will be based on assessment by independent central review.</description>

    <description>A DLT is defined as any of the hematological, non-hematological or other TEAEs occurring during Cycle 1 and regarded by the investigators and/or sponsor to be related to rogaratinib or atezolizumab. The CTCAE v 4.03 will be used to assess toxicities / adverse events.</description>

    <description>Part A:Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Patients for whom best overall tumor response is not CR or PR, as well as patients without any post-baseline tumor assessment will be considered non-responders.
For all patients, the best overall tumor response will be determined locally by investigators using the RECIST criteria (v1.1).</description>
