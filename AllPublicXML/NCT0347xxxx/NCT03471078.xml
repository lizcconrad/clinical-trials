    <textblock>
      Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of avatrombopag in subjects with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia receiving
      chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian, non-small cell lung and bladder cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive placebo controlled test treatment for one cycle of chemotherapy
      followed by an observational cycle. Subjects will have the option to continue into an open
      label extension period for all remaining chemotherapy cycles within the current regimen.
      After the follow-up visit, all subjects will continue to a long-term safety follow-up period.
