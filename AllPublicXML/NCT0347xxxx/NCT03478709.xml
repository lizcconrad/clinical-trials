  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn) was proposed as a marker of vascular
      tone. It is calculated by the ratio of the respiratory variation of the pulse pressure and
      the respiratory variation of stroke volume. Despite several clinical studies, no study has
      really focused on the physiological significance of Eadyn. No study demonstrates at present,
      if this index is a reflect of macrocirculatory parameters (systemic resistances, blood
      pressure, arterial elastance, ventricular elastance, ventriculo-arterial coupling) or
      microcirculatory tone in the capillaries and small arterioles (critical capillary pressure or
      capillary resistance). the physicians don't know which variables are associated with this
      index. the hypothesis is that Eadyn is an indirect reflect of capillary pressure (PCC).

      The measurement of dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn) was proposed as a marker of vascular
      tone. It is calculated by the ratio of the respiratory variation of the pulse pressure and
      the respiratory variation of stroke volume. Despite several clinical studies, no study has
      really focused on the physiological significance of Eadyn. No study demonstrates at present,
      if this index is a reflect of macrocirculatory parameters (systemic resistances, blood
      pressure, arterial elastance, ventricular elastance, ventriculo-arterial coupling) or
      microcirculatory tone in the capillaries and small arterioles (critical capillary pressure or
      capillary resistance). the physicians don't know which variables are associated with this
      index. One hypothesis is that Eadyn is an indirect reflection of capillary pressure (PCC).
      The main objective of this project is to study the correlation between the measure of Eadyn
      and the PCC. The study begins when the physician in charge of the patient decides a
      hemodynamic treatment (either volume expansion or norepinephrine). The indication of the
      treatment is left to the discretion of the physician in charge of the patient: volume
      expansion or vasopressor agent. After verification of inclusion criteria, the physician
      collects demographic, ventilatory, hemodynamic, cardiac ultrasound data, and the type of
      treatment initiated (volume expansion, norepinephrine, and their dosages). 15 minutes after
      the introduction of the therapy and stabilization of the hemodynamic state, a new series of
      measurements of the aforementioned.
