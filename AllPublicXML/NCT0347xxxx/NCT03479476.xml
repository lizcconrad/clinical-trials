    <textblock>
      This study is a controlled trial of metformin in individuals with fragile X syndrome between
      the ages of 6 and 25 years. Participants will be randomized in a double-blind design to
      either drug or placebo and will attend three visits to the study site in a 4-month period for
      a series of tests. The primary objectives are to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      metformin in the treatment of language deficits, behavior problems, and obesity/excessive
      appetite in individuals with fragile X syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study at the UC Davis MIND Institute for fragile X syndrome (FXS)
      patients aged 6 to 25 years inclusive. It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial of metformin (also known as Glumetza, Glucophage, Fortamet), a type 2 diabetes
      medication that can also improve obesity and excessive appetite.

      Metformin has emerged as a candidate drug for the targeted treatment of FXS based on animal
      studies showing rescue of multiple phenotypes in the FXS model. Metformin may contribute to
      normalizing signaling pathways in FXS in the central nervous system, which may include
      activities of mTOR and PI3K, both of which have shown to be pathogenically overactive in FXS.
      In addition, metformin inhibits phosphodiesterase, which would lead to correction of cAMP
      levels, and MMP9 production, which is also elevated in FXS. Looking at the potential
      signaling pathways, metformin appears to be a good candidate for targeting several of the
      intracellular functions in neurons disrupted in FXS and, therefore, has potential to rescue
      several types of symptoms in individuals with FXS. The researchers have utilized metformin in
      the clinical treatment of over 20 individuals with FXS between the ages of 4 and 58 years and
      have found the medication to be well tolerated and to provide benefits not only in lowering
      weight gain and normalizing appetite but also in language and behavior. In this controlled
      trial, the researchers hope to further assess metformin's safety and benefits in the areas of
      language and cognition, eating and weight loss, and overall behavior.

      Each participant will be involved in this trial for a period of 4 months. This will include 3
      visits to the UC Davis MIND Institute and 5 phone calls. At each visit, the researchers will
      assess behavioral, cognitive, and language development. The researchers will also assess the
      side effects of the study medication throughout the trial.

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Expressive Language Sampling (ELS) mean Number of Different Words (NDW) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The ELS is collected from shared interactions around a digital wordless picture book involving the participant and the examiner. The primary outcome measure will be Number of Different Words (NDW) derived from transcripts of audiorecorded samples of spoken language taken from two sampling contexts (conversation and narration), according to procedures described by Abbeduto and colleagues (Abbeduto et al., 1995; Kover et al., 2012). Samples are collected pre- and post- treatment using different digital books on each occasion. The mean of NDW in conversation and NDW in narration will be computed, and statistically adjusted through analysis of covariance for differences in talkativeness as outlined in Conners et al., 2018. The mean NDW score ranges from 1 to infinite/unspecified. An increase (positive change) in score from baseline to follow-up indicates improvement. The greater the increase, the greater the improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the FXS-normed Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community Edition (ABC-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC-C is a 58-item caregiver-rated behavior scale used to examine treatment effects on challenging behaviors for individuals with FXS in the following domains: (1) irritability, agitation, crying; (2) lethargy, social withdrawal; (3) stereotypic behavior; (4) hyperactivity, noncompliance; and (5) inappropriate speech. Analysis will be performed utilizing the Sansone et al. (2012) FXS-normed ABC scoring measures.</description>

    <measure>Improvement of symptoms in FXS using the Clinical Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a clinician-rated scale utilizing history from the caregiver and incorporating it into a clinical rating, first for severity, and then for clinical follow-up. The CGI-S will be used at the baseline assessment to judge symptom severity as 1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill; 5 = Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; and 7 = Among the most extremely ill. The CGI-I will be used at the Week 8 and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits to judge the change in clinical impression as 1 = Very Much Improved; 2 = Much Improved; 3 = Minimally Improved; 4 = No Change; 5 = Minimally Worse; 6 = Much Worse; and 7 = Very Much Worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS will be used to measure the severity of three specific behavioral symptoms targeted in this study: behavior problems, language abilities, and eating behavior. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at the baseline visit and again at the Week 8 and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits. The calculated distance in cm between the visit marks thereby demonstrates whether each behavior stayed the same, improved, or worsened during the study and by how much. The scale is from 0 cm (defined as &quot;worst behavior&quot;) to 10 cm (&quot;behavior not a problem&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Third Edition (VABS-III) Adaptive Behavior Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment/Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The VABS-III is a caregiver survey interview that measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. It was designed to assess handicapped and non-handicapped persons in their personal and social functioning and is appropriate for individuals of all ages. The Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) score is calculated from the caregiver responses using age-adjusted scoring tables. ABC scores range from 20 to 160 and indicate low (20-70), moderately low (70-85), adequate (85-115), moderately high (115-130), or high (130-160) overall adaptive functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) overall score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SNAP-IV, based on DSM-V criteria for ADHD, is a caregiver-rated questionnaire that effectively identifies those with and without ADHD and accurately predicts presentation specifier (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and combined). Its psychometric properties and clinical utility have been demonstrated in multiple studies since its introduction in 2001, and it has been found to be reliable and well validated with normative data from both parents and teachers. It will be completed by caregivers of all participants at baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PedsQL) Parent Proxy overall score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, End of Treatment/Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL Parent Proxy consists of a series of questions relating to a child's quality of life and is administered to the caregiver of the participant. The parent proxy module designed for children 8-12 years of age will be administered to the caregivers of all participants, regardless of participant age, because the questions therein are most appropriate for the overall study population's cognitive age and ability. It will be completed at the baseline, Week 8, and End of Treatment/Week 16 visits. For any participants not in school, questions pertaining to &quot;school&quot; will be replaced with references to &quot;work&quot; or other activities in their life.</description>
