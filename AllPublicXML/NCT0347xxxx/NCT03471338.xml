  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system inflammatory disease that causes a
      chronic and progressive physical handicap. Though primarily considered as a motor disease, it
      may, in 40 to 65% of cases, cause cognitive function deficits, concerning mainly attention,
      information processing speed, executive functions and memory. The impairment of these various
      functions may significantly impair the patients' social, professional and family lives. As
      such, the presence of cognitive difficulties is more frequently associated with the onset of
      anxio-depressive psychiatric symptoms and with reduced quality of life to the extent that it
      can be estimated via psychometric scales, or by a more qualitative approach. Recent research
      has focused, not on demonstrating the existence of cognitive disorders in MS, but rather on
      attempting to reduce their daily impact through cognitive rehabilitation programmes. While
      encouraging, the available results are relatively discordant and further work is required to
      demonstrate the actual efficacy of such programmes applied to daily life and of their
      long-term effects.

      The main objective of this work is to evaluate, in patients suffering from MS and presenting
      with cognitive disorders and/or with complaints, the effect of an innovative computerised,
      semi-autonomous at-home cognitive rehabilitation programme, following care, on quality of
      life. The secondary objective is to estimate the improvement, or even stabilisation over
      time, of patients' cognitive performance and psycho-affective sphere.

      In this randomised trial, the investigators plan to include 40 patients suffering from the RR
      and SP forms of MS, distributed to two groups paired by age, gender and socio-cultural level,
      one of which will benefit from computerised management, along with at-home support from a
      psychologist, while the other receives only the support.

      This work is expected to provide two types of benefits. Firstly, to enable patients to better
      understand their cognitive function via daily management and as such to improve their quality
      of life and self-esteem. Secondly, to eventually allow more appropriate patient management by
      combining the quasi-systematic use of this programme with follow-up consultations with
      referring practitioners (neurologists, psychologists, etc.).
