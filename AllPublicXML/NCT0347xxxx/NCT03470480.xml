  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to use a randomized single-blind sham-controlled study to
      investigate if high frequency repetitive transmagnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) can modulate
      cue-induced craving in adult methamphetamine (METH) users. The investigators hypothesize that
      HF-rTMS directed at left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) will result in a reduction in
      craving for METH compared to sham-controlled rTMS in adults with methamphetamine use disorder
      (MUD) as evidenced by validated measures of METH craving. Neurobiologically, the
      investigators anticipate rTMS mediated stimulation of the DLPFC could result in inhibition of
      cue-induced craving through potential disruption of involved circuitry. The current project
      proposes that participants who are recently abstinent from METH will be randomized into four
      experimental groups to provide two rTMS conditions (real versus sham) and two picture cues
      conditions (METH versus neutral). The experiment will have an induction phase where each
      subject will receive 10 daily treatments within 2 weeks. Just before each rTMS/sham session
      participants will be shown visual cues (METH or neutral). Participants will then undergo a
      maintenance phase for an additional month with assessments to evaluate craving and relapse.
      Urine samples for urine drug screening (UDS) will be collected at screening day and on days
      1, 5 and 10. Just before each rTMS/sham session participants will be shown visual cues (METH
      and neutral). VAS craving scores will be assessed before and after picture presentation and
      after the rTMS/sham session. Before the first and 10th treatment session, participants were
      evaluated by the the Stimulant Craving Questionnaire (STCQ) and the Severity of Dependence
      Scale (SDS) questionnaires. Participants will then undergo a maintenance phase for an
      additional month. During the first week of maintenance, three rTMS/sham sessions will be
      administered. During each of the following 3 weeks, one rTMS/sham session will be given per
      week. As with the induction phase, urine samples will be collected for screening and STCQ and
      the SDS questionnaires will be completed at each maintenance session. To evaluate the
      long-term effects of the rTMS treatment, the investigators plan on contacting participants 6
      months after treatment termination for all subjects who completed the 10 treatment sessions.
      During that phone conversation, craving and relapse will again be assessed.

    <intervention_model_description>This preliminary study aims to consent and enroll 20 individuals with Methamphetamine Use Disorder. Participants will be randomized into two rTMS conditions (real versus sham) and two picture cues conditions (METH versus neutral). Randomization provides the following four groups: real METH (RM), real neutral (RN), sham METH (SM) and sham neutral (SN). The randomizations can be performed with a web-based randomization generator (www.randomization.com) (47). Subjects and rTMS administrators will be blinded to the treatment.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Effect of rTMS directed at left DLPFC on craving for methamphetamine as assessed by the Severity of Dependence Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) is a 5-item questionnaire that provides a score indicating the severity of dependence on methamphetamine. Each of the five items is scored on a 4-point scale (0-3). The total score is obtained through the addition of the 5-item ratings and will range from 0 to 15. The higher the score the higher the level of dependence. Pre and post differences in craving will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Effect of rTMS directed at left DLPFC on craving for methamphetamine as assessed by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a fixed-length horizontal line on which the participant draws a line between the two anchors of &quot;no cravings at all&quot; and &quot;most intense craving imaginable&quot;. The distance between the &quot;no cravings at all&quot; anchor and the participants line is measured and reported as a value between 0 and 100. The higher the value, the more intense the participants cravings are. Pre and post differences in craving will be assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stimulant Craving Questionnaire-Brief (STCQ) is a 10-item self-report measure that assesses current craving for methamphetamine, using a seven-point scale, with answers ranging from 0 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 6 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;). A composite score is generated for each participant by averaging the responses over all 10 questions. The scores can range from 0 to 6. The higher the composite score, the stronger the current craving. Pre and post differences in craving will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Effect of cue type (methamphetamine versus neutral) on methamphetamine craving after rTMS treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A composite craving score will be generated by adding each of the three craving measure scores (Severity of Dependence, Visual Analog Scale, and Stimulant Craving Questionnare) for each participant who received real rTMS treatments. The composite score can range from 0 to 121, where 0 indicates no cravings for methamphetamine and 121 is the strongest possible cravings for methamphetamine. Pre and post differences in craving will be compared between participants who were exposed to methamphetamine cues before each session and those who were exposed to neutral cues.</description>
