  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies ipilimumab and nivolumab with immunoembolization in treating
      participants with uveal melanoma that has spread to the liver. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      ipilimumab and nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Immunoembolization may kill tumor cells due to loss of blood supply and develop an immune
      response against tumor cells. Giving ipilimumab and nivolumab with immunoembolization may
      work better in treating participants with uveal melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical benefit of treatment with immunoembolization (IEMBO) in combination
      with ipilimumab and nivolumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine all treatment and immune related toxicities. II. Determine progression free
      survival. III. Determine overall survival.

    <description>Participants receive ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Participants also undergo immunoembolization on day 2. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with complete response, partial response, or stable disease may receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and undergo immunoembolization on day 2. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
