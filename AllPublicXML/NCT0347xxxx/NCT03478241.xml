      In this study the effect of different engine-driven nickel titanium (Ni-Ti) instrumentation
      systems (OneShape, Revo S and WaveOne) on postoperative dental pain in patients with
      asymptomatic teeth after a single-appointment root canal retreatment was evaluated.

      The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the effect of different engine-driven nickel
      titanium (Ni-Ti) instrumentation systems (OneShape, Revo S and WaveOne) on postoperative
      dental pain in patients with asymptomatic teeth after a single-appointment root canal
      retreatment. A total of a hundred thirty nine patients with asymptomatic teeth and with no
      contradictory medical history who were indicated for non-surgical retreatment at the
      Endodontic Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul Medipol University, between September and
      December 2016 were included in this study. All of the patients have been recruited from the
      Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. Out of a hundred thirty nine
      patients, a total of ninety-nine patients who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to
      participate was enrolled for the study and were divided into three groups (n=33). Consent was
      obtained from all study participants before the treatment. After removing previous root canal
      filling, instrumentation was performed using One Shape, Revo-S, and WaveOne in groups 1, 2,
      and 3, respectively. All retreatments were performed in a single appointment by one
      endodontist before permanent coronal restoration. Postoperative pain intensity was assessed
      at 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h; 7 days; and 1 month after the retreatment. The teeth was
      examined according to for pain intensity, percussion &amp; palpation sensitivity, swelling,
      analgesic intake and clinical status.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of the study was to assess if different nickel titanium root canal shaping systems influence the intensity and duration of postoperative pain in single-visit non-surgical root canal re-treatments. Postoperative pain was recorded using a four-level verbal rating scale, where 0 indicated no pain, 1 indicated slight pain, 2 indicated moderate pain, and 3 indicated sever pain. the patients were asked to return to the clinic for assessing postoperative pain (tenderness to palpation and percussion) at 24, 48, and 72 h; 7 days; and 1 month after the treatment. One clinician performed all the assessments at 24, 48, and 72 h; 7 days; and 1 month.</description>
