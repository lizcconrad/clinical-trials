  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the Indashyikirwa (&quot;Agents of Change&quot;) program
      is effective at preventing intimate partner violence (IPV) in communities in Rwanda.

      Because IPV has many causes, including factors that operate at the individual, couple, and
      community levels, the Indashyikirwa program is designed with multiple elements targeting
      multiple levels. A training program for couples covers gender, power, and relationship
      skills. Individual graduates this program who are interested and eligible go on to an
      activist training program to help support sustained change in their communities. Parallel
      activities operate at the Sector level to create and support change at the community level.
      Sector level activities include (1) training in gender and IPV prevention for local opinion
      leaders. (2) Establishment of &quot;Women's Spaces,&quot; which are drop in centers that provide
      support and referrals for women experiencing IPV as well as a wide range of community
      outreach services to educate communities about, gender, power, women's rights, and violence
      prevention.

      Because the intervention is comprised of multiple components and includes elements designed
      to be delivered at the Sector level, Sectors were chosen as the unit of randomization. 28
      sectors spread across 7 districts are participating; randomization as intervention or control
      was stratified across Districts to ensure adequate geographical spread of program delivery
      (Rwandan geographic administrative units are: Province &gt; District &gt; Sector &gt; Cell &gt; Village).
      Within each randomized sector are two separate assessments of program impact: (1) A &quot;Couple
      Cohort&quot; comprised of heterosexual couples who enrol together in the couples training program
      (some of whom continue into the activist training) compared to similarly situated couples in
      control communities who participate only in a standard, ongoing VSLA (village savings and
      loan association) program. Couples cohort members (both intervention and control) are
      surveyed at enrolment, 12 months post-baseline, and 24 months post-baseline. (2) A &quot;Community
      Survey&quot; designed to measure community diffusion of the intervention through the activities of
      the Women's Spaces, Opinion Leader Trainings, and activities of graduates of the activist
      training. The community survey comprises a repeat cross-sectional population-based household
      survey of married/cohabiting adults in intervention communities who are NOT direct
      participants in any of the formal trainings delivered by intervention implementation
      partners, conducted at baseline and 24 months only. This survey is designed to look at
      community level shifts in the occurrence of IPV, as well as changes in support for survivors
      and changes in attitudes among the general population.
