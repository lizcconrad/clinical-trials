  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate postprandial glucose excursions and gut hormone secretion after
      ingestion of meals with different glycaemic index (GI) values (high vs low) followed by an
      acute bout of exercise or rest in gastric bypass operated subjects and matched control
      subjects.
