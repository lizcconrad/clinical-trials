    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a home-based high intensity interval
      training intervention on exercise among low active adults (defined as engaging in exercise 90
      minutes or less per week). Participants will be randomly assigned to a HIIT-based
      intervention or a wait-list control each lasting 12 weeks (participants in the wait-list
      control condition will have the option of receiving the HIIT intervention following the 12
      weeks).

      The intervention will be a 12-week high intensity interval training workout that will consist
      of home-based exercise sessions prescribed by the exercise counselor. The exercise sessions
      will be based on exercises the participant can confidentially engage in (regular push-ups vs.
      knee push-ups vs. wall push-ups). The goal will be to engage in three exercise sessions per
      week. The participants will receive weekly telephone calls during the first month and
      bi-weekly calls during months 2 and 3. The exercise counselor will also engage in dialogue
      that will motivate the participant to exercise.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise minutes per week</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise minutes per week as assessed by an accelerometer for one week at baseline and 12 weeks. Higher reported minutes per week indicates a higher level of physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biometrics</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index will be calculated based on combining weight and height to report BMI as kg/m*2. The higher the number (level) of BMI, indicative of higher weight to height ratio.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Support for Exercise Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses the degree to which the individuals has friends and family who support their exercise. Participants rate how often family member or friend expresses social support for physical activity with scale (0=none, 4=very often). Overall total score range 0- 104 with subscales for family (0-52) and friends (0-52).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Self-efficacy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses the amount of confidence the individual has to engage in exercise. Five questions, responses are on a scale from 1- 5 with participants indicating how confident they are on that scale of engaging in exercise in that situation (1=not at all confident, 5=extremely confident). Range of scores 5-25.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses the degree to which the individual enjoys exercise. The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale is an 18-item scale that assesses enjoyment for physical activity by asking participants to rate &quot;how you feel at the moment about the physical activity you have been doing&quot; using a 7- point bipolar Likert scale, from 1 (I enjoy it) to 7 (I hate it). Eleven items were negatively worded and seven items were positively worded. After reverse scoring the 11negatively worded items, an overall enjoyment for physical activity score is determined by summing the items, with a range of 18-126 being possible. Higher scores indicate higher enjoyment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome Expectancies Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses what benefits the individual expects to gain from exercise. Responses on a scale from 1-5 (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree), with participants indicating how strongly they agree to potential outcomes of exercise. Scores range from 9-45 with higher scores indicating greater outcome expectation.</description>

    <description>The exercise group will participate in a home and telephone-based program consisting of a 12-week high intensity interval training workout (HIIT). The home-based exercise sessions will be prescribed by the program exercise counselor, with a goal to exercise three times per week. The program will be tailored to meet specific fitness and strength needs of the participant. The participant will receive weekly telephone calls during the first month and bi-weekly calls during months 2 and 3. At 12 weeks, participants in both the exercise and wait-list control group will complete online questionnaires. The ActiGraph will be returned to the University of Minnesota research staff via a pre-paid postage envelope.</description>
