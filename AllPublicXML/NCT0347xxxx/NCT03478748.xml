  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the impact of anticipatory guidance on the caries incidence of
      2-3-year-old preschool children and their 4-6-year-old siblings, as well as on their mothers'
      oral health literacy, as compared to the conventional Ministry of Health (MOH) programme.

      This quasi-experimental study was conducted at two government dental clinics in Batu Pahat
      District, Malaysia. The samples comprised of 478 mother-child-sibling trios (233 families in
      the intervention group, and 245 families in the control group). An oral health package named
      the Family Dental Wellness Programme (FDWP) was designed to provide anticipatory guidance to
      the intervention group at six-month intervals over three years. The control group received
      the standard MOH oral health education activities. The impact of FDWP on net caries
      increment, caries prevented fraction, and mother's oral health literacy was assessed after
      three years of intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>The model is an oral health education package that covers the following aspects: (i) cognitive component (for example, the provision of basic oral health knowledge using an anticipatory guidance technique); (ii) psychomotor component (for example, the demonstration of basic oral health skills such as toothbrushing skills with a hands-on practical); and (iii) attitude component (activities that help to improve the children's attitude towards oral health). Children (along with their older siblings and mothers) in the study group were required to make six-monthly visits to the dental clinic in the three-year study period. Those in the control group received the conventional Ministry of Health programme.</intervention_model_description>
