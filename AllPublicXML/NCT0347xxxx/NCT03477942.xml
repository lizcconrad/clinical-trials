  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with osteoarthritis of the knee fail non-operative measures and elect to have
      knee arthroplasty to improve their quality of life. If successful, intra-articular
      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injections into the knee may offer another viable non-operative
      treatment modality. Additionally, this modality may have reparative or regenerative
      potential, which could lead to the first treatment for osteoarthritis that treats the
      underlying disease as opposed to symptomatic control.

      Additionally, there are no acceptable non-surgical treatments for focal chondral defects of
      the knee. Surgical treatments that do exist have diminished outcomes if performed on patients
      older than age 30-40 years. If successful, intra-articular MSC injections into the knee would
      represent the first non-operative treatment for focal chondral defects and also represent a
      potential option for treatment in patients over the age of 30-40 years.

      This trial will be a prospective, single-center phase I pilot study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of a single intra-articular injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs
      in 16 subjects, 8 who have knee osteoarthritis and 8 who have a focal chondral defect in the
      knee. Patients will undergo a bone marrow harvest procedure at the Dahms Clinical Research
      Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. MSCs will be isolated and
      expanded. After approximately 2-3 weeks, patients will return for an intra-articular
      injection of 50x106 MSCs Subsequent study visits will occur on post-injection day 7 and
      months 2, 6, 12, and 24. Safety of intra-articular injection of MSCs will be evaluated at
      study visits by interval history, physical examination and assessment of any adverse events
      that are observed/reported. Additionally, efficacy will be evaluated by having patients
      complete functional outcome measures including: Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain, Knee
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee
      (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, and Lysholm Knee Scale. These will be completed at the
      pre-treatment visit and then repeated at the 2, 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up visits. Lastly,
      T1 rho and T2 mapping on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to assess for improved
      cartilage quality after intra-articular injection of MSCs. An MRI will be obtained at the
      pre-treatment visit. At the 12 and 24 month follow up visit, additional MRIs will be obtained
      and analyzed to compare the pre-treatment MRI to post-treatment MRIs.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Establish the safety and tolerability of expended autologous intraarticular MSC injections into the knee by the incidence of no major adverse events (AE) determined to be directly related to MSC injection by the end of the 24 month follow up period. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence during the clinical investigation in a patient administered stem cells that does not have a causal relationship with the treatment that occurs from the time of consent through the last clinic visit at 24 months post-injection. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of the investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product. AEs will be described by duration (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to investigational product, or if unrelated, the cause.</description>

    <measure>Secondary Endpoint: Development of Pain following injection based on Visual Analog Scale scoring.</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be analyzed based on visual analog pain scores (VAS) by clinically and statistically significant amounts by six-month follow up and maintain these improvements throughout the two-year study period. Data analysis will be performed separately on the knee osteoarthritis subgroup and on the focal chondral defect subgroup. This will consist of a comparison of mean values for VAS scoring scales pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, 12, and 24-months. Clinically significant outcomes will be determined based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) occurring for each respective scale, which is defined as the smallest change score needed for the effect to be considered clinically relevant; described below. Specifically, VAS represents a patient-reported measurement tool used to quantify perceived level of pain.</description>

    <description>Validated functional outcomes will be evaluated by clinically and statistically significant amounts by six-month follow up and maintain these improvements throughout the two-year study period. Data analysis will again be performed separately on the knee osteoarthritis subgroup and on the focal chondral defect subgroup. This will consist of a comparison of mean values for KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm scoring scales pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, 12, and 24-months. Clinically significant outcomes will be determined based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) occurring for each respective scale, which is defined as the smallest change score needed for the effect to be considered clinically relevant. Data will be collected from KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm scoring systems with post-treatment scores compared to pre-treatment scores. ANOVA methods, parametric or non-parametric as appropriate, will be used to establish significance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Endpoint: Reparative potential of intra-articular MSCs based on improvement in cartilage quality using MRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>T1 rho and T2 mapping observed from MRIs at 1-year and 2-year follow-up to determine the reparative potential of intra-articular MSCs. T1 rho values increase as degenerative changes worsen; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, it is expected that T1 rho values would increase. T2 mapping values primarily reflect changes in water content and collagen anisotropy. Focal areas of increased T2 mapping values correlate with focal areas of cartilage damage; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, T2 mapping values would decrease. Clinically significant changes will be observed by comparing T1 rho and T2 values in areas of relatively preserved hyaline cartilage within our patients with the areas of degenerative change to utilize an internal control. Data analysis will consist of a comparison of mean values for quantitative T1 rho and T2 mapping data pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 12 and 24-months.</description>
