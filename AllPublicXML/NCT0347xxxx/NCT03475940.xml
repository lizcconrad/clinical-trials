      Coagulopathy in cardiac surgery; a quaternary-care academic center experience

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      To determine incidence of coagulopathy after cardiac surgery in Thai people To determine
      incidence of resternotomy for stop bleeding, morbidity and mortality

      Secondary:

      To identify risk factors which associated with non-red cell transfusion and coagulopathy

      study decide: Retrospective chart review

      Data to be collected:

      Age*, gender* Body weight, height, body mass index* Underlying disease: DM, renal disease*,
      liver disease* Pre-op. Antiplatelet or anticoagulant* Pre-op coagulogram and platelet count*
      Emergency or elective surgery Resternotomy or not* Intraoperative blood component
      Intraoperative factor concentration Dose and timing of antifibrinolytic administration* CPB
      time* Postoperative body temperature*

      *Possible risk factors for non-red cell transfusion

      statistic: To assess the relationship between risk factors and non-red cell transfusion a
      univariate analysis was performed using an unpaired t-test and a Chi-square test.

      For higher accuracy regarding the impact of single risk factors, a multiple logistic
      regression analysis was also performed.
