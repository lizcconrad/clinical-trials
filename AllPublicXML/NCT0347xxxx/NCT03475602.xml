  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) remains a common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in
      adults and one of the leading known causes of end-stage renal disease. Identification of
      circulating autoantigens provide potential biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy of idiopathic
      membranous nephropathy. M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and Thrombospondin type-I
      domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) were identified as the target antigen in membranous nephropathy
      with high specificity and the concentration of serum anti-PLA2R antibody and anti-TSHD7A
      antibody were helpful for predicting disease activity. In our prospective cohort study,
      hospitalized patients diagnosed as IMN are prospectively studied. Circulating anti-PLA2R
      antibody and anti-THSD7A antibodies were recently screened by using enzyme-linked sorbent
      assay(ELISA). This study aims to analyse the difference of clinicopathological
      characteristics for different concentrations of serum anti PLA2R antibody and anti TSHD7A
      antibody, and analyze the association between baseline concentrations of serum antibody and
      disease activity. This study also explored the prediction effects of serum antibody
      concentrations with different types of therapeutic regimen in IMN and compare the curative
      effects of different types of therapeutic regimen in different serum antibody concentrations.
