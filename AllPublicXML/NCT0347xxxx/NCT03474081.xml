  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a progressive disease characterized by increasing obstruction to airflow and the
      progressive development of respiratory symptoms including chronic cough, increased sputum
      production, dyspnea and wheezing. Once-daily triple therapy of an Inhaled Corticosteroid/
      Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists/ Long Acting Beta-Agonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA) that is
      combination of FF/UMEC/VI in a single device is being developed with the aim of providing a
      new treatment option for the management of advanced COPD. The primary purpose of this study
      is to evaluate lung function and health related quality of life (HRQoL) after 84 days of
      treatment with a single inhaler triple therapy combination of FF/ UMEC/VI once daily via the
      ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler (DPI) compared with tiotropium once daily via HANDIHALER®, in
      subjects with COPD. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive FF/UMEC/VI or tiotropium in
      the morning for 84 days. Subjects will also receive albuterol/salbutamol as a rescue therapy
      throughout the study. Approximately 848 subjects with advanced COPD will be enrolled in the
      study. The total study duration will be approximately 17 weeks including, 4-week run-in
      period, 12-week treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period. ELLIPTA is a registered
      trademark of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of companies. HANDIHALER and RESPIMAT are registered

             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years]). Previous smokers are defined as those
             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  A score of &gt;=10 on the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Subjects must demonstrate at Screening: A post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;50 percent
             predicted normal or a post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;80 percent predicted normal and a
             documented history of &gt;=2 moderate exacerbations or one severe (hospitalized)
             exacerbation in the previous 12 months. Subjects must also have a measured post
             albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 at screening.

          -  Subjects must have been receiving daily maintenance treatment with tiotropium alone
             (via the HANDIHALER or RESPIMAT®) for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to

             study.

          -  Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of asthma

          -  Subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD.

          -  Subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer, and clinically significant:
             bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung
             disease or other active pulmonary diseases.

             load and low cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4] count, lupus on immunosuppressant's)
             that in the opinion of the investigator would increase risk of pneumonia or other risk
             factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis). Subjects at potentially high
             risk for pneumonia (e.g. very low body mass index [BMI], severely malnourished, or
             very low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening and at least 30 days following the last dose of

          -  Respiratory tract infection that has not resolved at least 7 days prior to Screening.

          -  Chest x-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence of pneumonia or a
             clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD, or
             another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an infiltrate on chest x-ray
             (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All subjects will have
             a chest x-ray at Screening Visit 1 (or historical radiograph or computerized
             tomography [CT] scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening). For sites in
             Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is
             not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained
             from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular,
             neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, gastrointestinal,
             urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin, sensory, endocrine (including
             uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are
             uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or
             which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition
             exacerbated during the study.

          -  Alanine Transaminase (ALT) &gt;2x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN); and bilirubin &gt;1.5x ULN

             bilirubin &lt;35 percent). Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of
             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment). Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g., presence
             of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or positive hepatitis C antibody test result at
             screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Subjects with any of the following at Screening (Visit 1): myocardial infarction or

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) finding at Visit
             1. The Investigator will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG
             finding in relation to the Subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             ECG tracing that is interpreted at, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial
             fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute (BPM); sustained
             and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); second degree heart block Mobitz type
             II and third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted);

             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 3 years.
             Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma and
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 3 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen therapy &gt;3 Liters

             infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit compliance for
             scheduled visits.

          -  Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, poor
             motivation or other conditions that will limit the validity of informed consent to
             participate in the study.

             be able to complete study related materials.

          -  Subjects taking following drug therapies will be excluded; subjects taking inhaled
             short-acting anticholinergics alone or along with short-acting beta agonist
