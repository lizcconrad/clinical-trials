  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the OptimAT study main goal is to validate a PBPK model for 3 direct oral
      anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) and 3 P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel,
      ticagrelor, prasugrel) in hospitalized patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with antithrombotics are at risk of both severe ischemic and bleeding
      events. However, current clinical scores are insufficiently discriminant to predict the most
      favorable drug and dosing for an improved net clinical benefit. Physiologically and
      population-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK and POPPK respectively) incorporate substrate
      specific properties obtained from experimental in-vitro experiments as well as patients'
      demographic, genetic and physiological in vivo data in order to characterize the
      dose-concentration relationships. As such, they can be used to simulate and predict PK
      profiles accounting for specific patients' characteristics and are the basis of dosing
      optimization. These models could be a valuable tool to predict antithrombotic blood
      concentration in a given patient. Our main goal is to elaborate predictive models
      characterizing the dose-concentration relationship with influencing variables of three direct
      oral anticoagulants (DOAC) (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) and three P2Y12 inhibitors
      (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) in hospitalized patients, which will serve as basis for
      drug selection and dosage optimization.
