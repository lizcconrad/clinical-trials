  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-masked, uncontrolled, multi-center, study in which participants will be randomized to
      one of 3 doses of topical ocular PAN 90806 administered once daily for 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed, active, pathologic CNV associated with neovascular AMD will be
      screened for inclusion into the study after providing written informed consent. Participants
      who are eligible for the study will be centrally randomized at Day 1 to one of three doses of
      PAN-90806 Eye Drops. Participants will be instructed to apply one drop of PAN-90806 to the
      ocular surface of the identified study eye once daily for twelve (12) weeks.

      Participants will return for follow-up visits at Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, 1 week
      after stopping PAN-90806 treatment and 1 month after stopping PAN-90806 treatment.
