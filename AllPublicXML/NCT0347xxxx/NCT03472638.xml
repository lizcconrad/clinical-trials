  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial with a crossover design will examine the efficacy of rTMS targeting the
      dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as a treatment for medication-resistant major depression in
      patients meeting diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients meeting standard DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder, who
      also meet diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode that has not responded to
      medication, will be eligible for inclusion. In a study with a randomized crossover design,
      they will undergo a course of either either active followed by sham or sham followed by
      active treatment. Each phase (active or sham) will involve 15 days of rTMS targeting the
      bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, 5x weekly, twice-daily with sessions 1 hour apart,
      using 20 Hz stimulation. Followup visits will occur at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after both courses
      of treatment.

          -  have failed to achieve a clinical response to an adequate dose of an antidepressant
             based on an Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) score of &gt; 3 in the current
             episode OR have been unable to tolerate at least 2 separate trials of antidepressants
             of inadequate dose and duration (ATHF 1 or 2)

          -  have a score â‰¥18 on the HRSD-17 item

          -  able to adhere to the treatment schedule

          -  pass the TMS safety-screening questionnaire

          -  have normal thyroid functioning and no clinically significant abnormalities on CBC, on

             subject blinding

          -  Have any significant neurological disorder or insult including, but not limited to:
             any condition likely to be associated with increased intracranial pressure, space

             ECT, cerebral aneurysm, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, multiple sclerosis,

          -  Medication: currently (or in the last 4 weeks) taking more than lorazepam 2 mg daily
             (or equivalent) or any dose of an anticonvulsant due to the potential to limit rTMS
             efficacy. Medication regimen should be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to first rTMS
             treatment.

          -  Alcohol or substance use: severe substance use disorder (based on DSM-5 diagnostic
