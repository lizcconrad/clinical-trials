      Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) encountered
      in clinical practice. Functional dyspepsia is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic
      and recurrent gastroduodenal symptoms in the absence of any organic or metabolic disease that
      is likely to explain the symptoms.Functional dyspepsia has a high incidence in the
      population.Clinical diagnosis is notoriously unreliable in diagnosing the underlying cause of
      dyspepsia,but a number of alarm features have been suggested as indicating patients at higher
      risk for serious disease.However, previous studies noted that the sensitivity of alarm
      features for predicting cases with upper GI malignancies is unsatisfactory. The predictive
      value of alarm symptoms still require more researches. Rome IV was introduced in 2016. Rome
      IV introduced more precisely define the minimal thresholds for frequency and severity of each
      individual symptom, primarily for scientific purposes,but data still need to be collected to
      define thresholds based on the frequency and/or severity of symptoms that impair quality of
      life.A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the predictive value of alarm symptoms
      in patients with dyspepsia based on Roman IV.All patients who were satisfied with the
      inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria in the department of the second affiliated hospital
      of Xi'an jiaotong university received investigation.Inclusion criteria included:Symptoms of
      upper digestive tract for more than 6 months or 3 monthes（postprandial fullness, early
      satiation,epigastric pain, and epigastric burning）;Older than 18;From March 2018 to June
      2018，received gastroscope and upper abdominal B ultrasound examination;agreeing the informed
      consent.Data collection:Basic information：name, age, height, weight, gender,
      marriage;Dyspepsia: symptoms of indigestion, duration of indigestion, and weekly incidence of
      indigestion;Abnormal symptoms: weight loss, anemia, anorexia, vomiting, blackstool,
      dysphagia;Lifestyle habits: spicy food, smoking, drinking, sleep quality, daily exercise
      time;Family history, helicobacter pylori infection, abdominal color ultrasound
      results,Cost.Through endoscopy results to determine whether dyspepsia is organic or
      functional, benign or malignant, through contacts with the basic data, to determine the alarm
      symptoms.Further more, this study was proved by the ethical committee of second hospital of
      Xi'an jiaotong university.
