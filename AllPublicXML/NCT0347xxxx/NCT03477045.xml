  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fish oil and oily fish contain omega 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids known to be
      beneficial to health. Many people consume little, despite UK government recommendations to
      eat at least one portion of oily fish per week. Furthermore, despite modest consumption, fish
      stocks are declining due to over fishing. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative,
      sustainable and cost efficiently produced dietary source. A seed oil source of these fish
      oil-type fatty acids has been achieved by adding genes from other plant sources to the oil
      seed plant Camelina sativa. Camelina sativa, related to mustard and cabbage, has provided
      seed oil for human consumption for thousands of years. It was the most important oil seed
      plant in Europe until the 1900's. This research is being done to see if consuming fish
      oil-type fatty acids in Camelina seed oil allows the body to take up and use the fish oil
      fatty acids in the same way as it does from fish oil.

      This research is being done to see if consuming fish oil-type omega 3 long chain
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in Camelina seed oil allows the body to take up the fish oil
      fatty acids in the same way as it does from fish oil.

      In the first study (A) the Camelina oil will be used in a meal. The volunteers (healthy men
      and women) will be asked to consume the meal and provide blood samples in the following 6
      hours to look at immediate uptake of the fish oil fatty acids. This will be repeated (for
      comparison) with fish oil.

      The second study (B) will look at consumption over a longer period. Volunteers will be asked
      to consume the Camelina oil daily for 8 weeks and provide blood samples at the visits at the
      start and end of that period. This will be repeated (for comparison) with fish oil.
