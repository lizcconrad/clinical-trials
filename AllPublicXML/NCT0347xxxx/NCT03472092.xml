  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more effective in engaging
      and changing brain mechanisms associated with predicting a reduction in headaches than pill
      based therapies (placebo or amitriptyline).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric migraine is a prevalent disorder that results in significant pain and disability
      for children and adolescents. Little is known about the distinct brain changes that occur in
      youth with migraine when they receive cognitive behavioral therapy, which is known to
      decrease headache days for these patients. Pediatric medical and behavioral clinicians can
      use mechanistic insights from this study to provide patients and families with a stronger
      rationale for treatment, thereby decreasing stigma and increasing confidence in and
      commitment to the care plan.

      This project will study migraine, which affects &gt; 6 million youth in the U.S. Cochrane
      reviews show that psychological therapies for pediatric headache result in better outcomes
      than control conditions (56% improved vs. 22% in 714 participants), and our CBT+Amitriptyline
      Study found that 66% of youth with chronic migraine had a ≥ 50% reduction in headache days
      compared to 36% in an education control+Amitriptyline (AMI) group. Despite this evidence
      base, the neural mechanisms supporting the efficacy of CBT for pain remain poorly understood.
      The lack of mechanistic understanding is a barrier to treatment utilization, particularly
      given the time, effort, and expense for pediatric migraine patients to receive CBT vs.
      conventional pharmacological therapy (which in a national trial reduced headache days similar
      to placebo pill: AMI 52% of participants improved; Placebo 61%). Pilot data from the
      investigators demonstrate that: CBT induces changes in brain connectivity/activation, and QST
      at baseline predicts reduced migraines at 8 weeks.

To maintain blinding, all participants will receive 1 matching capsule as a daily dose to be taken each evening during the study. For this study, a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day will be provided for the 1st 2 weeks, followed by a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks and a maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks based on tolerability. Participants experiencing tolerability issues, may be held a current dose rather than titrated to the next dosage if deemed appropriate by the study doctor.</description>
