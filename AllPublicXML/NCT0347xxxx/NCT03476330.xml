  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive bone
      marrow failure, variable congenital abnormalities and a predisposition to malignancy,
      particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Improved
      transplant outcomes are modifying the natural history of Fanconi Anemia. Improved transplant
      survival, no radiation exposure, and almost no GVHD increases the importance of addressing
      later SCC even further. The investigators hypothesize that quercetin will prevent or delay
      the development of SCC and associated complications, there by ameliorating or delaying the
      need for potentially lethal treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for the
      same.

      Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive bone
      marrow failure, variable congenital abnormalities and a predisposition to malignancy,
      particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Currently, the
      only curative treatment option for the hematological complications of FA include
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The investigators hypothesize that quercetin will
      prevent or delay the development of SCC and associated complications, there by ameliorating
      or delaying the need for potentially lethal treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation
      therapy for the same.

      This study is an open-label, single arm study. This study will enroll 38 post-HCT patients
      with FA, and up to 7 patients with FA without history of HCT. In both groups, patients with
      or without evidence of any pre-malignant lesions concerning for SCC, history of SCC or active
      SCC may be allowed to participate if they wish so and at the discretion of the PI. All
      patients will be treated with oral quercetin for a total of 24 months.

      The investigators will determine the efficacy of Quercetin in reducing buccal micronuclei (a
      surrogate marker of DNA damage and susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma due to genomic
      instability) in post-HCT patients with fanconi anemia (FA).
