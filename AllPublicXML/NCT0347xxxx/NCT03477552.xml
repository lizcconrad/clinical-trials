    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this randomized, controlled, open-label study is to determine the
      efficacy of AccuveinV400 (a transillumination veins device) to facilitate peripheral
      intravenous (IVP) catheter placement during a vaso-oclusive crisis. The investigators
      hypothesized that the number of attempts to a successful placement of a peripheral IV, our
      primary outcome, would be shorter with the assistance of the Accuvein V400. It is also
      expected that AccuveinV400 will reduce the time of the procedure, the rate of failure, the
      technique-related pain.

    <intervention_model_description>Adult sickle cell patients who need of a new peripheral intravenous catheter placement (for fluid or porphine therapy) will be randomized between two arms : usual technique or use of the AccuveinV400® device). The randomization list (ratio 1: 1) will be made by the statistician of the study using the SAS software and balanced by random blocks of small size (2, 4, 6) to make it unpredictable. The randomization will be stratified on the center and the number of hospitalizations in the previous year (&gt;3, &lt;3).</intervention_model_description>
