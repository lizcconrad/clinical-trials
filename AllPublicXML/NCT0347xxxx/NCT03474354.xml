      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the distribution of radiopaque microspheres
      loaded with doxorubicin in the treatment of unresectable HCC. Prospective, single arm, open
      label, single centre, pilot study. All patients will undergo clinical follow-up. Twenty
      patients will be enrolled.

      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the distribution of radiopaque microspheres
      loaded with doxorubicin in the treatment of unresectable HCC. Prospective, single arm, open
      label, single centre, pilot study. All patients will undergo clinical follow-up. Twenty
      patients will be enrolled. Primary endpoint : Local response (evaluated with CT and MRI at 4
      to 6 weeks post each procedure and at 6 months according to mRECIST) in patients with
      intermediate-stage HCC following chemoembolisation with radiopaque bead. Secondary endpoints
      include: 1) Better definition of end point of embolization for drug eluting beads : Ability
      to achieve near-stasis during chemoembolisation procedure in the tumour feeding vessels using
      intra-procedural imaging feedback from the radiopaque bead (early visualization of non target
      embolization 2) Total dose needed for tumor devascularization 3)Distribution of radiopaque
      beads and correlation with necrosis and adverse events

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is at least 18 years old.

          2. HCC diagnosed according to updated American Association for the Study of Liver
             Diseases (AASLD) criteria.

          3. Barcelona Criteria Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B patients or BCLC stage A patients not
             candidates for curative treatment (resection, transplantation, ablation) or who have
             failed/recurred after resection/ablation).

          4. Tumour burden (located in one or two lobes) that can be sufficiently and selectively
             embolised with required dose or radiopaque bead loaded with doxorubicin.

          5. Performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0/1.

          6. Normal liver or compensated cirrhosis with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A
             score and Child/Pugh B≤ 7 points ) without ascites.

          7. Total bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dl.

          8. Adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 X ULN).

          9. Patient has provided written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient previously treated with any intra-arterial therapy for HCC.

          2. Eligible for curative treatment (resection/RadioFrequency Ablation-RFA,
             transplantation therapies).

          3. Advanced liver disease: Child-Pugh's C class or active gastrointestinal bleeding,
             encephalopathy. Bilirubin levels &gt;2.0 mg/dl.

          4. Advanced tumoural disease: BCLC class C (vascular invasion -even segmental,
             extra-hepatic spread or cancer-related symptoms=ECOG of 1-2) or D class (WHO
             performance status 3 or 4, Okuda III stage).

          5. Patient with another primary tumour.

          6. Patient with refractory ascites or on diuretic treatment; minor ascites retention
             detected at imaging and not requiring diuretics to be solved is not a
             contraindication.

          7. Patient with history of biliary tree disease or biliary dilatation.

          8. Portal vein thrombosis, porto-systemic shunt, hepatofugal blood flow or absent portal
             blood flow in the liver area to be treated.

          9. Contraindication to multiphasic CT and MRI (e.g. allergy to contrast media).

         10. Any other contraindication for embolisation or local doxorubicin treatment.

         11. Patients currently receive treatment with any investigational drug/device/intervention
             or have received any investigational product within 1 month or 5 half-lives of the
             investigational agent (whichever is longer) before study treatment.

         12. In the Investigator's opinion patient has (a) co-morbid condition(s) that could limit
             the patient's ability to participate in the study, compliance with follow-up
             requirements or impact the scientific integrity of the study.

         13. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
