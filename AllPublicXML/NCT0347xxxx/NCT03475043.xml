    <textblock>
      Millions of elderly adults in the USA have age related hearing loss (ARHL), a malady that
      affects half of adults 60-69 years, and the majority of older adults. This hearing loss not
      only impacts communication and functional ability, but also is strongly associated with
      cognitive decline and decreased quality of life. This project aims to develop effective
      strategies to compensate and reverse this process through a deeper understanding of
      plasticity and adaptive auditory function, and how to engage it and harness it to remedy
      ARHL.

    <textblock>
      The detrimental effects of aging on auditory temporal processing have been well documented in
      humans and animal models. At present, there are gaps in knowledge of the extent to which
      these auditory temporal processing deficits can be mitigated in older adults with or without
      hearing loss through auditory training and neuroplasticity, to improve precision of neural
      timing and speech understanding. The long-term goal is to determine the extent to which
      hearing deficits in older adults can be ameliorated with auditory training. The investigators
      propose an innovative approach to the investigation of aging, hearing, and neuroplasticity by
      marrying perceptual training experiments with electrophysiological measurements. The
      objectives are to compare young normal-hearing (YNH), older normal-hearing (ONH), and older
      hearing-impaired (OHI) adult listeners, and evaluate the improvements in perceptual and
      electrophysiological measures of temporal processing after explicit training on auditory
      temporal processing tasks. The central hypothesis is that training of auditory temporal
      processing will produce concomitant improvements in both perceptual performance and neural
      encoding, which will close the gap in the age-related differences between groups. The central
      hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Determine the extent to which
      perceptual training on temporal rate discrimination using simple non-speech stimuli improves
      perceptual and neural encoding in YNH, ONH, and OHI listeners; (2) Determine the extent to
      which perceptual training on speech cue discrimination in contrasting words differing in
      discrete temporal cues improves perceptual and neural encoding in YNH, ONH, and OHI
      listeners; and (3) Determine the extent to which perceptual training on the processing of
      sentences with increasing presentation rate can improve behavioral performance and neural
      encoding in YNH, ONH, and OHI listeners. The expected outcomes are that the investigators
      will learn what perceptual training tasks lead to simultaneous improvements in perceptual and
      neural auditory temporal processing and the findings will produce a significant impact in
      older listeners who experience difficulty in communicating in daily life because they will
      lead directly to focused and novel forms of rehabilitation. This research is innovative
      because the investigators will have established techniques that are proven to provide
      significant improvements in auditory temporal processing and speech perception, combined with
      evidence of improvements to neural encoding. These studies will serve the larger goals of the
      program project grant because they will help identify the neuroplastic mechanisms in the
      brain of humans that correspond to successful behavioral outcomes in younger and older
      adults.
