    <textblock>
      This study examines whether a safety-net primary care CKD registry directed at the entire
      primary care team can enhance the delivery of guideline concordant CKD care, including BP
      control, ACEi/ARB use and albuminuria quantification.

    <description>The CKD registry provided primary care practice teams with point-of-care data about patient-specific CKD status, recent ambulatory clinic blood pressure (BP) readings, status of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) prescription, and quantification of albuminuria (UACR). It also provided data about diabetes care, immunization status, and data pertinent to age appropriate cancer screening, to align with usual care. Point-of-care decision support reminded primary care providers (PCPs) about guideline concordant care for individuals with CKD. Quarterly feedback to practice teams and individual PCPs identified patients with CKD and BP &gt;140/90 mmHg, those not prescribed an ACEi/ARB, and those with albuminuria.</description>

    <description>Usual care consisted of an electronic registry that was in use before trial implementation. It provided practice teams with point-of-care data about diabetes care, age-appropriate cancer screening and immunizations, but no CKD-related data. Medical assistants were encouraged to use the usual care registry to identify patients who were due for cancer screening or immunizations. Quarterly feedback was not provided for practice teams randomized to receive usual care.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All PCPs who worked in practice teams and provided longitudinal primary care to patients
        were eligible to participate in this study. Practice teams that consisted of several
        physicians (+/- trainees), one nurse, nurse practitioners, medical assistants and
        behaviorists, were randomized 1:1 to one of two arms with a random number generator: access
        to an electronic CKD registry or a usual care registry for 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        PCPs who solely provided specialty care, for example HIV services or urgent care, were
        excluded.
