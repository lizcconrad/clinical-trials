  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine whether lemborexant as compared to placebo
      decreases the peripheral oxygen saturation during total sleep time in healthy adult and
      elderly participants after a single dose of treatment and to determine whether it increases
      the apnea-hypopnea index after single and multiple doses of treatment in adult and elderly
      participants with mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

      HV Cohort:

      The HV Cohort comprises a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover
      study. Eligible healthy adult and elderly participants will be randomized to treatment
      sequence A, B, or C, each consisting of 3 Treatment Periods, each of one night's duration, in
      which participants will receive a single dose of lemborexant 10 milligrams (mg), or
      lemborexant 25 mg, or placebo. Treatment Periods will be separated by a washout interval of
      at least 14 days. A sufficient number of participants will be randomized to ensure that 8
      evaluable adult participants (&lt;65 years) and 4 evaluable elderly participants (≥65 years)
      complete the study.

      OSA Cohort:

      The OSA Cohort comprises a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover
      study. Adult and elderly participants with mild OSA will be randomized to treatment sequence
      D or E, each consisting of 2 Treatment Periods, each of 8 nights' duration, in which
      participants will receive lemborexant 10 mg or placebo. The Treatment Periods will be
      separated by a washout interval of at least 14 days. A sufficient number of participants will
      be randomized to ensure that 20 evaluable adult participants (&lt;65 years) and 10 evaluable
      elderly participants (≥65 years) complete the study.

             the participant's safety or interfere with study assessments

          -  Current evidence of other clinically significant disease (e.g., psychiatric disorders,
             disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, respiratory system, endocrine
             system, hematological system, neurological system, cardiovascular system, or a

             treated basal cell carcinoma or in situ carcinoma of the cervix), or chronic pain that

             with the study assessments. Participants for whom a sedating drug would be
             contraindicated for safety reasons because of the participant's occupation or
             activities are also excluded. Participants with insomnia disorder, who complain of
             difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance, are eligible provided that
             they meet this criterion. Note that medications to treat insomnia are prohibited.
