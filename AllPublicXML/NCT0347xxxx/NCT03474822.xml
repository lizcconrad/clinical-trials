  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminarily evaluate the
      effectiveness of Plasmodium immunotherapy for advanced breast cancers and advanced liver
      cancers.The treatment will last 3-6 months from the day of successful infection and will be
      terminated by antimalarial drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to enroll 30 patients in each type of cancer. Each patient will be vaccinated
      with P.vivax-infected red blood cells containing approximately 0.3-1.0 × 10^7 Plasmodium
      parasites and be observed for the exact infection time, parasitemia condition and infection
      course; principal clinical symptoms such as fever; gastrointestinal reaction; peripheral
      blood parameters; the changes in heart, lung, liver and kidney function. Preliminarily
      observe the changes in the primary and metastatic lesions of the cancer, the tolerance of
      patients to Plasmodium infection, changes in tumor-related parameters and immunological
      related parameters.The duration of the planned treatment of each subject is 3-6 months. The
      successful infection will be indicated by microscopic observation of parasitemia in
      peripheral blood samples, and the time of the treatment course is based on the presence of
      peripheral parasitemia. After 3-6 months, parasitemia will be terminated by antimalarial
      drugs for terminating the treatment of Plasmodium immunotherapy (the immunological treatment
      effect may persist after the termination of Plasmodium infection).
