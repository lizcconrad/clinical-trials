  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in younger women with early breast cancer (EBC) has
      substantially improved the long-term outcome. However, this benefit is associated with
      long-term toxic effects which are becoming more important as prognosis improves. These
      include premature menopause and infertility in young pre-menopausal women. The incidence of
      premature menopause depends on the type and intensity of chemotherapy and the patient's age.
      In women &lt;35 years old, the long-term (3 years after diagnosis) incidence of amenorrhea is
      similar to women who have not received chemotherapy, at âˆ¼ 10%, but this increases to 50% in
      women between 35 and 40 years old, and can be up to 85% in women &gt;40 years. Premature ovarian
      failure has major consequences including sexual dysfunction and infertility, and the latter
      may be of great concern to younger patients with breast cancer and has a bearing in
      influencing treatment decisions in almost 30% of cases.

      Currently, there is no standard treatment for preventing chemotherapy-induced ovarian
      failure. Previous studies have suggested that temporary ovarian suppression with a
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue may preserve ovarian function both in humans
      and animal models. Clinical data are conflicting. For example, a recent Italian multi-center
      phase III study Prevention of Menopause-Induced by Chemotherapy: A Study in Early Breast
      Cancer Patients-Gruppo Italiano Mamella 6 (PROMISE-GIM6) reported that the use of GnRH
      analogue, triptorelin during chemotherapy in pre-menopausal patients with EBC, reduced the
      occurrence of chemotherapy-induced early menopause with four pregnancies after a 26-month
      follow-up [one in the chemotherapy alone arm and three in the triptorelin with chemotherapy
      arm]. In contrast, another trial suggested that the use of goserelin concurrently with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly reduce incidence of amenorrhea 6 months after
      the end of chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone and only two
      pregnancies were recorded [one in each arm] with a follow-up of 2 years.

      In this phase II trial, patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to standard
      adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the GnRH agonist goserelin (goserelin group) or to
      chemotherapy without goserelin (chemotherapy alone group).

      For Patients randomly assigned to the goserelin group, goserelin at a dose of 3.6 mg will be
      administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks beginning 1 week before the initial chemotherapy
      dose and will be continued to within 2 weeks before or after the final chemotherapy dose.

      Follow up: All patients will be followed for at least 1 year clinically monthly and by
      laboratory assessment by hormonal profile (FSH, LH, E2) every 6 months.
