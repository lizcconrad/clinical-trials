      Aqueduct's Smart External Drain (SED) will be compared to the current gold standard for
      temporary CSF management in a hospital setting.

        -  Evaluate the number of subjects requiring to be switched to a standard of care EVD

        -  Evaluate subject transport while on the SED

        -  Evaluate SED system control from initiation of SED through discharge of external drain
           system

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate Aqueduct's Smart External Drain (SED) upon implementation
      of ventriculostomy or lumbar drain placement for temporary CSF external management in a
      hospital setting. Subjects will remain on study from the time of SED application through
      discharge of the external drain or switch to standard of care extraventricular drain.
