  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficiency and safety between gene-oriented group and standard care group
      during 90 days of initial warfarin-treatment for requiring anticoagulation patients with
      valve replacement or atrial fibrillation with or without valvular heart disease。

      Due to narrow therapeutic window, and individual differences in dosage, inappropriate use of
      warfarin may lead to serious complications and ineffective. Based on the results of the
      research on the transformation of warfarin pharmacogenomics, this study investigates the
      clinical application of gene-directed warfarin dose prediction model through the preset
      dosage regimen of warfarin during the initial treatment phase. Compared with the conventional
      treatment, that is to say empirical medication, this study is to verify the feasibility and
      value of gene-oriented warfarin dose prediction model, in order to establish a practical
      guidance to optimize the rational use of warfarin treatment program, to enable patients to
      obtain effective, safe warfarin dose, and to achieve the established anticoagulant strength
      faster and safer, as the same time, to reduce the times of patients was blood and the
      incidence of bleeding/embolism, and to save costs and ensure the safety of warfarin clinical
      medication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged from 18 to 70 years old, requiring anticoagulation because of valvular
             or non-valvular atrial fibrillation or after valvular replacement. Patients could
             visit to be followed up in our hospital clinic regularly and agree to participate in
             the clinical trial and sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the trial if aged &lt;18 years old or &gt; 75 years old,
             pregnant and lactating, if treated tricuspid valve replacement, or coronary artery
             bypass grafting before, if diagnosed with congenital heart disease, if known their
             CYP2C9 or VKORC1 genotype, if taken dicoumarol drugs previously or taking them now, if
