      yearly visit at the age of 5 or 6, he or she is eligible for participating the study aiming
      to implement and evaluate the Voiding school intervention.

      In the Voiding school the children are educated in groups of 4-6 children with child-oriented
      methods highlighting learning by doing in order to achieve better bladder control. Usual care
      includes individual advice concerning voiding habits and general life-style advice.

Children with the help of their parents are asked to mark X in the diary every time they are voiding; M=a little amount of wetting, MM=a bigger amount of wetting, Y=night-time wetting. Bowel movements are marked with K.</description>

    <description>Symptom score for dysfunctional elimination syndrome (NLUT-DES questionnaire) is used to evaluate children's voiding and defecation habits associated with incontinence. It is a 14-item 5-point Likert scale questionnaire (0=no symptoms 4=severe symptoms, except item 3: 0=5-6 times, 2= 3-4 or 7-8 times, 4= 1-2 or over 8 times). Official translation into Finnish was performed for this study.</description>

    <description>Children are educated on the kidneys, bladder and bowel function, the importance of regular voiding and drinking habits, and avoidance of constipation. Balloons, books, videos, animations, the pictures of a satisfied and irritated bladder and a poo-cars formula track are used to exemplify the function of urinary and defecation systems. During toilet visits children are given advise about an adequate and relaxed toilet posture with the help of little bench under the feet if needed. Each child also make their own timetable for peeing, pooing, and water drinking times, which they then should learn to follow in day-care, pre-school and at home. At the end of each session child, parent and public health nurse/urotherapist discuss any individual advice and the homework for the next time.</description>
