  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality glasses on anxiety of the
      patients who underwent operations under spinal anesthesia during peroperative period. Both
      control group and VR group will be carry out STAI- TraÄ±t anxiety test before operation and
      trait test after operation. Patients will be perform spinal anesthesia after standard
      sedation administration. After block reach adequate level for operation patients in VR group
      will wear the glasses and started to watch a documentary about birds and a sedative music by
      the headset. Patients in Control group will take standard anesthesia care. Hemodynamic
      changes (systemic blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate and pSPO2) will be record in
      both groups.

      The ASA score I-III Patients undergoing operation in OR under spinal anesthesia will be
      included in the study. Patients randomly assigned to VR group or Control Group. Patients will
      be carry out STAI-Trait Anxiety test preoperatively and second STAI test postoperatively.
      Spinal anesthesia will be performed after standard iv midazolam administration in both
      groups. After block reach adequate level for operation patient will wear the glasses and
      started to watch a documentary about birds and a sedative music by the headset in VR group
      and patient will take standard anesthesia care in Control group. The hemodynamic variables
      will be recorded during operation.
