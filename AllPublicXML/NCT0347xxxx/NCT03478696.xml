  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate lung function and health related quality of
      life (HRQoL) after 84 days of treatment with a single inhaler triple therapy combination of
      FF/UMEC /VI [100/62.5/25 microgram (mcg)] once daily via ELLIPTAÂ® compared with a multiple
      inhaler combination therapy of Symbicort Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) (budesonide/formoterol
      320/9 mcg) twice daily plus Spiriva HandiHaler (tiotropium 18 mcg) once daily. The study will
      inform healthcare providers that subjects can be effectively and safely switched to FF/UMEC
      /VI single inhaler therapy from a multiple inhaler triple therapy regimen of Symbicort MDI
      and Spiriva Handihaler. Eligible subjects will enter a 4-week run-in period during which they
      will be administered budesonide/formoterol (320/9 mcg) twice daily plus tiotropium (18 mcg)
      once daily plus placebo via ELLIPTA. Following the run-in period, subjects will be randomized
      to receive one of the following study treatments for 84 days: 1) FF/UMEC /VI 100/62.5/25 mcg
      via ELLIPTA once daily in the morning plus two inhalations of placebo to match
      budesonide/formoterol via MDI, twice daily plus placebo to match tiotropium via HandiHaler
      once daily in the morning or 2) Budesonide/formoterol 320/9 mcg via MDI, twice daily plus
      tiotropium 18 mcg via HandiHaler once daily in the morning plus placebo via ELLIPTA once
      daily in the morning. Subjects will then enter a one week follow-up period. The total
      duration for a subject in the study will be approximately 17 weeks. ELLIPTA is a registered
      trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

             load and low cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4] count, lupus on immunosuppressants)
             that in the opinion of the investigator would increase risk of pneumonia or other risk
             factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis).

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening and at least 30 days following the last dose of oral or

          -  Respiratory tract infection that has not resolved at least 7 days prior to Screening

          -  Chest x-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence of pneumonia or a
             clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD, or
             another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an infiltrate on chest X-ray
             (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All subjects will have
             a chest X-ray at Screening Visit 1 (or historical radiograph or computerized
             tomography [CT] scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening). For sites in
             Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is
             not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained
             from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

             uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are
             uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or
             which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition
             exacerbated during the study.

          -  Unstable liver disease: alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;2 times Upper Limit of Normal
             (ULN); and bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN is acceptable
             if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35 %). Current active liver or
             biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones
             or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment).

          -  Subjects with any of the following at Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded:
             Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months; Unstable or life

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) finding at Visit
             1. The Investigator will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG
             finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             ECG tracing that is interpreted at, but not limited to, any of the following: i)
             Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute (BPM); ii)

             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 3 years.
             Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma and
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 3 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen therapy &gt;3 liters

          -  Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, poor
             motivation or other conditions that will limit the validity of informed consent to
             participate in the study

          -  Study Investigators, sub-Investigators, coordinators, employees of a participating
             Investigator or study site, or immediate family members of the aforementioned that is
             involved with this study
