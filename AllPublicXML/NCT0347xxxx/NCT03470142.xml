    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the short-term and long-term outcomes of traditional
      laparoscopy-assisted surgery and total laparoscopic surgery with no incision (natural orifice
      transluminal endoscopic surgery, NOSES) for colorectal cancer and to find a better surgical
      method for patients.

    <description>All postoperative complications in the perioperative period will be classified by the Clavien-Dindo classification.The classification mainly focuses on the medical perspective, with major emphasis on the risk and invasiveness of the therapy used to correct a complication. From light to heavy, it consists of five grades (Ⅰ to Ⅴ)</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale/Score</measure>

    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms.For example, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain ( from 0 to 10).</description>

    <time_frame>Three months after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Anal incontinence was evaluated using the Wexner Continence Grading Scale , the score being calculated after the patients' completion of a daily defecatory questionnaire. Range is from 0 (normal continence) to 20 (maximum incontinence with maximum disturbance of lifestyle).</description>
