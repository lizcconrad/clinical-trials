  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of
      erdafitinib in combination with JNJ-63723283 (Phase 1b) and to evaluate the safety and
      clinical activity of erdafitinib alone and in combination with JNJ-63723283 (Phase 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label (all people know identity of intervention) and multicenter (when more than
      one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study of erdafitinib
      plus JNJ-63723283 in participants with advanced urothelial cancer with selected fibroblast
      growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene alterations who have progressed on or after one or more
      prior lines of systemic therapy, will consists of 2 parts. Part 1 (Phase 1b: Dose Escalation)
      will establish recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for erdafitinib in combination with
      JNJ-63723283, and Part 2 (Phase 2: Dose Expansion) will evaluate safety and efficacy of RP2D.
      The study will be conducted in 3 phases: screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up
      phase. Study evaluations include efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
      immunogenicity, biomarkers, and safety.
