  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of bariatric surgery on the
      disappearance of NASH without worsening of fibrosis in comparison to medical standard
      treatment in obese patients (35 kg/m² &gt; BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) with NASH complicated of advanced
      fibrosis (F3 and F4 fibrosis grade according to Brunt score).
