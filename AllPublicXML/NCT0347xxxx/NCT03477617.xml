  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serious complications occur in about 16% of major surgeries. Episode of hypotension during
      surgery may be a leading cause of these complications. Even though hypotension occurs
      frequently during surgery, choosing the correct treatment remains difficult in clinical
      practice. Physicians are often uncertain as to whether low blood pressure should be treated
      with intravenous fluid or vasoactive drugs. The first treatment of choice typically involves
      administering more intravenous fluid; however, excessive fluid administration during surgery
      has been shown to be deleterious. New minimally invasive hemodynamic monitors now offer a
      potential solution by guiding physicians with respect to the choice of appropriate
      intervention (i.e., fluid versus vasoactive drugs). The Investigators will conduct a
      single-center feasibility randomized control trial (RCT) at the Toronto General Hospital
      (Toronto, ON, Canada) of an algorithm to manage hypotension during surgery based on the
      information captured by a minimally invasive monitor. Sixty participants who are aged 40
      years or older and scheduled to undergo an abdominal, pelvic or vascular surgery will be
      randomized to have the intraoperative hypotension managed by either the new algorithm (guided
      by the monitor) or usual care. Participants will be recruited over 12 to 18 months, and
      followed for 30 days to describe differences in clinical care, hemodynamics, complications,
      and death. The feasibility of a future multicenter RCT will be assessed based on this present
      study demonstrating that (1) the algorithm can be practically implemented in a clinical
      setting where hemodynamic monitors are not typically used; (2) initial descriptive data
      suggest differences in care between groups; (3) there are no obvious major harms from the
      protocol; and (4) there is an acceptable participation rate among eligible patients. These
      data will inform any required changes to the algorithm and protocol to allow for its
      application in a future study.

    <intervention_model_description>Parallel Assignment Participants are randomized to two groups; both groups will have an intraoperative minimally invasive cardiac output monitor connected.
In the intervention arm, the anesthesiologist will treat episodes of hypotension using a hemodynamic algorithm based on the information for the cardiac output monitor.
In the control arm, the anesthesiologist will treat episodes of hypotension using standard of care management and will be blinded to the information from the cardiac output monitor. Data from the monitor will be stored for comparison between the arms.
This is a pilot study; therefore, the main objective is to assess feasibility of a future multicenter RCT, based on the following domains: (i) participation rate among eligible patients; (ii) practicality of implementing the study intervention in a clinical setting; (iii) collect descriptive data for differences between the 2 arms; (iv) collect safety data to ensure no harm has resulted from the study protocol</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>• Practicality of study algorithm will be measured by the survey scores of the anesthesiologists involved in the intraoperative care, assessing several domains using a 5 point Likert scale such as (1) Ease of use, (2) Clinical Utility, (3) Validity</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with Adverse Events thought to be at least possibly related to the study treatment will be reported. This outcome will assure that no harm has resulted from the study protocol and the protocol is safe for a future randomized control trial</description>

    <measure>Volume of intravenous fluid and volume of blood products (therapeutic interventions) for each arm of the study.</measure>
    <time_frame>During intra-operative period and recovery, an average of 12 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>• The volume of IV fluid and volume of blood products prescribed by the anesthesiologist will be reported as mean (in mL) separately for each study arm. Since this is a feasibility trial the statistical analysis for this study will be descriptive in nature, therefore no statistical differences will be reported between the 2 arms.</description>

    <measure>Dose of vasoactive medication (therapeutic interventions) for each arm of the study.</measure>
    <time_frame>During intra-operative period and recovery, an average of 12 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>• The dose of vasoactive medications prescribed by the anesthesiologist will be reported as means (in the unit of each vasoactive medication i.e., mg, mcg, etc.) separately for each study arm. Since this is a feasibility trial the statistical analysis for this study will be descriptive in nature, therefore no statistical differences will be reported between the 2 arms.</description>

    <measure>Hypotension (blood pressure in mmHg) (therapeutic interventions) for each arm of the study</measure>
    <time_frame>During intra-operative period and up to 72 hours after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>• Hypotension is the indication for receiving treatment in the study; therefore, blood pressure will be measured during surgery (every 5 minutes electronically by the non-invasive monitors) and after surgery (every hour by an ambulatory blood pressure monitor) separately for each study arm. Since this is a feasibility trial the statistical analysis for this study will be descriptive in nature, therefore no statistical differences will be reported between the 2 arms.</description>
