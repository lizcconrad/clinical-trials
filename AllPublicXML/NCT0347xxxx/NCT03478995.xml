    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled in two stages:

        -  Dose-escalation stage: Approximately 15-30 patients will be enrolled.

        -  Dose-expansion stage: 6-12 patients will be enrolled. Dose-escalation slots will be
           filled first, then dose-expansion slots.

      -  Dose-escalation stage : designed as classical 3+3 to determine MTD or RP2D to evaluate
           approximately five dose levels of GX-I7 (60, 120, 240, 480, and 600 µg/kg, IM)

        -  Dose-expansion stage : designed to enroll additional 6-12 patients to acquire additional
           safety and pharmacodynamic data to more fully inform the dose selection for RP2D
