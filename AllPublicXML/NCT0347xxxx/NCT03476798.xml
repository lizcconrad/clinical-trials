  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of rucaparib, a small molecule inhibitor poly (adenosine diphosphate
      [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP), being tested in combination with bevacizumab in patients
      with recurrent cervical or endometrial cancer. The objective of this study is to determine
      the proportion of these patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months while
      receiving this drug combination.

      Patients who consent to participate in this study will receive treatment with rucaparib and
      bevacizumab until unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression. Subjects will take one
      rucaparib pill will be taken twice daily, and bevacizumab will be adimistered via IV onDay 1
      of each 21 day cycle. Subjects will receive tests and procedures that are part of regular
      cancer care as well as those required for the purposes of this study. If there is no cancer
      found in scans after 6 cycles of treatment, patients may continue with study treatment for 1
      year. Follow up visits will occur every 3 months for the first 2 years after treatment is
      completed and every 6 months for 3 additional years.

          -  Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Patients should have no major existing co-morbidities or medical conditions that will
             preclude therapy in the view of the principal investigator.

          -  Prior bevacizumab is allowed if off drug ≥ 28 days prior to study enrollment.

          -  Female patients of reproductive potential and their male partners must agree to
             practice total abstinence or use a highly effective method of contraception prior to

          -  Patients with tumors that invaded major vessels (e.g. the carotid) as shown
             unequivocally by imaging studies will be excluded due to the possibility of increased
