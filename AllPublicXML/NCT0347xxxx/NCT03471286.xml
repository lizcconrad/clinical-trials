  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution, single arm, open label, window of opportunity clinical trial
      that will act as a Master Protocol with a primary objective to assess pharmacodynamic effects
      of the novel study drugs in subjects with resectable solid tumor malignancies.

      Each Sub-protocol conducted under the Master Protocol will evaluate different novel
      therapeutic agent(s).

      Estimated enrollment is 15 subjects per Sub-Protocol.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will have a short-course (4-weeks) administration of a given compound in the
      timeframe between the diagnostic biopsy and the surgical resection. A pre-treatment tumor
      biopsy will be obtained, and blood samples will be collected before, during, and at the end
      of treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must have biopsy-proven solid tumor that is eligible for elective surgical resection,
             disease does not require immediate therapy, and there is NO approved/ standard therapy
             available that is shown to prolong overall survival.

          2. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          3. Must have a tumor lesion that is amenable to biopsy, and willing to undergo biopsy.

          4. Willing to provide tissue and blood samples for research.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The following solid tumors are NOT eligible: Primary brain tumor, Ocular melanoma,
             Head and neck cancer, Breast cancer, Prostate cancer, Testicular cancer, and Stage III
             rectal cancer.

          2. Any active malignancy within 3 years prior, except: Adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, or early stage cancers (carcinoma in situ or stage 1)
             treated with curative intent.

          3. Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to: Symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, Unstable angina pectoris or coronary angioplasty or stenting
             within 6 months prior to enrollment, Cardiac arrhythmia, Psychiatric illness or social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, or Ongoing or active
             infection.

          4. Any known sensitivity to or history of allergic reaction to compounds of similar
             chemical or biological composition of study drug(s).

          5. Unwilling or unable to follow the study schedule.

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
