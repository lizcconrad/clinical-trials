  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to determine whether implant length and the crown-to-implant (C/I)
      ratio influence implant stability and the loss of the surrounding marginal bone, and whether
      short implants can be used instead of sinus augmentation procedures.

    <textblock>
      The patients participating in the study (n=30) had one single tooth implant - a short
      (OsseoSpeed™ L6Ø4 mm, Implants) or a regular implant (OsseoSpeed™ L11 and L13Ø4 mm, DENTSPLY
      Implants) - placed in the maxilla. The evaluation was based on clinical and radiological
      examination.

      The crown-to-implant ratio was determined by dividing the length of the crown together with
      the abutment by the length of the implant placed crestally. Mean crown-to-implant ratios were
      calculated separately for each group and its correlation with the MBL (marginal bone loss)
      and stability was assessed. The authors compared the correlation between the C/I ratio
      values, MBL and secondary implant stability.
