  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop, design and implement an easy-to-use, cloud-enabled
      software for patients with low back pain and evaluate the effect of the system on compliance
      and quality of life. We hypothesize that a device which measures compliance to physical
      therapy regimens in patients with low back pain will increase patient participation.

      Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to develop and deploy a low-cost measurement system
      which tracks exercise compliance and enables remote health coaching for patients with low
      back pain. The system will consist of a series of small motion sensors built into a custom
      designed harness which connect wirelessly tot he user's tablet or smartphone. A software
      application will guide the patient through the exercise routine while the sensor system
      monitors their motion, classifies exercise completion, and tracks their progress through the
      protocol. The results of the routine will be securely uploaded to caregivers where they can
      monitor progress, modify the patient's exercise prescription, and offer encouragement and
      coaching to continue the therapy. This research program aims to enable the long term
      treatment-tracking of patients with chronic low back pain.
