  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This objective of this study is to determine whether the Air Barrier System device reduces
      airborne colony-forming units (e.g., bacteria) present at a surgery site during total knee
      arthroplasty surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Air Barrier System (ABS) is a device that uses localized clean air flow to shield a
      surgery site from ambient airborne contamination. This study examines the hypothesis that the
      ABS can reduce the presence of airborne CFU at the surgery site during total knee
      arthroplasty surgery.
