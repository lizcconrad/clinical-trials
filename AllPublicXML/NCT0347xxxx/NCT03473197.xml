        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is a healthy male or female (to be confirmed by medical history);

          -  Is 18 years of age or older;

          -  In the case of a female of childbearing potential, is using an acceptable form of
             birth control (oral/implant/injectable/transdermal contraceptives, intrauterine
             device, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, abstinence, partner's
             vasectomy, tubal ligation). Abstinence or vasectomies are acceptable if the female
             subject agrees to implement one of the other acceptable methods of birth control if
             her lifestyle/partner changes;

          -  In the case of a female of childbearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test
             (UPT) at Day 1 and are willing to submit to a UPT at the end of study (EOS);

          -  Is free of any systemic or dermatological disorder, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase the risk of AEs;

          -  Has uniformly-colored skin on the lower thoracic area of the back which will allow
             discernment of erythema, and has Fitzpatrick Skin Types I, II, or III

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history of photosensitivity or photoallergy;

          -  Has any visible skin disease at the application site which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will interfere with the evaluation of the test site reaction;

          -  Is using systemic/topical corticosteroids within 3 weeks prior to and/or during the
             study, or systemic/topical antihistamines 72 hours prior to and during the study;

          -  Is not willing to refrain from using systemic/topical anti-inflammatory analgesics
             such as aspirin (81 mg daily aspirin will be allowed), Aleve, Motrin, Advil, or Nuprin
             for 72 hours prior to and during the study (occasional use of acetaminophen will be
             permitted);

          -  Are taking medication known to cause phototoxic reactions (eg, tetracyclines,
             thiazides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS]);

          -  Is using medication which, in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere with the
             study results (e.g. anti-inflammatory medications, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants
             with potential pain relief effects, immunomodulatory medications, and others);

          -  Is unwilling or unable to refrain from the use of sunscreens, cosmetics, creams,
             ointments, lotions or similar products on the back during the study;

          -  Has psoriasis and/or active atopic dermatitis/eczema;
