  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the analgesic benefit of a traditional landmark-guided GON block with
      the ultrasound-guided approach over a four week period in patients with occipital neuralgia
      or cervicogenic headache.

      Hypothesis: A novel ultrasound-guided greater occipital nerve (GON) block at the level of C2
      will result in significantly lower pain scores after 4 weeks when compared with a traditional
      landmark-guided approach at the superior nuchal line.

      The greater occipital nerve (GON) has been implicated in several conditions that prompt
      referral to pain medicine specialists, including occipital neuralgia and cervicogenic
      headache. According to the International Headache Society, a local anesthetic block of the
      GON can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of occipital neuralgia. Many practitioners perform
      GON injections using a conventional approach, relying solely on superficial bone-based
      anatomic landmarks to infiltrate local anesthetic and corticosteroid around the nerve at the
      level of the superior nuchal line. The ambiguity of these injections poses a risk of
      anesthetizing adjacent structures or injecting into vessels, such as the occipital artery.

      In an attempt to mitigate these risks and improve the efficacy of GON injections, ultrasound
      has been increasingly utilized. Multiple studies have demonstrated successful
      ultrasound-guided GON blockade at the superior nuchal line and improvement in pain scores
      compared to non-guided injections. The investigators' preliminary data confirms the
      feasibility, efficacy, and safety of an ultrasound-guided GON block technique at the level of
      C2, but it is not yet known whether this technique provides greater pain relief and
      functional outcomes compared to traditional injections.

    <description>The subjects will be provided a headache journal to record the number of days they have been using each of their analgesic medications. Medication overuse will be defined as the use of acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs &gt; 14 days a month, triptan, ergotamine, or combination-analgesic medications (e.g.,caffeine containing) medications &gt;9 days a month, and opioid or butalbital containing medications &gt;5 days a month.</description>

    <measure>Change in number of headache days per month</measure>

    <measure>Change in Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HIT-6 show the effect that headaches have on normal daily life and the subject's ability to function. It consists of 6 questions; possible responses being never (6 points each), rarely (8 points each), sometimes (10 points each), very often (11 points each), and always (13 points each). The total score ranges from 36 (little to no impact) to 78 (very severe impact).</description>
