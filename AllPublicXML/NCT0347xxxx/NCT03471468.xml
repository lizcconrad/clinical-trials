  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microparticles have recently emerged as a thrombotic risk marker with a potential role in
      determining which patients are at greatest risk for developing thrombosis. Available data
      show an increase in the level of microparticles in cancer patients who are undergoing
      chemotherapy for solid tumors with a possible link to their thrombogenic state.

      Our study focuses on the kinetics of microparticles under chemotherapy in patients with
      pancreatic or gastric cancer by serial measurements of microparticles procoagulant activity.

      Detailed Description:

      The impact of chemotherapy on microparticles expression will be assessed by measuring their
      procoagulant activity on blood samples taken during the course of chemotherapy. The
      thrombotic risk will be evaluated by the score of Khorana in parallel. Microparticles
      expression in patients with thrombosis will be compared to that in other patients.
