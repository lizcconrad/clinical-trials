  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Training (HABIT) has been shown to result in improvements in hand
      function and daily functioning of children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP). Children with
      bilateral CP may also present difficulties to coordinate their hands to perform activities.
      Thus, HABIT may be a potential intervention for these individuals. We intend to examine the
      effects of HABIT on hand function and daily functioning of children with bilateral CP
      compared with conventional occupational therapy (OT). Our hypothesis is that children
      receiving HABIT will present larger improvements in manual dexterity and daily functioning as
      compared to conventional OT.

      Study Design: Randomized Controlled Trial. Study Participants &amp; Setting: Forty children with
      bilateral CP recruited from the Associação Mineira de Reabilitação, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

      Procedures: After being included in the study, children will be randomly assigned to a
      intervention group (n=20) or a control group (n=20). Children in the intervention group will
      receive a 90-hour (6 hours/day; 5 days/week, 3 weeks) of Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Training
      (HABIT) while children in control group will maintain their usual frequency of Occupational
      Therapy (OT) sessions (45 minutes/session, twice a week, for 3 weeks), focusing on functional
      training, stretching and sensory stimulation. All participants will be assessed by an
      examiner blinded to group allocation before and after the intervention period, as well as 6
      months after the intervention (follow-up).

      Statistical Analysis: A 2 (groups) x 3 (assessments) analysis of variance will test the
      effects of group, assessment and group x assessment interaction with a level of significance
      set at 0.05.
