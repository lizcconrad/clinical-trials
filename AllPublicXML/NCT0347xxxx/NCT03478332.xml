  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared with conventional treatment of the coronary heart disease,the aim of the research is
      to find out if the addition of Yangxinshi pills on the basis of conventional treatment can
      improve exercise tolerance of patients with coronary heart disease, improve quality of life
      or restore social function and mental health

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 outpatients with clear diagnosis of coronary heart diseases will be recruited in the trial
      and randomized into two group.

      One group are treated with Yangxinshi pills (provided by Qingdao Growtful Pharmaceutical Co.,
      Ltd.) plus conventional medicine, the other group are treated with placebo plus conventional
      medicine.

      The primary end point is VO2max measured by cardiopulmonary exercise test after 3 months of
      treatment.

      The secondary endpoint is:

        1. Mets, Anaerobic threshold（AT）measured by cardiopulmonary exercise test；

        2. Changes of other composite indicators of treadmill exercise test or cardiopulmonary
           exercise test；

        3. The maximum walking distance of 6-minute walk test;

        4. Changes of Seattle Angina Questionnaire;

        5. Hamilton Depression Scale/ Hamilton Anxiety Scale.

      The safety evaluation criteria is:

        1. Adverse event and serious adverse event;

        2. Vital signs;

        3. Resting 12 lead ECG;

        4. Blood routine examination , urine routine examination、liver and renal function
           examination(AST、ALT、BUN、Cr).
