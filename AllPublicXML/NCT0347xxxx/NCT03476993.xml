    <textblock>
      BCD-085 is an innovative drug, anti-interleukin-17 monoclonal antibody. The aim of the study
      is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCD-085 in patients with primary biliary
      cholangitis (PBC).

      This is an open-label proof-of-concept phase 2A study. The aim of the study is to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of BCD-085 in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with
      primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with compensated liver function with an inadequate
      (suboptimal) response to ursodeoxycholic acid.

      In this study the inadequate (suboptimal) response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is defined
      as screening alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level &gt; 1.67 ULN (the upper limit of normal) despite
      treatment with UDCA in stable dose for at least 6 months before signing the ICF.

          2. Men and women, age 18 - 60 years at the time of signing the ICF

          3. Established diagnosis of PBC with following criteria (according to EASL 2017
             guidelines):

               -  documented ALP elevation

               -  documented АМА ≥ 1:40 or PBC-specific ANА (anti-sp100/anti-gp210).

          4. Suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) taken in stable dose for at least 6
             months before signing ICF with screening alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level &gt; 1.67 ULN
             (the upper limit of normal)

          5. Fertile patients and their partners agree to use barrier contraception throughout the
             study and 4 weeks after its completion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or ascites requiring
             treatment with diuretics.

             List.

          3. Established diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatorenal syndrome.

          4. Direct bilirubin &gt; 1.0 mg/dL at screening.

             sclerosing cholangitis, alcoholic liver disease, Gilbert's syndrome, Wilson disease,

          9. Vaccination with live or attenuated vaccines within 8 weeks before signing the ICF.

         15. Concurrent diseases at screening that may increase the risk of adverse events during
             the study or affect the evaluation of PBC symptoms (mask, enhance or alter the
             symptoms of PBC, or cause clinical or laboratory signs/symptoms similar to those of
             PBC)

         18. Any psychiatric conditions including severe depressive disorders and/or any history of
             suicidal thoughts or suicidal attempts that may constitute the excessive risk for the
             patient or that may affect the patient's ability to follow the protocol.

         19. Alcohol or substance abuse.

         20. Participation in other clinical trials within less than 90 days before signing the
