  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant gonadotropins are currently used for ovarian stimulation in women undergoing to
      IVF for infertility. Recently new flexible protocols have been introduced: the &quot;single dose&quot;
      and &quot;multiple dose&quot; protocol. The single dose protocol is performed just using Cetrorelix by
      the administration of a single injection of Cetrorelix 3 mg subcutaneous when the lead
      follicle is ≥ 14 mm. The multiple dose protocol consider the daily administration of
      Cetrorelix 0.25 mg subcutaneous or Ganirelix 0.25 mg subcutaneous when the lead follicle is ≥
      14 mm and until the realization of hCG criteriaThere are few data from letterature about the
      comparison of the efficacy in pitituary suppression and pregnancy outcome of Ganirelix and
      Cetrorelix.

      Objective: to compare the efficacy in pituitary gonadotropin suppression and IVF outcome of
      multiple dose flexible gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist administration
      according to follicular size using daily injection of Cetrorelix or Ganirelix.

      Interventions : patients are randomly assigned in to Cetrorelix acetate group or Ganirelix
      acetate group. Multiple dose of Cetrorelix acetate (0.25 mg) or multiple dose of Ganirelix
      acetate (0.25mg) are administered when the lead follicle is ≥ 14 mm until hCG criteria are
      met.Oocyte maturation trigger is performed by the administration of subcutaneous r-hCG (250
      μg) or of intramuscular hCG (10,000 IU). After 36 hour transvaginal oocyte retrieval is
      performed followed by ICSI and embrio transfer (72 hours later).
