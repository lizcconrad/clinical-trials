  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      always reliable.Pain is an important diagnostic tool in dentistry. The type of treatment,
      extent of treatment and, sometimes, even the decision on whether to treat or not is dependent
      on the pain history obtained from the patient.The absence of an accurate description of
      dental pain is a factor that severely limits dental treatment planning in children with CP.
      The aim of this study is to study to evaluate the salivary cytokine profile of children with
      CP who have severe dental problems and to compare this to verbal children who have a similar
      dental profile.

      The sample with CP will be selected from individuals attending the dental clinics of the
      Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian city (SBAHC). The control patients will be selected
      from the dental clinics of the Riyadh Colleges of Dentistry and Pharmacy and be matched to
      the CP patients for age, gender and extent of dental problems. The sample will comprise of 20
      patients with CP and 20 verbal controls.The oral health of all children will be recorded
      using WHO examination criteria .The teeth will be examined using WHO category II criteria -
      clinical examination with lighting and without radiographs.aliva will be collected from the
      children using the passive drool method and stored in sterile plastics collection tubes. The
      collected sample will be stored at -600C until they can be analyzed. The cytokine profile of
      the saliva sample will be analyzed using an ELISA kit for total cytokine profile (Luminex
      Performance Human Cytokine Panel A, LUH000, R&amp;D systems) to measure cytokines IL-1 alpha,
      IL-1 beta, IL-8, and TNF-alpha. The pain perception of the verbal control group will be
      recorded using the validated Arabic version of the short form of the McGill Pain
      Questionnaire. The children will also indicate the extent of the pain using the Wong Baker
      Faces â„¢ pain perception scale.Normality of the total cytokine levels will be tested using the
      Shapiro-Wilkes Test. The Mann Whiney U test will be used to compare the cytokine profile the
      CP and control group. The spearman correlation will be used to explore the relationship
      between the reported pain and cytokine profile levels. If found to be significant an initial
      cytokine-pain map will be proposed.

        The study population will comprise of children with cerebral palsy(unable to verbalize
        pain) who have at least one dental condition that would be considered painful.
