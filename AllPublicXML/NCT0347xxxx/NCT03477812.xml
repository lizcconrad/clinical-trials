  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Full ambulatory polysomnography at home performed two nights in 30 healthy children and one
      night in 30 children with mono-symptomatic nocturnal enuresis (15 with polyuria and 15
      without polyuria). The children will be aged 7-14 years of age.

      The sleep will be evaluated on sleep quality, number of periodic limb movements per hour,
      blood pressure and pulse, beat to beat variation by electrocardiography during sleep,
      respiration during sleep, nocturnal urine production, and enuresis episodes.

      Purpose and perspectives:

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the quality of sleep, the sleep architecture and
      the intra-individual variation from night to night in healthy children and children with
      mono-symptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) using full polysomnography at home.

      Hypotheses:

        -  There is large intra-individual night to night variation in sleep quality and
           architecture.

        -  Children with MNE have different sleep architecture than healthy children when looking
           at sleep quality and arousals.

        -  Periodic limp movements at sleep is more frequent in children with MNE than in healthy
           children.

      Design:

      The study is a case-control study.

      Materials and methods:

      The study will recruit 30 healthy children and 30 children with MNE (15 with polyuria and 15
      without polyuria) recruited from the Childrens Incontinence Center at the Department of
      Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at Aarhus University Hospital. Children of both sexes aged
      between 7 and 14 years of age will be enrolled. Children and their parents will be informed
      about the study both verbally and in written. Written informed consent from both parents must
      be obtained before the children can be enrolled in the study.

      The healthy children will go through two nights of full polysomnography to be able to view
      intra-individual changes. The children with MNE will only have to do one night of
      polysomnography.

      Primary parameters:

        -  Sleep quality

        -  Number of periodic limb movements per hour

        -  Blood pressure and pulse

        -  Beat to beat variation by electrocardiography during sleep

        -  Respiration during sleep

        -  Nocturnal urine production

        -  Enuresis episodes
