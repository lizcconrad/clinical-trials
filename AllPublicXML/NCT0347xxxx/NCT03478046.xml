  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetuin-A has been identified as a novel physiological regulator of insulin action in vitro,
      in intact cells and in vivo in animals. Previous research has shown that circulating levels
      of fetuin-A were increased in animal models of insulin resistance and diabetes. Additionally,
      several human investigation studies demonstrate a correlation of fetuin-A levels with body
      mass index, insulin resistance, and a fatty liver. Recently, the investigators have
      elucidated the role of fetuin-A phosphorylation in the regulation of insulin action,
      demonstrating that phosphorylation is critical for the inhibitory activity of fetuin-A. The
      objectives of this study are twofold: (1) Quantitate phosphorylated fetuin-A levels in
      individuals with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, and (2) Investigate the effects
      of lifestyle modifications (acute or chronic exercise and dietary modifications) on fetuin-A
      phosphorylation and insulin sensitivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several objectives of this study: (1) Quantitate phosphorylated fetuin-A levels and
      the daily variation in these levels in individuals with insulin resistance and metabolic
      syndrome; (2) Investigate the short-term responses of fetuin-A phosphorylation and changes in
      insulin resistance that occur with a single session of aerobic exercise; (3) Characterize and
      compare the total and temporal changes in fetuin-A phosphorylation and insulin resistance
      that occur with an 8 to 10% weight loss induced by chronic exercise training and dietary
      modification, and; (4) Investigate the influence of weight loss on the short-term responses
      of fetuin-A phosphorylation and changes in insulin resistance that occur with a single
      session of aerobic exercise. Our hypothesis is that phosphofetuin-A levels are tightly
      correlated with insulin resistance and that lifestyle modifications will improve insulin
      sensitivity and decrease phosphorylated fetuin-A levels.
