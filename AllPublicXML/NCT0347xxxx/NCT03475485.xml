  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ID-Cap System is classified as an ingestion event marker (IEM), a Class II medical
      device. The system is intended to record time-stamped ingestions with the ingestible sensor,
      ID-Tag which transmits a signal to a wearable device, the ID-Cap Reader. In this study, 36
      subjects will ingest capsules containing ingestible sensors while wearing the Reader and
      being observed in a clinic setting.

    <description>The ID-Cap System is a medical device that is intended to record time-stamped ingestions with an ingestible sensor which transmits a signal to a wearable Reader. When the ID-Capsule that contains the ingestible sensor is ingested, the ID-Cap System is intended to log, track, and trend intake times. When co-ingested with medication, the tracking and trending of intake times may be used as an aid to measure medication adherence. The ID-Cap System enables unattended data collection for clinical and research applications in the home or clinical settings.</description>
