  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and reduced left ventricle ejection fraction
      benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator (ICD). Currently used devices, besides delivering low and high-energy
      therapies, record patient's activity and many hemodynamic parameters. However, increasing
      numbers of patient with CRT and ICD devices produce overload of cardiology centers where
      patients are admitted to ambulatory visits. Contrarily, there are technological possibilities
      for remote monitoring proven to be effective in recognizing damage of the implanted device
      and risk of exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Patients' registries show that majority of
      ambulatory visits are unproductive and do not result in significant modification of device's
      parameters. Promising experiences with application of data mining and machine learning
      techniques allow us to assume probable benefits from using modern methods of data analysis in
      determination of requirement for ambulatory follow-up on basis of data gathered through
      telemonitoring and clinical assessment of a patient.

      Aim of the study is to find multivariate model predicting the requirement for ambulatory
      follow-up of IECD.
