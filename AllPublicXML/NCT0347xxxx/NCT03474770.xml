             full explanation of the nature and purpose of this study.

          -  Have signed the Informed Consent before any study-specific procedures are performed.

          -  Be males or females between 18 - 65 years of age.

          -  Have a diagnosis of FIAS type epilepsy with or without additional focal aware or
             non-aware seizures with generalization.

          -  Have a current minimum average of 5 countable seizures / week to enroll in study.

          -  Have at least 5 focal impaired awareness seizures during the 96-hour baseline VEM
             period.

          -  Be receiving stable doses (for at least 4 weeks) of one to four currently marketed
             anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), with or without vagus nerve stimulation (in which case
             the patient should be on the same stimulation parameters for at least 4 weeks).

          -  Have a negative urinary pregnancy test upon admission to the site on Day 1.

          -  Be in good general health in the judgment of the Principal Investigator based upon
             medical history, physical examination, standard 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory
             evaluations obtained within the two weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Be able to comply with all study-specified procedures.

          -  Weight between 40 and 120 kg.

             multiple seizures with at least one seizure within 30 minutes of the previous seizure.

          -  Have less than the 5 minimum accepted seizures required during baseline evaluation
             period screen.

          -  Have a history of only seizure clusters, for example, seizure clusters defined as
             multiple seizures with at least one seizure within 30 minutes of the previous seizure.

          -  Has attempted suicide within the past 2 years.

          -  Has a history of status epilepticus in the 6 months previous to enrollment.

          -  Has a pre-existing medical condition (including an existing progressive or
             degenerative neurological disorder including brain tumor, active encephalitis, active
             meningitis or abscess) or takes medications that, in the Principal Investigator's
             opinion, could interfere with the participant's suitability for participation in the
             study.

             alcohol or drug abuse within the past 2 years, or symptoms of psychosis
             (hallucinations, delusions) in the last 5 years.

          -  Has had any clinical laboratory abnormalities within the past two months, prior to
             screening, considered of clinical significance by the Principal Investigator.

          -  Is on concomitant therapy with non-AEDs that are cholinergic.

          -  Has participated in any clinical investigational drug or device study within four
             weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Inability to complete seizure diary.

          -  Is currently taking or has taken Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) within the past 14
             days, or consume foods or drinks containing EGCG; including green, white, oolong teas
