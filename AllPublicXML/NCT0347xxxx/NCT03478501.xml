  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limiting access to a firearms during suicidal crisis can save lives. This study will test a
      patient decision aid about safe firearm storage during crisis. The investigators will enroll
      60 adult emergency department patients being evaluated for suicidal risk and have at least
      one firearm at home. If available, the investigators will also enroll a family member or
      friend. Participants will randomly receive one of two things: the decision aid or general
      suicide prevention information. A week later, the investigators will call participants to see
      how both groups choose to store their firearms. This trial tests the acceptability of the
      decision aid, effects on decision making, effect on home storage, effect on suicide outcomes,
      and feasibility of a larger trial. The investigators hypothesize that patients with higher
      quality decisions after the decision aid will be more likely to change their firearm storage
      to reduce access during the time of crisis; should the pilot demonstrate feasibility, in a
      subsequent larger trial this hypothesis would be tested directly.

    <measure>Acceptability of Lethal Means Decision Aid</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using the Ottawa Acceptability Questionnaire that captures the patient's feedback on the design, presentation, quality, and information presented in the decision aid through both survey and open ended questions. Questions include likert scale responses (range of responses are specific to each question's content). There are also a series of yes/no/don't know questions related to content presented. Each &quot;no&quot; response asks the participant to elaborate in an open ended response. The participant also has the ability to provide general feedback in open ended feedback format. There are no subscales to this measure.</description>

    <measure>Decision Making Quality in ED</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), low literacy 10 item scale, measures decision quality, uncertainty, personal perceptions and satisfaction. A total score is computed through sum of items 1-10 (Yes=1; unsure=2; no=4) divided by 10, and multiplied by 25. Scores range from 0 (no decision conflict) to 100 (extreme decision conflict). The sum of items 1, 2, 3, divided by 3 and multiplied by 25 is the informed decision subscale (1 extremely informed) to 100 extremely uninformed). The sum of items 4 and 5, divided by 2 and multiplied by 25 is the values clarity (0 feels extremely clear to 100 feels extremely unclear). The sum of items 9 and 10, divided by 2 and multiplied by 25 is the uncertainty subscale (0 feels extremely certain about best choice to 100 feels extremely uncertain about best choice). The sum of items 6, 7, 8, divided by 3 and multiplied by 25 is the support subscale (0 feels extremely supported in decision making to 100 feels extremely unsupported in decision making).</description>

    <measure>Home Firearm Storage</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>At both baseline and one week follow up, participants will complete a study specific survey that asks about how they currently store their firearms or current plans to change how they store their firearms to measure change in storage.</description>

    <description>The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), low literacy 10 item scale, measures decision quality, uncertainty, personal perceptions and satisfaction.
