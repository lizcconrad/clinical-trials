  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of
      incorporating palliative care into the clinical care plans of patients newly diagnosed with
      malignant brain tumors. Palliative Care is a field of medicine that focuses on providing
      relief from symptoms and stress related to serious illnesses. This study will assess the
      feasibility of conducting a future study, and will gather data upon which to appropriately
      tailor the intervention and the future study design. The statistical analysis of this study
      will describe 8 components that encompass each of the 4 areas of focus or &quot;domains&quot;:
      acceptability, demand, implementation, and integration.

      Patients who agree to participate at their initial consultation in our clinic will receive a
      referral to a Palliative Care (PC) provider who is also located in our clinic and an initial
      appointment will be scheduled with the PC provider. The frequency of follow-up visits with
      the PC provider will be at the discretion of the PC provider and the patient. Visits with the
      PC and neuro-oncology providers will be scheduled on the same day whenever possible. As part
      of the study, participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires and
      assessment forms at different time intervals. These questionnaires and assessments are
      intended to track symptoms experienced during the course of treatment. Total study duration
      is about nine months.
