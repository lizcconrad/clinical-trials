  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares under controlled conditions if different flow rates affect apnoea time
      after induction of anaesthesia and how CO2 clearance is influenced. Furthermore, this study
      enables to quantify the effects of increased pCO2 on vital parameters (e.g. blood pressure,
      cardiac output, cerebral perfusion, etc.) The investigators will enroll patients undergoing
      elective surgery at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland.

      Once anesthesia has been induced, apnoea will set it. During this period, the investigators
      will compare different methods of apnoeic oxygenation for a maximum of 15 minutes.

      Before discharge, an interview will be conducted, assessing complications and patient
      satisfaction.

      Eligible, consenting adults will be prepared for general anaesthesia in the usual way
      consisting of ECG, pulse-oximetry, NarcotrendTM, a venous cannula and an arterial line for
      continuous blood pressure monitoring. They will receive additional monitoring such as
      transcutaneous measurement of pCO2 and O2, NIRS, and thoracic electrical impedance tomography
      (EIT, PulmoVistaÂ® 500, Draeger, Luebeck, Germany).

      Normal pre-oxygenation (until etO2 is &gt; 90% or time &gt; 3 minutes) will occur. Anaesthesia will
      be started (= &quot;induction&quot;) using Propofol and Fentanyl, using NarcotrendTM to measure depth
      of anaesthesia. All patients will receive a standard dose of neuromuscular blockage to
      facilitate airway management and total intravenous anaesthesia will be installed. Using the
      train of four measurement (TOF) full neuromuscular blockage with Rocuronium will be confirmed
      every 30 seconds. If necessary, additional dosage of neuromuscular blockage will be
      administered.

      After induction and administration of Rocuronium, possibility of mask ventilation will be
      confirmed and the sealed envelope with the randomization will then be opened. As a study
      intervention, the assigned method (HFNCT 70 l/min with either jaw thrust or laryngoscopy, 10
      l/min or 2l/min) will be installed and mask ventilation discontinued to start the apnoea
      period. Nasopharyngoscopy (EF-N slim, Acutronic, Hirzel, Switzerland) will be performed to
      confirm upper airway patency. Blood gas analysis will be conducted: baseline awake, start of
      apnoea, first minute after apnoea start, every 2 minutes thereafter. Other measurements (ECG,
      pulse-oximetry, blood pressure, NIRS, thoracic EIT, NarcotrendTM, PtcO2, PtcCO2) will be on a
      continuous basis.

      The study intervention will end when one of the following criteria (study end-points) is met:
      SpO2 &lt;92%, PtcCO2 &gt; 80 mmHg, pH &lt; 7.10, potassium &gt; 6.0 mmol/l, visible respiratory movements
      or time &gt; 15 minutes.

      When any of the end points is reached, normal anaesthesiologic care will be established as
      planned.

      A post-operative interview will be conducted before discharge to evaluate injuries during
      airway management (bleeding, sore throat, hoarseness), pain, postoperative nausea and
      vomiting.
