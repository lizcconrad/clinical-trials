  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether virus-specific T cell lines (VSTs) are safe
      and can effectively control three viruses (EBV, CMV, and adenovirus) in patients who have had
      a stem cell transplant and also in patients that have a primary immunodeficiency disorder
      with no prior stem cell transplant.

      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether most closely HLA-matched
      multivirus-specific T cell lines obtained from a bank of allogeneic virus-specific T cell
      lines (VSTs) have antiviral activity against three viruses: EBV, CMV and adenovirus.

      Reconstitution of anti-viral immunity by donor-derived VSTs has shown promise in preventing
      and treating infections associated with CMV, EBV and adenovirus post-transplant. However, the
      time required to prepare patient-specific products and lack of virus-specific memory T cells
      in cord blood and seronegative donors, limits their value. An alternative is to use banked
      partially HLA-matched allogeneic VSTs. A prior phase II study at Baylor College of Medicine
      using trivirus-specific VSTs generated using monocytes and EBV-transformed B cells
      gene-modified with a clinical grade adenoviral vector expressing CMV-pp65 to activate and
      expand specific T cells showed the feasibility, safety and activity of this approach for the
      treatment of refractory CMV, EBV and Adenovirus infections. More recent protocols utilizing
      synthetic viral peptide pools allow ex vivo expansion of T-cells targeting multiple viral
      antigens in 10-12 days without use of viral transduction.

      The study will evaluate whether partially-HLA matched allogeneic multivirus-specific VSTs,
      activated using overlapping peptide libraries spanning immunogenic antigens from CMV,
      adenovirus and EBV, will be safe and produce anti-viral effects in immunodeficient recipients
      infected with one of more of the targeted viruses that are persistent despite conventional
      anti-viral therapy.

      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of partially-matched VST therapy in A) patients
      who have persistent viral infections in the post-HSCT period, and B) patients with primary
      immunodeficiency conditions who have persistent viral infections and have not undergone HSCT.

      The study agent will be assessed for safety and antiviral activity.
