  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer harbours 20% Breast Cancer gene (BRCA)1/2 mutations independently
      of family history. Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have shown clinical
      activity among patients with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and specifically among
      BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

      The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of olaparib as maintenance therapy &quot;as
      monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive relapsed
      BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic) high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube,
      or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial response) to
      platinum-based chemotherapy&quot;.

      Trabectedin and Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) have shown relevant activity in
      relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer. In the relapse with Treatment-free interval of last
      platinum (TFIp) between 6 and 12 months this efficacy translated into an increase in Overall
      survival (OS) and Progression free survival (PFS).

      There is an increase of hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) among platinum sensitive patients,
      that reaches 44% in third line and does not always allow for platinum use despite
      desensitization protocols. In relapse with TFIp between 6-12 months the use of
      Trabectedin+PLD is accepted in guidelines and consensus.

      Following clinical BRCAness criteria a group of patients that harbours up to 50% of BRCA1/2
      mutations can be selected. Olaparib has been licensed according to EMA for maintenance in
      BRCA mutated patients after response to platinum following Study 19 phase II trial and
      further confirmed with phase III SOLO-2 data. However there is no evidence of the benefit of
      adding olaparib after Trabectedin+PLD response among BRCA1/2 carriers.

      The combination of Trabectedin+PLD, as well as both single drugs, have shown higher activity
      among BRCA1/2 carriers.
