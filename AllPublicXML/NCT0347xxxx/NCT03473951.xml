  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperuricemia is associated with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular
      risks in diverse of the population. Whether the dose-response effects on the prevalence of
      metabolic syndrome and cardiometabolic risks is unclear. The present study is conducted to
      investigate the relationship between serum uric acid and the prevalence metabolic syndrome
      and left ventricular hypertrophy.

    <textblock>
      Apparently healthy individuals with an estimated screening number of approximately
      twenty-thousand individuals undergo an annual health exam in the investigators' hospital. The
      routine exam includes measurements of body height, body weight, blood pressure, visual and
      acoustic acuity, physical examinations, basic blood tests, urine analyses, chest radiography,
      and electrocardiography. The blood tests were performed after individuals fasted for at least
      eight hours. Individuals with any abnormal results underwent a clinical examination at an
      outpatient department for safety issues, ensuring the accuracy of the data. All data were
      registered prospectively. The investigators retrospectively collected data from the annual
      exam.

    <description>Based on the Taiwan criteria, metabolic syndrome must fulfill at least three of the five following criteria: 1) waist circumference more than 90 cm in men or more than 80 cm in women; 2) blood pressure of more than 130 / 85 mm Hg or already on anti-hypertensive medication; 3) fasting glucose of 100 mg/dl or more or already on anti-diabetic agents; 4) triglyceride level of 150 mg/dl or more or already on lipid lowering therapy for hypertriglyceridemia; 5) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 40 mg/dl or less in men or 50 mg/dl or less in women; the investigators also replaced the criterion of waist circumference by body mass index of 27 kg/m2 in the definition of metabolic syndrome.</description>

    <measure>brief symptom rating scale-5</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Brief symptom rating scale-5 consisted of five items with a total score of 0 to 20. Each items range from 0 to 4 in score, including difficult in falling asleep, anxiety (feeling tense or high-strung), hostility (feeling easily annoyed or irritated), interpersonal sensitivity (feeling inferior to others), depression (feeling depressed or in a low mood) in the past week. The summation of brief symptom rating scale-5 is further classified as normal (score of &lt;6), mild mood disorder (score of 6-9), moderate mood disorder (score of 10-14), severe mood disorder (score of &gt;14). Suicidal attempt is an additional item and the score &gt;1 is considered as severe mood disorder.</description>
