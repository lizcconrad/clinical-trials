    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to predict the patient under conservative therapy as a function of
      the patient Classification of Rommens and Hofmann and other potential prognostic factors. A
      corresponding prognostic score may be used in the future by patients and attending physicians
      support joint decision between surgical and conservative treatment.

        diagnosis &quot;pelvic ring fracture&quot;. Subsequently, patients under the age of 60 and patients
        after high-energy trauma are excluded.
