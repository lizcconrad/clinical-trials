  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EASYX™ Liquid Embolic is a new injectable, precipitating polymeric agent for the
      obliteration of vascular spaces through direct puncture or catheter access performed under
      X-ray guidance. The embolic liquid is an iodinized Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) Polymer ether.
      Iodine groups are covalently grafted to the PVA polymer backbone, whereby a stable
      nondegradable polymer with the desired features is created. The resulting polymer is
      dissolved in Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO). EASYX™ is CE-marked since December 2016 and has been
      used in humans a few time for type II endoleaks, portal vein and varicocele (&lt;10 cases at the
      date of submission). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      EASYX™ embolization liquid for the percutaneous treatment of vascular lesions, i.e.
      embolization of varicocele, type II endoleaks, portal vein before surgery, active peripheral
      bleeding or angiomyolipoma (AML).
