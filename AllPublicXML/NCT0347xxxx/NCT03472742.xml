  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study to assess safety and preliminary clinical activity of ADR-001 in
      patients with liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score; Grade B) caused by Hepatitis C or
      Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis. Patients who have already participated in the ADR-001-01 study
      and completed the last evaluation after 24 weeks of administration will be eligible to this
      study.

      Patients registered will continue follow-up observation and evaluate long-term safety and
      exploratory efficacy.
