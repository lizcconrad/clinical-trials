  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the relationship between gut microbial
      composition and stroke outcome. If we can establish a relationship between gastrointestinal
      microbial community composition and convalescent ischemic stroke outcomes in a U.S. sample,
      such results would prompt further mechanistic studies, and ultimately provide a rationale for
      trials to determine whether modulating intestinal immune responses (e.g. via prebiotic,
      probiotic, or fecal transfer methods) would be beneficial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measured differences in taxonomic make-up and the relative frequency of the gut microbial composition in relation to excellent vs. poor stroke outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome in this case-comparison design of those with excellent vs. non-excellent ischemic stroke outcomes at 3 months as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is the taxonomic make up of the gut microbial composition. In other words, comprehensive microbiota survey results from 16S rRNA gene sequencing from individuals with excellent outcomes versus all other outcomes at 3 months are the outcome.</description>

    <description>Descriptive analyses will be used to develop a preliminary understanding of microbiome composition in relation to measures of cognitive functioning as derived from Cogstate cognitive assessment results at baseline and 3 months post- ischemic stroke/TIA</description>

      Fecal and blood samples will be collected. The biorepository will contain acute and

      (biomarker levels, proteomics), and fecal (microbiome) samples couple with clinical and
      research data.
