    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of corneal,
      epithelial, and LASIK flap thickness using the Carl Zeiss Meditec Cirrus HD OCT 5000, Optovue
      RTVue OCT, CSO MS-39 OCT, and ArcScan Insight 100 very high-frequency digital ultrasound
      arc-scanner.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very high-frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound was first used in 1993 to obtain images and
      measure the thickness of the cornea (the window at the front of the eye) and the layers
      within the cornea, such as the epithelium (the layer of skin on the surface of the cornea). A
      commercially available instrument, known as the Artemis, has been used in routine clinical
      practice since 2001. The ArcScan Insight 100 VHF digital ultrasound scanner is an updated
      version, which obtained CE mark in 2016.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is another method of measuring the thickness of the cornea
      and the corneal epithelium. OCT has been used for measuring corneal thickness since 1997 and
      the technology had evolved to also measure epithelial thickness since 2012. There are
      currently three OCT scanners capable of measuring epithelial thickness; Carl Zeiss Meditec
      Cirrus HD OCT 5000, Optovue RTVue OCT, CSO MS-39 OCT.

      The aim of the study is to establish the repeatability (i.e. the variability in measurements
      taken by a single examiner during a single visit) and reproducibility (i.e. the variability
      in measurements taken in the same conditions between two examiners) for each of the four
      devices for measuring corneal thickness and epithelial thickness.

    <intervention_name>ArcScan Insight 100 very high-frequency digital ultrasound</intervention_name>
    <description>The ArcScan Insight 100 VHF digital ultrasound scanner can measure individual layers within the cornea with very high precision, as well as being able to image the interior of the eye including the chamber between the iris and the cornea, the lens and other structures behind the iris. The ArcScan Insight 100 device is a digital ultrasound scanner, meaning that it uses ultrasound waves to measure parameters of the eye. The Insight examination involves the patient sitting in front of the ultrasound unit and looking through a disposable goggle-like eyepiece at a light source. Warm sterile balanced saline solution (like natural tears) are used to fill the space between the light source and the eye, to allow ultrasound transmission. There is no contact between the instrument and the eye other than being immersed in this water bath.</description>

    <description>The Cirrus HD OCT 5000 uses high definition spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure anatomical structures of the eye. OCT is non-contact and uses light, rather than ultrasound, to obtain cross-sectional images. An OCT scan involves the patient sitting in front of the device, placing their chin on a chin-rest and fixating on a light source. Nothing comes into contact with the eye and the patient is only aware of the instrument rotating in front of them.</description>

    <description>The CSO MS-39 OCT uses high definition Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure anatomical structures of the eye. OCT is non-contact and uses light, rather than ultrasound, to obtain cross-sectional images. The MS-39 also includes a Placido topographer within the device to simultaneously obtain a measurement of the shape (curvature) of the front surface of the cornea, which is then combined with the OCT thickness measurement to generate the shape of the back surface of the cornea.
