      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate the biodistribution of [18F]MNI-958 also
      known as APN-0000455 or PM-PBB3, as a tau targeted radiopharmaceutical.

      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate the biodistribution of [18F]MNI-958 also
      known as APN-0000455 or PM-PBB3, as a tau targeted radiopharmaceutical. The specific
      objectives are:

        -  To determine the radiation dosimetry of [18F]MNI-958

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of [18F]MNI-958

    <description>Whole body tomographic PET images will be obtained for 6 healthy volunteers, and reviewed visually for assessment of body organ distribution of radioactivity. Volumes of Interest (VOI) will be placed on the visually identified source organs, and subsequently used for all the study PET frames. Activity within these volumes of interest is expressed in units of total radioactivity (kBq).
Radioactivity will be corrected for body attenuation, but not for decay, and time activity data (TAC) generated for each source organ.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant is 18 to 55 years old.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          -  Female subjects must be documented by medical records or physician's note to be either
             surgically sterile (by means of hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal
             ligation) or post-menopausal for at least 1 year or, if they are of child-bearing
             potential, must commit to use a barrier contraception method for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Male subjects and their partners of childbearing potential must commit to the use of
             two methods of contraception, one of which is a barrier method for male subjects for
             the study duration.

          -  Male subjects must not donate sperm for the study duration.

          -  Willing and able to cooperate with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically
             significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness.

          -  The subject is a currently exposed to nicotine products or had regular nicotine
             exposure within a six month period, to be verified by urine cotinine screening.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to screening, or evidence of
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening visit.

          -  The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
             hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, neurological, immunodeficiency,
             pulmonary, or other disorder or disease.

          -  The subject has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion.

          -  Prior participation in other research protocols or clinical care in the last year in
             addition to the radiation exposure expected from participation in this clinical study,
             such that radiation exposure does not exceed the effective dose of 50 mSv, equivalent
             with the acceptable annual limits established by the US Federal Guidelines.

          -  Pregnancy or women who are breastfeeding, lactating or nursing.

          -  Unsuitable veins for repeated venipuncture.

          -  History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV test result.

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C antibody test result.
