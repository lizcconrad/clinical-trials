  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol contributes to over 5% of deaths worldwide, and death rates from alcohol-related
      liver disease (ARLD) in the UK continue to rise sharply. On-going alcohol use in ARLD leads
      to markedly increased mortality (Thursz et al, 2015), and maintaining abstinence is a key
      therapeutic goal. However, there are no effective pharmacological therapies for maintaining
      abstinence. Brief intervention (BI) is an effective psychological tool for reducing alcohol
      use, but is difficult to scale widely.

      AlcoChange is a smartphone app and breathalyser (AlcoChange), which facilitates
      self-monitoring and delivers BIs in response to patient triggers. The aim of this open-label
      study is provide AlcoChange to 60 patients with ARLD, to determine compliance with the
      app/breathalyser and changes in self-reported alcohol consumption.

      Recruitment of inpatients/outpatients with ARLD and recent alcohol use will take place at
      Royal Free London. The inclusion criteria are: intent to maintain abstinence, possession of
      compatible smartphone. The exclusion criteria are: inability to provide consent. Participants
      will be assessed at baseline and 3-months. The primary endpoint is self-reported alcohol use
      (units/week, timeline follow-back). Secondary endpoint is compliance with the app (monitored
      remotely).
