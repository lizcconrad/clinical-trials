  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Tao Mask is a new novel facemask for positive pressure ventilation which has recently
      been demonstrated (MUSC study Pro00047645) to have superior performance to our conventional
      (standard) positive pressure mask in a random distribution of patients with experiences
      users. This additional study will extend our investigation of the new masks capabilities by
      studying it's performance in the morbidly obese - which are more challenging patients to
      ventilate by mask. Our hypothesis is that the Tao mask will be even more effective in this
      challenging population than in the random distribution of patients.

    <intervention_model_description>The sequence of standard vs Tao mask will be determined by random number generator. Mask ventilation will be scored with both masks before and after the standard administration of paralytic medication. The duration of the study procedures is variable but would last approximately 30-60 seconds, seldom exceeding 5 minutes additional time to the study patient from what is necessary in a non-study patient. The number of ventilations to achieve adequate ventilation is variable with both the standard mask and the Tao mask. After grading mask ventilation the study intervention is complete and the remainder of surgical and anesthesia care will be based on the clinical needs and decisions of the care team.</intervention_model_description>
