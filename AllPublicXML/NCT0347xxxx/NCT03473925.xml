An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Modified RECIST 1.1 for Immune-based Therapeutics (iRECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An objective response is defined as an immune-based Complete Response (iCR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or immune-based Partial Response (iPR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). ORR will be assessed by the investigator based on iRECIST following administration of navarixin in combination with pembrolizumab. The percentage of participants who experience an iCR or iPR will be presented.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first confirmed documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. PFS per RECIST 1.1 will be assessed by the investigator.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per iRECIST, progressive disease (PD) is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition after iRECIST-unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD); target lesion increase of &gt;5 mm compared to any prior iUPD time point, for non-target lesions, any significant growth in lesions overall compared to a prior iUPD time point that does not meet unequivocal standard RECIST 1.1 and a further increase in the sum of diameters by &gt;5 mm from a prior iUPD time point, visible growth of new non-target lesions and the appearance of additional new lesions and any new factor that would trigger PD by RECIST 1.1. Per iRECIST, disease progression is to be confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4-8 weeks after first documentation and will be assessed by the investigator.</description>

             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the
             participant's participation for the full duration of the study, make administration of
             the study drugs hazardous, or make it difficult to monitor AEs such that it is not in
             the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating
             Investigator.
