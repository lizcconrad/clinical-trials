    <textblock>
      Diabetes-related foot ulcers (DFUs) are a leading cause of hospitalization and amputation
      worldwide, and account for 33% of all direct costs of diabetes care in the US. Ulcers
      requiring acute care can result in treatment costs of up to US$70,000 per event, varying with
      the severity of the wound. Once the skin is ulcerated, it is susceptible to becoming infected
      and ultimately amputation in particular in case of deep DFUs. To manage the cost and avoid
      hospitalization and amputation, wound should be immediately closed. But this is often
      challenging in diabetic foot with deep ulcers.Wound healing is a dynamic process involving
      interactions between cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factors that reconstitutes
      tissue following injury. ECM plays an important role in tissue regeneration and is the major
      component of the dermal skin layer. Recognition of the importance of the ECM in wound healing
      has led to the development of wound products that aim to stimulate or replace the ECM in
      particular in case of deep tissue destruction because of deep DFUs. It is known from the
      literature that chronic or hard-to-heal wounds are characterized by a disrupted or damaged
      ECM that cannot support wound healing. Thus treatment strategies based on use of biologic
      scaffold materials for management of chronic and deep wounds has increased dramatically
      during the past two decades. These scaffolds include those comprising an intact extracellular
      matrix (ECM) or individual components of the ECM, and those comprising hybrids incorporating
      a synthetic component with a biologic component. DermACELL (LifeNet Health,Virginia Beach,
      VA) is acellular dermal matrices (ADM), which has been shown to be effective in treating
      chronic DFUs in a clinical trial.

      Another ADM product available in the market is made by IntegraÂ® (Bilayer Matrix Wound
      Dressing, Integra LifeSciences). However, advantages/disadvantages of one compared to the
      other are unclear. In addition, prior studies often focused on wound healing outcomes (e.g.
      time to heal, success of wound healing) without considering patient-centered and
      physician-centered outcomes such as time and difficulty to apply, likelihood of adverse
      events and need for reapplication, poor tissue mechanics outcomes (e.g. presence of scarring
      or tissue biomechanics properties leading to increase in shear or pressure post healing thus
      increasing likelihood of recurrence of the ulcer), and other patient centered outcomes like
      smell, pain, and comfort.

      The primary objective of this prospective, randomized trial is to compare the outcomes of
      DermaCELL with Integra. The investigators assumed that the wounds outcomes (e.g. weekly wound
      size change, time to heal, time to successful wound granulation) are comparable between
      DermaCELL and Integra. However, from operation and patient centered outcomes, there may be
      some noticeable differences. For instance, DermaCELL, thanks to its mesh structure, thin
      thickness, and no need for hydration, may be easier to apply with shorter time than Integra.
      The factors are of key importance in operation room (OR) setting and could reduce overall
      cost of application and needs in using OR resources. Other important outcomes least addressed
      in prior studies are number of grafts failing, adverse events (e.g. amputation, infection,
      etc), cost of wound healing treatment, tissue biomechanics, which may lead to recurrence of
      ulcers (e.g. formation of tissue scarring), and other patient-centered outcomes (e.g. pain,
      quality of sleeping, wound smelling, etc). For instance, many patients are unhappy with
      smelling of wounds, which make them embarrassed among their family members like grand kids.
      Thus reducing wound smelling during activities of daily living is often considered as an
      important patient centered outcomes.
