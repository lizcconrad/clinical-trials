    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label study of D-0502 single agent and D-0502 in combination with
      standard dose of palbociclib to assess the safety and tolerability, identify an MTD, and/or
      RP2D, evaluate the PK properties and evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activities in women with
      advanced or metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

                  systemic therapy prior to starting current study treatment.

               4. For phase Ia: Not eligible for standard therapy that would confer clinical
                  benefit to the patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:
