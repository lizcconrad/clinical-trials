    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to obtain reference values of CGM in healthy individuals using
      the Dexcom G4 sensor and evaluate whether reported low glucose values by the Dexcom G4 sensor
      are really low when confirmed by capillary testing.

      Evaluation of the profile of blood glucose using Dexcom G4 in a population with normal oral
      glucose tolerance test. The investigators have used information from a previous study of 60
      participants using Dexcom G4, CGM system. A non-randomized, days 1-7 blinded and days 8-14
      non-blinded CGM trial, the study was performed to evaluate the profile of blood glucose using
      CGM in the population with normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All enrolled subjects
      with at least three time-points with evaluable values from CGM system and the reference
      capillary value obtained from HemoCue during the whole study period were included in the
      Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population

    <description>Evaluation of the Dexcom G4 system from questionnaire regarding the following questions, 1. The visual analogue scale 1-100 mm. How do you experience the benefits of seeing your daily blood glucose profile with the help of CGM (continuous glucose monitoring)? The evaluation of questions of the Dexcom G4 system were expressed on a 0-100 scale with lowest value (0) equaling to Not rewarding at all and highest value (100) equaling to completely rewarding.
2. Do you consider the CGM can be a great educational tool for patients who are at risk for getting diabetes? (yes, no)
3. Can CGM give you a mindset about diet and lifestyle changes? (yes, no)
4. Can you describe your experiences using CGM?</description>
