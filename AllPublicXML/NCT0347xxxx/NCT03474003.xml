  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further develop personalized medicine in kidney transplantation and improve transplant
      patient outcomes, attention has been given to define early surrogate endpoints that might aid
      therapeutic interventions, clinical trials and clinical decision-making.

      Despite a clear pressing need, no population-scale prognostication system exists that will
      combine traditional factors and biomarker candidates to represent the complete spectrum of
      risk predicting parameters. To adequately predict transplant patients' individual risks of
      allograft loss and allograft function trajectories, this would require a complex integration
      of data, including: donor data, recipient characteristics, transplant characteristics,
      allograft precision phenotypes, ethnicity, immunosuppressive regimen monitoring, allograft
      infections, acute kidney injuries, and recipient immune profiles.

      This project aims:

        1. To develop a generalizable, transportable, mechanistically and data driven composite
           surrogate end point in kidney transplantation;

        2. To validate several risk scores to predict kidney allograft survival and response to
           treatment of individual patients;

        3. To predict individual patient kidney function trajectories;

        4. To dynamically predict kidney allograft survival with the help of evolution overtime of
           selected clinical and biological parameters.

      Eventually, it will provide an easily accessible tool to calculate individual patients' risk
      profiles after kidney transplantation, by using datasets from prospective cohorts and post
      hoc analysis of randomized control trial datasets.

      Background The field of kidney transplantation currently lacks robust models to predict
      long-term allograft failure and allograft function trajectories, which represents a major
      unmet need in clinical care and clinical trials. This study aims to generate and validate an
      accessible scoring system that predicts individual patients' risk of long-term kidney
      allograft failure and allograft function trajectories.

      Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)

      A score based on classical statistical approaches to model determinants of allograft and
      patient survival (Cox model, multinomial regression). These models will be further completed
      with statistical approaches derived from artificial intelligence and machine learning.

      A final approach combining the Cox Model and the e-GFR measurements will be used to create a
      dynamic prediction model, that takes into account the cross-sectional aspect of variables
      assessed at the time of transplant at 1-year post transplant and the longitudinal aspect of
      kidney function (joint modelling).
