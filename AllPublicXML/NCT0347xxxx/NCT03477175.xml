      This study will be conducted to assess the long-term safety of study drug(s) in participants
      who are enrolled in Eisai-sponsored lenvatinib studies.

      This is an open-label extension study to roll-over eligible participants from Eisai-sponsored
      lenvatinib studies. The participants may roll-over no sooner than the primary completion
      dates in their parent study or after all study data for the primary outcome measure have been
      collected for the parent study. The parent study is defined as the Eisai-sponsored lenvatinib
      clinical study in which the participant was receiving lenvatinib either as monotherapy or as
      combination therapy or was receiving any other comparator therapy. The participant can be
      enrolled in the current study for the purpose of long-term safety data collection if all the
      selection criteria for the current study are met. The intention is that the participant will
      not be without study drug during the transition from the parent study to the rollover study.

          -  Provide signed written informed consent for the roll-over study

          -  Currently enrolled in an Eisai-sponsored lenvatinib clinical study and still receiving
             at least one of the study drugs from that protocol

          -  Currently deriving clinical benefit from at least one of the study drug(s) as
             determined by the investigator

          -  Must be able and willing to comply with the current roll-over protocol requirements

          -  Continued ability to swallow and retain orally administered study drug(s)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Permanent discontinuation of all study drug(s) in the parent study due to toxicity or
             disease progression and without clinical benefit

          -  Receiving any prohibited medication(s) as described in the parent study

          -  Any unresolved toxicity that meets the criteria for study drug(s) discontinuation or
             withdrawal criteria from the parent study at the time of transition to this study

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension or other medical conditions at the time of
             transition to the roll-over study that may interfere with assessment of toxicity

          -  Pregnant or lactating female

          -  Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical condition, psychiatric disorder or
             other conditions at the time of transition to the roll-over study that could interfere
