      Sublingual microcirculation change in pregnant women with or without high risk pregnancy
      factors during pregnancy and postpartum period.

      Microcirculation system is composed of a group of blood vessels less than 100 um in diameter
      composed of arterioles, capillaries, veins and other structures. The health of
      microcirculation system correlates well with the stability of systemic circulation. Perfusio
      of microcirculation is often affected by major diseases such as sepsis, shock and heart
      disease. Through various microcirculation monitoring instruments, the investigators can
      assess the disease severity and prognosis.

      Physiological changes during pregnancy will increase the blood volume, stroke volume, and
      microcirculation. Preeclampsia refers to the development of hypertension (systolic blood
      pressure&gt; 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure&gt; 90 mmHg) after 20 weeks of gestation with
      proteinuria. Severe preeclampsia is associated with impaired endothelial cell circulation
      throughout the body, and reduced sublingual microcirculation perfusion.

      Through the sublingual microcirculation monitor, studies have shown that pregnant women have
      more microcirculation perfusion than non-pregnant women, while women with severe preeclampsia
      and those with HELLP syndrome have impaired microcirculation.

      This study aims to investigate whether there is any change in the sublingual microcirculation
      before and after labor in healthy pregnant women and high-risk pregnant women (such as
      epilepsy, gestational diabetes, etc.) through the third generation of microcirculation
      imaging microscope (cytocam).
