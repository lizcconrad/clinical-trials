  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Currently prevalence of HPV infections for high risk strains among young women in
      Switzerland is unknown. In addition, since 2008 a vaccination program to prevent these
      infections has been implemented in a number of cantons, but its actual population impact is
      currently unknown. For now, HPV screening in Switzerland is mainly performed by gynecologists
      or during gynecological consultation at hospital. This method is certainly effective, but
      expensive; population coverage of screening is still insufficient. A whole segment of the
      target population does not participate in this screening especially young people of foreign
      origin, for various reasons: economic cost, no gynecological, and for other reasons.

      Several studies raise the effectiveness and efficiency of self-sampling to increase coverage
      of screening, and the rate of participation of non-participants. Through this study, the
      investigators evaluate effectiveness of this vaccination on the prevalence of HPV infections
      using HPV prevalence kit and assess evolution of infection and clearance of HPV virus during
      5 years in a population of young unvaccinated and vaccinated women.

      Method: During the study, each participants will perform a vaginal swab sampling by auto to
      research HPV. These samples will be sent to a laboratory where HPV typing is done by PCR
      using the Anyplex ™ II technology.

      The study will focus on a sample of 400 young women. Participants must complete a
      questionnaire containing demographic questions and their HPV immunization status. Vaccination
      coverage expected in this population is about 50%. Depending on the state of vaccination, two
      different groups will be vaccinated vs unvaccinated (200 women per group). The cases of HPV
      infection are then calculated for each group and compared as a function of the status of
      vaccination. Statistical tests will be applied McNemar's test for comparison between the HPV
      prevalence rates between the 2 groups.

      Expected Results: This study will allow us to confirm the possibility of using self-sampling
      as a method of screening and monitoring of HPV infections in the general population, it will
      also enable us to document the effectiveness of HPV vaccination by comparing prevalence rate
      of HPV infections among a group of young girls vaccinated and not vaccine and assess
      evolution of infection and clearance of HPV virus.

        It will take place in the health school of health and Faculty of Medicine at the University
        of Geneva. Trial information on the University website will be available; it will also
        contain a phone number for helpline. Cards to check eligibility, registration and
        scheduling will be available. The HPV self-collection kit will be directly distributed to
        participants at the end of their courses to School of Health and University of Geneva
        School of Medicine
