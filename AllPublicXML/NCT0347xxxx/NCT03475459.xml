  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, open label, dose escalation trial to evaluate prolongation
      effect on QT interval of NPC-15 (melatonin 8mg or 16mg).

      The trial compose of 3 periods; During the each period, eligible volunteers wll be
      administered placebo, NPC-15 4g (melatonin 8mg) and NPC-15 8g(melatonin 16mg) as a sequential
      manner.
