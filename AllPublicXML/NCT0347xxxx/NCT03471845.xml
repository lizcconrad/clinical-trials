  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a single arm clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of the Medtronic Resolute Onyx™
      zotarolimus-eluting coronary stent system in subjects who are eligible for percutaneous
      transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in de novo lesions amenable to treatment with
      Resolute Onyx™ Stent System in China.

      This study is a pre-Market, prospective, multi-center, single arm trial. Subjects will be
      enrolled and followed through 5 Years (screen, implant procedure(including post-procedure
      assessment),30-Day, 6 Months, 9 Months-subjects implanted with fringe size, and annual
      assessments from 1-5 years).

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is an acceptable candidate for treatment with a drug-eluting stent in
             accordance with the applicable guidelines on percutaneous coronary interventions, and
             the IB of Resolute Onyx stent.

          -  The subject requires treatment of up to 3 target lesions in up to 2 separate target
             vessels [2 target lesions in 1 vessel (including its side branches) and 1 target
             lesion in a separate vessel (including its side branches)] amenable to treatment with
             stents with diameter from 2.25 mm to 5.0 mm

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

             derivatives), cobalt, nickel, platinum, iridium, chromium, molybdenum, polymer
             coatings (e.g. BioLinx) or a sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated
