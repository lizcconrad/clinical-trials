  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In-patients with severe anorexia nervosa (AN) often drop out of treatment, because of
      ambivalence towards treatment and anxiety for weight gain. However, physical therapy has
      shown some positive effects on symptoms of AN. This study aims to investigate the feasibility
      of a randomized control trial (RCT) of a standardized physiotherapeutic program for patients
      with severe AN with compliance to nutritional therapy as the primary outcome measure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious and complex disease with unknown etiology. It is
      characterised by disturbed body image and extreme and devastating fear of gaining weight. The
      illness leads to a considerable and sometimes dangerous weight loss because of the limited
      food intake and often an exaggerated exercise behavior. AN can affect people of all ages and
      of both sexes, but girls or young women are more at risk. The prevalence among young women in
      Denmark is estimated to be between 0.4% and 1%. AN is associated with a high rate of
      comorbidity and mortality.

      The treatment of AN consist of re-feeding and psychotherapy. Different therapeutic methods
      and theories have been applied, but none have shown to be superior. The patient alliance and
      motivation for treatment seem to be essential for a successful treatment. Drop-out is a
      common challenge. Hence, attention must be directed to how the therapeutic alliance and the
      patient's motivation can be optimized in order to secure a better treatment effect.

      Studies have shown that physical therapy, including supervised exercise and bodily focused
      interventions, may have a positive effect on symptoms of AN. It may reduce the distorted body
      image and anxiety. However, it is unknown whether physical therapy can affect compliance and
      drop out rate to the nutrition therapy. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      feasibility of a RCT design in this group of patients with severe AN at a specialized unit.
      The intervention is supervised, standardized physical therapeutic exercises mainly consisting
      of light strength training. The development of the intervention is based partly on the
      literature, and partly on interviews and observations with two patients with severe AN.

    <description>For assessment of quality of life is the Eating Disorder Quality of Life (EDQoL) questionnaire used.
EDQLS is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in eating disorders. It consists of 40 items across 12 domains. In each domain patients respond on a 5-point likert scale (strongly agress through strongly disagree). Each domain has three questions, except the eating domain which consists of six questions. The domains are: school/work, family and close relationships, relationships with others, future, feelings, appearance, leisure, values and beliefs, cognitive, physical health, psychological health and eating. Each score is summed using a scoring algorithm with a higher total score indicating higher quality of life (0-200).</description>
