  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The foods we eat - our diet - can affect whether we develop diseases during our lives, such
      as diabetes or heart disease. This is because the amount and types of foods we eat can affect
      our weight, and because different foods are metabolised (processed) by the body in different
      ways.

      Scientists have also found that the bacteria in our guts (the gut microbiome) affects our
      metabolism, weight and health and that, together with a person's diet and metabolism, could
      be used to predict appetite and how meals affect levels of sugar (glucose) and fats (lipids)
      found in blood after eating. If blood sugar and fat are too high too often, there's a greater
      chance of developing diseases such as diabetes.

      The gut microbiome is different in different people. Only 10-20% of the types of bacteria
      found in our guts are found in everyone. This might mean that the best diet to prevent
      disease needs matching to a person's gut microbiome and it might be possible to find
      personalised foods or diets that will help reduce the chance of developing chronic disease as
      well as metabolic syndrome.

      The study investigators are recruiting volunteers aged 18-65 years to take part in a study
      that aims to answer the questions above. The participants will need to come in for a clinical
      visit where they will give blood, stool, saliva and urine samples. The participants will also
      be given a standardised breakfast and a glucose monitor (Abbott Freestyle Libre-CE marked) to
      monitor their blood sugar levels. After the visit, the participants will be asked to eat
      standardised meals at home for breakfast for a further 10 days. Participants will also be
      required to prick their fingers at regular intervals to collect small amounts of blood, and
      to record constantly their appetite, food, physical activity and sleep using apps and
      wearable devices.

      Choice of design: The study is single arm mechanistic intervention study.

      Study population: Twin participants will be recruited from the TwinsUK database and non-twins
      will be recruited via social media platforms and advertising campaigns.

      Screening Assessment: Prospective participants will be selected based on the defined
      inclusion and exclusion criteria by the study management team. Recruitment will be done over
      the phone and via the Internet and emails and prospective participants will be booked in for
      their initial appointment to acquire baseline measurements.

      Study duration: Each participant will take part in the study for a period of 2 weeks (14
      days).

      Dietary intervention: The dietary intervention will be carried out for 10 days within the 2
      week study period. On day one (baseline visit) participants will be given standardised meals
      (breakfast and lunch). For the next 9 consecutive days following the baseline visit, each
      participant will be instructed to eat 9 standardised meals for breakfast, which must be their
      first meal of the day. On one day the participants maybe asked to eat a high fibre bar, as
      sold in the supermarket. Participants are free to eat whatever they wish at all other times,
      although we may provide a list of recommended foods. The standardised meals will be provided
      to all participants by the study team on the day of the visit. The foods included as part of
      these meals will be foods that are commonly consumed and can be made from products sold in UK
      supermarkets. Participants will be reassured that the amount of food will be designed to
      ensure a stable body weight over the course of the study. Participants will be asked to
      consume the entire amount of food indicated for the standardised meals and to record any
      left-over food via a digital app for which training will be provided at the start of the
      study. For the remaining 4 days post the 10 day dietary intervention period, participants are
      free to eat and drink whatever they wish or choose from the list of recommended foods
      provided to them. They will be asked to track all meals, snacks and drinks on their digital
      app. Participants will also be advised not to change their physical activity patterns during
      the course of the study.

      After the baseline visit, regular contact will be made with the participants via phone, their
      app and text messages for the period of the intervention to encourage compliance and answer
      any queries.

      Anthropometry: Weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, body fat, pulse and wave
      velocity will be taken using standard procedures, in duplicates by a trained researcher at
      all face to face appointments. Body composition will be assessed using Seca bio electrical
      impedance analysis scales at all face to face appointments. DXA scans using a Hologic machine
      will be used to assess body composition in all participants.

      Dietary and Lifestyle. Participants will be asked to complete a simple online baseline
      questionnaire plus record daily dietary and activity information using digital apps.
      Lifestyle information (such as sleep, exercise and heart rate) will be monitored using
      digital wearable devices. Dietary information and psychological data (eg hunger) will be
      recorded in a digital mobile phone app. Training in all apps and equipment will be given at
      the baseline visit.

      Digital devices: Participants will be asked to record daily dietary and activity information
      using digital apps and lifestyle information will be monitored using digital wearable
      devices. The continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre, FSL-CGM) provides continuous
      glucose profiles for up to 14 days. The FSL-CGM will be inserted on the back of the upper arm
      at the baseline visit by a nurse. Subcutaneous interstitial fluid glucose concentrations are
      measured every 5 minutes by the FSL_CGM, and can be displayed on a remote device when
      necessary. The readings will be blinded so that the participant's behaviour is not affected
      by the glucose readings. The CGM will be removed at the end of the intervention period (i.e
      day 15). Removal of the glucose monitor can be performed by the participants at home and
      detailed instructions on the removal procedure will be provided to them on day 1 of their
      visit. A 24-h contact number will be made available to participants for any inquiries or if
      any problems arose. Data from the CGM will be downloaded, and glucose profiles will be
      evaluated on the basis of data collected on days 1-14.

      Digital app: Participants will be asked to download an app designed specifically for this
      study, which provides diet &amp; activity logging functionality similar to widely used existing
      apps such as MyFitnessPal.

      Participants will be asked to record and monitor daily the following information via the
      digital app and wearable devices:

        -  Daily record of foods eaten throughout the day with serving sizes

        -  Sleep and physical activity patterns

        -  Hunger, satiety and appetite ratings

        -  Psychological feeling of energy, well-being, bloating

        -  Prescription drug consumption

        -  Defecation patterns and Bristol Stool chart

        -  Smoking

        -  Stress During their baseline visit day, participants will be assisted with installation
           and setup and provided with instructions on how to use the app.

      The app will be available in versions for both iOS (for Apple iPhones) and Android (for other
      smartphones such as Samsung), and will support a wide range of mobile phone models as
      expected across the participant population. The app will synchronise remotely with backend
      database servers, over an encrypted and authenticated API, and will support offline operation
      for when patients wish to record an entry without network coverage. This continuous
      background synchronization means that it will not be necessary to explicitly download data
      from the phone at the end of the study.
