  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological findings indicate that older adults do not meet physical activity (PA)
      guidelines &amp; spend up to 11 hrs/day sitting. Given the high prevalence of sedentary behavior
      (SB), the higher chronic disease risk in this population, &amp; the age-associated challenges of
      meeting traditional PA guidelines, involving longer bouts of moderate PA, the investigators
      hypothesize that older adult health will benefit from new strategies to interrupt sitting.
      This protocol &quot;Sedentary Behavior Interrupted: A randomized trial of 3-month effects on
      biomarkers of healthy aging and physical functioning in the real world (Project 2)&quot; is part
      of a National Institutes of Aging Program Grant called &quot;Sedentary Time &amp; Aging Mortality and
      Physical Function (STAR). The overall purpose of the STAR program to is to better understand
      how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging in postmenopausal women.
      This protocol (also referred to Project 2 of the STAR program) is a 3-arm randomized control
      trial designed to assess ways of interrupting sitting in 405 overweight, postmenopausal
      women.

      Primary Aims:

      In our primary biomarker outcomes of glucose regulation (fasting insulin &amp; glucose, HbA1c,
      HOMA-IR) &amp; blood pressure (BP):

        1. Investigate the 12 week effects of increased standing and additional brief sit-to-stand
           compared to attention controls.

        2. Investigate the dose-response effects of behavioral change on the biomarkers &amp; BP.

      Secondary aims

        1. Assess the effect of changes in standing and sit-to-stand transitions at 12 weeks on
           physical, emotional &amp; cognitive functioning.

        2. Assess the effect of changes in standing and sit-to-stand transitions at 12 weeks on in
           vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.

      Exploratory aims

        1. Explore the possible modifying effect of age on the relationship between intervention
           conditions &amp; primary &amp; secondary outcomes.

        2. Explore the psychosocial &amp; environmental mediators &amp; moderators of changes in sitting
           time, standing time, and transitions.

        3. Explore differences in outcomes between the 2 sitting interruption conditions.
