  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A stooped posture is one of the characteristic motor symptoms of patients with Parkinson's
      disease, and has been linked to impairments in ADL and QOL. We aimed to test the efficacy,
      safety, practical utility and user-friendliness of a posture correction and vibrotactile
      trunk angle feedback device (the UpRight) in the home setting of patients with Parkinson's
      disease with a stooped posture.

      The subjects will be asked to arrive at the Gait laboratory for Mobility Research at Tel Aviv
      Medical Center. After a detailed explanation of the research procedure and after signing the
      consent form, they will be introduced to the UPRIGHT GO device. Participances will practice
      operating and placing the device on the body.

      With the device attached to upper back, a number of short clinical tests will be performed:

        1. Complete demographic questionnaires and medical history

        2. Walking tests and balance:

             1. Short walks at a comfortable speed with or without dual task.

             2. Stairs

             3. Performing daily tasks, such as entering and exiting a room, negotiating obstacles
                (shoebox), walking between obstacles, buttons, tying laces, carrying small objects
                on a tray, bringing a glass of water etc.

             4. Timed &quot;Get up and go test&quot; All tests are supervised by a physiotherapist .

      Upon completion of the tests, the UPRIGHT device will be delivered for use and exercise for 2
      months. Physiotherapist will guide to maintain the devices (such as charging devices and
      connecting to power).

      At the end of the training period, the participans will be invited again to Gait Lab for post
      tests.
