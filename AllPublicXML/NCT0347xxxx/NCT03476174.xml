    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this single arm phase 2 trial is to assess the response rate
      [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] of sequential therapy of pembrolizumab
      followed by HD IL-2 in subjects with stage IV malignant melanoma. Response assessment will be
      performed after pembrolizumab therapy, and response reassessment will be performed after HD
      IL-2 therapy using revised RECIST 1.1.

    <description>Following the pembrolizumab treatment, HD IL-2 treatment will commence. After completing the 2 cycles of pembrolizumab, High Dose Interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) will be administered. This will require a hospital stay of at least 5 days for each treatment cycle. Established guidelines will be followed for safely administering HD-IL-2 and managing toxicities from this treatment. Two treatment cycles will be administered, Cycle 2 being separated from Cycle 1 by approximately 9 days after completion (assuming subject has recovered from Cycle 1 adequately to proceed with Cycle 2). Four weeks after completion of the 2 cycles (called a course of HD IL-2 therapy), disease status will be monitored via CT of the chest and abdomen/pelvis using revised RECIST guidelines</description>
