  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dating and sexual violence are significant public health concerns occurring on a continuum of
      severity across the lifespan, with serious consequences to victims and society. The present
      research advances the science of prevention by rigorously evaluating a comprehensive social
      norms marketing campaign to promote community-level change in dating and sexual violence in
      middle schools. Partnership between researchers and a CDC Rape Prevention and Education
      Program (RPE) funded agency is a core feature of this work, and aims to build community
      capacity to implement and evaluate violence prevention efforts, and promote the subsequent
      uptake of social norms marketing campaigns as a strategy for reducing dating and sexual
      violence among youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a group cluster trial, a comprehensive, tailored, data-based social norms marketing
      campaign that addresses misperceptions of: 1) the acceptability of dating and sexual
      violence; 2) gender roles; 3) sexual activity; 4) sexual communication/consent; 5) support
      for victims; and 6) bystander intervention will be evaluated among middle schools. Poster
      messaging will be paired with several systematic efforts to diffuse program content through
      the community, including a Lunch and Learn Teacher Training, Social Norms Video, Teacher
      Workbook, Parent Mailing, and Parent Information Session. A member of the
      researcher-practitioner team, designated as a School Resource Provider, will oversee campaign
      implementation in partnership with a teacher champion. The Resource Provider will also track
      campaign intensity, assess campaign credibility through intercept interviews with teachers
      and students, work with teachers to infuse messaging into classroom activities, and assist
      the teacher champion with addressing &quot;kick-back&quot; to the campaign. Outcome assessments will be
      completed by teachers, administrators and students. Towards the goal of exploring the role of
      other environmental factors as moderators of program effects, school administrators will
      assess their community readiness to develop and implement school dating and sexual violence
      prevention policy, in general, and social norms marketing, in particular. A neighborhood scan
      will also be conducted to estimate the density of nearby outlets associated with gender-based
      personal violence.

    <description>A series of items were developed for the purpose of the present study to assess student perceptions of peer norms regarding dating and sexual violence. Items are scored on a range of 0% - 100% to indicate the percent of peers within the school that would endorse each item. Scores for each item will be examined individually. Positive scores on this measure are indicated when respondents perceive a greater number of their peers would endorse healthy behavior.</description>
