  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease. ABO
      incompatible (ABOi) living donor kidney transplantation is one of the best ways to expand the
      donors' pool. However, breaking the ABO barrier is possible only with a preconditioning
      regimen that includes 1) an immunosuppressive strategy using a B-cell depleting agent
      (rituximab), an induction therapy with polyclonal antibodies, and a maintenance triple
      immunosuppressive therapy based on calcineurin inhibitors, and 2) a desensitization protocol
      aiming to decrease the titer of isoagglutinins. For this purpose, several techniques of
      apheresis are available. To date, two main techniques used in clinical setting are the
      Double-Filtration PlasmaPheresis (DFPP) and the Antigen-Specific Immunoadsorption (SIA). DFPP
      permits the depletion of the selective plasma fraction containing Immunoglobulins, while
      limiting the need for plasma substitution. SIA enables to remove ABO antibodies without a
      major loss in essential plasma components. To date, no randomized study comparing DFPP and
      SIA exist. SIA is less often used because of its high cost. However, in order to reduce the
      number of SIA sessions and consequently its cost, large plasma volume sessions of SIA are
      performed. ABOi is dramatically more expensive than ABO compatible kidney transplantation. A
      large part of the difference in the cost is related to the apheresis technique.

      Herein, the investigator proposes to describe the efficacy, the safety, and the cost of DFPP
      and SIA to desensitize ABO incompatible kidney transplant candidates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All recipients will receive an induction therapy with rituximab and polyclonal antibodies, as
      well as a maintenance therapy by tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid (switched for mTOR
      (Mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors 1 month after the transplantation to avoid viral
      infections) and steroids.

      The desensitization protocol will be based on the initial titer of isoagglutinin. All
      patients with an isoagglutinin titer between 1/8 and 1/128 will be included in this
      monocentric, open label study, and randomized between the DFPP arm (1 to 4 sessions according
      to the initial titer) and large-plasma SIA (1 to 2 sessions according to the titer). The
      effectiveness will be evaluated on the ability to obtain the targeted titer before
      transplantation (1/4) with less than 5 DFPP, or 2 large-plasma volume SIA.

      All recipients will be followed for 6 months, and examined for surgical complications,
      rejection rate, and kidney function. All complications related to desensitization protocol
      will be reported. Moreover, all cost associated with these two apheresis techniques will be
      evaluated.
