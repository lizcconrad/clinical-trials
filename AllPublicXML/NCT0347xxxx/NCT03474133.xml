      This study evaluate possibility of brentuximab vedotin, administered after first treatment
      failure (no response or relapse after I line therapy) of Hodgkin's lymphoma, to induce
      durable response or cure without autologous stem cell transplantation.

      Brentuximab vedotin (BV) can induce durable response or cure in some patients with relapsed
      or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR HL) after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)
      failure. It is expecting that BV alone administered earlier (after first treatment failure,
      without any additional treatment) can cure some RR HL patients and spare them from
      ASCT-associated risks and toxicity. Therefore in this study full course of BV which confirmed
      its curative potential in post-ASCT setting will be applicated to the potentially
      transplant-eligible RR HL patients immediately after first treatment failure, with a aim to
      assess curative potential of BV in this setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients 18 years or older

          2. Voluntary written informed consent must be given before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future
             medical care.

          3. Female patient is either post-menopausal for at least 1 year before the screening
             visit or surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2
             effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the
             informed consent through 6 months after the last dose of study drug, or agrees to
             completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          4. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e., status post vasectomy) agree to
             practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study period and through 6
             months after the last dose of study drug, or agrees to completely abstain from
             heterosexual intercourse.

          5. Patients must have a diagnosis of a morphologically confirmed cluster of
             differentiation antigen 30 {CD30)-positive classical Hodgkin's lymphoma with primary
             refractory course or relapse after adequate first-line chemotherapy (with
             morphologically confirmation of vital tumor)

          6. PET-positive measurable disease (at least one lesion with Deauville score of &gt;3 and at
             &gt;1.5 cm on CT scan)

          8. Patients potentially eligible for subsequent ASCT according treating physician
             decision

                  tumor marrow involvement
