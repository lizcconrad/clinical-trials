    <textblock>
      This is an open label, first-in-human, phase 1, dose escalation study to determine the safety
      including dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximal tolerated dose of the monoclonal antibody
      NEO-201 in adults with solid tumors (cancer) which has not responded to standard treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental drug called NEO-201 (the &quot;study drug&quot;) is a monoclonal antibody that is
      being tested and is not approved for use in the United States by the FDA.

      The primary purpose of this first in human targeted phase 1 open-label study with NEO-201 in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors is to determine the safety of NEO-201 and select a dose
      for phase 2 clinical trials.

      NEO-201 will be given in four increasing doses to make sure it is safe. NEO-201 will start at
      a low dose (1 mg/kg) and be increased 3 times (2, 4, 6 mg/kg) over the period of the study in
      different groups of subjects. Subjects who enroll during the early stages of the study, will
      receive a lower dose of NEO-201, those who enroll later, will receive a higher dose that may
      be associated with more side effects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of disseminated or uncontrolled brain metastases or central nervous system
             disease. Brain metastases will be considered controlled if SD on two consecutive brain
             MRIs, performed at least 2 months apart, and subject is without seizures.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to NEO-201 or other agents used in this study.

          -  Receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  No archival tissue available and a lesion(s) that cannot be safely biopsied via
             percutaneous route, or is unwilling to undergo biopsy.

          -  Has an uncontrolled concomitant illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome or
             presence of cardiac arrhythmia.

          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the unknown potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with NEO-201. In addition,
             these subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections which could complicate the
             toxicity assessment of this study. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Subject has other serious medical illness, including a second malignancy, or
             psychiatric illness that could, in the Investigator's opinion, potentially interfere
             with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects due to NEO-201 is unknown. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with NEO-201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with NEO-201.

          -  Subjects with marked baselined prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g. 2 ECGs on
             separate dates demonstrating QTc interval &gt; 450 ms).

          -  Use of concomitant medications associated with a high risk of DtP and prolongation of
             QT/QTc interval
