  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this observational cohort study are to describe the use of
      intravitreal aflibercept and to describe follow-up as well as treatment patterns in patients
      with wAMD or DME in routine clinical practice in Latin America for a study population of
      treatment naive patients and those who have received prior therapy (anti-VEGF injections,
      laser, steroids, etc.) and are being switched to intravitreal aflibercept injection.

        The study population will consist of patients with wAMD or DME treated with intravitreal
        aflibercept. If both eyes are eligible, data from both eyes will be captured, but only one
        eye will be considered the study eye and included in the study analyses. The eye included
        will be at the physician's discretion and only visits related to the study eye will be
        captured in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: ≥18 years of age for DME patients,

          -  Age: ≥55 for wAMD patients

          -  Decision to treat with intravitreal aflibercept prior to patient enrolment as per the
             physician's routine clinical practice and following the local Product monograph
             recommendations. Patients who are treatment naïve (no previous intravitreal treatment
             received, including, anti- VEGF agents, steroids, steroid implants and/or PDT) and
             patients that are switching from a different anti-VEGF therapy are both eligible to be
             included. DME patients that have received previous laser only will be classified as
             treatment naïve.

          -  Male, or female willing to use effective contraception during treatment and for at
             least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (if of
             childbearing potential)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients participating in an investigational program with interventions outside of
             routine clinical practice.

          -  Patients currently being treated with intravitreal aflibercept. This study will only
             include patients new to intravitreal aflibercept, both naïve and previously treated
             with other therapies, including other anti-VEGF agents and steroids.

          -  Patients who are hypersensitive to this drug, to any ingredient in the formulation, or
             to any component of the container. For a complete listing, see the DOSAGE FORMS,
             COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING section of the local product monograph.

          -  Ocular or peri-ocular infection in either eye.

          -  Active intraocular inflammation in the study eye.

          -  Scar, fibrosis, or atrophy involving the center of the fovea in the study eye.

          -  Patients with advanced glaucoma, visually significant cataracts, or any eye disease
             likely to require surgery during the study period in the study eye.

          -  Concomitant ocular or systemic administration of drugs that could interfere with or
             potentiate the mechanism of action of intravitreal aflibercept, including anti-VEGF
             agents.

          -  Patients receiving a different anti-VEGF agent other than intravitreal aflibercept for
             the fellow eye.
