    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease of unknown aetiology.
      The condition typically starts in infancy with changing presentations over the years.
      Incessant pruritus is the main symptom.

      Main findings include: xerosis, eczematous lesions, Ig E reactivity, relapsing course and
      personal or family history of other atopic diatheses .Global prevalence rates range from
      1%-20%.

      AD is often worsened by stress and anxiety. Moreover, a mutual relationship between the
      neuroendocrine system and the immune system; including the skin has been suggested. Different
      mediators are responsible for this relation. Serotonin is considered as one of the most
      important responsible mediators (5-hydroxy-tryptamine; 5-HT) .

      Patients with AD have been reported to have high serum levels of 5-HT. Moreover, plasma
      levels of 5-HT were found to be positively correlated with the disease severity. However and
      to the best of the investigators` knowledge, no studies have addressed this point in Egypt.

      Treatment of AD includes: Elimination of triggers, emollients, topical therapies, and
      systemic modalities including SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) and TCAs
      (Tricyclic Antidepressants) in certain cases. SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin, thus
      increase the concentration of serotonin within synaptic clefts. The mechanism of action in
      relation to pruritus is not understood, but SSRIs have been used to treat atopic dermatitis
      associated pruritus
