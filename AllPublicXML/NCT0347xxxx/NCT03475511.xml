    <textblock>
      In this study, high-resolution brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to
      evaluate the differences in brain structure and brain function network between patients with
      different degrees of disturbance of cognition and healthy controls by means of cohort
      follow-up and control study. The changes of patients' The dynamic changes of learning, to
      explore its clinical value as an early diagnosis. Combined with neurobehavioral scales and
      high-resolution brain structure, functional magnetic resonance imaging data to assess the
      brain structure, functional characteristics and consciousness of patients with impaired
      consciousness, and initially establish awareness of patients with recovery of consciousness
      Predictable imaging signs. Twenty eligible controls, 20 VS patients, and 20 MCS patients will
      be considered for inclusion in the inclusion / exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be
      obtained as required before starting any registration process.
