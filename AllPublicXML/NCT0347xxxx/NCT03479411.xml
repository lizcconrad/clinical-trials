    <textblock>
      Phase 1, 3-part study to assess safety, tolerability and PK of single and multiple doses of
      itraconazole administered as a dry powder for inhalation (PUR1900) in healthy subjects (parts
      1 and 2) and a 2-period crossover study of single doses of itraconazole administered as a dry
      powder for inhalation (PUR1900) and an oral solution (Sporanox) in adults with mild to
      moderate, stable asthma (part 3)

      Phase 1, multi-center, 3-part, open-label study in healthy adults (Parts 1 and 2) and adults
      with mild to moderate, stable asthma (Part 3).

      Safety, tolerability and PK will be assessed following either single ascending (SAD) or
      multiple ascending (MAD) dosing of itraconazole administered as a dry powder for inhalation
      (PUR1900; Part 1 and Part 2, respectively). Part 1 will comprise 3 separate cohorts planned
      to receive single doses of 5, 10 and 25 mg itraconzaole, respectively. The study will have an
      interleaved design; Part 2 will comprise 2 separate cohorts planned to receive daily doses of
      itraconazole 10 and 20 mg per day for 14 days, respectively. Part 2, Cohort 1 will commence
      after a review of safety data from Part 1 Cohort 2 suggests it is safe to do so.

      Part 3 is a 2-period, randomised, crossover study in adult subjects with mild to moderate
      stable asthma to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of single doses of itraconazole
      administered as a dry powder for inhalation (PUR1900) and administered as an oral solution
      (Sporanox® Oral Solution).

             cough within 14 days of the first IMP administration, or lower respiratory tract
             infection within the last 3 months prior to IMP administration

         11. Recent (last 4 weeks prior to IMP administration) clinically significant bacterial,
             viral or fungal infection that required systemic (oral or intravenous) antibiotics,
