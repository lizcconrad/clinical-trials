    <textblock>
      This multicentric, randomised, Phase II trial will use a pick-the-winner design in order to
      evaluate the clinical and biological activity of atezolizumab when combined with
      pre-operative or post-operative radiotherapy in STS patients.

      Following Inform Consent Form (ICF) signature, eligible patients will be randomised (1:1:1)
      to receive:

        -  Arm A: Radiotherapy followed by atezolizumab then surgery.

        -  Arm B: Atezolizumab followed by surgery then radiotherapy.

        -  Arm C: Radiotherapy then surgery followed by atezolizumab.

      The sequence of the study treatments is different among the 3 study arms. However, the dose
      regimens will be the same:

        -  Atezolizumab will be administered to all patients at the dose of 1200mg, by IV
           injection, for 2 cycles (Q3W).

        -  Radiotherapy will be administered to all patients at the dose of 2Gy/day, 5 days per
           week, for a total of 5 weeks and 50Gy.

        -  Surgery will be performed as per institutional practice.

      Randomisation will be stratified according to histological subtypes as follows:

      Group 1: Liposarcoma (LPS), Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS), Leiomyosarcoma (LMS),
      myxofibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma versus Group 2: all translocation sarcoma except Ewing,
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and myxoid LPS.

      This trial is a European, multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase II trial using a
      pick-the-winner design aiming to the clinical and biological activity of anti-PD-L1
      (atezolizumab) in a population of operable localised soft tissue sarcomas (STS) patients to
      be treated with radiotherapy.

      Following inform consent signature and validation of eligibility criteria, patients will be
      randomized (1:1:1) into one of the 3 study arms:

        -  Arm A: Pre-operative radiotherapy followed by 2 cycles of atezolizumab then surgery

        -  Arm B: 2 cycles of atezolizumab followed by surgery then post-operative radiotherapy

        -  Arm C: Pre-operative radiotherapy followed by surgery then 2 cycles of atezolizumab.

      The sequence of treatment is different between the study arms, but the regimen of study
      treatments are the same. All randomized patients will received:

        -  The conventionally fractionated radiotherapy regimen of 2 Gy, 5 days a week up to a
           total dose of 50 Gy over 5 weeks. Radiotherapy will be either pre-(Arms A and C) or
           post-(Arm B) operative.

        -  Two cycles of atezolizumab (1200mg, IV, Q3W)

        -  Surgery will be performed as per institutional practice.

      Randomisation will be stratified according to histological subtypes as follows

        -  Group 1: Leiomyosarcoma [LMS], Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma [UPS], Liposarcoma
           [LPS], myxofibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma versus

        -  Group 2: all translocation sarcoma except Ewing, rhabdomyosarcoma RMS and myxoid LPS.

      Following this sequence of treatment, all patients will be followed-up at W12, W18, W24
      (=M6), then M9 and M12. The minimal follow-up will be 1 year for the last randomized patient.

      During the study period, the following tumor samples will be also collected for all
      randomized patients:

        -  A de novo tumor biopsy before study treatment start (pre-treatment tumor sample)

        -  A fragment of the surgery specimen.

         11. Patients must be covered by a medical insurance in country where applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with evidence of metastatic disease, defined by the presence of any of the
             followings:

               -  Lesions that are discontinuous from the primary tumor,

               -  Lesions that are not regional lymph nodes,

               -  Lesions that do not share a body cavity with the primary tumor,

               -  Evidence by medical imagining (eg CT-scan) of metastatic disease.

          2. Patients with history of severe allergic or other hypersensitivity reactions to:

               -  Chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins,

               -  Biopharmaceuticals produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, or

               -  Any component of the atezolizumab formulation.

          3. Patients using or requirement to use while on the study of any not permitted
             concomitant medications :

               -  Any approved anti-cancer systemic treatment including chemotherapy,
                  hormonotherapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy other than atezolizumab,

               -  Any investigational agents,

               -  Live vaccines. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the
                  following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and
                  typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally
                  killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines
                  (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed during the
                  study active period,

               -  Traditional herbal medicines since the ingredients of many herbal medicines are
                  not fully studied and their use may result in unanticipated drug-drug
                  interactions that may cause or confound assessment of toxicity,

               -  Immunostimulatory agents, including but not limited to IFN-α, IFN-γ, or IL-2,
                  during the entire study. These agents, in combination with atezolizumab, could
                  potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions. In addition, all
                  patients (including those who discontinue the study early) should not receive
                  other immunostimulatory agents for 10 weeks after the last dose of atezolizumab,

               -  Immunosuppressive medications, including but not limited to cyclophosphamide,
                  azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide. These agents could potentially alter
                  the activity and the safety of atezolizumab. Systemic corticosteroids and
                  anti−TNF-α agents may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of
                  treatment with atezolizumab but may be administered to manage irAE (See Safety
                  Plan). If feasible, alternatives to these agents should be considered.

          4. Patients with a malignancy other than STS within 5 years prior to randomisation with
             the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and treated with
             expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix,
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localised prostate cancer or ductal in situ
             carcinoma treated surgically with curative intent).

          5. Patients with severe infections within 4 weeks prior to randomisation including but
             not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteraemia, or severe
             pneumonia.

          6. Patients with history of autoimmune disease including but not limited to myasthenia
             gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
             arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with

             test and a positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] antibody test) are
             eligible. Patients positive for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA.

          8. Patients with active tuberculosis.

          9. Patients with ongoing toxicities (Grade ≥1 according to CTCAE V4.03) from previous
             therapies, except for alopecia (any grades) and lab values defined in inclusion
             criteria.

             Note: Some Grade 2 may be permitted following discussion with the Sponsor.

         10. Patients with evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease that could
             affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including
             significant liver disease (such as cirrhosis, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or
             superior vena cava syndrome).

         11. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association
             cardiac disease Class II or greater, myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to

             Notes:

               -  Patients with a known Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% will be
                  excluded

               -  Patients with known coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure not meeting
                  the above criteria, or LVEF &lt; 50% must be on a stable medical regimen that is
                  optimized in the opinion of the treating physician, in consultation with a
                  cardiologist if appropriate.

         12. Patients with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including pneumonitis),
             drug-induced pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e. bronchiolitis obliterans,
             cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on imaging.
