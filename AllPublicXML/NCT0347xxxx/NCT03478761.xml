      You are being asked to take part in this research registry because you or your family member
      is suspected to have a 24-hydroxylase deficiency.

    <textblock>
      In this registry we propose to establish and maintain a registry of suspected and confirmed
      patients with 24 hydroxylase deficiency in an effort to collect data for further
      investigation. This would be the first and only known registry of its kind. These resources
      would be made widely available to clinicians and research scientists within Mayo to stimulate
      advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with this disease.
