      There are 2 parts to this clinical research study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose
      expansion).

      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      the combination of ivosidenib (AG-120) and venetoclax that can be given to patients with
      relapsed (has come back) or refractory (has not responded to treatment) acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) with an IDH1 mutation (a type of genetic change).

      The goal of Part 2 is to learn if the highest tolerable dose of ivosidenib and venetoclax
      found in Part 1 can help to control the disease.

      The safety of this drug combination will be studied in both parts.

      This is an investigational study. Ivosidenib is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      Venetoclax is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of a certain type of
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is considered investigational to use ivosidenib in
      combination with venetoclax to treat AML.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 48 patients will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 5 groups of 6 participants will be enrolled in
      Part 1 of the study, and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose levels of venetoclax you receive will depend on when
      you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose levels of
      venetoclax. Each new group will receive a higher dose of venetoclax than the group before it,
      if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose
      of venetoclax is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of ivosidenib.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive ivosidenib and venetoclax at the highest dose
      that was tolerated in Part 1.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      You will take venetoclax by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-14 of each cycle. You should take
      your dose with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water and within 30 minutes of eating. Your dose of
      venetoclax will slowly increase over the first 3-5 days until you receive the full dose. Your
      dose level of venetoclax may change while on study, if needed. This will be discussed with
      you.

      You will take ivosidenib by mouth 1 time each day starting with Day 15 of Cycle 1. You may
      take your dose with or without food.

      You will record all of your doses in a study diary, which you should bring with you to each
      study visit. If you miss a dose and it is within 6 hours of the missed dose, you may take it.
      If you vomit after taking a dose, or more than 6 hours has passed since you missed a dose,
      you must not make-up the dose. Continue taking the next dose at your regular time.

      During Cycle 1, you will be admitted into the hospital as an inpatient for at least the first
      5-7 days of your study treatment. During this time, you will also be given standard drugs to
      help prevent . You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and
      their risks. TLS happens when breakdown products of the cancer cells enter the blood stream
      (causing weakness, low blood pressure, muscle cramps, kidney damage, and/or other organ
      damage).You will stay in the hospital for the first 5-7 days of study treatment. If the
      doctor thinks it is needed, you may need to stay in the hospital longer.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      TLS Testing:

      During Cycle 1, while you are admitted to the hospital to receive your first doses of
      venetoclax, blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be drawn to measure your levels of
      uric acid, potassium, creatinine, phosphorus, and calcium, and to check for symptoms of TLS
      at the following timepoints:

        -  Before each dose.

        -  6-8 hours after each dose.

        -  24 hours after each dose.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1-4 and 8 of Cycle 1:

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing. If it was not done at
           screening, on Day 1 only, this blood sample will also be used for biomarker testing.

        -  On Days 1 and 8 only, you will have a physical exam.

      On Day 22 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

      On Day 14 of Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing
      before the dose and then 6 more times over the next 24 hours after the dose.

      On Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine testing.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      On Day 28 (+/- 4 days ) of Cycle 1 and every odd-numbered cycle (+/- 7 days) after that
      (Cycles 3, 5, 7, and so on) for up to 1 year:

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for IDH1, cytogenetic, and biomarker
           testing.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every cycle after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 2 only, you will have an EKG.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3, you will have an EKG.

      End-of-Treatment (Final) Visit:

      When you have received your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for IDH1, cytogenetic, and biomarker
           testing.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      End-of- Study Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

      If at any point the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow
      aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      One (1) time each month for 3 years after the last participant has enrolled onto the study, a
      member of the study staff will contact you to ask how you are doing. This follow-up will take
      place either by phone or at a regularly scheduled clinic visit. If you are contacted by
      phone, the call should last about 15 minutes.
