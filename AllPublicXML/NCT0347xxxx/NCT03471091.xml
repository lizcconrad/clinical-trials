  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a worldwide common disease with high
      morbidity and mortality and leads to heavy social and economic burden. Health management of
      stable COPD patients has been suggested to be essential for delaying diseases progress,
      reducing acute exacerbation events and improving patient quality of life. Non-invasive
      ventilation (NIV) is a widely used treatment in COPD patients. There were studies shown that
      NIV could improve ventilation, blood gases etc., and several clinical trials have shown
      improvements in survival, exercise capacity, quality of life and so on. Compliance to NIV and
      optimal parameter setting are important factors that will affect the effect of the use of
      NIV, thus NIV usage monitoring might also be a crucial element in the health management of
      COPD patients. Many studies have been designed to study the effect of tele-monitoring program
      on the management of COPD patients. However, almost none of these studies were designed for
      specific population, and little is known about the effect of such program on the management
      of patients with NIV treatment.

      The COPD home management program consists of 3 Philips devices (NIV BiPAP ST, Oximeter and
      Blood Pressure Meter), a patient mobile APP which is developed for self-management at home
      and a professional physician web portal which is designed for NIV usage and other vital sign
      data monitoring. The program is intended to manage the post-discharge COPD patient by
      enhancing COPD patient condition monitoring and adherence to the home therapy, e.g. NIV in
      this study. Besides obtaining clinical proof points of the efficacy of such program on
      patients with NIV treatment, it will provide potential evidence of the usability as well as
      the collect the insights for future product improvement.
