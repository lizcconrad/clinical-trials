    <textblock>
      This prospective feasibility study is a single arm, non-randomized multi-center study
      evaluating the safety and performance of the MicroStent peripheral vascular stent system for
      use in arterial lesions below the knee. A total of 15 subjects will be enrolled at 3 centers
      and followed for up to 3 years, with the primary safety and efficacy endpoints evaluated 30
      days post-implant.

    <description>Patency is defined as freedom from target lesion occlusion (absence of blood flow via duplex ultrasound) with no clinically driven target lesion revascularization. A clinically driven revascularization is defined as reintervention due to complaints of leg pain/worsening pain, a progressing non-healing ulcer, or new ulcer formation with or without the presence of an abnormal noninvasive test.</description>
