  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims are as follows:

        -  To adapt our existing CBT4CBT program for use with Spanish-speaking alcohol users in a
           web-based platform

        -  To conduct an 8-week randomized trial evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of adding
           CBT4CBT-Spanish to treatment as usual in a community based treatment program in a
           population of 90 Spanish-speaking individuals who meet current criteria for alcohol use
           disorder

        -  To evaluate the long-term durability and/or delayed emergence of treatment effects
           through a six month follow-up after termination of the study treatments. Given previous
           evidence regarding the durability of standard clinician-delivered CBT and
           computer-assisted CBT4CBT, we hypothesize that CBT4CBTSpanish will be significantly more
           effective than standard treatment alone through the follow-up.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will conduct a Stage 1 randomized clinical trial evaluating the program in
      which 90 Spanish-speaking individuals with alcohol use disorder will be randomized to (1)
      standard outpatient counseling at the Hispanic Clinic (ST; typically consisting of weekly
      individual and group supportive counseling) or (2) CBT4CBT-Spanish as an adjunct to ST. Other
      aspects of the trial will parallel those in the investogators completed trial of the English
      version of CBT4CBT-Alcohol to facilitate comparability across studies. Treatments will be
      delivered over an 8-week period with a 6-month follow-up to assess durability and/or delayed
      emergence of treatment effects. The primary outcome measure will be percent days of
      abstinence (PDA) by week. Secondary outcomes include percent heavy drinking days and number
      of individuals with no heavy drinking days in the last 4 weeks of treatment.

      Participants will be 90 individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use at the Hispanic Clinic
      of CMHC. The clinic treats a heterogeneous population, where 42% of those in the co-occurring
      treatment program report alcohol as their principal substance related issue and 43% are
      women. As reported above, the investigators have demonstrated the ability to recruit,
      randomize, retain, and follow-up high numbers of closely related samples in this setting.

Participants will have access the CBT4CBT website in Spanish as an add-on to treatment. In this treatment participants will work with a computerized program that teaches skills for stopping alcohol use and increasing coping skills, such as how to understand patterns of alcohol use, how to cope with cravings for alcohol, how to refuse offers of alcohol, and so on.</description>
