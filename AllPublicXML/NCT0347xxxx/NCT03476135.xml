    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study to describe the immune persistence of the priming
      dose and describe the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of MenACYW conjugate
      vaccine in children in Finland who had been vaccinated 3 years earlier as toddlers with
      either MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as part of the MET54 study (NCT03205358).

      The objectives are:

        -  To describe the antibody persistence of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W before a
           booster dose in children who received either MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® 3
           years earlier as toddlers

        -  To describe the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W 30 days
           after a booster dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine in children who received either
           MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® 3 years earlier as toddlers

        -  To describe the antibody responses against tetanus toxoid 30 days after a booster dose
           of MenACYW conjugate vaccine in children who received either MenACYW conjugate vaccine
           or Nimenrix® 3 years earlier as toddlers

        -  To describe the safety profile of a booster dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine in
           children who received either MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® 3 years earlier as
           toddlers

      Healthy children who were vaccinated 3 years earlier at 12 to 23 months of age in study MET54
      (NCT03205358) are eligible for enrollment. All participants will receive a single booster
      dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine on Day 0. Immunogenicity will be assessed pre-vaccination
      and 30 to 44 days after vaccination. Safety will be assessed throughout the study period, and
      includes solicited injection site and systemic reactions (Day 0 to Day 7 post-vaccination);
      unsolicited adverse events up to Day 30 (Visit 2), and serious adverse events occurring
      throughout the trial.

             event has subsided
