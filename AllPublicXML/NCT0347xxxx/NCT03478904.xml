  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Enzalutamide is given to treat metastatic prostate cancer. But it takes 4 pills to deliver
      the effective dose. This can be difficult for people already taking multiple drugs. And
      swallowing may be difficult for some people. Researchers want to test out a new way of giving
      enzalutamide by mouth. They want to see if giving a person the liquid taken from inside the
      standard 4 gelatin capsules is handled by the body in the same way as giving them the
      capsules whole.

      Objectives:

      To compare how capsule and liquid forms of enzalutamide are handled by people with prostate
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Men at least 18 years old with prostate cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a heart test (electrocardiogram), medical history, and
      physical exam. A tissue sample or lab reports will be reviewed.

      During the study, participants will repeat screening tests and have urine tests.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to get the study drug in one of two orders: either the
      as capsules then the liquid form (Arm A) or as the liquid form then the capsule form (Arm B).

      Participants will be counseled about birth control.

      The study will have 2 periods with a minimum 42 day break in between.

      On Day 1 of Period 1 and Day 1 of Period 2, participants will be admitted to the hospital.
      They will get one dose of the study drug. They cannot eat or drink anything except water for
      at least 10 hours before and for 4 hours after the study drug. Their blood will be sampled
      over 24 hours. Lunch and dinner will be served. Participants will answer questions after
      taking the liquid form.

      Participants will have blood drawn on Day 3, Day 8, and Day 42.

      Background:

        -  Enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment of patients with mCRPC

        -  The marketed (reference) formulation of enzalutamide is a liquid-filled, soft gelatin
           capsule containing 40 mg enzalutamide dissolved in Labrasol; four such capsules are
           required to deliver a 160 mg dose

        -  The four-capsule regimen is inconvenient because of the number of capsules that must be
           taken, particularly in light of the fact that cancer patients usually have to take
           multiple drugs.

        -  Additionally, some patients may not be able to swallow pills; therefore, alternate
           methods of oral administration are necessary

      Objectives:

      -To evaluate the bioequivalence, safety, and tolerability of two oral formulations of
      enzalutamide following a single 160 mg dose in male subjects with prostate cancer under
      fasting conditions.

      Eligibility:

      -Male subjects with prostate cancer

      Design:

        -  Comparative, randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover bioavailability,
           safety and tolerability study

        -  Subjects will be randomized in Period 1 to one of two sequences: AB or BA. Following a
           minimum 42-day washout period, subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to receive the
           treatment that they did not receive in Period 1.

        -  Treatment A will be the standard capsule (reference) formulation; Treatment B will be
           the liquid formulation (test product)

        -  Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to enzalutamide or other agents used in study.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients with active treatment for active Hepatitis B and C infections.
