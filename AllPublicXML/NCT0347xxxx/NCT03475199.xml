  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FabLife is an interventional, prospective, multicentre, controlled study undertaken in
      metropolitan France.

      The main objective is to evaluate the effect of FabLife personalised program over a period of
      15 weeks on the improvement of spermatic DNA fragmentation in subfertile men compared to
      general dietary recommendations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 15 % of couples couldn't get pregnant after at least a year of unprotected
      intercourse.

      The FabLife personalised program aims to improve sperm quality including sperm DNA
      fragmentation in subfertile men through:

        -  A personalized dietary program based on patient's phenotype and genotype

        -  A daily dietary supplement, developed in the context of male infertility

      A total of 75 patients will be recruited:

        -  46 patients will benefit from the program,

        -  23 patients will form the control group.

        -  6 patients will not answer to all the criteria.
