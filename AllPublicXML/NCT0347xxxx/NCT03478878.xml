      Background:

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease. It is the leading cause of vision
      loss in people over 55 in the U.S. Changes in the eye can make it difficult for they eye to
      adjust to low light. This is known as dark adaptation. This is particularly significant in
      people with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). Identifying and watching the early to middle stages
      of AMD and changes in dark adaptation might help researchers learn to stop the disease before
      it becomes severe. Taking vitamin A might help improve vision in people with RPD.

      Objectives:

      To see if taking 16,000 IU of vitamin A per day improves vision in people with RPD. Also to
      improve understanding of RPD and associated dark adaptation.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 50 and older with RPD and normal liver function

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical and eye disease history

      Eye exam: The pupil will be dilated with eye drops. Pictures will be taken of the retina and
      the inside of the eye.

      Including the screening visit, participants will have at least 5 visits. They will be about
      once a month over 6 months and last 4 6 hours. Visits include:

      Questions about eye problems in certain light

      Eye exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Dark adaptation protocol: Participants will sit at a machine in a dark room. They will look
      into the machine and push a button when they see a light. This lasts 20 40 minutes.

      Participants will take a vitamin A supplement by mouth once a day for 2 months. They will
      record when they take the pills in a diary.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the potential efficacy of vitamin A
      palmitate in improving dark adaptation in participants with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and
      abnormal dark adaptation.

      Study Population: Five participants will be initially accrued, however, up to ten
      participants with RPD who meet the eligibility criteria may be enrolled. In the event that a
      participant withdraws from the study prior to receiving two months of study supplementation
      for a reason unrelated to an adverse reaction, an additional participant will be accrued. A
      maximum of five additional participants may be accrued in order to obtain five participants
      for the primary outcome analysis.

      Design: This is a pilot, uncontrolled, prospective, single center study to investigate the
      potential efficacy of vitamin A palmitate in improving dark adaptation in participants with
      AMD and abnormal dark adaptation.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the measurement of dark adaptation parameters
      (thresholds and kinetics) by the following: dark adaptation times as measured by the AdaptDx
      comparing before and after vitamin A palmitate and dark adaptation parameters as measured by
      the Medmont comparing before and after vitamin A palmitate supplementation. The secondary
      outcomes are changes in low luminance visual acuity (LLVA) and changes in patient reported
      outcomes as measured by the low luminance questionnaire (LLQ).

        STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The participant must have at least one eye meeting all inclusion criteria

          1. The eye must have a best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score better than or equal to
             20/80 (i.e., better than 54 letters).

          2. Participant must have presence of reticular pseudodrusen on multi-modal imaging.

          3. Abnormal dark adaptation, which is defined as having an AdaptDx test with a RIT of 18
             minutes or more at the screening visit. This is at least one standard deviation
             greater than the average normal RIT.

        STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The participant must have none of the exclusion criteria listed below

          1. Presence of advanced macular degeneration with central geographic atrophy or choroidal
             neovascularization.

          2. An ocular condition is present (other than AMD) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., vein
             occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma,
             Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).

          3. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

          4. History of major ocular surgery (e.g. cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within three months prior to study entry.

          5. History of YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum Garnet) capsulotomy performed within two months prior
             to study entry.

        CHOICE OF STUDY EYE IN CASES OF BILATERAL DISEASE:

        If both eyes meet the study eye eligibility criteria described above, the following
        criteria will be used to select the study eye for the purposes of this investigation:

          1. The eye with the better visual acuity will be chosen.

          2. If both eyes are equal acuity, the right eye will be arbitrarily chosen as the study
             eye
