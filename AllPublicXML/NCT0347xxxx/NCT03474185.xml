      Background:

      Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is the gold-standard in tertiary prevention of
      coronary artery disease (CAD), yet average CR attendance is only 67%. Patient education is
      commonly delivered during CR to impart information about CAD and its risk factors. An
      underlying assumption is that knowledge will enhance patients' attitudes toward CR, promote
      better program adherence, and improve clinically relevant cardiovascular outcomes. However,
      more formative work is needed to characterize the impact of patient education delivered in a
      CR setting on purported mechanisms-of-action in order to optimize efficacy. Few cardiac
      patient education interventions have been empirically validated, and it is unclear whether
      knowledge gains from education translate to improved CR attitudes and program adherence.

      Objective: This study aims to 1) examine the association between cardiac patient education
      and changes in knowledge about CAD, and; 2) explore whether changes in knowledge correspond
      to (a) improved attitudes about CR (perceived necessity, concerns about exercise, practical
      barriers, perceived personal suitability), and (b) increased CR adherence.

      Hypothesis: It is expected that 1) knowledge will increase from pre- to post-patient
      education, and 2) knowledge gains will be associated with improved CR attitudes and better CR
      adherence.

      Methods: 100 adults with CAD referred to outpatient CR will be recruited prior to attending
      four, mandatory 2.5-hour-long group-based education classes. Patients will subsequently
      attend supervised CR exercise sessions twice-weekly for 12 weeks. Validated questionnaires
      assessing knowledge about CAD and attitudes toward CR (i.e., perceived necessity, exercise
      concerns, barriers, perceived suitability) will be completed pre- and post-cardiac education
      classes, and 12-weeks post-CR. Adherence (# of CR exercise sessions attended) will be
      obtained by chart review.

      Implications: This study will help identify whether patient education delivered in a CR
      setting impacts hypothesized treatment targets and inform future efforts to optimize
      behavioral interventions for increasing CR utilization

      BACKGROUND &amp; RATIONALE:

      Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease (CAD), is a leading cause of
      death in Canada and worldwide. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is the gold standard intervention
      for tertiary prevention of CAD, and is associated with improvements in cardiovascular risk
      (e.g., blood pressure, psychological distress) and with 26% reductions in mortality. Despite
      these benefits, only 20-50% of eligible patients participate and even fewer attend all
      scheduled CR sessions. CR consists of multicomponent risk reduction interventions including
      exercise training and patient education (PE). An underlying assumption of PE is that
      imparting knowledge to patients will lead to changes in their adherence to health behaviours
      and, ultimately, influence cardiovascular outcomes. Decades of research from behavioural
      science, however, demonstrates that changing health behaviours, such as CR participation,
      requires more than knowing &quot;what&quot; to do, but also favourable attitudes and self-efficacy
      about behaviour change. PE has been demonstrated to enhance knowledge about CAD, but more
      work is needed to understand whether changes in knowledge translate into more positive
      attitudes, self-efficacy, and adherence to CR. To date, only one Canadian PE curriculum
      within a CR setting has been empirically evaluated, and cardiac PE classes across settings
      are often poorly described and variable in duration and format. To optimize adherence to CR
      and its associated survival benefits, there is a need to evaluate whether a well-described
      cardiac PE curriculum helps translate knowledge into favourable attitudes, self-efficacy, and
      CR attendance.

      PRIMARY AIM: To determine the impact of a Calgary-based patient education curriculum
      delivered in a CR setting (i.e., &quot;Taking Charge of your Heart Health&quot;; TCHH) on cardiac
      knowledge post-TCHH and at 12-week follow-up.

      SECONDARY AIMS:

        -  To examine the impact of cardiac education on attitudes toward CR, and self-efficacy for
           CR attendance from pre- to post-TCHH

        -  To examine whether increases in CAD knowledge are associated with improvements in
           attitudes toward CR, self-efficacy for CR adherence from pre- to post-TCHH oTo examine
           whether increases in CAD knowledge from pre- to post-TCHH are associated with CR
           adherence

      HYPOTHESES: It is predicted that (1) knowledge about CAD will increase from pre- to
      post-TCHH, and knowledge gains will be maintained at 12-weeks, and; (2) increases in
      knowledge will be positively associated with improvements in attitudes toward CR,
      self-efficacy toward CR participation, and actual CR adherence.

      METHODS:

      DESIGN: This is a prospective observational cohort study. As the cardiac education
      intervention is a mandatory component of participation in the CR program, the present study
      will observe and measure changes in CAD knowledge, CR attitudes, and CR adherence among
      eligible CR patients who choose to participate.

      CR PROGRAM: The CR program consists of four mandatory 2.5-hour group-based cardiac education
      classes (focused on physiology, risk factors, medications, nutrition, exercise, and stress
      management) followed by 12 weeks of supervised exercise training held twice weekly. All
      patients enrolled in the CR program are required to complete the 4 education classes prior to
      starting CR exercise.

      PROCEDURE:

      â€¢ Patients will complete a baseline battery of validated questionnaires assessing CAD
      knowledge, CR attitudes, and CR self-efficacy, as well as baseline demographic and medical
      information prior to their first TCHH class (T1). Measures of CAD knowledge, CR attitudes,
      and CR self-efficacy will be re-administered post-TCHH (T2), and after completion of CR
      exercise training (12-weeks; T3).

      DATA ANALYSIS: To evaluate the impact of patient education on knowledge, a repeated-measures
      ANOVA will be performed with time as the independent variable (T1, T2, T3), and CAD knowledge
      as the dependent variable. To evaluate the association between knowledge gains and CR
      attitudes, self-efficacy, and CR adherence, residualized change scores will be calculated for
      T1 to T2 knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The investigators will conduct separate
      regression models with knowledge change scores as the independent variable, and with CR
      attitudes change scores and CR adherence as dependent variables.

      IMPLICATIONS: This study will inform strategies to help increase knowledge, and translate
      knowledge into exercise adherence, among patients with CAD. Given the link between CR
      attendance and morbidity/mortality, efforts to optimize patient education interventions and
      CR utilization have the potential to significantly improve cardiovascular health outcomes.

    <description>Beliefs and Attitudes about CR (BACR) Scales (Cooper, Weinman, Hankins, Jackson, &amp; Horne, 2007)
13 items measured on four subscales assessing attitudes about CR (perceived necessity of CR, perceived suitability) and self-efficacy for completing CR exercise (concerns about exercise, practical barriers).
Patients rate their agreement/disagreement with each item (e.g., &quot;Attending CR may help the long-term recovery of my heart condition&quot;) on a 5-point Likert-type scale with anchors at &quot;1&quot; (strongly disagree) and &quot;5&quot; (strongly agree).
The BACR has established predictive validity for cardiac rehabilitation enrollment and attendance.
Residualized change scores will be calculated to determine changes in BACR scores from pre- to post- cardiac education, and from post-education to 12-weeks (i.e., after CR exercise is complete)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Referred to and eligible for the TotalCardiology CR program following a diagnosis of
             acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS patients will be targeted in this study because (a)
             they represent the most common patient group referred to TotalCardiology (~70% of
             referrals) and (b) patients with ACS follow an &quot;Early Cardiac Access Clinic&quot; stream at
             TCR that involves a different schedule of exercise appointments than other patient
             groups. Therefore recruiting ACS patients will enable a consistent CR referral and
             intake process across all study participants.
