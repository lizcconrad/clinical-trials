      This phase I trial studies the side effects of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody REGN2810
      (REGN2810) and/or ipilimumab when given together with stereotactic body radiation therapy
      before surgery in treating participants with prostate cancer that is growing, spreading, or
      getting worse, and has spread to other places in the body, or formed a small number of new
      tumors in one or two other parts of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-PD-1
      monoclonal antibody REGN2810 and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that
      sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less
      damage to normal tissue. Giving anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody REGN2810 and ipilimumab with
      stereotactic body radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability for an established effective dose of systemic
      REGN2810 and intraprostatic ipilimumab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in
      patients with locally advanced prostate cancer with or without oligometastatic disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall pathologic response rate after radical prostatectomy. II. To
      determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression free survival in men treated with
      REGN2810 and intraprostatic ipilimumab with SBRT.

      III. To determine radiographic progression free survival in men treated with REGN2810 and
      intraprostatic ipilimumab with SBRT.

      IV. Acute and chronic adverse events (AEs).
