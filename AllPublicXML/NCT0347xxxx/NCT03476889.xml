        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy, singleton, term infants

          2. Aged ≤14 days at randomisation/enrolment

          3. Birth weight within normal range for gestational age and sex

          4. Head circumference at birth within normal range for age and sex

          5. Maternal age ≥18 years at birth;

          6. Intervention arms: exclusively formula fed at randomisation (infants of mothers who
             autonomously chose not to breastfeed for any reason before their infant is ≤14 days of
             age, and who intend to exclusively formula feed until their infant is at least 17
             weeks of age); OR Breastfed reference arm: exclusively breastfed at enrolment (infants
             of mothers who intend to exclusively breastfeed until their infant is at least 17
             weeks of age);

          7. Written informed consent from parent(s) and/or legal guardian(s), who themselves are
             aged ≥18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Infants who require to be fed a special diet other than standard cow's milk based
             infant formula;

          2. Infants known or suspected to have cow's milk allergy, soy allergy and/or lactose
             intolerance;

          3. Infants known or suspected to have current or previous illnesses/conditions or
             interventions which could interfere with the study or its outcome parameters, as per
             the clinical judgement of the Investigator;

          4. Infants with known or suspected congenital diseases or malformations which could
             interfere with the study or its outcome parameters (including, but not limited to: GI
             malformations, congenital immunodeficiency), as per the clinical judgement of the
             Investigator;

          5. Infants with previous, current or intended participation in any other clinical study
             involving investigational or marketed products;

          6. Incapability of infants' parents/legally acceptable representatives to comply with
             study protocol or Investigator's uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the
             parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) to comply with the protocol
             requirements;

          7. Infants born from mothers with significant medical conditions during pregnancy that
             might interfere with the study or known to affect intra-uterine growth (e.g. placenta
             previa, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, gestational diabetes requiring insulin or oral
             medication) as per Investigator's judgement.

             Criteria for lactating mothers of subjects in the breastfed reference arm:

          8. Lactating women who are currently participating or intend to participate in any other
             clinical study involving investigational products. Participation in purely
             observational studies is permitted;

          9. Lactating women known to suffer from hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus;

         10. Lactating women known to have any other significant medical condition(s) which might
             interfere with the study or its outcome parameters (breast abscess or mastitis which
             could interfere with lactation, or other clinically relevant infections, or
             consumption of medication/substances which could impact the infants' growth), as per
             the clinical judgement of the Investigator;

         11. Lactating women who intend to feed their infants with a combination of human milk and
             infant formula.
