  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is an acquired disorder of hyperpigmentation characterised by blotchy, light-to-dark
      brown macules distributed symmetrically on the sun-exposed parts of the body.

      Although many factors have been proposed to have a role in pathogenesis, the exact ethology
      is yet to be understood. The most commonly identifiable risk factors include ultraviolet
      radiation, genetic predisposition, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, thyroid disease and drugs
      like antiepileptic. The excessive pigmentation has been attributed to both melanocytosis
      (increased number of melanocytes) as well as melano genesis (excess production of melanin) as
      confirmed in a histopathological study on Asian patients.] Furthermore, a vascular component
      has also been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of melisma. Kim et al. have found
      that lesion melasma skin had greater expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor in
      keratinocytes compared to nearby nonlesional skin.

      As regards management, the therapeutic options range from photoprotection, topical
      hypopigmenting agents, chemical peels and lasers. There are variety of less-tried systemic
      agents like fish oil, green tea and . Although no single agent has proved to be effective for
      all patients, a combination of two or three agents is often tried to achieve optimum results.

      Chemical peeling is the application of a chemical agent to the skin, which causes the
      controlled destruction of a part or of the entire epidermis, with or without the dermis,
      leading to exfoliation and removal of superficial lesions, followed by the regeneration of
      new epidermal and dermal tissues.

      Chemical peels are a well-known modality of treatment for melasma. The basic mechanism of the
      action of chemical peels in melasma is the removal of unwanted melanin by causing a
      controlled chemical burn to the skin.

      Trichlroacetic acid peeling has been the gold standard in chemical peeling for many decades.

      For superficial peels Trichlroacetic acid 10% to 25% are used. some authors consider up to
      35% Trichlroacetic acid as also a superficial.

      Skin microneedling is a technique predominantly used to improve the appearance of cutaneous
      scarring and photo damage.

      Fine needles puncture the skin, resulting in increased dermal elastin and collagen, collagen
      remodelling, and thickening of the epidermis and dermis. Additionally, skin needling creates
      small channels, which increase the absorption of topically applied preparations A property
      which has been used in various dermatological treatments.

    <intervention_model_description>TCA peeling session: Facial skin will be cleansed with tap water and degreased by rubbing with an alcohol sponge .
Then TCA 25% will be applied to the whole face by cotton tipped applicator or gauze pad. The entire face will be treated until complete frosting occur.
The patients will be instructed to wash their faces to decrease the burning sensation.
Combined session: starts with microneedling using microneedling device (Dermapen) The skin of each patient is cleaned with anti septic solution and anesthetic cream may be applied to lessen discomfort.
(Dermapen) will be applied on the lesional skin in four direction, vertical, horizontal and in the two diagonal until pin point bleeding occur which will be gently massaged .
After 10 minutes TCA peeling will be applied TCA peeling will be done for 8 session with 2 weeks interval between each session.
Microneedling will be done for 4session with 4 weeks interval between each session.</intervention_model_description>
