      A single-centre, prospective, observational study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Polyclonal Antibodies in simultaneous Pancreas Kidney Transplant recipients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyclonal antibody mainly contains Antit-Tlymphocyte globulins(Grafalon) and Anti-thymocyte
      globulins(ATG). To investigate the efficacy and safety of polyclonal antibodies induction
      regimen using Grafalon compared with ATG in de novo simultaneous pancreas kidney transplant
      recipients. The primary analysis of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the
      two regimens with regard to efficacy, defined as failure rate.

      The secondary objective of the study is the assessment of safety and further efficacy
      parameters in terms of incidence of acute rejections, graft/patient survival, DGF(delayed
      graft function), pancreas function and renal function

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. with end-stage,diabetic nephropathy(type1or 2)

          2. Patients scheduled to undergo SPK with compatible ABO blood type.

          3. Peak PRA &lt;50%

          4. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 48hrs
             prior to randomization and reliable methods of contraception should be started 4 weeks
             prior to and during the whole study.

          5. Patient must have signed the Patient Informed Consent Form.

          6. Patient must receive a primary simultaneous pancreas/kidney (SPK) cadaveric
             transplant, with either intestinal or bladder and either portal or systemic venous
             drainages.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          2. Patient has a positive T-cell crossmatch on the most recent serum specimen.

          3. Patient is known for active liver disease or has significant liver disease, defined by
             ASAT and ALAT serum levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal.

          4. Patient has malignancy or history of malignancy, with the exception of adequately
             treated localised squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma, without recurrence.

          5. Patient has been included in another clinical trial protocol for any investigational
             drug within 4 weeks prior to randomisation.

          6. Patient has any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder or condition, which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may invalidate communication.

          7. Patient receives a SPK transplant from a living donor, or receives segmental
             pancreatic transplant, or a previous kidney transplant alone.
