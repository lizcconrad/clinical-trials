  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to develop an intervention that combines mTBI-specific motor and cognitive
      challenges into a progressive and challenging rehabilitation program. We plan to develop and
      refine a combined motor and cognitive intervention using healthy athletic young adults (n=12)
      and people with a positive history of non-resolving mTBI (n=12). We will conduct limited
      feasibility testing by conducting 6 week training sessions with each subject group. We also
      plan to identify best measures for determining readiness for duty or full function by
      incorporating and testing 3 dual-task assessment measures using state-of-the-art wearable
      sensors to quantify movement.

In addition to providing comparison data, the healthy control, athletic 18-34 year old subjects will be used to identify levels and intensity of progressions of dual-task training stations appropriate for highly trained athletes and military personnel recovering from concussion.</description>

    <description>The intervention will take place 3 times per week for 6 weeks (60 minutes/session) and employs motor and cognitive challenges. It is based on known motor and cognitive deficits after mTBI and is structured using a theoretical framework published in another domain of neurologic disease. The intervention will consist of 6 stations that target known motor and cognitive impairments after mTBI. Each station will have 3 levels of difficulty with optional cognitive progressions. Subjects will spend 8 minutes at each station with a 2 minute transition/rest period between stations and will be progressed in motor and cognitive difficulty as able.</description>
