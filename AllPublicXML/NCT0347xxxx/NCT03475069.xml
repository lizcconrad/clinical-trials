  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a widespread worldwide disease. Exercise therapy is an
      effective method but which exercise types are more effective is an important question.

      This study was designed to compare the effects of three different exercise programs on
      physical function and quality of life in Type 2 DM. Forty-two patients with Type 2 DM
      participated in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Client based
      exercises in accordance with physiotherapy assessment were applied to group 1 (aged
      51.42±4.60 years; body mass index 35.28±4.21 kg/m² kg/m²), Clinical Plates exercises were
      applied to group 2 (aged 53.07 ±5.12 years; body mass index 35.56±4.83 kg/m²) and a standard
      program including calisthenics exercises were applied to group 3 for 12 weeks, 3 days a week.
      6 minutes walk test (6 MWT) and physiological cost index (PCI), timed up and go test (TUG)
      and SF-36 quality of life questionnaire were performed before and after the 12-week exercise
      program.

    <measure>Energy expenditure after physical performance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physiological cost index (PCI) calculated during 6 minutes walk test (6MWT) after exercise period. PCI is a clinical tool thought to indicate the energy expenditure. Subjects walk at their preferred pace, usually following a track of known distance, while heart rate and time are noted. After measurement of resting heart rate, a person's PCI in beats per meter is calculated. 6MWT measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway. Mean PCI values for healthy adults have been reported to be between 0.23 and 0.42 beat/meter. The energy consumption increases as the number increases and it indicates fatigue. Lower than 0.23 indicates low energy consumption and is not considered normal.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire was applied after exercise period. SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. The test consists of 36 questions and requires 10 minutes to administer. The Sf-36 includes a multi-item scale with 8 subscales. The SF-36 has eight scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section.
Scores range from 0 - 100. Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability
Sections:
Vitality, Physical functioning, Bodily pain, General health perceptions, Physical role functioning, Emotional role functioning, Social role functioning, Mental health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Standing, walking and sitting performance were measured after exercise period by timed up and go test (TUG). TUG is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. ≤10 seconds=normal, ≤ 20 seconds=good mobility, can go out alone, mobile without gait aid, ≤ 30 seconds=problems, can not go outside alone, requires gait aid.</description>

    <measure>Body mass index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. It was measured by bioelectrical impedance device.
A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered healthy. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.</description>
