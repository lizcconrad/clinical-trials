      To develop a repository of blood, urine and tissue samples from patients with ILD to support
      future studies into the development of such biomarkers.

      The proposed biospecimen repository would be derived from patients diagnosed with ILD. This
      is to include 500 patients in the repository, with each patient contributing approximately 5
      longitudinal blood and urine samples. The longitudinal blood and urine samples participation
      will be optional. Depending on the patient's disease activity, which determines the frequency
      of clinical visits, serial blood and urine samples will be collected from individual patients
      on a quarterly to annual basis.

      In addition, the researchers would also like to keep any leftover lung tissue from any
      clinical procedures that are performed. Tissue will be used for future research and may be
      stored indefinitely. The residual tissue collection will be optional.

      To develop a repository of blood (collected at each study visit), urine (collected at each
      study visit), and surgical residual lung tissue (will be collected if patient is having a
      surgical lung biopsy) samples from patients with ILD to support future studies into the
      development of such biomarkers. The repository would be maintained in Dr. Carmona's
      laboratory the Thoracic Diseases Research Unit in the Stabile building where all biospecimens
      will be stored.

      These samples will be stored in freezers in Dr. Carmona's laboratory space in the Thoracic
      Diseases Research Unit in the Stabile building for future research.
