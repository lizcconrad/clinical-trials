  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if changing the frequency or intensity of
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can reduce the development of tolerance to
      TENS treatment.

      Healthy adults will come daily for 5 consecutive days to the testing room. Pressure pain
      thresholds (PPT) will be the outcome measure and will be used to measure the subject's pain
      threshold to deep mechanical pressure. Subjects will push a button to stop the PPT test when
      they first begin to feel a sensation of pain. The PPT test will be done before TENS
      application. The TENS unit will be applied based on random assignment to 1 of 5 treatment
      types and subjects will not be told which group they are assigned to. Those groups are: 1)
      placebo TENS, 2) high frequency TENS, 3) alternating frequency TENS, 4) modulated frequency
      TENS, or 5) high frequency TENS with increased intensity daily. The TENS unit will be applied
      for 30 minutes. After 20 minutes the PPT test will be completed a second time. This procedure
      will occur on all 5 consecutive days of testing. Data will be measured and recorded by an
      assessor blind to subject group. Blinding will be assessed at the end of testing on day 5.

    <description>Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) change score measured in kPa will be assessed on the forearm using a pressure algometer. The pressure algometer is mechanical pressure applied by the research assistant at a gradual rate by pushing the device against the skin. The device has a 1 cm2 pad that is in contact with the skin. The subject has a button that they push when the pressure first becomes painful (threshold)which stops the test and the pressure amount is recorded by the research assistant. This is the amount of pressured in kPa that is required to cause a subjective pain of 1/10 on a scale of 0 (no Pain) to 10 (Maximum Pain) rating by the subject. The change score from day 1 to Day 5 is the primary outcome measure.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is utilized clinically by a variety of health care professionals for the reduction of pain. The mechanisms by which TENS produces analgesia or reduces pain are only recently being elucidated. TENS is a non-invasive modality that is inexpensive, safe and easy to use with relatively few contraindications. Frequency of stimulation is broadly classified as high frequency (&gt;50Hz), low frequency (&lt;10Hz) TENS. Intensity is determined by the response of the patient as either sensory level (low-intensity) TENS strong but comfortable. With sensory level TENS, the voltage (i.e. amplitude) is increased only until the patient feels a comfortable tingling (perceived with high frequency) or tapping (perceived with low frequency) sensation without motor contraction. With strong but comfortable TENS the intensity is increased to a strong but comfortable level which may include muscle contraction.</description>
