        Clinical Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female ≥18 years of age;

          2. Rutherford Clinical Category 2-4;

          3. Patient is willing to provide informed consent, is geographically stable and comply
             with the required follow up visits, testing schedule and medication regimen;

             Angiographic Lesion Inclusion Criteria:

          4. Length ≤15 cm;

          5. Up to two focal lesions or segments within the designated 15 cm length of vessel may
             be treated (e.g. two discrete segments, separated by several cm, but both falling
             within a composite length of &lt;15 cm);

          6. ≥70% stenosis by visual estimate;

          7. Lesion location starts ≥1 cm below the common femoral bifurcation and terminates
             distally ≤2 cm below the tibial plateau AND ≥1 cm above the origin of the TP trunk;

          8. de novo lesion(s) or non-stented restenotic lesion(s) &gt;90 days from prior angioplasty
             procedure;

          9. Lesion is located at least 3 cm from any stent, if target vessel was previously
             stented;

         10. Target vessel diameter between ≥4 and ≤6 mm and able to be treated with available
             device size matrix;

         11. Successful, uncomplicated (without use of a crossing device) antegrade wire crossing
             of lesion;

         12. A patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by
             angiography (treatment of target lesion acceptable after successful treatment of
             inflow artery lesions); NOTE: Successful inflow artery treatment is defined as
             attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death or major vascular
             complication.

         13. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%)
             stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been revascularized
             (treatment of outflow disease is NOT permitted during the index procedure);

         14. Contralateral limb lesion(s) cannot be treated within 2 weeks before and/or planned 30
             days after the protocol treatment in order to avoid confounding complications;

         15. No other prior vascular interventions within 2 weeks before and/or planned 30 days
             after the protocol treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded if ANY of the following conditions apply:

          1. Pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant or men intending to father children;

          2. Life expectancy of &lt;5 years;

          3. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or other device study or
             previously enrolled in this study; NOTE: Enrollment in another clinical trial during
             the follow up period is not allowed.

          4. History of hemorrhagic stroke within 3 months;

          5. Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 2 weeks before or
             within 30 days after the index procedure;

          6. History of MI, thrombolysis or angina within 2 weeks of enrollment;

          7. Rutherford Class 0, 1, 5 or 6;

          8. Renal failure or chronic kidney disease with MDRD GFR ≤30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (or serum
             creatinine ≥2.5 mg/L within 30 days of index procedure or treated with dialysis);

          9. Prior vascular surgery of the index limb, with the exception of remote common femoral
             patch angioplasty separated by at least 2 cm from the target lesion;

         10. Inability to take required study medications or allergy to contrast that cannot be
             adequately managed with pre- and post-procedure medication;

         11. Anticipated use of IIb/IIIa inhibitor prior to randomization;

         12. Ipsilateral retrograde access;

         13. Composite lesion length is &gt;15 cm or there is no normal proximal arterial segment in
             which duplex flow velocity can be measured;

         14. Significant inflow disease. Successful treatment of inflow disease allowed prior to
             target lesion treatment;

         15. Known inadequate distal outflow (&gt;50 % stenosis of distal popliteal and/or all three
             tibial vessels), or planned future treatment of vascular disease distal to the target
             lesion;

         16. Sudden symptom onset, acute vessel occlusion, or acute or sub-acute thrombus in target
             vessel;

         17. Severe calcification that renders the lesion un-dilatable;

         18. Use of adjunctive treatment modalities (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty,
             scoring/cutting balloon, etc.).
