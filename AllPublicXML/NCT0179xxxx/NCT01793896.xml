      Both dietary caloric restriction (CR) and physical exercise (PE) exert beneficial effects,
      which retard or prevent age-related diseases and prolong life span. Subjects with the
      metabolic syndrome age prematurely, therefore preventive measures should be initiated early.
      The present study intends to demonstrate that physical exercise and/or Mediterranean diet, in
      middle aged volunteers with the metabolic syndrome, preserve adequate adipose tissue
      functionality and retard skeletal muscle aging (assessed by mitochondrial biogenesis and
      accumulation of ROS), by activating several pathways, homologous to CR. The investigators
      plan to study this by using two approaches: 1) A cross- sectional model, in which the
      expression of the mentioned metabolic mediators, indicators of muscle mitochondrial
      biogenesis and muscle oxidative damage will be compared between men with different body
      compositions, fat distribution, muscle strength and exercise capacity (VO2max). Also, in
      these men the investigators will assess the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in
      subcutaneous white adipose tissue (as a measure of adaptive thermogenesis), and inflammatory
      markers (Interleukin 1-6, Interleukin 1ß and CCL2 chemokine (C-C motif ligand 2)) in
      preperitoneal adipose tissue, plus inflammation and adipogenesis potential of their cultured
      preadipocytes. Moreover, in vitro studies will evaluate the functional effects of exposure of
      a cell lyne of human adipocyte cells (LS14)to factors secreted by media conditioned by the
      patients´ adipose tissue explants. 2) A prospective intervention in overweight/moderately
      obese middle aged volunteers that will be assigned to a weight-maintenance period (as a
      control group), and then randomly y assigned to a Mediterranean diet, exercise training or
      diet plus training. Before and after 3 months of intervention the investigators will obtain
      muscle tissue samples to study the expression of Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
      (PPAR) gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), AMP activated protein
      kinase (AMPK), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1), mitochondrial DNA and oxidative damage indicators
      (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (oxodG), carboxymethyllysine (CML and its receptor
      (RAGE)). In vitro studies will evaluate the effect of circulating factors from the patients
      (serum) on LS14 inflammatory and adipogenic potential, at baseline and after 3 months of
      intervention.

      Before the operation and after signing a written informed consent, the following assessment
      will be performed:

        1. Medical history including medication intake and complete physical examination.

        2. Dietary recall of habitual intake and calculation of AGEs ingestion.

        3. Regular physical activity assessment using the International Physical Activity
           Questionnaire

        4. Anthropometrics (height, weight, waist circumference)

        5. Fasting blood sampling for routine determinations (haemoglobin,lipoproteins,
           creatinine,prothrombin, TSH), AGEs concentrations (CML) free fatty acids, adiponectin
           and 8- Isoprostanes.

        6. Fasting and post glucose serum sampling for glucose and insulin measurements, and
           calculation of Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) and the Matsuda Index for
           determination of peripheral insulin sensitivity.

        7. Resting and exercise indirect calorimetry for estimation of resting energy expenditure,
           respiratory quotient and VO2 max.

        8. Handgrip and quadriceps muscle strength

        9. Dual X-Ray Energy Densitometry (DEXA) for estimation of body composition

       10. CT scan of abdominal region at L4 level for measurement of visceral and subcutaneous fat
           areas and estimation of liver fat infiltration.

       11. Ultrasound intensity analysis in thigh ultrasonography indicating muscle fat
           infiltration. After the initial evaluation, subjects will be classified as with or
           without the metabolic syndrome, according to the international guidelines guidelines,
           for further analysis of data.

      A few days later, during the surgical procedure, a sample of muscle tissue (approximately 200
      mg of internal abdominal oblique) will be obtained for measurement of:

        1. Fiber type

        2. Messenger Ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of PGC-1-alpha, SIRT-1, UCP-3 and AMPK

        3. Mitochondrial density by measurement of mitDNA and Cytochrome C activity

        4. Oxidative damage (8-oxodG, CML and RAGE).

      During the same operation, 2 samples of adipose tissue will also be obtained, one
      subcutaneous (at the site of the incision) and the other preperitoneal (at the inguinal sac),
      for in vitro studies:

        1. UCP1 and inflammatory marker (interleukin 6, 1ß, CCL2) expression in mature adipocytes

        2. Inflammatory profile and adipogenic potential (expression of lipoprotein lipase, PPAR
           gamma and adiponectin) in cultured preadipocytes

        3. Adipogenic potential and inflammatory expression profile of LS14 adipose cells exposed
           to conditioned media from adipose tissue explants.

      A small part of these adipose tissue samples will be placed in formaldehyde, fixed and
      stained with H.E for histologic estimation of adipocyte cell size.

    <description>selected subjects will adopt a Mediterranean low-AGE diet. We will not include red wine in the Mediterranean diet (7 Kilocalories (KCal)/g), in order to attain more weight loss. Each subject will be instructed to reduce 500 Kcal of their estimated total daily energy requirements, so theoretically they will be able to reduce 5 - 10 % of their body weight in 3 months.</description>
