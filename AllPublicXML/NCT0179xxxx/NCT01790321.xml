  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of this study is to determine the effect of the daily consumption of
      zinc-fortified water provided by the LSF-filter on zinc status and diarrhea rates in school
      age children from rural areas characterized by a high risk of zinc deficiency and by elevated
      stunting prevalence.

      A double-blind efficacy study will be carried out over 4 months in school age children
      enrolled in a primary school equipped with a water pump, in the rural area of the commune of
      Natitingou, Benin. Participating children will be randomly assigned to one of two groups of
      intervention or control. On a daily basis, all children will consume a defined quantity of
      pump-water outside of meals. The water offered to children in the first group of intervention
      will be previously filtered and zinc-fortified by the LSF-filter; the children in the second
      group will receive water that has been filtered only. A nutrition survey will provide an
      indication of dietary zinc intake. The effect of enriched water consumption on children's
      zinc status will be evaluated by analyzing the concentration of zinc in serum at baseline,
      midpoint and endpoint of the intervention. Diarrhea rates will be monitored by recording
      episodes of diarrhea.

    <description>LifeStraw Family is a water purification device that by means of hollow fibres removes solid particles (&lt;0.5 NTU turbidity reduction), bacteria (&gt;Log 6 reduction), viruses (&gt;Log 4 reduction) and cysts (&gt;Log 3 reduction). Zinc fortification is provided by a chamber housing a zinc releasing glass-plate that is placed annexed to the hollow fibre column. It is estimated that the LSF can provide about 5 mg of zinc/l of filtered water. By consuming daily a portion of 0.6 litres of enriched water, &gt;100% of the age-specific estimated physiologic requirement would be covered, assuming a fractional absorption of 40%.</description>
