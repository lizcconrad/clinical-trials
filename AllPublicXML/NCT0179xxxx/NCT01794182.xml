  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, prospective, double blind study. The primary objective is
      to demonstrate the efficacy of RP-1127 compared to placebo in subjects with a severe anterior
      circulation ischemic stroke who are likely to develop malignant edema. This objective will be
      addressed by comparing the proportion of RP-1127 treated patients and placebo treated
      patients with a Day 90 modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 4 without decompressive craniectomy
      (DC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population consists of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of acute severe anterior
      circulation ischemic stroke, a baseline diffusion weighted image (DWI) lesion between 82 and
      300 cm3, age 18-80 years, and time from symptom onset to start of study infusion of ≤10
      hours. The study will enroll both patients that do not receive IV rtPA and those that receive
      IV rtPA within 4.5 hours of stroke.

      Enrollment will be randomized controlling for site, age ≤60 (yes/no), and IV rtPA treatment
      at baseline (yes/no). Subjects will be randomized equally between RP-1127 and placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke in the MCA territory (PCA and/or ACA
             territory involvement in addition to primary MCA territory stroke is acceptable).

          -  Prior to stroke, no disability, or no significant disability despite symptoms (able to
             carry out all usual duties and activities).

          -  A baseline DWI lesion between 82 and 300 cm3 on MRI.

          -  Patients treated with IV rtPA should meet established criteria for IV rtPA
             administration in the 0-3 and 3-4.5 hr time periods at the time of rtPA administration
             (if rtPA is administered in the 3-4.5 hr time window, the NIHSS must be ≤ 25 at the
             time of rtPA administration).

          -  The time to the start of infusion of Study Drug must be ≤ 10 hours after time of

             neurologic baseline&quot; (TLK@B)].
