    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the safety of PLX-PAD to treat pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH). PLX-PAD is a cell-based product made of allogeneic
      Mesenchymal-like Adherent Stromal Cells (ASCs), derived from human full-term placentas
      following an elective caesarean section. This year-long study will evaluate the safety of
      three different dose levels of PLX-PAD, each given as a single intravenous infusion. This
      study will also evaluate effects that PLX-PAD may have on PAH, such as changes in the ability
      to exercise and on other tests used to measure the disease severity.

        Summary of inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        Eligible subjects:

          -  Have a minimum weight of 45 kg

          -  Have a diagnosis of idiopathic or heritable PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue
             disease (CTD), PAH associated with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary cardiac
             shunt (at least one year since repair), or PAH associated with appetite
             suppressant/drug or toxin use confirmed by RHC

        Subjects must not:

          -  Have any evidence of pulmonary thrombus, significant coronary artery disease (CAD),
             left ventricular dysfunction, or a restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy

             undergo radiation therapy, chemotherapy and/or surgical intervention, or to initiate
