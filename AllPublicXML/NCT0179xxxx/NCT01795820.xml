  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor is currently indicated for treatment of patients
      presenting with acute coronary syndrome. Such therapy is started with the administration of a
      loading dose in patients which are not yet under treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors
      (antiplatelet agents). However it is unknown whether a loading dose is needed to maintain a
      satisfactory inhibition of platelet aggregation in patients who are already treated with a
      previous generation P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel) during the passage to the newer compound
      ticagrelor. For this reason aim of the present study is to evaluate the levels of platelet
      aggregation during the pharmacological shift from clopidogrel to ticagrelor performed with or
      without a loading starting dose of the newer drug.

    <description>Patients allocated to this group will not receive a loading dose of ticagrelor.

    <description>Patients allocated to this group will receive a loading dose of ticagrelor. In other words, clopidogrel 75 mg/die will be administered until the day before the pharmacological shift (study start). On the very day of the pharmacological shift, patients allocated in Group 2 will receive Ticagrelor 180 mg (loading dose) on the morning and Ticagrelor 90 mg on the evening, while ticagrelor 90 mg bis in die will be administered from the day after the pharmacological shift on.</description>

In other words, patients randomized to this group (group 1) will not receive a loading dose of ticagrelor during the passage from clopidogrel to ticagrelor.</description>
