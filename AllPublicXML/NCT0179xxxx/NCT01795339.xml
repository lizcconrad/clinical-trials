  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part multiple dose study in healthy male and female (of non-child bearing
      potential) elderly volunteers, and in Alzheimer's disease patients, to assess the safety,
      effects on the body, and blood, CSF, and urine drug levels of AZD3293. AZD3293 is being
      developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease

    <description>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. Some questions are yes/no and some are on a scale of 1 (low severity) to 5 (high severity). Completed suicide and non-fatal suicide events are yes/no questions and results presented are the number of participants with these events. Worsening of suicidal ideation was an increase in severity of suicidal ideation from baseline.</description>
