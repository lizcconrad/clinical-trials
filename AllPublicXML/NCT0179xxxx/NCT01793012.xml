    <textblock>
      Infections are critical factors for the survival of critically ill patients. A broad,
      high-dose and early initial therapy of antibiotics is of particular relevance.

      A serious problem is the high variability of antibiotic serum concentrations after
      administration of antibiotics in patients of the critical care units. This may result in the
      risk of underdosage with possible ineffective therapeutic levels as well as in the risk of
      overdosage with possible adverse and toxic effects. The goal of this study is to determine
      antibiotic concentrations in blood and to evaluate concentrations with the course of the
      therapy. The measurement of antibiotic concentrations in blood may allow an individual
      adaption of the dose in future.

      100 - 200 patients will be included in this study. Only critically ill patients of the ICU of
      the Department of Anaesthesiology will be included that receive one or more of the following
      antibiotics: piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and
      colistin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substantial variations of serum concentrations of different antibiotics with partly
      insufficient levels have been observed in critically ill patients. The high variabilities
      between the pharmacokinetic parameters in different patients argue for a therapeutic drug
      monitoring (TDM) in intensive care units. TDM may lower the risk of overdosage with possible
      adverse and toxic effects as well as the risk of underdosage with possible insufficient
      therapeutic effects and development of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate variabilities of pharmacokinetic parameters of different widely used antibiotics and
      to correlate them with clinical and laboratory parameters. Therefore, numerous clinical and
      laboratory parameters including serum, urine and dialysate concentrations of 6 different
      antibiotics will be determined in 100 - 200 critically ill patients of the Department of
      Anaesthesiology, University Hospital of Munich. Laboratory parameters (e.g. inflammatory
      parameters) will be quantified by facilities of the Institute of Laboratory Medicine,
      University Hospital of Munich. Concentrations of antibiotics will be determined by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We expect that correlations between antibiotic
      serum concentrations and clinical and laboratory outcome parameters will be found.

    <description>The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the variability of antibiotic serum concentrations in critically ill patients. In total, serum concentrations of 6 different antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and colistin) in 100-200 patients of the ICU will be determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</description>

    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Moreover, we will evaluate if antibiotic serum concentrations differ between the different diseases (e.g. ARDS, sepsis) and the different therapies (e.g. different transplantation types (liver,lung) patients with and without renal replacement therapy).
Correlation between antibiotics serum concentrations and Apache II score / SOFA score. Correlation between antibiotics serum concentrations and CRP, procalcitonin, interleukin-6.
Finally minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics will be documented in case of detection of pathogens.</description>
