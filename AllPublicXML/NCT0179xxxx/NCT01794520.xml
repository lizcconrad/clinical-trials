    <textblock>
      The phase 1 primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety profile, characterize
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and determine the dosing schedule, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and
      recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD) of ABT-199 (venetoclax) when administered in subjects with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This study will also assess the safety profile and
      PK of venetoclax in combination with dexamethasone in subjects with t(11;14)-positive
      multiple myeloma.

      The phase 2 primary objective is to further evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) and
      very good partial response or better rate (VGPR+) in subjects with t(11;14)-positive multiple
      myeloma and to evaluate patient reported outcomes.

          -  Diagnosis of multiple myeloma previously treated with at least one prior line of
             therapy. Induction therapy followed by stem cell transplant and maintenance therapy
             will be considered a single line of therapy. For Safety Expansion, subjects must have
             been previously treated with a proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib) and an
             immunomodulatory agent (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide). For Venetoclax-Dexamethasone
             Combination, subjects must have been been previously treated with a proteasome
             inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib) and an immunomodulatory agent (e.g., thalidomide,
             lenalidomide) AND have t(11;14)-positive multiple myeloma per the central lab testing.
             For Phase 2, subjects must have documented MM positive for t(11;14) translocation. If
             testing has been performed by non-central lab, retesting must be confirmed by central
             lab. Subjects must have evidence of disease progression on or within 60 days of last
             dose of most recent previous treatment based on IMWG criteria AND subjects must have
             previously received at least 3 prior lines of therapy, including and immunomodulatory
             drug, a proteasome inhibitor, daratumumab, and glucocorticosteroids. Daratumumab
             combination regimen MUST be one of the prior lines of therapy (for this study,

          -  Measurable disease at Screening: Serum monoclonal protein of at least 1.0 g/dL (10g/L)
             by protein electrophoresis or at least 200 mg of monoclonal protein in the urine on
             24-hr electrophoresis or serum immunoglobulin free light chain of at least 10 mg/dL
             and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda free light chain ratio.

          -  Subjects with a history of autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation must have
             adequate peripheral blood counts independent of any growth factor support, and have
             recovered from any transplant related toxicity(s) and be at least 100 days
             post-autologous transplant prior to first dose of study drug or at least 6 months
             post-allogenic transplant prior to first dose of study drug and not have active
             graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), i.e., requiring treatment.

          -  Meet the following laboratory parameters, per the reference range: ANC of at least
             1000/μL (Subjects may use growth factor support to achieve ANC eligibility criteria),
             AST and ALT not higher than 3 x ULN, Calculated creatinine clearance of at least 30
             mL/min using a modified Cockcroft-Gault calculation, platelet count of at least 30,000
             mm³ (independent of transfusion for 2 weeks), hemoglobin of at least 8.0 g/dL
             (subjects may receive blood transfusion to achieve hemoglobin eligibility criteria),
             and total bilirubin not higher than 1.5 x ULN (subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome may
             have bilirubin higher 1.5 x ULN with approval of sponsor medical monitor).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exhibits evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s),
             including, but not limited to: uncontrolled systemic infection (viral, bacterial, or
             fungal), diagnosis of fever and neutropenia within 1 week prior to first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class greater than or
             equal to 3.

          -  Significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic, metabolic,
             immunologic, cardiovascular or hepatic disease, within the last 6 months that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would adversely affect his/her participation in the
             study.

          -  History of other active malignancies other than multiple myeloma within the past 3
             years prior to study entry, with the following exceptions: adequately treated in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix uteri, basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin, Prostate cancer gleason grade 6 or lower AND with stable
             prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels off treatment, previous malignancy confined and
             surgically resected (or treated with other modalities) with curative intent.

          -  Known HIV infection.

          -  Active hepatitis B or C infection
