  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a specifically designed ankle foot
      orthosis (AFO, hinged, with tamarack joint and adjustable check strap) on the spatial and
      temporal gait parameters, electromyography (EMG), and walking endurance, in select
      individuals living with MS. This orthotic is fabricated to allow ankle range of motion
      required for normal gait kinematics. Additionally, it controls forward progression of the
      tibia during the stance phase of gait. This study has three hypotheses 1. Individuals who are
      fit with the AFO will demonstrate improvements in spatial and temporal gait parameters 2.
      Individuals who are fit with the AFO will demonstrate improvements in walking endurance, and
      3. Individuals who are fit with the AFO will demonstrate improvements in muscle firing
      profiles/EMG measures.

      This is a non-randomized, single group (N=15), repeated measures study. The study will take
      place at the David M. Crowley Research and Rehabilitation Lab in the School of Health
      Professions at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The outcome measures for the
      study include: 1. GAITRite System for temporal and spatial parameters, 2. EMG of the anterior
      tibialis, gastrocnemius, and vastus lateralis muscles, 3. 6 Minute Walk Test (gait endurance)
      4. Lower extremity strength, 5. MS Fatigue scale, 6. Observational Gait Analysis - Video tape
      of over ground walking. This study will be 13 weeks long. Over the 13 week period, the
      subject will participate in 5 gait training sessions which will be at weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, and
      10. They will be 60 minutes in duration. Outcome measures will be assessed at the following
      times: initial (T1), week 5 (T2), and week 13 (T3). Subjects will be closely monitored
      throughout the 13 week study and will be un-enrolled by self-request or the following medical
      reasons: 1. Acute exacerbation of MS symptoms, 2. New diagnosis with direct consequences
      affecting gait training, 3. Inability to tolerate the study AFO.

    <time_frame>Surface EMG will be done at the time of enrollment and week 13.</time_frame>
    <description>Surface electromyography will be done on key muscles in the lower extremity (quadriceps, anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius) during computerized gait assessment. Changes in muscle activity would be things like large changes in amplitude of muscle firing or changes in the timing of muscle firing, for example. These would indicate changes in strength or perhaps motor learning as a result of wearing the ankle foot orthosis.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change in Muscle Activity With Surface Electromyography (EMG) of Key Lower Extremity Muscles From Baseline to Final Testing</title>
        <description>Surface electromyography will be done on key muscles in the lower extremity (quadriceps, anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius) during computerized gait assessment. Changes in muscle activity would be things like large changes in amplitude of muscle firing or changes in the timing of muscle firing, for example. These would indicate changes in strength or perhaps motor learning as a result of wearing the ankle foot orthosis.</description>
