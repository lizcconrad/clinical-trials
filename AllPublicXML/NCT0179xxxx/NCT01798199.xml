  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual environments and information communication technologies (ICT) offer large
      perspectives in the field of assistive care and rehabilitation.

      As potentially endless, the scenarios and environment used using 3D can provide immersive
      social and interactive context for enjoyable and therapeutic exercises in the aging
      population. In addition it is also possible to use this type of serious game and scenario in
      very easy to use devices such as lap top or tablet.

      Social exclusion has many causes, Apathy as one of the most common behavioural disturbances
      found in old adults populations alters significantly social and emotional interaction.

      Even though, progress in VR has been made over the past year, the presence of such technology
      in daily living space is still at the embryonic stage.

      The European e-Inclusion policy stresses the importance of ICT in improving the quality of
      life in potentially disadvantaged groups, including older people and persons.

      The VERVE project is developing ICT tools to support the treatment of people who are at risk
      of social exclusion due to apathy associated with a disability.

      As people aged and autonomy worsen fear for safety and comfortable means to maintain social
      and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) status are public health issues.

      Moreover, even though older adults would like to perform some activities such as walking in
      the streets some are reluctant to go out of their homes as the external environment is
      perceived as potentially unsafe.

      Apathy, the most common behavioural symptoms in aging population is characterized by symptoms
      of reduced initiation and responsiveness to environmental interactions. The syndrome of
      Apathy takes form of diminished goal-directed behaviour, characterised by emotional blunting,
      loss of initiative and loss of interest. Apathy along with the nosological characteristics of
      dementia induces impairment in autonomy level and therefore dependence as cognitive
      impairments worsened.

      The importance of stimulation could be related to the concept of engagement defined as the
      act of being occupied or involved with an external stimulus. Engaging older person with or
      without Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in appropriate activities has been shown to
      yield beneficial HRQL effects such increasing positive emotion, improving cognition,
      functional autonomy and quality of life.

      Accordingly, enriched environments with high definition virtual representation of cities and
      activities of interest have the potentials not only to encourage patients to get active in a
      safe and interactive environment but also to create access to enjoyable and stimulating
      settings for the more severe patients.

      The VR setting from VERVE proposed personalised and populated environments available on two
      different, but interlinked hardware platforms: 1/: standard gaming set-up in the home,
      nursing home or day hospital therapy group; and 2/ mobile tracked internet devices
      (e.g.,IPad). The system will ensure maximum openness and dissemination by using 3D Web
      technologies.
