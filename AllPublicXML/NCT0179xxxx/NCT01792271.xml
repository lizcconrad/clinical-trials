  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effects of two weeks of daily dosing of
      inhaled salt water mist (hypertonic saline - HS) on actual measurements of mucociliary and
      cough clearance in patients with the chronic bronchitis type of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD.

      Defective mucociliary clearance (MCC) is central to the development and/or worsening of
      several kinds of lung diseases, including COPD/chronic bronchitis (CB), cystic fibrosis (CF),
      and bronchiectasis. In each case, defective MCC leads to the development of lung infections
      and damage to the airways from ongoing inflammation caused by a person's inability to clear
      mucus from the lungs.

      The investigators' previous studies have shown that the administration of inhaled HS
      (hypertonic saline) not only acutely accelerates MCC in CF, but also that repetitive use
      &quot;resets&quot; the baseline rate of MCC within 2 weeks. It is likely that the sustained effect of
      HS on MCC was responsible for the ~60% reduction in the frequency of pulmonary disease
      exacerbations, reduced antibiotic use and improved lung function in a long-term study of HS
      in CF volunteers. As a result, HS has now become a standard therapy for CF lung disease and
      its success raises optimism that similar benefits might occur in patients with CB.

      In this study the investigators will use mildly radioactive particles, technetium bound to
      sulfur colloid, to measure and compare the sustained effects on mucus clearance of two weeks
      of daily dosing of 7% hypertonic saline versus a low salt control treatment for subjects with
      CB. We will also be collecting sputum and breath condensation to analyze for protein and
      inflammatory changes that might occur with exacerbations.

      Our long term goals are to improve our understanding of MCC in health and disease and to
      develop better therapies that support and/or restore MCC in patients with these diseases to
      reduce lung infections.

The intervention consists of the subject receiving both concentrations of inhaled sodium chloride solution, each during a different home treatment periods. Subjects randomized to order AB will receive inhaled 7% NaCl (sodium chloride solution) mist during the first home treatment period, then 0.12% NaCL during the second home treatment period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Volunteers who meet all of the following criteria will be eligible for study participation:

          1. Age 40-80 years, inclusive

          2. Non-pregnant subjects must be either not sexually active, post-menopausal, surgically
             sterilized, or agree to use an appropriate &quot;double barrier&quot; method (such as diaphragm
             and condom), or must currently be using a prescribed transdermal, injection, implant,
             or oral contraceptive during study participation.

          3. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 35-80% of predicted, inclusive, and

        eligible for screening four weeks after completing their treatment providing their symptoms
        have resolved.
