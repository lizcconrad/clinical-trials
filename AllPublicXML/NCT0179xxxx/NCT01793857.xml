  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a survey aiming to describe the healthcare seeking behaviour of primary
      caregivers when their child aged 6 months to less than 30 months was suspected to have an
      episode of acute otitis media in Panama.

      The study is a cross sectional survey in which primary caregivers will be asked if they
      recall having observed an ear infection in the child in the age range 6 months to less than
      30 months in the last 6 months. During the interview, the primary caregivers will be asked
      what they did for the child during that episode and whether they sought medical care or not.
      They will be also asked about the demographic characteristics (such as age range) of the
      child who experienced that episode and the household environment of the child at the time of
      the episode (such as number of household members), etc.

      No questions will be asked about the episode itself if the primary caregiver does not recall
      that the child had one in the last six months.

      Approximately 1300 primary caregivers will be interviewed in multiple clinics / well-baby
      clinics in Panama.

      The clinics will be stratified into 'former clinical trial sites' and 'non-clinical trial
      sites' in urban areas of Panama, based on participation in the COMPAS trial. Both 'former
      clinical trial sites' and 'non-clinical trial sites' will include private and public
      facilities. Sites will be selected by convenience sampling and eligible subjects will be
      enrolled on an on-going basis, in proportion to the population coverage of each site. The
      participating sites have thus been stratified to be able to assess whether the healthcare
      seeking behaviour of primary caregivers enrolled at former clinical trial sites are different
      from those enrolled at non clinical trial sites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator/interviewer believes can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. availability of time for completion of the
             interview).

          -  Signed informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Subjects aged 18 years or above, being the primary caregiver of at least one child
             aged 6 months to less than 30 months, visiting a clinic.

        Note:

        i. Although the child will most likely be present at the time of interview, his/her
        presence is not required.

        ii. If more than one primary caregiver fulfilling the inclusion criteria is present per
        child, only one will be enrolled in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • Subjects having previously participated in this survey.
