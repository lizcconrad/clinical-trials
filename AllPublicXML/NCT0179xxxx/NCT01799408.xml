  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injection (IACI) of depot
      preparation of betamethasone on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in patients
      with osteoarthritis of the knee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients attending the rheumatology or orthopedic clinic with osteoarthritic knee
      pain, not responding satisfactorily to medical or physical therapy were allocated to group-1
      after consent and given IACI of 6 mg of betamethasone acetate/betamethasone sodium phosphate.
      Following completion of this part, consecutive age- and sex-matched patients were allocated
      to group-2 and given intra-articular injection of 60 mg of sodium hyaluronate. Just prior to
      the knee injection and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 weeks later, patients had 1 Âµg adrenocorticotropin
      hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) was defined as levels
      of less than 18 ng/ml or a rise of &lt; than 7 ng/ml of serum cortisol, 30 minutes following the
      ACTH stimulation test.
