    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tarceva (erlotinib) in
      first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive
      non-small cell lung cancer. Eligible patients, for whom the treating physician has decided to
      initiate treatment with Tarceva according to the local label will be followed for 18 months.
