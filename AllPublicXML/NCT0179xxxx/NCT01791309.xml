  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new drug combination consisting of two drugs,
      vemurafenib (also known as ZelborafTM) and panitumumab (also known as VectibixTM). This
      treatment is being tested in a subgroup of patients with colorectal cancer whose tumors have
      changes in the BRAF gene that may make them more likely to respond to this new drug
      combination.

    <description>This will be a pilot study of the combination panitumumab and vemurafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation. Patients participating in this study must have BRAF V600E mutated metastatic colorectal cancer and not previously received treatment with an anti-EGFR targeting antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab).</description>

    <intervention_name>combination panitumumab and vemurafenib</intervention_name>
    <description>Treatment will consist of panitumumab 6mg/kg IV every 14 days and vemurafenib 960mg orally twice daily. In patients who initially respond to treatment and later progress, a voluntary biopsy will be requested at the time of relapse to study mechanisms of acquired resistance. This biopsy should consist of at least one frozen core specimen. Every effort will be made to obtain this biopsy within 30 days of discontinuation of treatment and before the initiation of any new tumor-directed therapies.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have metastatic colorectal cancer with a V600E BRAF mutation that has
             been histologically or cytologically-confirmed at MSKCC and has failed to respond to
             appropriate standard therapy regimens. There is no limit on the number of prior
             treatment regimens permitted.

          -  Patient must not have previously received treatment with an anti-EGFR targeting
             antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab).

          -  Patient must have accessible disease appropriate for tumor biopsy.

          -  Patient is male or female and ≥18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent.

          -  Patient must have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          -  Patient must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory
             values:

        Hematological:

        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/μL Platelets ≥100,000/μL Hemoglobin ≥8g/dL

        Renal:

        Serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance*

        ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR

        ≥60mL/min for patients with creatinine levels &lt;1.5 x institutional ULN

        Hepatic:

        Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for patients with total
        bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤3 x ULN or ≤5 x ULN in patients
        with known liver metastasis

        *Creatinine clearance should be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault method

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential who is not surgically sterilized must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test β-hCG within 72 hours prior to receiving the
             first dose of study medication.

          -  Patient, or the patient's legal representative, has voluntarily agreed to participate
             by giving written informed consent.

          -  Patient is able to swallow capsules and has no surgical or anatomical condition that
             will preclude the patient from swallowing and absorbing oral medications on an ongoing
             basis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any patient meeting any of the following criteria is not eligible to participate in this
        study:

          -  Patient who has had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy within 3 weeks
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), or who has not recovered from the adverse
             events due to previous agents administered more than 4 weeks prior to study day 1. If
             the patient has residual toxicity from prior treatment, other than oxaliplatin-related
             neurotoxicity or bevacizumab-related albuminuria, toxicity must be ≤ grade 1.

          -  Patient must be at least 4 weeks post major surgical procedure, and all surgical
             wounds must be adequately healed (in the judgment of the treating investigator).

          -  Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study with an
             investigational compound or device within 30 days of study day 1.

        Patient has evidence of active CNS disease (radiographically unstable, symptomatic
        lesions). Newly diagnosed, untreated brain metastases are ineligible. However, prior
        treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), whole brain radiotherapy, or surgical
        resection is allowed if the patient remains without evidence of disease progression in the
        brain ≥ 6 weeks and has been off corticosteroids for ≥ 3 weeks.

          -  Patient has known hypersensitivity to the components of study drug or its analogs.

          -  Patient is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including
             &quot;recreational use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last
             year) of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Patient is breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study.

          -  Patient is known to be Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive.

          -  Patient who has a known history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  Patient with mean QTc ≥450msec on screening EKG.

          -  Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or lab
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or it is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would, in the opinion
             of the treating investigator, interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the
             trial.
