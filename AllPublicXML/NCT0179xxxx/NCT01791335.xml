  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can provide ventilatory support in selected patients with acute
      respiratory failure, for instance due to acute exacerbation of COPD and acute heart failure.
      Advantages of noninvasive ventilation compared to invasive mechanical ventilation include
      absence of complications associated with endotracheal intubation, lower risk of pneumonia,
      lower level or even absence of sedation and the ability of the patient to verbally
      communicate. However, in approximately 30% of patients NIV fails and endotracheal intubation
      is needed to provide optimal ventilatory support. Surprisingly, very few studies have
      investigated why patients fail on NIV. Clinical observations indicated that agitation,
      delirium and most importantly asynchrony between patient and ventilator play a role in
      unsuccessful support with NIV. The upper airways are bypassed during endotracheal intubation.
      However, with NIV the upper airways may play a role in the efficiency of ventilatory support.
      In normal breathing the upper airways actively dilate before initiation of inspiratory flow.
      This is a highly appropriate response as it prevents narrowing of the upper airways during
      inspiration, which would result in elevated inspiratory resistance. Experiments in newborn
      lambs have shown that NIV has profound effects on physiology of the upper airways. Positive
      pressure during inspiration results in constriction of upper airway muscles in the early
      phase of inspiration. This results in elevated upper airway resistance with lower tidal
      volume delivered to the lungs. Subsequent studies revealed that reflexes that mediate this
      response originate in vagal afferences located in the lower airways. From an evolutionary
      point of view this might be an appropriate response, as high pressure delivered to the lungs
      may induce barotraumas. However, these responses may negatively affect the efficiency of
      ventilatory support delivered during NIV. The understanding of upper airway constriction and
      dilation during NIV is rudimentary. This study aims at determining the effect of NIV on
      regulation of upper airway patency in patients with COPD.

        The patient population for this study will be included from the intensive care. All
        patients at the intensive care unit who are in clinical need of noninvasive mechanical
        ventilation due to hypercapnic COPD and with a NAVA catheter in situ, will be screened and
        asked for informed consent to participate.
