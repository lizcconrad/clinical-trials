  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A potential application for unstructured monoacylglycerol (MAG) containing long chain
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA)can be to provide essential fatty acids to humans who
      chronically consume lipases inhibitor such as Orlistat® for weigh lowering reasons. Indeed,
      it is predictable that chronic consumption of Orlistat® led to a depletion of essential fatty
      acids with time, therefore unstructured MAG containing LC-PUFA can be an option as a source
      of LC-PUFA for patients under Orlistat® treatment and hypothetically for subjects with other
      type of maldigestion/malabsorption. Potential applications of such concept are therefore
      related to disease conditions comprising low lipid digestion due to lipase activity
      insufficiency.

      In the present study, in order to see the response information for eicosapentanoic acid (EPA)
      delivery, EPA will be provided either as a mixture of free monoacylglycerols or as
      triacylglycerol (TAG). The erythrocyte and plasma fatty acid composition from subjects under
      Orlistat® consumption will be analyzed.
