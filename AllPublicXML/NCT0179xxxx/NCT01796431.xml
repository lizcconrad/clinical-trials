  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of three HIV medications: tenofovir,
      emtricitabine, and rilpivirine in blood after the drug intake has been stopped in order to
      understand how long these drugs persist in the blood. The study will specifically look at
      blood levels of these three drugs (taken as a 3-in-1 tablet) after taking them every day for
      14 days.

      The duration of the subjects involvement in the study will be up to 23 days plus a screening
      visit which will take place up to 4 weeks prior to the start of the study, and a follow up
      visit which takes place 16-22 days after the last dose of study medication.

      This study is not randomised which means that all participants will receive all study
      medications in the same order. The participant and the study doctor will know which study
      medications you are taking at all times during the study.
