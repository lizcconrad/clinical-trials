      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of an educational program of
      Narrative Medicine &quot;workshop reflexive writing &quot;dedicated to medical students on the
      satisfaction of standardized patients.

      Design: Randomized Controlled Trial in 2 arms. Participants: Medical students (4th years) of
      the University Paris Descartes. Methods: Participants will be randomized in two groups. The
      allocation of participants will be done by a computerized randomization list, the sequence
      will be created by an independent statistician. Participants will be blinded of the study
      hypothesis. Allocation concealment will be provided because only the statistician will have
      access to the randomization list.

      A program of Narrative Medicine in Class-led instruction &quot;workshop reflexive writing &quot;vs
      &quot;workshop reading medical publication&quot;.

      Outcome: The primary endpoint will be the satisfaction of standardized patient relative to
      the empathy of the medical students. The secondary endpoints will be the empathy of the
      medical students; recommendation of the student by the standardized patients to friends or
      relatives; students' satisfaction.

      Potential interests: The investigators believe that the workshop &quot;reflexive writing&quot; can
      develop the thinking of the student with respect to his behavior with the patient, and so the
      relation between student and patient.
