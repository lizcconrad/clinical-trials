      Background: Acute pancreatitis is characterized by a high mortality rate (10%-15%), and a
      remarkably unpredictable clinical course. Approximately 50% of deaths in acute pancreatitis
      occur early—within the first 14 days—and early mortality is attributable to sequelae of a
      severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is associated with multi-organ
      dysfunction syndrome (MODS) that can escalate to renal failure, respiratory failure, and
      death. Significant improvements in acute pancreatitis mortality will demand innovative
      approaches to counteract early organ failure. A series of destructive cellular processes
      begins within minutes of initial pancreatic injury, and the ensuing inflammatory cascade is
      compounded by disease sequelae including edema, ischemia, and tissue necrosis. Early
      interventions to reduce inflammation within the first 36 hours have been shown to have
      significant effects in minimizing progressive organ dysfunction.

      Hypothermia is clinically employed to combat cellular injury and systemic responses following
      ischemia-reperfusion, and is been studied as a mechanism of acute inflammatory inhibition in
      processes including cardiogenic shock, lung injury, local intestinal injury, and reperfusion
      injuries to the lung, liver, and endothelium. In numerous studies, effective
      immunomodulations have been observed including reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines
      (TNF-α, IL-6), stimulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), inhibition of
      pro-apoptotic JNK signaling, reduction of systemic oxidative stress, and inhibition of
      neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Most saliently, in the caerulein
      model of murine acute pancreatitis, therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to reduce serum
      IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, increased serum IL-10, decrease serum amylase and lipase, lower the
      histological grade of pancreatic injury as compared to normothermic mice, and significant
      survival benefit. Although therapeutic hypothermia is actively employed in the treatment of
      traumatic brain injury, neonatal asphyxia, spinal cord injury, and cardiac arrest, no studies
      have yet been made of its application to acute pancreatitis.

      Hypothesis: Patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (32-34°C) will sustain reduced
      organ-specific injury in acute pancreatitis.

      Proposal: In a Phase IIa pilot clinical trial, we will examine the effects of therapeutic
      hypothermia on organ-specific outcomes during the early stage of acute pancreatitis. We will
      recruit five patients aged 18 to 80 receiving medically-necessitated ventilator support under
      ICU monitoring with core temperatures ≥36°C and severe acute pancreatitis defined as either a
      Ranson Score ≥7, a CT indicating ≥50% pancreatic necrosis, or a significant deterioration in
      clinical status including dysfunction of two or more organ systems (defined by ACCP/SCCM
      Organ Failure Guidelines, Chest 2009). All patients will receive current standard management
      for severe acute pancreatitis and a standardized protocol for application of therapeutic
      hypothermia and rewarming. Our primary endpoints are organ-specific cardiovascular,
      respiratory, hematological, renal, and metabolic dysfunction as measured at 28 days. Logistic
      Organ Dysfunction Scores (LOD) will be compared before and after therapeutic hypothermia,
      establishing day 4 versus day 1 changes in LOD. Secondary endpoints include D-dimer, IL-6,
      C-reactive protein, APACHE II scores on day 1 and day 4, inpatient and ICU length-of-stay,
      infection, mortality, and hypothermia-associated side effects including cardiac arrhythmia,
      electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia, major bleeding, and acute pancreatitis. We believe that
      such a study will supply preliminary answers to our chief research questions: does
      therapeutic hypothermia reduce morbidity as assessed by organ-specific outcomes, does
      therapeutic hypothermia attenuate the steep rise in inflammation observed in severe acute
      pancreatitis, and does therapeutic hypothermia shorten the clinical course for these
      patients.
