  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to find out if mobile phone text message reminders of
      appointments can help to address missed appointments in Psychosis Community Services. Another
      aim is to examine if fewer missed appointments result in clinical benefits for service users
      and in lower costs for Psychosis Community Services over a period of 6 months. 600 users from
      2 London Psychosis Community Services will take part in this research. Each participant will
      be put into one of two groups, as s/he joins the study: In the first (experimental) group,
      each participant will receive appointment reminders for 6 months (7 and 1 day/s before each
      appointment), starting with the first available opportunity upon joining the study. In the
      second (control) group, each participant will not receive appointment reminders for 6 months.
      The choice of group for each individual will be made at random by a computer. Clinical
      information will be collected for 6 months from the time each participant joins the study,
      using, with his or her consent, their anonymised electronic medical records. The following
      clinical information will be compared between the experimental and control groups: Attendance
      of appointments, number of inpatient admissions, number of days in inpatient care, number of
      inpatient admissions under the mental health treatment act, number of referrals to a home
      treatment team, number of times patient has changed medication, health and social
      functioning. Service use, service costs and the cost-effectiveness of the reminder system
      will also be examined. Towards the end of their participation, service users, as well as
      mental health professionals, will be invited to express their views, concerns and suggestions
      in relation to the reminder service by completing a brief anonymised (service users) or
      anonymous (staff) questionnaire

    <description>Data on the use of services over the follow-up period will be combined with appropriate unit cost information (Curtis, 2011; Department of health, 2012). Service costs will be compared between the experimental (SMS intervention) and control (No SMS intervention)groups. Cost data often follow a skewed distribution and so bootstrap methods will be employed</description>

    <time_frame>1 year after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The cost of the actual intervention will be negligible given the extent of general SMS use. However, there could be an impact on service costs and this will be estimated. Data on the use of services over the follow-up period (see below for details) will be combined with appropriate unit cost information (Curtis, 2011; Department of health, 2012). Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by combining the cost data with HoNOS scores using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness estimates will be explored using cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</description>

    <description>At the end of their participation, service users will be invited to complete an optional brief questionnaire (designed for the purposes of the study by the research team), to express their views, concerns and suggestions in relation to the SMS service. This information will be collected in an anonymised format. The questionnaires will be posted to the study participants, or alternatively, administered to them over the telephone or in person (whichever they prefer) by a research worker.</description>
