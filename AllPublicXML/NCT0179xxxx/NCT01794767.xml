  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to verify if the periodic flush with normal saline 0.9% NaCl causes a
      longer or equal duration of patency of peripheral venous catheters, compared with heparin
      solution 50 U / ml flush, in children from 2 years to 14 years. Only 22 and 24 gauge
      catheters Will be included in the study.The study will assess in particular:

        -  the difference of permanence in situ of the device

        -  the difference in incidence of complications (in detail: obstruction, phlebitis,
           thrombocytopenia, systemic anticoagulation)

        -  the difference in costs between use of saline normal saline 0.9% NaCl solution and
           heparinized 50 U / ml.
