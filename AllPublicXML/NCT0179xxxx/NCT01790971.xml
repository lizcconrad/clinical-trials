  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) appear to be especially vulnerable to medications
      that suppress pharyngeal muscle activity such as general anesthetics and opioids. Opioids can
      depress the ventilator response to airway obstruction and inhibit the awakening response to
      hypoxia and hypercarbia, resulting in central respiratory depression. OSA is therefore an
      important risk factor for serious postoperative complications, including perioperative death.
      While OSA is increasingly recognized as a serious perioperative concern, current clinical
      practices are highly inconsistent with regard to the management of surgical patients with
      OSA. Additionally, the relative safety of intrathecal opioids in this patient population
      remains unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) are among the most common orthopedic procedures
      performed worldwide1. They have been shown to reduce chronic pain, increase the ability to
      function independently, and improve quality of life2,3. With an aging and increasingly obese
      North American population, the uses of THA and TKA are increasing 4. One of the main
      challenges associated with THA as well as TKA continues to be the perioperative management of
      patients who are elderly or obese, and their associated co-morbidities. Both THA and TKA are
      commonly performed under neuraxial anesthesia. Neuraxial anesthesia has been reported to
      provide multiple benefits when compared to general anesthesia and/or systemic analgesia
      including superior post-operative analgesia5, reduced opioid consumption6, improved
      rehabilitation7, and reduced morbidity and mortality8-12. The addition of opioids to the
      neuraxial local anesthetic solution has been common practice since 1979, when morphine was
      first shown to provide effective and prolonged analgesia after intrathecal administration13.
      For both THA and TKA surgeries, intrathecal morphine provides effective analgesia14-16
      allowing for a reduction of the dose of intrathecal local anesthetic (thus minimizing side
      effects)17, and has a marked postoperative opioid-sparing effect14-16. However, these
      benefits of intrathecal morphine must be weighed against its risks of pruritis,
      nausea/vomiting, urinary retention, and, of most concern, respiratory depression18.
