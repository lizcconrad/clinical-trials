    <textblock>
      This study has the following objective:

      To identify related factors to hospital mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation acute
      myocardial infarction submitted to pharmacoinvasive strategy within a structured healthcare
      network.

    <textblock>
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the main therapy for patients with ST-segment
      elevation acute myocardial infarction. However, a significant portion of these patients won't
      receive optimal treatment due to the small number of tertiary centers with interventional
      laboratories available for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

      Specially in large urban centers and rural areas, where tertiary care hospitals are
      restricted to a specific region, alternative approaches must be developed. The
      pharmacoinvasive strategy has emerged as an alternative for patients admitted to primary care
      centers. It is based in up-front intravenous thrombolytic therapy and transfer to a tertiary
      center where early, systematic, coronary intervention will be performed between 3 to 24 hours
      after the administration of thrombolytic drugs, even in cases in which successful reperfusion
      was obtained.
