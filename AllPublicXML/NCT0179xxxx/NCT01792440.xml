  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients (and controls) were recruited for the study. The
      investigators' aim was to study the relevance of clinical parameters in terms of underlying
      disease severity, proteolysis and inflammation in a diverse non-cystic fibrosis
      bronchiectasis population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients from the non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) outpatient clinic were recruited
      in our study from September 2009 till July 2010. Control healthy subjects were recruited
      among peers of the patient or hospital staff during the same period. For the NCFB patients,
      underlying etiologies of NCFB and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization status were
      analyzed and each patient was evaluated by means of spirometry (FVC and FEV1), Leicester
      Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and Sputum Colour Chart (SCC). SCC assessment was both done by
      letting the patient predict his sputum purulence prior to sputum induction and by SCC scoring
      after sputum harvest by the physician.
