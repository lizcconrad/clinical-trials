    <textblock>
      This is a national, multicentre, non-interventional, retrospective study to be carried out in
      the oncology settings of approximately 15-20 Spanish hospitals.

      At each participant hospital, all patients recently diagnosed with advanced EGFR mutated
      NSCLC (both newly or with recurrent disease , without previous treatment for metastatic
      disease) from April 2010 to December 2011 will be included as study population. Information
      about the follow-up of the patients during a minimum of 12 months after diagnosis will be
      collected.
