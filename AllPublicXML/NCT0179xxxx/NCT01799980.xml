    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different methods of staging lung cancer to determine whether
      endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) staging of mediastinal lymph nodes will provide good
      diagnostic yield in detecting lung cancer, when compared to current methods of a staging
      bronchoscopy and cervical mediastinoscopy.
