      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of probiotics in enteral nutrition on
      improving gut function, inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients
      admitted to the intensive care unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gut failure in critically ill patients is common. Enteral feeding is one of the preferred
      routes for nutrition support to maintain gut function. However, enteral nutrition is not
      without complications such as alterations in gut transit time and gut eco-culture. Enteral
      nutrition supplemented with a probiotic offers a possible solution to modulating this
      ecosystem. Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      probiotics in enteral feeding on improving the gut function, inflammatory markers and
      clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. Subjects and Methods: Forty-nine patients that
      were admitted to the intensive care unit in University Malaya Medical Center requiring
      enteral feeding were randomized to receive either probiotics or a placebo. Patients remained
      in the intensive care unit for more than 7 days and were examined prior to the start of
      enteral feeding and on day 8. Return of gut function was assessed by the time needed to
      achieve caloric requirement. Inflammatory markers including the White Cell Count and
      C-reactive protein levels were tested on day 1 and day 8. Clinical outcome was assessed by
      number of days of ventilation and total days in intensive care unit.
