  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious clinical problem because of its
      worldwide distribution and potential adverse outcome, including cirrhosis, which is a major
      cause of HBV related death. Studies show the use of nucleot(s)ide analogs treatment can
      alleviate, even reverse the progress of HBV-related cirrhosis. In cirrhosis stage, some
      potential factors, including endocrine disorder, renin, aldosterone, vasopressin increasing,
      hepatitis B virus related nephritis, hepatorenal syndrome, may cause renal damage. With the
      exposure of NAs, adverse reports of rhabdomyolysis, renal dysfunction, and lactic acidosis
      are increasing. So when choosing NAs, the potential renal function impairment should be
      considered.

      Recently, Gane, Xiaoxi Li have separately reported that Telbivudine can improve estimate of
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of patients with chronic hepatitis B, while eGFR of
      patients with Lamivudine, adefovir and entecavir have a trend of decrease, which suggested
      Telbivudine may have renal protective effects. This effect on patients with HBV-related liver
      cirrhosis has not been studied, which is not clear now.

      This study is a randomized controlled study to prospectively observe Telbivudine's effect on
      renal function, which aims to provide evidence in antiviral treatment for the patients with
      cirrhosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:Subjects eligible for enrolment in the study must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          -  eGFR in baseline less than 90 ml.min-1.1.73m2

          -  Aged between 18-75 years (inclusive).

          -  Male or female.

          -  Subjects with positive HBsAg for more than 6 months and anti-HBs negative regardless

             related procedure and comply with the requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study

             the past 5 years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases,
             with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with
             previous findings suggestive of possible hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), should have
             the disease ruled out prior to entrance into the study.

          -  Patient has one or more additional known primary or secondary causes of liver disease
             other than CHB, including steatohepatitis，autoimmune hepatitis and so on. Gilbert's

             efficacy or safety observations of the study.

          -  Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5
             half-lives of enrollment, whichever is longer.
