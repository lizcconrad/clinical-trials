  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common condition that affects millions of women every year. There
      are many options for treatment and it can be difficult to make a decision as how best to
      proceed. Previous studies have shown that decisional aids (DAs) may improve knowledge,
      physician-patient communication, decisional conflict, and patient satisfaction. However, no
      study has evaluated the role of a decisional aid among women presenting for evaluation and
      management of prolapse. We would like to determine if a decision aid for prolapse decreases
      the amount of decisional conflict women face when choosing a plan of care.

      We hypothesize that there will be a difference in the level/amount of decisional conflict
      between women who receive a DA and those who do not. Specifically, we anticipate that women
      randomized to receiving standard counseling and a DA with have less decisional conflict than
      the cohort receiving standard counseling alone.

      Women scheduled for the evaluation and management of pelvic organ prolapse at Hartford
      Hospital will be contacted via telephone prior to the initial consultation visit to ascertain
      interest for this study. If they are interested, they will be randomized to one of two
      groups: those that receive a DA and those that do not.

      This study requires you to answer some questions about the information packet you received in
      the mail. We routinely send a packet to all of our new patients. Half of the participants
      received a decision aid to supplement their information packet and the other half received
      our routine informational packet. You will be asked to complete a set of 2 questionnaires. It
      will take less than 10 minutes to complete these questions.

      All data will be extracted and used by only the investigators on this study. The data will be
      stored on a restricted-access network drive and results will be reported in aggregate and no
      personal health history will be disclosed. Our primary outcome for this analysis is
      decisional conflict differences in those who receive a DA and those who do not.

    <description>The primary outcome for this analysis is decisional conflict differences in those who receive a DA and those who do not. The investigators will administer the 16-item traditional Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The DCS comprises 3 subscales: decision uncertainty, factors contributing to uncertainty, and perceived effective decision making. The investigators will use the statement format of this scale in which patients respond to a series of Likert-scale statements using response categories of strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree, which are scored as 0-4, respectively, and added. Based on previous research, scores will be tabulated and patients will be grouped as either having &quot;high level of decisional conflict&quot; versus &quot;low level of decisional conflict.&quot;
Values will be assessed for normality and compared between groups (i.e. those receiving the DA versus those who did not).</description>
