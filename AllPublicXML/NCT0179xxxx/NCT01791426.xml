  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to show that the performance of Artelac Rebalance eye
      drops is non-inferior to that of Vismed eye drops in subjects with moderate to severe dry
      eye, and to assess the safety of Artelac Rebalance after a 90-day (± 10 day) treatment
      administered 3 to 5 times per day.

             inclusion, and who will use preservative-free ART (Artelac® UNO CL hypromellose 0.32%
             w/v eye drops, single dose unit) up to 6 times a day for at least 2 weeks immediately
             prior to randomization

             infection within 90 days prior to study start

             1 year prior to study start

          -  Subjects who have received ocular therapy (either eye) with any ophthalmic medication,
             except tear substitutes, within 2 weeks prior to study start

          -  Subjects expected to receive ocular therapy during the study

          -  Subjects treated with topical ocular steroidal or non-steroidal anti- inflammatory
             medication within 30 days prior to study start

          -  Subjects expected to receive ocular therapy with immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine)
             during the study or who have used ocular immunosuppressants within 90 days prior to
