  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective Study is to evaluate the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of patients
      receiving the CryoVein cryopreserved saphenous vein allograft (CVA) as their primary open
      bypass conduit to assess if there is a quantifiable correlation to time of placement as a
      primary bypass graft and improved long-term clinical outcomes of patients with critical limb
      ischemia (CLI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of 50 CVA will be implanted in enrolled patients at up to 6 participating sites.
      The Study will include prospective evaluations on these patients at discharge, 1, 3, 6, 9,
      12, 18 and 24 months following surgery. The window for follow-up visits is ± 2 weeks for each
      time point. All Study patients will be expected to participate in all follow-up evaluations
      unless precluded by patient death.

      Patient status and graft performance data will be collected on all patients consented and
      enrolled into the Study. The primary endpoint of the Study will be limb salvage. The
      secondary endpoints of the Study will include primary patency, secondary patency, morbidity
      and mortality per the same reporting standards.

      Patient attributes (age, gender, etc.) and preoperative assessments (indication for surgery,
      medical history) will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Graft performance will be
      presented as freedom from an event endpoint (patient death, graft complication, amputation,
      graft explant) as calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Log Rank and Cox Regression will be
      utilized for comparison between subgroups of the patient population. Statistical software
      will be used to compile and analyze all submitted clinical data.

      The method of data reporting may include, but is not limited to, a description of the sample
      population, frequency distributions of patient demographics, allograft statistics, and
      follow-up percentages, summary of event data, correlation analysis, and actuarial analysis

      During the Study follow-up period, a patient may present with an event requiring an open
      surgical revision, surgical explant or limb amputation on the (allograft) recipient limb. At
      the time of related planned intervention a tissue sample of the affected area of the
      allograft may be obtained and, if so, will placed into 10% buffered formalin solution and
      returned to CryoLife for histologic analysis.
