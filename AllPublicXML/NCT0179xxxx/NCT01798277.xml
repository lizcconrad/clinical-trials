    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare antiarrhythmic drug therapy with catheter ablation using the
      SmartTOUCH catheter (Biosense Webster Inc.) as treatment for patients with ventricular
      tachycardia and coronary artery disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized prospective cohort study to compare the impact of catheter
      ablation with antiarrhythmic drug therapy for treating patients with sustained ventricular
      tachycardia (VT) and coronary artery disease. Patients that meet all inclusion criteria and
      no exclusion criteria will be recruited to the study cohort. After baseline measurements are
      taken, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either undergo radiofrequency catheter
      ablation or receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy (amiodarone or sotalol). The in-clinic
      appointments include: enrollment, baseline, intervention, and follow-up every three months
      for one year post-ablation. At each follow-up visit, electrogram (ECG) and Holter monitoring
      tests will be performed to measure any episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Furthermore,
      interrogation of the patient's implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) will be performed
      at all follow-up visits to detect any episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmia that required
      antitachycardia pacing (ATP) or shocks.
