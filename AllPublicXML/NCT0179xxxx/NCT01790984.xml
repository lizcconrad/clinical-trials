  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that a diet high in sugars will increase abnormalities in
      blood lipids which are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, relative to a
      diet which is low in sugar. We predict that this potentially adverse effect of dietary sugars
      on blood lipids will be more pronounced in people with a raised level of stored fat inside
      their liver, as compared to people with a low level of stored fat.

      This study aims to determine the metabolic mechanism(s) by which dietary extrinsic sugars
      (sucrose and fructose), promote the formation of a high risk dyslipidaemia, known as an
      atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (raised plasma triglyceride, low HDL and predominance of
      small, dense LDL), in men with raised cardio-metabolic risk and percentage of liver fat, as
      determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The study examined the impact of diets
      high and low in extrinsic sugars, on the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins in vivo, of
      two groups of men with a high (&gt;10%)and low (&lt;2%)percentage of liver fat, by the
      trace-labelling of these lipid moieties with stable isotopes, and detection by gas
      chromatography mass spectrometry. The study had a two-way cross-over design, with two, 12
      week dietary interventions separated by a six week wash-out period. The dietary intervention
      with high and low sugars was achieved by a dietary exchange with supermarket foods, which
      were consumed within the homes of the participants.

    <measure>Plasma concentration of triglyceride (mmol/l) in the post-absorptive state (after 12 hour fast)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post 12 week dietary intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Total plasma triglyceride (TG) is a measure of the TG transported in the plasma by all the principal plasma lipoproteins, very low density (chiefly), intermediate density, low density and high density lipoproteins.</description>

    <measure>Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) kinetics: Fractional catabolic and production rates of large and small VLDL glycerol (2H-5 deuterated glycerol) and apoprotein B (1-C-13 leucine).</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-(12 week) dietary interventions</time_frame>
    <description>VLDL was labelled in vivo by the constant infusion of two stable isotopes (deuterated H5-glycerol and carbon 13 leucine). The labels are then isolated in large/light and small/dense fractions of VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and large/light and small/dense low desnity lipoprotein (LDL) by sequential ultra-centrifugation, and detected by GC-MS as measures of lipoprotein (glycerol and apoprotein) kinetics in vivo. Lipoprotein kinetics are being described by mathematic models which are currently being developed at the University of Cambridge.</description>

    <description>Palmitate was labelled in vivo by the infusion of U-13 Carbon. This provides a measure of the rate of intra-cellular lipolysis and contribution of systemic palmitate to the synthesis of TG in the liver.</description>

    <description>A high sugar, low starch diet was provided by the exchange of two thirds of the participants daily intake of carbohydrate. This was achieved by exchanging foods with low sugar to starch content, with foods containing a high sugar to starch content to reach a target ratio of starch to sugar of 1:1.2</description>
