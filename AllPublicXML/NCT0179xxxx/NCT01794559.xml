  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study to evaluate
      the effectiveness of PEER Interactive to inform treatment in subjects with a primary
      diagnosis of depression with comorbidity of non-psychotic behavioral disorders versus
      treatment as usual, as determined by the investigator. The primary measurement for
      improvement of the subjects depression will be a self-evaluation questionnaire, Quick
      Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16 , but the investigators will also
      collect information on their clinical global improvement and any reduction in adverse events.

      This study is prospective in nature. Subjects in the control group will be treated according
      to treatment as usual and best judgment of the treating physician. For the experimental group
      the treating physician will follow the guidance of the subject's PEER Interactive Report as
      regards sensitivity to on-label medications and classes of medication.

      The subjects will be washed out of all current medications prior to having an EEG, which is
      necessary to generate the PEER Interactive Report. The wash out period for outpatients is no
      longer than 14 days.

      The subjects will be followed for 6 months after the initial treatment, or until the patient
      has achieved maximum medical improvement (MMI). The patient will be seen on a routine basis
      and assessments will be made at each interaction to evaluate the patient's improvement in
      mental health. The subjects will also be closely evaluated to determine if they are
      experiencing any psychiatric specific adverse events. The investigator is allowed to treat
      the patient according to their best medical judgment, which may include adding or changing
      medications, seeing the patient more frequently, or other interventions such as the use of
      sleep aids.
