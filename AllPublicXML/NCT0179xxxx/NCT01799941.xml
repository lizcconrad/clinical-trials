    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      NUEDEXTA capsules containing 20 mg DM (Dextromethorphan)/10 mg Q (Quinidine) for treatment of
      Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) in patients with prevalent conditions such as dementia, stroke, and
      traumatic brain injury (TBI)over a 12 week period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an Open-label, Multicenter, study in patients with PBA and dementia, stroke or
      TBI. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PBA and who meet all other inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be eligible to participate and receive NUEDEXTA for 12 weeks.

      Males and females patients with a minimum age of 18 years, a clinical diagnosis of
      Pseudobulbar Affect and a documented diagnosis of neurologic disease or brain injury, will be
      enrolled in this study.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint is the mean change in the Center for Neurologic
      Study-Lability scale (CNS-LS). Secondary objectives include measures to evaluate treatment
      outcomes.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) Score at Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 (Final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The CNS-LS was a seven-item, self-administered questionnaire, completed by the participant or participant's caregiver that provided a quantitative measure of the perceived frequency and severity of Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) episodes. It consisted of two subscales measuring labile laughter (four items) and labile crying (three items). Each item was rated on a scale from 1 (applies never) to 5 (applies most of the time). The total score was calculated as the sum of the item values that resulted in a score ranging from 7 (no symptoms) to 35 (maximum symptom severity and frequency). A single continuous variable was created for the reported time point. The change in CNS-LS was calculated as the score from the Day 90 assessment minus the Baseline CNS-LS measure. A negative change represented a decrease in CNS-LS score over time following the baseline assessment indicating a perceived decrease in frequency and severity of PBA episodes.</description>

    <measure>Mean Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) Episode Count Per Week by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 30 (Visit 1), and Day 90 (Final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>PBA episode count was an investigator assessed measure in which the participant/participant's daytime caregiver was asked to identify, count and recall the total episodes of exaggerated/uncontrollable laughing or crying over the previous 7 days (prior to visit) at Baseline (Day 1), Day 30 (Visit 1), and Day 90 (Final visit). The response categories for this question were: 0, 1- 2, 3-5, 6-10, &gt;10. The original responses from participants were converted to estimate the continuous number of PBA episodes by taking the mid-point of the original response ranges and multiplying that value by 7. Data is presented as mean PBA count per week.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Quality of Life Visual Analog Scale (QOL-VAS) Score at Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 (Final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The QOL-VAS, a participant reported scale of quality of life (QOL) was used to measure the impact of PBA episodes on the participant's QOL over the previous 7 days (prior to visit) at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 90 (Final visit). The assessment was completed by a participant placing a mark on a horizontal line that extends from 0 &quot;not (affected) at all&quot; to 10 &quot;significantly (affected)&quot;. The participant's mark was measured and recorded at each time point. The change in QOL-VAS score from baseline to day 90 visit, defined as the day 90 score minus the baseline score, was analyzed. Data is reported as mean QOL-VAS score; a positive change in score represented an increase in participant's quality of life.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) Score at Day 90</title>
        <description>The CNS-LS was a seven-item, self-administered questionnaire, completed by the participant or participant’s caregiver that provided a quantitative measure of the perceived frequency and severity of Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) episodes. It consisted of two subscales measuring labile laughter (four items) and labile crying (three items). Each item was rated on a scale from 1 (applies never) to 5 (applies most of the time). The total score was calculated as the sum of the item values that resulted in a score ranging from 7 (no symptoms) to 35 (maximum symptom severity and frequency). A single continuous variable was created for the reported time point. The change in CNS-LS was calculated as the score from the Day 90 assessment minus the Baseline CNS-LS measure. A negative change represented a decrease in CNS-LS score over time following the baseline assessment indicating a perceived decrease in frequency and severity of PBA episodes.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed using the Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) Population, defined as all participants who met all inclusion criteria, with a score of at least 13 on the CNS-LS, who received at least 1 dose of study drug, and who had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy measurement with CNS-LS.</population>

        <title>Mean Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) Episode Count Per Week by Visit</title>
        <description>PBA episode count was an investigator assessed measure in which the participant/participant’s daytime caregiver was asked to identify, count and recall the total episodes of exaggerated/uncontrollable laughing or crying over the previous 7 days (prior to visit) at Baseline (Day 1), Day 30 (Visit 1), and Day 90 (Final visit). The response categories for this question were: 0, 1- 2, 3-5, 6-10, &gt;10. The original responses from participants were converted to estimate the continuous number of PBA episodes by taking the mid-point of the original response ranges and multiplying that value by 7. Data is presented as mean PBA count per week.</description>

          <title>Mean Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) Episode Count Per Week by Visit</title>
          <description>PBA episode count was an investigator assessed measure in which the participant/participant’s daytime caregiver was asked to identify, count and recall the total episodes of exaggerated/uncontrollable laughing or crying over the previous 7 days (prior to visit) at Baseline (Day 1), Day 30 (Visit 1), and Day 90 (Final visit). The response categories for this question were: 0, 1- 2, 3-5, 6-10, &gt;10. The original responses from participants were converted to estimate the continuous number of PBA episodes by taking the mid-point of the original response ranges and multiplying that value by 7. Data is presented as mean PBA count per week.</description>
          <population>The analysis population consisted of all participants who met all inclusion criteria, including a score of at least 13 on the CNS-LS, who received at least 1 dose of study drug, and who had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy measurement with PBA episode.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Quality of Life Visual Analog Scale (QOL-VAS) Score at Day 90</title>
        <description>The QOL-VAS, a participant reported scale of quality of life (QOL) was used to measure the impact of PBA episodes on the participant’s QOL over the previous 7 days (prior to visit) at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 90 (Final visit). The assessment was completed by a participant placing a mark on a horizontal line that extends from 0 “not (affected) at all” to 10 “significantly (affected)”. The participant’s mark was measured and recorded at each time point. The change in QOL-VAS score from baseline to day 90 visit, defined as the day 90 score minus the baseline score, was analyzed. Data is reported as mean QOL-VAS score; a positive change in score represented an increase in participant’s quality of life.</description>

        <description>The treatment satisfaction survey was a 5 point single question survey that was administered by the site staff to the participant/participant’s caregiver. Participants were asked to rate their response to treatment satisfaction as: very dissatisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, somewhat satisfied, and very satisfied. Data is presented as percentage of participants with treatment satisfaction at Day 90. Percentages within a measure may not sum to 100.0 due to rounding. Percentages use the count of participants with non-missing data as the denominator.</description>
