    <textblock>
      This is a trial of adoptive T cell therapy using the patient's own T cells, genetically
      engineered to target the tumour associated antigen NY-ESO-1 (New York esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma 1). Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis (a process to remove white
      blood cells) to retrieve sufficient T cells which will be gene modified and expanded in the
      laboratory. Patients will undergo preconditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide
      (60mg/kg) day -7 and day -6, followed by fludarabine (25mg/m2) day -5 to day -1. The NY-ESO-1
      gene modified cells will be re-infused on day 0 and the patients will receive up to 14 doses
      of intravenous Interleukin2 (100000 U/kg) from day 0 to day 4.

      The primary objective of response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria will be assessed by CT scans carried out at week 6, week 12 and
      at 12 weekly intervals thereafter.

    <description>NY-ESO-1 T cells are T cells engineered to target the tumour antigen NY-ESO-1. Autologous T cells are obtained from eligible patients who have NY-ESO-1 positive tumours and who are Human Leukocyte Antigen serotype &quot;A&quot; serotype group (HLA2) positive. The T cells undergo lentiviral transduction with NY-ESO-1 specific nucleic acid under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions. The patient will then undergo preconditioning chemotherapy with a regime of cyclophosphamide 60mg/kg/day day -7 and -6 followed by fludarabine 25mg/m2 day -5 to -1. They will receive autologous NY-ESO-1 T cells on day 0 and following on from that they will receive up to 14 doses of intravenous IL-2 at a dose of 100000 units per kg..</description>

          -  Platelets (Plts) ≥ 100 x 10*9/L

          -  Any of the following abnormal baseline liver function tests:

          -  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or

          -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or

          -  ≤ 3 x ULN unless patient has liver metastases when can be &lt; 5 x ULN.

          -  The chemotherapy to be used in this trial is non-myeloablative, but where patients
             have had previous high dose chemotherapy, an autologous haemopoietic stem cell backup
             harvest, for stem cell rescue, will be obtained prior to commencing therapy in this
             trial. Similarly, where there is concern about a patient's bone marrow reserves, for
             example due to multiple previous lines of myelosuppressive chemotherapy a backup stem
             cell harvest should also be obtained.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test prior treatment and agree to use appropriate medically approved
             contraceptive precautions for four weeks prior to entering the trial, during the
             trial, and for six months afterwards.

             treatment.

          -  All toxic manifestations of previous treatment must have resolved. Exceptions to this
             are alopecia or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which an investigator considers should not
             exclude the patient.

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial within the previous 30 days or during the
             course of this treatment.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  Patients who are high medical risks because of non-malignant systemic disease,
             including those with active infection, uncontrolled cardiac or respiratory disease, or
             other serious medical or psychiatric disorders which in the lead clinicians opinion
             would not make the patient a good candidate for adoptive T-cell therapy.

          -  Concurrent serious infections within the 28 days prior to treatment

          -  Current malignancies at other sites, with the exception of adequately treated

             carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Patients known or found to be serologically positive for Hepatitis B, C, HIV or Human
             T cell lymphotropic Virus (HTLV).

          -  History of systemic autoimmune disease which could be life-threatening if reactivation
             occurred( for example hypothyroidism would be permissible, prior rheumatoid arthritis
             or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE0 would not).

          -  Evidence of Centra Nervous System (CNS) involvement.

          -  Patients who are likely to require systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive
             therapy.
