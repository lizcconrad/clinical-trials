    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ATIR is safe and effective in reducing
      transplant-related mortality and improving overall survival, when infused in patients with a
      hematologic malignancy following a T-cell depleted stem cell graft from a related
      haploidentical donor.

      Study CR-AIR-007 is an exploratory, open-label, multicenter study. After signing informed
      consent, patients will receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a
      related, haploidentical donor, followed by infusion with ATIR between 28 and 32 days after
      the HSCT (or later if required by the patient's medical condition). Patients will receive
      ATIR as a single infusion at a dose of 2x10E6 viable T-cells/kg. All patients treated with
      ATIR will be followed up until 12 months after the HSCT. Assessments will be performed at
      weekly visits from the day of ATIR infusion until 8 weeks after ATIR infusion, at monthly
      visits from 3 until 6 months after the HSCT, every 2 months from 6 until 12 months after the
      HSCT, and every 6 months from 12 until 24 months after the HSCT.
