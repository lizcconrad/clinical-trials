  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To cover meal-related insulin requirements, insulin pumps allow insulin to be delivered at
      high rates over a short period of time (bolus delivery). The length of this period (bolus
      duration) usually depends on the chosen bolus size and on the used insulin pump model. This
      study will evaluate the impact of different bolus durations (i.e., durations commonly
      employed in commercially available insulin pumps: 2 and 40 seconds for delivering 1 Unit of
      insulin) on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of an rapid-acting insulin
      analogue.

      Objective: To evaluate in type 1 diabetic patients the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
      of rapid-acting insulin (insulin lispro) administered as subcutaneous boluses with different
      bolus durations.

      Study design: Single-center, randomized, controlled, two-arm cross-over intervention study

      Population: Twenty type 1 diabetic subjects

      Intervention: The investigational treatment is the subcutaneous administration of insulin
      lispro either as one bolus of 15 IU over a period of 30s or as one bolus of 15 IU over a
      period of 10 min. Plasma samples to assess pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties
      will be taken during an 8-hour clamp experiment. Patients will undergo both investigational
      treatments in a randomized order; between the two clamp visits there will be a wash-out
      period of 5-21 days.

      Main study endpoint: Time to maximum glucose infusion rate
