      The effects of Valacyclovir (VAV) augmentation or placebo (PLA) as adjuncts to conventional
      antipsychotic drug treatment will be evaluated among patients with schizophrenia who have
      been exposed to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Hypothesis: Valacyclovir (VAV)
      augmentation improves (a) cognitive and (b) overall function among Herpes Simples Virus 1
      (HSV-1) exposed early course schizophrenia patients.

      Design: We propose a randomized double blind placebo controlled study of patients with early
      course Schizophrenia (SZ) / schizoaffective disorder (SZA) patients exposed to HSV-1, who are
      receiving antipsychotic drugs. The effects of VAV augmentation or PLA as adjuncts to
      conventional antipsychotic drug treatment will be evaluated. As outcomes, we will evaluate
      clinical symptoms, cognitive variables, overall function (including social function) and side
      effects. The participants will be under the direct care of the Indian investigators during
      the study. Ratings will be performed blind by research staff. We will pre-screen for HSV-1
      exposure. There will be a 2 week placebo run in phase, 16 week augmentation and 4 week follow
      up to identify post-treatment side effects.

    <measure>Cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The following measures will be used to assess cognitive functioning both before and after treatment with Valacyclovir:
Cognition: (1) Trail Making Test (TMT). This paper and pencil test is a convenient estimate of cognitive function, principally focusing on attention, working memory and executive function. (2) Computerized Neuropsychological Battery (CNB). We have validated a Hindi version of the Penn CNB and administered it to over 300 Indian participants. The CNB includes cognitive measures that distinguish SZ cases and relatives from controls. Accuracy and response time are recorded. Cognitive domains assessed: Abstraction and mental flexibility; Attention; Verbal Memory; Face Memory; Spatial Memory; Spatial Processing; Sensory-motor Dexterity; Emotion Processing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Severity will be measured by the following assessments: (i) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS. The PANSS is 7 point rating scale for 30 psychopathological items based on interviews or reports. (ii) Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S). The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that rates the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Social function will be measured by: (1) Independent Living Skills Survey (ILSS), a comprehensive, validated measure of functional living skills including self rated and observer rated portions (2) Sheehan's disability scale (SDS), a self-report tool that assesses functional impairment in work/school, social and family life with a 10-point visual analogue scale; (3) Global Assessment of Function (GAF), a global measure of function and symptom severity (4) Quality of Life Scale (QOL) measures interpersonal, social and occupational functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Side effects will be assessed using: (1) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale This scale rates the severity of dyskinetic movements. Orofacial, neck-trunk and distal (limb) movements are rated separately. 2) Barnes Akathisia Scale: A rating scale to assess the severity of drug-induced akathisia.</description>

The VAV group will receive 1.5 g Valacyclovir by mouth, twice daily for 16 weeks, after which they will be followed up without VAV for 4 weeks to monitor delayed adverse effects.</description>
