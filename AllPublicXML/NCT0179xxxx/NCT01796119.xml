  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this split-mouth controlled study, implants placed using the alveolar ridge expansion
      technique will be compared to those placed in native bone with sufficient horizontal bone
      width.

      The Piezosurgery device and Bone expanders (Mectron,Italy) will be employed in an alveolar
      ridge expansion technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success rate of endosseous implant placement in native bone has been proven to be highly
      predictable. Reliable long term result requires sufficient bone thickness surrounding the
      implant's body. This is especially true in the maxillary aesthetic zone where buccal bone
      thickness of 2mm or more is necessary to prevent loss of buccal bone margin and maintain the
      integrity of the gingival architecture.

      Ridge expansion technique, an alternative to bone graft, widens the alveolar ridge prior to
      implant placement, thus permits the preservation of buccal and lingual bone thickness.

      Narrow atrophy edentulous alveolar ridges (study site) in the maxillary aesthetic zone will
      be split lengthwise using piezo-electric surgery (Piezosurgery, Mectron, USA). The prepared
      osteotomy will subsequently be expanded using threaded osteotomes (Bone Expanders, Mectron,
      Italy). Implants will immediately be inserted in the prepared osteotomy. In the edentulous
      alveolar ridges with sufficient thickness (controlled site) in the maxillary aesthetic zone,
      implants will be placed directly using conventional drilling technique. Outcome measures will
      be compared.
