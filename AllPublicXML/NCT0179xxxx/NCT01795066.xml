    <textblock>
      For 12 months after approvement by the University of Yonsei institutional review board, of
      the 59 patients older than 20 years referred to our medical center for EUS-FNA or FNB, all
      consecutive pancreatic lesions were evaluated for inclusion in our prospective study. The
      inclusion criteria for this study were the following: diagnosed or suspected solid pancreatic
      masses according to clinical evaluation and imaging studies with need of histologic tissue
      confirmation by EUS-FNA or EUS-FNB. The exclusion criteria were the following: cystic
      pancreatic lesions, patients haemodynamically unstable or with severe coagulopathy
      (international normalized ratio [INR] &gt; 1.5 or platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/cubic millimeter
      [cmm3]), patients unable to suspend anticoagulant/anti-platelet therapy, pregnancy, inability
      or refusal to give informed consent, and refusal to participate in the study. Patients
      undergoing anticoagulant or anti- platelet therapy for non-critical problems discontinued
      treatment at least 5 days before the endoscopic procedure. Written informed consent was
      obtained from all patients for the procedures performed and participation in the study, and
      the study protocol was approved by the University of Yonsei institutional review board. All
      patients were underwent the procedure under conscious sedation with propofol and midazolam
      according to the current guidelines.8 After procedure, the patients were monitored for at
      least six hours in order to immediately detect post-procedural complications and were
      followed for up to 7 days in order to detect late complications.

    <description>The tissue samples were immediately fixed in formalin. The histologic cassette was processed, embedded in paraffin, and then prepared in hematoxylin and eosin to be evaluated by one pathologist (K.H.K) for the presence of a histologic core. If the histologic core was present, the specimen was graded as optimal or suboptimal. Optimal specimens were those in which the procured material enabled satisfactory assessment of histologic architecture that either did not change the original diagnosis or yielded additional findings. Suboptimal specimens were those in which the quality of the histologic core was unsatisfactory for assessment of histologic architecture. When required, immunohistochemical or special staining was performed for differentiation of morphologically challenging lesions.10</description>
