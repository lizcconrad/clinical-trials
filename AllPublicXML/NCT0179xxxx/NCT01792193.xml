  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous work, the investigators analyzed the concentration of gut-derived peptides
      (ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide [PP]) in serum of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      The investigators have shown that the secretion pattern differs between PD patients and
      controls. Beside ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptide other gut-derived peptides (e.g.
      Glucagon-like-Peptide 1[GLP-1], Amylin, etc.) might be relevant for PD as well. The rational
      to investigate gut-derived peptides in the neurological disorder Parkinson's disease (PD) is
      based on the following considerations:

        -  Receptors for gut-derived peptides are expressed in Central Nervous System (CNS)
           structures that are affected by the neurodegenerative process underlying Parkinson's
           disease

        -  Gut-derived peptides are involved in the modulation of higher brain functions (mood,
           cognition, reward-related behaviour) that are frequently altered in Parkinson's disease.

        -  The secretion of gut peptides is (co-)regulated by the vagal nerve that is dysfunctional
           in Parkinson's disease.

        -  Certain gut-derived peptides (ghrelin, GLP-1) stimulate neurogenesis and might be able
           to prevent cell death in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.

      Objective:

      Collection of CSF and serum samples in a standardized way in order to quantitatively measure
      the concentration of gut-derived peptides (ghrelin, leptin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic
      peptide [GIP], GLP-1, amylin, PP, peptide YY [PYY], and insulin). Scientific questions:

        1. Do CSF (and serum) concentrations of these gut peptides differ between PD patients and
           controls?

        2. Do CSF (and serum) concentrations of the investigated peptides correlate with clinical
           and / or epidemiological characteristics of the investigated subjects (age, gender, BMI,
           disease duration, severity of motor impairments, presence of non-motor symptoms,
           co-morbidities, medication, etc.)?

    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed only once, after an overnight fast between 7 and 8 AM. Study-related procedure will be performed on one singel day. There will be no follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>CSF and corresponding serum samples will be collected in the fasting state in the morning. A standardized collection of the samples is crucial to avoid potential confounders (daytime, metabolic state, etc.). Samples will be frozen immediately and kept at minus 20°C until analysis. Samples will be analysed using a multiplex approach.</description>
