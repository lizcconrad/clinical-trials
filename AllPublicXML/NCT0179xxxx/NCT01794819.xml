  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness in Russian general practice of C-reactive
      protein testing in patients with acute cough or lower respiratory tract infections.

      In addition to studying the effect of C-reactive protein testing on the prescription of
      antibiotics, the purpose is to find out whether the frequency of referral to radiography
      could be reduced.

      Eighteen general practitioners, from both urban and rural offices, were randomised into
      intervention and control groups. All registrations were made by general practitioners in
      their offices.

      The case report form was similar to that used in the GRACE study (Genomics to combat
      Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in
      Europe (www.grace-lrti.org) describing symptoms, findings, and treatment in lower respiratory
      tract infections.

        -  The clinical examination included a chest examination and the axillary temperature.

        -  After the clinical examination, the general practitioners recorded their provisional
           diagnosis.

        -  Chest radiography was accessible for all patients.

      The C-reactive protein test was performed in the intervention group at both the first and
      second consultations. The Afinion test system was used, which provides results within 5
      minutes and before treatment was determined. This test is based on solid-phase sandwich
      immunometric analysis.

      General practitioners could prescribe any treatment, including antibiotics and other drugs
      for the cough and additional medication if deemed necessary.
