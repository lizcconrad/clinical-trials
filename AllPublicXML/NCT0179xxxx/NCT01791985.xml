  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at a new drug called AZD4547 which is being tested for the treatment of
      oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer. AZD4547 is a drug which specifically &quot;blocks&quot;
      proteins called fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1) that are involved in the processes
      that help cancer cells to grow. These proteins may also be responsible for the development of
      resistance to hormonal therapies used to treat some breast cancers. AZD4547 is not yet
      approved for use in breast cancer and is therefore being used in this study as a research
      drug.

      The investigators will also test the theory that it is not necessary for high levels of FGFR1
      to be present in the body to see benefit from AZD4547. (Stage 1 only)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out in two stages. Stage 1 is to find a suitable dose of AZD4547
      which can be used together with a class of drugs called nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors
      (e.g. anastrozole or letrozole) i.e. a dose which does not cause too many unacceptable side
      effects.

      Patients with hormone sensitive (oestrogen receptor positive) breast cancer, whose current
      treatment with anastrozole or letrozole has recently stopped working properly will be
      eligible for this stage.

      Stage 2 will then assess the efficacy of AZD4547, based on the change in tumour size at 12
      weeks (or progression if prior to week 12), when used in combination with either anastrozole
      or letrozole in patients with hormone sensitive (oestrogen receptor positive) breast cancer,
      who have progressed on treatment with either anastrozole or letrozole in any setting.

      In both stages, the study will look at how well the new treatment is tolerated.

      Each patient is only allowed to take part in either stage 1 or 2.

      The study will be run in 9 Hospitals across England and Scotland.

    <description>Patients will continue or restart the NSAI which they have progressed* on: either anastrozole (1mg) or letrozole (2.5mg), orally, once daily but together with twice daily AZD4547 (80mg).
AZD4547 will be given on an intermittent schedule of one week on / one week off.
*Prior to study entry, patients must have taken anastrozole or letrozole at some stage in their treatment to date for breast cancer; and shown evidence of resistance to this therapy. The NSAI does not have to be the most recent line of treatment.</description>
