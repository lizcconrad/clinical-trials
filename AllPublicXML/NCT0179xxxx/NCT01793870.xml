  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, single dose, 4-period, period balanced, crossover
      study. There will be at least 5 days between dosing in each session. The study consists of
      Screening period (30 days prior to Day 1), Treatment period consisting of 4 dosing periods
      (Day 1 is the dosing day and Day 2) and Follow-up period (7-14 days post-last dose).

      The detailed treatment regimen will be A and B (27.5 mg total maximum dose): Single oral dose
      of carvedilol 25 mg immediate release tablet and up to 2.5 mg of enriched carvedilol powder
      under fasted conditions; C (33.75 mg total maximum dose): Single oral dose of carvedilol
      31.25 mg as 25 mg immediate release tablet, a 6.25 mg immediate release tablet and up to 2.5
      mg of enriched carvedilol powder under fasted conditions; D (27.5 mg total maximum dose):
      Single oral dose of carvedilol 25 mg immediate release tablet and up to 2.5 mg of enriched
      carvedilol powder under fed conditions. Approximately 15 subjects will be randomized to
      receive one of four treatment sequences (ADBC, BACD, CBDA, or DCAB).

      The pharmacokinetic sampling and safety data will be collected in the Treatment period (Day 1
      and 2).

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin
