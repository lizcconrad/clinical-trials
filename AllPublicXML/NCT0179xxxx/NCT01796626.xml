  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least thirty (30) subjects, Fitzpatrick-Goldman Skin Type I-IV will be enrolled in 2
      clinical sites; each clinic will enroll at least 15 subjects.

      Subjects should present visible wrinkles and/or striae requiring treatment.

      Hypothesis: The M22 ResurFX 1565nm module will improve the appearance of the wrinkles by at
      least 2 grades on the Fitzpatrick-Goldman Wrinkle and Elastosis Score, and striae by at least
      50% using VAS as compared to baseline, for at least 75% of the subjects.
