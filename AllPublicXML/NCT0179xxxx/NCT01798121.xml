      A study to determine bioequivalence of PPD material versus Reference Standard.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled parallel-group study to
      determine the bioequivalence of newly produced PPD material versus PPD-S2 in the detection of
      male and female subjects with current or previously diagnosed intrathoracic Mtb infection, as
      documented by a positive culture for Mtb (preferred method), by their primary care or
      attending physician and/or by the subject's current or prior medical records (ie, sensitivity
      determination).
