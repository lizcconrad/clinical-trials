      This pilot clinical trial studies busulfan, melphalan, and stem cell transplant after
      chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma that is likely to come
      back or spread. Giving chemotherapy to the entire body before a stem cell transplant stops
      the growth of tumor cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment,
      stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. More chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are
      then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the
      chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the acute toxicity of an autologous stem cell transplant with a
      busulfan-melphalan (BuMel) based regimen is tolerable when given as consolidation therapy for
      high-risk neuroblastoma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the incidence of non-hematologic organ toxicity (grade 3 and higher) and all
      cause mortality in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant with a BuMel based
      regimen followed by local radiotherapy for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma.

      II. To describe response rates, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) for
      patients undergoing induction therapy followed by consolidation with myeloablative BuMel
      preparative regimen and local radiotherapy for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma.

      III. To correlate busulfan pharmacokinetics with non-hematologic toxicity following a BuMel
      based autologous transplant regimen and event-free survival and overall survival.

      IV. To determine the feasibility of performing Curie scores in &quot;real time,&quot; as assessed by
      central scan committee review of a 123 I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan obtained after
      cycle 4 of induction therapy.

      V. To examine the concordance between central reviewers and institutional reviewers in
      performing Curie scoring at diagnosis and after cycle 4 of induction therapy.

      VI. To determine the feasibility of detecting aberrations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase
      (ALK) gene in tumors obtained at the time of diagnosis in patients with high-risk
      neuroblastoma.

      VII. To determine the feasibility of performing molecular profiling of neuroblastoma tumors
      obtained at the time of diagnosis in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

      VIII. To correlate melphalan pharmacokinetics with non-hematologic toxicity following a BuMel
      based autologous transplant regimen and event-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY:

      COURSES 1-2: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 15-30 minutes,
      topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) or
      IV once daily (QD) beginning on day 6 or pegfilgrastim SQ once on day 6. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for 2 courses.

      COURSES 3 AND 5: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-4 and etoposide IV over
      1-2 hours on days 1-3 and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) or IV once daily (QD) beginning on
      day 6 or pegfilgrastim SQ once on day 6. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses.

      COURSE 4: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-6 hours on days 1-2, vincristine
      sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 1-3, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on days 1-3
      and mesna IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-2 and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) or IV once
      daily (QD) beginning on day 6 or pegfilgrastim SQ once on day 6. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for 1 course.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning 4-8 weeks following the 5th course of induction therapy,
      patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -6 to -3 and melphalan IV on day -1.
      Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) on day 0 and filgrastim SC or IV
      beginning on day 0 until recovery.

      Some patients also undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) after induction and
      consolidation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.

In addition, a descriptive analysis of “late” onset grade 4-5 pulmonary and hepatic complications that occur within 180 days of the start of consolidation therapy will be examined, regardless if the patient has proceeded to other therapy (including chimeric antibody) during that 180 day period.</description>
