  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if giving the study drug Ruxolitinib (INC424) prior
      to a combination of other chemotherapeutic drugs (Fludarabine and Busulfan) before infusing
      another person's hematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow transplantation) will be successful in
      people who have advanced primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis
      (PPV-MF) or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF), collectively known as
      myelofibrosis (MF). MF is a disorder in which bone marrow tissue develops in abnormal sites
      because the bone marrow itself undergoes fibrosis or scarring. This study plans to evaluate
      whether adding the drug Ruxolitinib will further aid in reducing pre-transplant spleen size,
      improve physical performance levels and reduce adverse events (side effects) related to the
      transplant. Ruxolitinib is a drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients
      with advanced forms of myelofibrosis. Using Ruxolitinib prior to stem cell transplantation is
      experimental.

      A two- stage Simon Phase II study will be conducted in each of two groups of patients:
      related and unrelated donor transplants. In each donor transplant group, the first stage of
      this design will include 11 patients evaluated for death or graft failure by 100 days
      post-transplant. In each stratum, we will enroll additional patients (up to 20%) of stratum
      total to take into account exclusions due to donor failure (such as donor deemed unsuitable
      for stem cell donation due to medical or other reasons) only. Those patients who have
      toxicities related to Ruxolitinib and not been able to reach HCT due to these toxicities will
      be included in the estimation of overall failure rates. Only those patients who are excluded
      based on donor related issues without any regimen related complications will be excluded from
      the estimation of failure rates. However, all data on these patients will be reported.
