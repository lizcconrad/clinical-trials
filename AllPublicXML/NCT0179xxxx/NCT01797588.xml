  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective pain management following total knee arthroplasty is important to facilitate early
      mobilization and rehabilitation. To manage post-operative pain, multimodal analgesia,
      including acetaminophen, NSAID's, gabapentin, opioids and local anesthetics are used.
      However, local anesthetics injected into the femoral nerve area may cause a block in motor
      function of the quadriceps muscle. Both adductor-canal peripheral nerve block performed
      pre-operatively, and periarticular infiltration performed intra-operatively are effective in
      reducing pain following TKA without causing quadriceps motor block which can impede
      mobilization. No published trials have been found that compare single shot adductor-canal
      block plus periarticular infiltration to periarticular infiltration only or adductor-canal
      nerve block only. The purpose of this trial is to examine the effect of 3 different
      approaches to nerve blockade: 1) adductor-canal block plus periarticular infiltration; 2)
      adductor-canal block only; 3) periarticular infiltration only, on pain, analgesic
      consumption, mobility, pain related interference with activities and length of hospital stay
      in participants undergoing unilateral TKA. Patients will be eligible for participation if
      they are 18 years old or older, and can speak, and read English. Ninety-six trial
      participants will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 approaches to nerve blockade as part of
      their pain management plan. Outcomes will be measured on post-operative days 1 and 2 and
      length of stay will be calculated in hours after the participant is discharged to home. It is
      hypothesized that participants that receive both adductor-canal nerve block plus
      periarticular infiltration will report less pain, improved mobility and less pain related
      interference with activities.

      Hypothesis:

      The combination of adductor-canal peripheral nerve block with periarticular intra-operative
      infiltration (AC+PI) provides superior analgesia and preserves motor function as compared to
      adductor-canal block (AC) only or periarticular infusion (PI) only.

      Specific Aims:

      The primary outcome of this trial is to examine pain on walking, using a 0 to 10 numeric
      rating scale (NRS), at post-operative day 1 in patients who undergo TKA using 3 different
      approaches to nerve blockade: 1) adductor-canal block plus periarticular infiltration; 2)
      adductor-canal block only; 3) periarticular infiltration only.

      The secondary outcomes of this trial are to examine, in patients who undergo TKA using 3
      different approaches to nerve blockade: 1) adductor-canal block plus periarticular
      infiltration; 2) adductor-canal block only; 3) periarticular infiltration only:

        1. pain at rest on post-operative day 1 and day 2 at 1000

        2. pain with walking on post-operative day 2

        3. pain with knee flexion on post-operative day 1 and day 2 at 1000

        4. analgesic consumption on post-operative day 1 and day 2

        5. distance walked on post-operative day 1 and day 2

        6. pain related interference with activities on post-operative day 1 and day 2

        7. length of stay

    <description>The adductor-canal block only group will receive an adductor-canal block prior to surgery in the block room using ultra sound guidance by an anesthetist. After the adductor-canal is located a total of 30mL of 0.33% ropivacaine will be injected into the area surrounding the saphenous nerve. Participants will also receive 110mL of normal saline administered as follows: the first 20mL aliquot is injected into the posterior capsule and the medial and lateral ligaments just prior to implantation; after the implants have been cemented and curing, another 20mL is infiltrated to the quadriceps and retinacular tissues. The remaining solution (~60mL) is used to infiltrate the muscle, subcutaneous tissues.</description>
