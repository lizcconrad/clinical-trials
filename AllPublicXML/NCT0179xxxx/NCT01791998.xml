      This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance thermal image guided laser interstitial
      thermal therapy in treating patients with breast cancer. Magnetic resonance thermal image
      guided laser interstitial thermal therapy may be able to kill tumor cells by heating up the
      tumor cells without affecting the surrounding tissue

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the procedural success rate of using the Visualase magnetic resonance
      (MR)-guided laser system to target, access, thermally monitor, and focally ablate MR-visible
      breast cancer lesions.

      2. To obtain preliminary data on ablative success using pathologic assessment for specimen
      excised subsequent to the ablation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MR-thermal image guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) over 1
      hour.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-7 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal state

          -  Histological diagnosis of breast invasive ductal carcinoma with receptor profiles
             obtained

          -  MRI visible breast lesion

          -  Unifocal cancer, less than 1.5 cm in maximum diameter (clinical stage T1), with no
             evidence of extensive in situ cancer surrounding the main tumor; the eligibility will
             be determined by the MR imaging appearance of the tumor; if the tumor (proven invasive
             ductal carcinoma) is a unifocal mass without additional enhancement, it will be judged
             eligible; however, if the tumor is associated with additional enhancement and/or a
             satellite focus, it will not judged ineligible, as these are signs of additional in
             situ or invasive cancer

          -  Clinical stage N0 (no metastatic axillary lymph node on physical examination or
             imaging work-up)

          -  Ability to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous surgery or radiation for the ipsilateral breast cancer

          -  Presence of any condition (e.g., metal implant, shrapnel) not compatible with MRI

          -  Tumor located less than 1 cm from the skin or the pectoralis muscle
