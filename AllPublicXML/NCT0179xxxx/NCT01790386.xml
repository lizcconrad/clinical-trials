      This study is being performed to obtain data about the CORA system, a new device that is
      currently being tested and is not yet cleared for sale in the United State by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA). The purpose of the study is to validate the CORA system by
      comparing the results of this test to that of the standard of care device called the TEG
      system. Both systems evaluate hemostasis, a highly complex and interactive process involving
      many protein and cellular elements, especially platelets, occurring in a series of
      interrelated phases, which results in either normal hemostasis or a tendency toward bleeding
      or clotting complications.

      The study protocol specifies testing using multiple reagents which are similar for both the
      CORA and TEG systems. Tests are run on blood samples taken from patients undergoing
      cardiovascular surgery and cardiology procedures, at two times throughout the procedure. The
      tests may be performed at three different pairs of times: Pre-Operation and Post-Protamine,
      or During Operation (Post-Heparin) and ICU, or Pre-Operation and ICU. Patients are selected
      at random for determination of which pair of times will be used, as long as the number of
      patients for each of the three groups is approximately the same. Following the protocol
      defined in CLSI Standard EP09-A2, equivalence between the two systems will be demonstrated if
      the conclusions from the Standard Section 7, Interpreting Results and Comparing to Internal
      Performance Criteria, are found to be acceptable.

      The study protocol also specifies the testing of blood samples from normal, health volunteer
      subjects for the purpose of determining CORA System Reference Ranges for all of the reagents
      used in the study. Reference ranges will be constructed following the guidelines specified in
      CLSI Standard C28-A3c.

      All blood samples drawn for this study will use venous blood. Whole blood is not used for
      these studies; only citrated or heparinized samples are used. All samples are repeated twice
      (run in duplicate tests). Quality Controls are run on both instruments at a frequency
      specified by the manufacturers. Results obtained from this testing are not used to make
      treatment decisions.
