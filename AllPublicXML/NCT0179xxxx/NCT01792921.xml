      Scientific Rationale: Many children with ADHD have serious difficulties in participation in
      daily occupations in their ecological settings. These difficulties have a pervasive negative
      impact on their everyday functioning and quality of life (QoL). Although pharmacological
      treatment has been proven effective in treating ADHD symptoms in many children, as have
      psychosocial interventions such as parent training, there is little evidence for integrative
      approaches that address the cognitive, volitional and social-environmental barriers to
      participation with this population. Although preliminary positive effects of a
      cognitive-function (Cog-Fun) treatment in occupational therapy on this population have been
      demonstrated, additional evidence is needed to confirm these initial findings. Methods:
      Initial results of our pilot study (N=17 children with ADHD) demonstrated significant
      moderate to large effects of Cog-Fun treatment, which targeted participation and executive
      functions in daily life. Significant effects were also found for a measure of self-efficacy
      and neuropsychological measures of attention, planning and organization. Parent ratings
      showed significant reduction of ADHD symptoms and improved QoL. The purpose of the current
      study is to replicate the pilot study findings in a randomized controlled trial. The study
      will be a randomized controlled trial with a crossover design, including 2 groups of children
      with ADHD attending elementary school and their parents. The research group (Group A, n=50)
      will receive three months of the Cog-Fun treatment, designed for a parent/child dyad and the
      control group (Group B, n=50) will be wait-listed and receive treatment after three months.
      Outcomes will include measures of participation, executive functions in daily life, child and
      parental self-efficacy, ADHD symptoms and QoL. The investigators expect to find a significant
      main effect of time (pre-post intervention), group (research vs. control) and a significant
      interaction effect (group x time) on executive and occupational outcome measures.
