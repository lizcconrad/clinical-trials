      The investigators hypothesise that manipulating the glycaemic index of the meal after
      exercise and before sleep will help prevent Type 1 diabetes individuals experiencing
      hypoglycaemia.

             retinopathy).

          -  HbA1c &lt;8.5%.

          -  Not taking any prescribed medication other than insulin, and treated with a stable
             insulin regimen composed of a combination of slow/long acting insulin (glargine or
             detemir) and fast-acting insulin analogues (lispro or aspart), for a minimum of 6
             months before the start of the study.

          -  Demonstrate normal cardiac function in response to exercise.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged younger than 18, or older than 50 years.

          -  Suffering from, or diagnosed with a diabetes related complication (apart from mild

          -  HbA1c &gt;8.5%.

          -  Currently taking prescribed medication, and not currently treated with a stable basal
             bolus regimen composed of a combination glargine or determir, and lispro or aspart for
             at least 6 months before the start of the study.

          -  Failure to demonstrate normal cardiopulmonary responses during exercise, or have a
             medical condition which could prevent completion of exercise or be exacerbated because
