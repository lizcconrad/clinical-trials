    <description>Drug: Rilotumumab Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G, type 2 (IgG2) against human hepatocyte growth factor/scatter (HGF/SF) that blocks binding of HGF/SF to its receptor MET, inhibiting HGF/MET-driven activities in cells. Drug: Cisplatin A platinum containing chemo-therapy compound that reacts in vivo, binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA, which ultimately triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death). Drug: Capecitabine A chemo-therapy prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to 5-fluorouracil in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.</description>
