    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of participation in this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of
      different dosing schedules of LY2605541 and how different dosing schedules of LY2605541
      affect Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants will be treated for up to 36 weeks with LY2605541
      (one 12-week Lead-in period and two 12-week Randomization periods) and will participate in a
      total of 42 weeks of total study enrollment, including a 2-week Screening period and a 4-week
      Follow-up period.

      This study involved a comparison of LY2605541 regimens, each administered with bolus insulin
      lispro. Eligible participants were switched to a fixed evening LY2605541dosing regimen at the
      beginning of the 12-week lead-in period. LY2605541 was administered SQ once-daily using a
      prefilled insulin device. The LY2605541dose was adjusted using a dosing algorithm adapted
      from Bartley and Bolli (Bartley et al. 2008, Bolli et al. 2009) based on the participant's
      blood glucose (BG) values and documented hypoglycemia during the previous week. Participants
      not already receiving insulin lispro for prandial dosing were switched to insulin lispro at
      the beginning of the 12-week lead-in period. Adjustments to insulin lispro doses were based
      on the insulin dosing algorithms adapted from Riddle and Bergenstal (Riddle et al. 2003,
      Bergenstal et al. 2008). At the time of randomization, participants were randomized to begin
      either the fixed evening dosing regimen or the variable time dosing regimen. Each participant
      was crossed over to the alternate regimen after 12 weeks. The insulin device (prefilled pen)
      remained the same throughout the study.

    <measure>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 Week in Each Randomization Period</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a test that measures a person's average blood glucose level over the past 2 to 3 months. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis including the following fixed effects: treatment, period, sequence, baseline HbA1c (last nonmissing value at or before randomization), week (defined from the start of each Randomization Period), and treatment-by-week interaction.</description>

    <measure>30-Day Adjusted Rate of Total and Nocturnal Hypoglycemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) of Randomization Period through 24 Weeks (12 weeks in each Randomization Period)</time_frame>
    <description>Total hypoglycemic events (HE) include any event based on a blood glucose &lt;=70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (3.9 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]), with or without signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia or an event associated with signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia but without a glucose measurement. Nocturnal HE include any total HE that occurred between bedtime and waking. Group Means are presented and were calculated from negative binomial regression models (number of episodes = treatment + period + treatment sequence + baseline HbA1c [&lt;=8.0% or &gt;8.0%], with log [exposure in days/30] as an offset variable). Group Mean (LS mean) is estimated by taking the inverse link function on individual participant covariates first and then averages over all participants.</description>

The percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with hypoglycemic episodes by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants completed a 12 week (wk) Lead-in Period during which insulin peglispro was administered at fixed time in the evening. Participants were then randomized to a fixed evening dose regimen or a variable time dose regimen for 12 wks (Randomization Period 1); after 12 wks, they crossed over to the alternate regimen (Randomization Period 2).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>LY2605541 Fixed Time Dosing (All Participants)</title>
          <description>Lead-in Period: Participant-specific dose of LY2605541 administered subcutaneously (SQ) at approximately the same time every evening for 12 weeks. Participant-specific dose of insulin lispro SQ when &gt;20% of calories were consumed (pre-meal).
Insulin dose and adjustments to insulin dose were determined by insulin algorithms based on self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG).
Target glucose values were as follows:
Preprandial and bedtime BG between 71 and 130 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) Insulin adjustment and glucose correction between 71 and 100 mg/dL.</description>

Randomization Period 2: Participant-specific dose of LY2605541 administered SQ on a variable schedule (8- and 40-hour dosing intervals) for 12 weeks. Participants were dosed in the morning on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and in the evening on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Dosing schedules were to remain approximately the same throughout the 12 weeks. Participant-specific dose of insulin lispro SQ when &gt;20% of calories were consumed (pre-meal).
Insulin dose and adjustments to insulin dose were determined by insulin algorithms based on SMBG. Target glucose values were as follows:

          <description>Participants entered a 12-week Lead-in Period where they received fixed time of dose of LY2605541 with bolus insulin lispro. Participants were then randomized to either a fixed time of dose or a variable time of dose regimen for 12 weeks administered with bolus insulin lispro; after 12 weeks, they crossed over to the alternate regimen. LY2605541 dose was adjusted using a dosing algorithm based on the participant’s BG values and documented hypoglycemia during the previous week. Insulin dose were determined by insulin algorithms based on SMBG.
Fixed time of dose: Participant-specific dose of LY2605541 administered SQ at approximately the same time every evening for 12 weeks administered with bolus insulin lispro.
Variable time of dose: Participant-specific dose of LY2605541 administered SQ on a variable schedule (8- and 40-hour dosing intervals) for 12 weeks. Dosing schedules were to remain approximately the same throughout the 12 weeks administered with bolus insulin lispro.</description>

        <description>Total hypoglycemic events (HE) include any event based on a blood glucose &lt;=70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (3.9 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]), with or without signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia or an event associated with signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia but without a glucose measurement. Nocturnal HE include any total HE that occurred between bedtime and waking. Group Means are presented and were calculated from negative binomial regression models (number of episodes = treatment + period + treatment sequence + baseline HbA1c [&lt;=8.0% or &gt;8.0%], with log [exposure in days/30] as an offset variable). Group Mean (LS mean) is estimated by taking the inverse link function on individual participant covariates first and then averages over all participants.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Total and Nocturnal Hypoglycemic Events</title>
          <description>Total HE include any event based on a blood glucose &lt;=70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), with or without signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia or an event associated with signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia but without a glucose measurement. Nocturnal HE include any total HE that occurred between bedtime and waking. The percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with hypoglycemic episodes by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) at 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>SMBG measurements were taken at 9 time points: pre-morning meal, 2 hours post-morning meal, pre-midday meal, 2 hours post-midday meal, pre-evening meal, 2 hours post-evening meal, bedtime, at approximately 0300 hours, and the subsequent morning prior to the morning meal. SMBG measures were assessed at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 within each Randomization Period. LS means were calculated using MMRM analysis including the following fixed effects: treatment, period, sequence, baseline SMBG (last nonmissing value at or before randomization), baseline HbA1c (&lt;=8.0% or &gt;8.0%), week (defined from the start of each Randomization Period), and treatment-by-week interaction.</description>

        <description>A summary of glucose variability (intra-participant variability) as measured by the average of between-day standard deviations of individual SMBG time points.
