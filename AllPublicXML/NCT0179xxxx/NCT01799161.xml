  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NSCLC tumors are appropriate targets for active immunotherapy, because they are
      non-immunogenic, which indicates that NSCLC does not stimulate a spontaneous immune response.

      NSCLC tumor-secreted gp96-Ig is an ideal vaccine because it combines adjuvant activity with
      polyvalent peptide specificity. Tumor secreted gp96 activates dendritic cells (DC), natural
      killer cells (NK) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Tumor cells can be killed by NK-specific
      mechanisms, by promiscuous killing of CD8 CTL through NKG2D, and by MHC restricted CD8 CTL
      activity. The activation of DC and NK by tumor secreted gp96 may also counteract the
      generation of immuno-suppressive CD4 regulatory cells.

      Suppression of adenosinergic pathways by oxygen and theophylline in combination with
      immunotherapy will improve tumor rejection.

      Allogeneic, gp96-Ig secreting tumor cells used as vaccine are expected to generate NK and CTL
      with activity to the patient's autologous tumor.

      This is a proof of principle trial investigating a heat shock protein gp96 Ig-secreting,
      allogeneic tumor cell-vaccine (gp96-Ig vaccine) administered in combination with suppression
      of adenosinergic pathways by oxygen and Theophylline to patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Allogeneic, cultured lung adenocarcinoma cells transfected with HLA A1 and
      gp96-Ig will be irradiated and injected intradermally into patients suffering from advanced,
      relapsed, or metastatic NSCLC. HLA matching is not required. Safety and immunogenicity of the
      combined treatment will be studied in three patient cohorts that will receive twice monthly,
      weekly or twice weekly vaccination plus Theophylline and oxygen.

      Immune response to vaccination of patients will be measured by determining
      adenocarcinoma-specific CD8 CTL precursor frequencies. ELI-spot assay for interferon-y
      (IFN-y) will be done to measure cytotoxic function of CD8 cells challenged in vitro with
      vaccine cells or autologous tumor cells. Multiparameter flow cytometry of CD8 and CD4 cells
      will be carried out to assess functional characteristics and to assess adenosine receptor
      levels and expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha.

      Patients will be randomized in equal allocation (1:1:1) to one of three dose-schedule (DS)
      cohorts defined by the frequency of vaccination. All patients will receive a total course
      dose of gp96 vaccine. A total of 36 patients, 12 per DS cohort, will be enrolled. We expect
      to accrue at a rate of two patients per month except at the onset of study when successive
      enrollment will be spaced to allow observation of first course toxicity in the first several
      patients. (See Section 3.3.4 for details.) Patients will be followed for a minimum of one
      year, thus study duration is expected to be three years.
