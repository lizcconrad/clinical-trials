    <textblock>
      This study is a non interventional study where no investigational medicine is provided.
      Procedures and examination will follow the institution standard of care practice. The
      therapeutic approach will not be decided in advance by the protocol or influenced in any way
      by the protocol.

      After standard evaluation the investigator will decide the treatment strategy and upon
      eligibility criteria met will propose subject to participate to the study. Informed consent
      will be collected for all subjects.

      The study will consist of 3 possible observational visits; V1 (enrolment), V2 and V3 (follow
      up).

      During all observational visits (V1, V2 and V3) the patient will complete the I-PSS
      (International Prostate Symptom Score) questionnaire including Quality Of Life (QOL)
      questionnaire and a Patient assessment of treatment benefit and satisfaction using a Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS).

      The patient will be asked to complete a voiding diary the first 3 days after Visit 1
      (Baseline diary), 3 days before Visit 2 and again 3 days before Visit 3.

      Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) measurement- Uroflowmetry - Post Voiding Residual volume and
      Trans Rectal Ultra Sound data will be collected only if available.

      During all observational visits (V1, V2 and V3) the investigator will complete the assessment
      of treatment benefit and satisfaction using a VAS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following subjects can be included in this study if they answer the following criteria:

          -  they have been prescribed solifenacin 5-10mg according to Summary of Product
             Characteristics (SmPC).

          -  Subjects with diagnosed Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) with substantial storage
             disorder defined as urgency, and/or frequency and/or Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI)

          -  IPSS storage sub-score &gt; 8

          -  Subject expected to require at least 3 months treatment with solifenacin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any reason which following current medical knowledge, physical condition of the
             patient and in the opinion of the investigator contraindicates administration of
             solifenacin to the subject, such as- signs and symptoms suggestive of urinary tract
             infection (confirmed by positive urine analysis).

          -  History of bladder obstruction not being adequately corrected.

          -  Anticipate or plan to participate in another study during study period of 12 weeks
             from study entry.
