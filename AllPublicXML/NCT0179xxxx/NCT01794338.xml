  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the outcomes of patients who have been treated with Strattice or Gore
      Bio-A mesh for the repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias. The purpose of this study is
      to collect information and evaluate the outcome of your surgery. Synthetic (man made) mesh
      has been shown to provide durable long-term outcomes; however, this type of mesh should not
      be used in patients at risk of developing an infection. Therefore, to address the challenge
      of finding an artificial strengthening material to repair complicated hernias in patients
      that could potentially develop surgical infection, two types of non-permanent materials have
      been developed, including biologics and bioabsorbables. Biologic mesh is made of living
      tissue and bioabsorbable mesh is made of synthetic material that is gradually absorbed by the
      body over time. The purpose of this study is to allow surgeons to compare the postoperative
      course of patients associated with these two mesh types to decide which material will improve
      the outcomes of their patients with complicated abdominal wall defects. To date there is no
      evidence to suggest that either mesh type is superior or safer than the other.

      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the outcomes of patients implanted with
      Strattice® (LifeCell Corporation, Branchburg, NJ, USA) and Gore® Bio-A® (W. L. Gore &amp;
      Associates, Inc., Newark, DE, USA) for the repair of abdominal wall defects in at-risk
      patients. Primary endpoints of the study will include hernia recurrence, duration of
      postoperative drains, the incidence of systemic and wound-related complications, the need for
      percutaneous intervention or reoperation and quality- of-life with 3 years of follow-up. The
      study will be prospective and randomized, and the evaluator and patient will be blinded as to
      the type of mesh implanted.

    <description>Patients will receive underlay mesh tissue reinforcement followed by standard fascial closure with #1 PDS. As described by Dr. Stoppa10-12, the mesh will be secured via abdominal wall sutures. Additional full thickness sutures will be placed every 8 cm circumferentially. After securing the mesh in place, #1 PDS sutures will be used to close the fascia in a running fashion with 1.5-2 cm &quot;bites&quot; from the fascial edge and a 1cm &quot;walk&quot; between stitches. Skin will be closed with staples or monofilament suture according to surgeon preference. Drains will be placed on the mesh in each case, and one or two drains will be placed in the subcutaneous tissues at the discretion of the surgeon depending on the amount of subcutaneous tissue dissected.</description>
