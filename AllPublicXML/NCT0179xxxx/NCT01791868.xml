      Study Hypothesis Generalized Convulsive Status Epilepticus (GCSE) is a medical emergency
      associated with an increased morbidity and a prolonged length of hospital stay. Only 50% of
      patients are discharged from the hospital within the first month after GCSE. Recent
      Guidelines from Experts highlight the necessity to improve the efficiency of the first line
      anti-epileptic (AE) therapy.

      Intravenous Sodium Valproate (SV) might be an adjuvant AE drug to the recommended first line
      AEs. Intravenous SV is available, well tolerated and easily injectible but also has
      pharmacologic properties for reducing the risk of seizures relapses and for being
      neuroprotective. However, efficacy of intravenous as an adjuvant therapy in GCSE has never
      been properly assessed.

      Primary Purpose The primary purpose is to assess if the association of intravenous Sodium
      Valproate with the recommended treatment for Generalized Convulsive Status Epilepticus
      increases to 20 % the number of living patients, discharged from the hospital at day 15.

      Patient admitted Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for a Generalized Convulsive Status Epilepticus
      (GCSE) will be randomized if they fulfil the inclusion criteria and after the written
      informed consent is obtained from the patient's next of kin. In clack of closed relatives,
      patients could be included according to the French Health Code for Case of medical emergency.
      In this situation, patient's consent should be then obtained as soon as possible According to
      randomization arm, patients will be treated either by intravenous sodium valproate (30 mg/kg
      during 15 min then 1 mg/kg/h during 12 h) or intravenous placebo. All included patients will
      benefit from first-line anti epileptic drugs and symptomatic medical care, in agreement with
      the Experts recommendation (RFE 2009).

      From day-1 to day-15, level consciousness(Glasgow Coma Scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation
      Scale), delirium (Confusion Assessment Method For Intensive Care Unit), reoccurrence of
      seizure, vital signs, organ dysfunction (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential
      Organ Failure) will be daily assessed.

      At day 2, the preventive oral anti-epileptic drug will be prescribed by a neurologist,
      blinded from randomization.

      At Day 15 and Day 30, neurological status, cognitive functions (Mini Mental State
      Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery, Glasgow Outcome Scale), and quality of life (SF36)
      will be assessed by a neurologist, also not aware of the randomization.

      The number of patients alive and discharged from Hospital day 15 15th day will assessed.

      300 patients with GCSE will be randomized, 150 in each arm, in 16 ICUs and over a period of 3
      years.
