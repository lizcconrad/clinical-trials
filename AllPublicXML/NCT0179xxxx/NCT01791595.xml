  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose that can be given
      safely to patients, the potential side effects of the drug and how they can be managed and
      what happens to AZD3965 inside the body.

      AZD3965 is a type of drug called a monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitor which is being
      used to stop the growth of cancer cells and kill cancer cells by blocking the action of one
      of the proteins involved in moving chemical compounds in and out of the cells of the body.
      This will be the first time that this type of drug has been given to patients.

      The drug is a capsule and is taken daily. The study is in two parts. In Part 1, small groups
      of patients will be treated at increasing doses to find the highest safe dose and best dose
      to give to patients in Part 2 of the study. Approximately 18 patients with advanced solid
      tumours or lymphomas will be treated in this part.

      In Part 2, the dose found to be safe in Part 1 will be given to three groups of patients with
      either prostate cancer, gastric cancer or diffuse large B cell lymphoma. 15 patients will be
      treated in each group.

      Patients will need to visit the hospital weekly for two months and then every fortnight.
      Patients will have regular blood and urine tests, scans, heart traces and eye tests amongst
      other clinical tests. Research blood samples will also be taken to look at what happens to
      the drug inside the body. Treatment will continue until a patient's cancer starts growing but
      can continue for up to a maximum of 12 months if the cancer is responding to the drug. It is
      important to explain that this is the first study of this drug and patients will have
      advanced cancer so it is unlikely that patients will benefit directly from taking part but
      the study may help improve future treatment of cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 will follow a rolling six dose escalation schedule of AZD3965 until a tolerated dose
      at which MCT1 is inhibited (as measured by at least a four-fold change relative to baseline
      in peak lactate levels in PBMCs) and/or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined.

      Approximately 36 patients with advanced solid tumours or lymphoma will be entered into Part
      1. The final number will depend on the number of dose escalations required to reach MTD or
      the tolerated dose at which MCT1 is inhibited. A recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be
      proposed from the safety, pharmacokinetic, and proof of mechanism of lactate transport
      inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) results from Part 1.

      All patients in Part 2 will be treated at this RP2D to further explore the tolerability of
      this dose and schedule and to explore proof of principle of MCT1 inhibition in tumour types
      that were shown to express MCT1 (prostate) or in which AZD3965 showed some effect
      pre-clinically (gastric and diffuse large B cell lymphoma).

             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of AZD3965. Participation in an observational

             good candidate for the clinical trial.

             treated cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell
