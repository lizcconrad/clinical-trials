  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of a new device called an
      Intramural Needle Ablation Catheter (INA catheter). The INA catheter is used for locating and
      ablating ventricular arrhythmias that have failed standard radiofrequency ablation. This
      approach is desirable because some people have ventricular arrhythmias that originate deep
      within the heart muscle where it is not abolished by ablation with standard catheters.

      The investigators seek to determine whether the INA catheter can potentially help people who
      have ventricular arrhythmias that have failed standard radiofrequency ablation. The
      investigators also want to determine if it is likely to be safe, without excessive side
      effects.

    <description>Defined as termination of at least one clinical or presumptive clinical monomorphic VT by Radiofrequency ablation and/or rendering that VT no longer inducible. It is recognized that this secondary efficacy endpoint will not be assessed in all patients because VT induction will not be attempted in patients in whom, in the judgment of the investigator, attempted VT induction imposes unwarranted risk of hemodynamic deterioration. A clinical or presumptive clinical VT is one that has been documented to occur spontaneously, or is within 20 ms in cycle length of a VT that has been documented to occur spontaneously.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or incessant ventricular arrhythmia (defined as &gt;20% of
        beats due to ventricular arrhythmia including unifocal premature ventricular contractions
        (PVCs ), couplets, nonsustained VT) that is causing a decline in LV ejection fraction to
        less than 40%

        Arrhythmia meet the following criteria:

          1. Ventricular arrhythmia is recurrent and symptomatic

          2. prior antiarrhythmic drug therapy has failed due to recurrent ventricular arrythmia,
             toxicity, or intolerance

               -  Age 18 or older

               -  Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction &gt; 10% as estimated by echocardiography or
                  contrast ventriculography within the previous 90 days

               -  Failed prior VT or PVC ablation due to spontaneous recurrence of the arrhythmia
                  or frequent PVCs.

               -  Able and willing to comply with all pre-, post-, and follow-up testing and
                  requirements

               -  Signed Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with idiopathic VT defined as VT that originates from a region without
             evidence of scar detected by MRI or voltage mapping in a patient without other
             evidence of heart disease that is not causing significant depression of ventricular
             function.

          -  Definite protruding left ventricular thrombus on pre-ablation echocardiography when LV
             ablation is required.

          -  Thrombotic myocardial infarction within the preceding two (2) months.

          -  Other disease process that is likely to limit survival to less than 12 months.

          -  Class IV heart failure, unless heart failure is due to frequent or incessant VT.

          -  Contraindication to heparin.

          -  Allergy to radiographic contrast dye.

          -  Severe aortic stenosis

          -  Severe mitral regurgitation with a flail mitral valve leaflet.

          -  Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the principal
             investigator would preclude enrollment into the study.

          -  Enrolled in another investigational study evaluating a drug or device.

          -  Unstable angina that is not due to frequent or incessant VT.

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 50,000) or coagulopathy.

          -  Acute non-cardiovascular illness or systemic infection.

          -  Cardiogenic shock unless it is due to incessant VT
