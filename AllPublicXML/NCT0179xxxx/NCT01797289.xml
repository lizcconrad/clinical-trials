  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients consecutively referred with the first episode of transient and short-lasting
      loss of consciousness will have a diagnostic workup for the assessment of the most common
      causes of syncope, and will be evaluated for the presence of pulmonary embolism (PE) with the
      use of an internationally accepted algorithm including a pre-test clinical probability (PTP
      according to the method of Wells et al.) and a high-sensitivity quantitative D-dimer assay.
      If the PTP is low and D-dimer negative, PE will be excluded. All other patients will undergo
      confirmatory diagnostic tests (either computerized tomography or ventilation/perfusion lung
      scanning) in order to confirm or rule out the presence of PE.
