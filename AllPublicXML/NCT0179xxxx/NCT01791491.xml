  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well adolescent kidney transplant patients
      tolerate a single dose of belatacept they receive at least 6 months after transplant surgery,
      and how their body handles the drug.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Death, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Treatment-related Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of First Dose to 24 weeks post the last dose; approximately 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Death was a fatal event leading to permanent cessations of all vital functions of the body. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Adverse event (AE) defined: any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. Treatment related=having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Positive Belatacept-induced Immunogenicity Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Day 1, Days 15, 29, and 57</time_frame>
    <description>Serum samples were analyzed for anti-belatacept antibodies using a validated homogenous bridging assay. The assay followed a tiered approach consistent with health authority guidance: tier 1 for screening ADA responses, tier 2 for confirming drug specificity of the ADA-positive responses, and tier 3 for titer. A neutralizing antibody assay was used to test those samples positive to the LEA29Y portion of the molecule in tier 2 and for which drug concentrations are =&gt;1 μg/mL. Lack of immunogenicity was defined as the absence of a positive response.</description>

        <title>Total Body Clearance (CLT) of Belatacept</title>
        <description>CLT was the volume of abatacept cleared by the system, normalized by baseline body weight. Serum samples were analyzed for abatacept by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were obtained at: pre-dose (0 hours), 0.5 and 2 hours from Start of Infusion on Day 1, Day 29, and Day 57. The results were summarized. The lower limit of assay quantitation (LLOQ) was set to &quot;zero&quot; which was 0.003 micrograms per milliliter (ug/mL). CLT was measured in milliliters per hours per kilogram of body weight (mL/h/kg).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Positive Belatacept-induced Immunogenicity Response</title>
        <description>Serum samples were analyzed for anti-belatacept antibodies using a validated homogenous bridging assay. The assay followed a tiered approach consistent with health authority guidance: tier 1 for screening ADA responses, tier 2 for confirming drug specificity of the ADA-positive responses, and tier 3 for titer. A neutralizing antibody assay was used to test those samples positive to the LEA29Y portion of the molecule in tier 2 and for which drug concentrations are =&gt;1 μg/mL. Lack of immunogenicity was defined as the absence of a positive response.</description>
