  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug NULOJIX® (belatacept) will minimize the
      amount of other anti-rejection medications necessary and thereby reduce the long-term side
      effects caused by the other medications. The researchers also want to learn more about the
      safety of this treatment and long term health of transplanted pancreases and kidneys.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune systems
      (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new organs. Most
      patients who receive a transplanted organ must take these anti-rejection medications for the
      rest of their lives, or for as long as the transplanted organ continues to work. Taking
      standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects, including
      pancreas and kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection
      medications that work just as well, but could lessen the amount of anti-rejection medications
      that are taken long term.

          <description>Induction: Methylprednisolone (MEDROL) was administered at a dose of 500 mg on the day of transplant, and tapered to 250 mg on day 1, 125 mg on day 2, 60 mg on day 3, 30 mg on day 4, and 0 mg on day 5. A target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days of Thymoglobulin was administered via intravenous infusion. Maintenance: Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 5, 14, 28, 56, and 84. After 84 days participants received 5 mg/kg every 4 weeks until the completion of the trial. Site investigator determined the initial dose of tacrolimus (tac) started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 5-8 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks, and adjusted to 3-5 ng/ml until week 40. If eligible, at week 40 tac withdrawal was initiated over a 4-8 week period. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.</description>

A target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days of Thymoglobulin was administered via intravenous infusion. Maintenance: Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 5, 14, 28, 56, and 84. After 84 days participants received 5 mg/kg every 4 weeks until the completion of the trial. Site investigator determined the initial dose of tacrolimus (tac) started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 5-8 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks, and adjusted to 3-5 ng/ml until week 40. If eligible, at week 40 tac withdrawal was initiated over a 4-8 week period. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.</description>

        <title>Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) From Baseline (Pre-Transplant) Through Wk 52 Post-Transplant</title>
        <description>Fasting blood sugar (e.g., glucose) test is used to help diagnose diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes.
Reference fasting blood sugar (glucose) values:
70 to 99 mg/dL is normal
100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes
126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests is considered diabetes.</description>

            <description>Induction: Methylprednisolone (MEDROL) was administered at a dose of 500 mg on the day of transplant, and tapered to 250 mg on day 1, 125 mg on day 2, 60 mg on day 3, 30 mg on day 4, and 0 mg on day 5. A target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days of Thymoglobulin was administered via intravenous infusion. Maintenance: Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 5, 14, 28, 56, and 84. After 84 days participants received 5 mg/kg every 4 weeks until the completion of the trial. Site investigator determined the initial dose of tacrolimus (tac) started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 5-8 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks, and adjusted to 3-5 ng/ml until week 40. If eligible, at week 40 tac withdrawal was initiated over a 4-8 week period. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.</description>

        <title>Standardized Blood Pressure Measurement From Baseline (Pre-Transplant) Through Wk 52 Post-Transplant</title>
        <description>A blood pressure measurement consists of two numbers: the systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels when the heart beats. Diastolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels between beats of the heart.
Systolic measures of &lt;120 and diastolic measures of &lt;80 are considered normal.
Systolic measures of 120-139 and diastolic measures of 80-89 are considered at risk (or pre-hypertension).
Systolic measures of ≥140 and diastolic measures of ≥90 are considered high.</description>

A target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days of Thymoglobulin was administered via intravenous infusion. Maintenance: Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 5, 14, 28, 56, and 84. After 84 days participants received 5 mg/kg every 4 weeks until the completion of the trial. Site investigator determined the initial dose of tacrolimus (tac) started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 5-8 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks, and adjusted to 3-5 ng/ml until week 40. If eligible, at week 40 tac withdrawal was initiated over a 4-8 week period. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.</description>

          <title>Standardized Blood Pressure Measurement From Baseline (Pre-Transplant) Through Wk 52 Post-Transplant</title>
          <description>A blood pressure measurement consists of two numbers: the systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels when the heart beats. Diastolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels between beats of the heart.
Systolic measures of &lt;120 and diastolic measures of &lt;80 are considered normal.
Systolic measures of 120-139 and diastolic measures of 80-89 are considered at risk (or pre-hypertension).
Systolic measures of ≥140 and diastolic measures of ≥90 are considered high.</description>

        <title>Lipid Profile at Wk 52 Post-Transplant</title>
        <description>A fasting lipid profiles measures total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. These measurements are used in assessing one's risk of cardiovascular disease. Target ranges for each of these measures are provided:
Total cholesterol: 75-169 mg/dL if age ≤ 20; 100-199 mg/dL if age ≥ 21; high values indicate risk of cardiovascular disease
LDL cholesterol: &lt;70 mg/dL for people with documented cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome; &lt;100 mg/dL for people considered high risk for cardiovascular disease; &lt;130 mg/dL for people considered low risk for cardiovascular disease; high values indicate risk of cardiovascular disease
HDL cholesterol: 40mg/dL and higher; high values indicate reduced risk of cardiovascular disease
Non-HDL cholesterol: 30 mg/dL above the target value for LDL cholesterol; high values indicate risk of cardiovascular disease and
Triglycerides: &lt;150 mg/dL; high values indicate risk of cardiovascular disease.</description>

        <description>Participants are stratified by kidney biopsy results/treatment received.
In the event of a for cause renal (kidney) biopsy:
-The diagnosis of acute cellular rejection (ACR) using the Banff 2007 renal allograft pathology criteria. These criteria for renal allograft biopsies is an international histopathological classification standard. ACR is defined by a renal biopsy demonstrating a Banff 2007 classification of Grade IA or greater, with higher scores indicating more severe rejection. (Ref: Solez K, Colvin RB et al. Banff 07 classification of renal allograft pathology: updates and future directions. Am J Transplant 2008 8(4): 753-60).

            <description>Induction: 500 mg of MEDROL was administered on the day of transplant, and tapered to 250 mg on day 1, 125 mg on day 2, 60 mg on day 3, 30 mg on day 4, and 0 mg on day 5. A target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days of Thymoglobulin was administered via intravenous infusion. Maintenance: Site investigator determined the initial dose of tacrolimus (tac) that started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 8-12 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks, and adjusted to 5-8 ng/ml thereafter. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.</description>

          <title>Type of Treatment(s) Participants Received for Biopsy-Proven Renal Allograft Rejection During the First 52 Weeks Post-Transplant</title>
          <description>Participants are stratified by kidney biopsy results/treatment received.
In the event of a for cause renal (kidney) biopsy:
-The diagnosis of acute cellular rejection (ACR) using the Banff 2007 renal allograft pathology criteria. These criteria for renal allograft biopsies is an international histopathological classification standard. ACR is defined by a renal biopsy demonstrating a Banff 2007 classification of Grade IA or greater, with higher scores indicating more severe rejection. (Ref: Solez K, Colvin RB et al. Banff 07 classification of renal allograft pathology: updates and future directions. Am J Transplant 2008 8(4): 753-60).

A target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days of Thymoglobulin was administered via intravenous infusion. Maintenance: Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 5, 14, 28, 56, and 84. After 84 days participants received 5 mg/kg every 4 weeks until the completion of the trial. Site investigator determined the initial dose of tacrolimus (tac) started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 5-8 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks, and adjusted to 3-5 ng/ml until week 40. If eligible, at week 40 tac withdrawal was initiated over a 4-8 week period. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.</description>

          <title>Type of Treatment(s) Participants Received for Biopsy-Proven Pancreatic Allograft Rejection During the First 52 Weeks Post-Transplant</title>
          <description>Participants are stratified by kidney biopsy results/treatment received.
Upon having a for-cause biopsy performed, persons often receive treatment for rejection based on the biopsy results, which may or may not reveal signs of rejection. Details of biopsy findings and corresponding treatment are provided for each instance of treatment for rejection.
Results summary format: biopsy results; treatment.

        <description>This measure counts death, graft loss, or undetectable C-peptide value (e.g., C-peptide &lt;0.3 ng/mL) occurring at any point post-transplant and independent of each other.
Kidney Graft Loss was defined as 90 consecutive days of dialysis dependency.
Pancreas graft loss was defined as returning to exogenous insulin therapy or initiation of oral hypoglycemic agents for greater than 30 days.
Factitious hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin administration results in elevated serum insulin levels and low or undetectable C-peptide levels.</description>
