          2. Male or female, 12 to 40 years of age, inclusive.

          3. Definite clinical diagnosis of facial acne vulgaris with an inflammatory lesion
             (papules and pustules) count between 20 and 50 and a non-inflammatory (open and closed
             comedones) lesion count between 25 and 100 and no more than 2 nodulocystic lesions
             (i.e., nodules and cysts) including those present on the nose.

          4. Baseline Investigator's Global Assessment Score of 3 (moderate severity) or 4 (severe)
             on a severity scale of 0 to 4.

          5. Willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, apply
             the medication as instructed, refrain from use of all other topical acne medication or
             topical antibiotics during the 12-week treatment period, return for the required
             treatment period visits, comply with therapy prohibitions, and are able to complete
             the study.

          6. In general good health and free from any clinically significant disease, other than
             acne vulgaris, that might interfere with the study evaluations.

          7. Females of childbearing potential (excluding women who are surgically sterilized or
             post menopausal for at least 2 years), in addition to having a negative urine
             pregnancy test, must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control during the
             study. For the purpose of this study, the following are considered acceptable methods
             of birth control: Oral Contraceptives, Contraceptive patches, Contraceptive Injection

             abstinence with a documented second acceptable method of birth control should subject
             become sexually active. A sterile sexual partner is not considered an adequate form of
             birth control. Subjects entering the trial that are on hormonal contraceptives must
             have been on this method for at least 3 months (90 days) prior to the trial and
             continue the method for the duration of the trial. Subjects who had used hormonal
             contraception and stopped must have stopped no less than 3 months (90 days) prior to
             baseline.

          5. History or presence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, regional enteritis, or
             antibiotic-associated colitis.

          6. Use of neuromuscular blocking agents (nondepolarizing agents and depolarizing agents)

             carcinoma, eczema, acneform eruptions caused by medications, steroid acne, steroid
             folliculitis, or bacterial folliculitis).
