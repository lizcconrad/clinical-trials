  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main hypothesis on the present study is that new parameters such as risk-taking behavior,
      patients motivation, health related quality of life, new biomarkers and more precise
      echocardiography measures in addition to traditional parameters will improve pre-operative
      risk assessment in patients with AS and better guide patients and doctors in decision whether
      to operate or not.

      Patients referred for surgery are included thorough reading referral letter. Data collected
      in the study wil be compared with data from Medical records and clinical examination.

      Data entered will be controlled by two investigators.

      Data wil be compared to national norms and from result of other studies.
