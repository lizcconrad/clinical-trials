      The overall goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a community-level, structured
      approach to enhance HIV care access and retention for drug users in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
      The &quot;Enhanced HIV Care Access and Retention Intervention&quot; will: 1) identify drug users living
      with HIV who either do not know their HIV status and/or are not engaged in HIV care; 2)
      provide direct HIV care services through a mobile health van; and 3) support identified
      HIV-infected drug users with patient navigators to enhance their ability to engage in HIV
      care and substance abuse treatment, to initiate antiretroviral therapy, and maintain
      adherence to their treatment regimens. The structural enhanced care approach will be
      evaluated through a randomized roll-out design, a refinement of the stepped-wedge design. The
      community-level success of the intervention will be assessed by evaluating virologic
      suppression (primary biological outcome), increased attendance to HIV care visits, uptake of
      antiretroviral therapy, adherence to HIV treatment regimens, and decreased substance use (as
      secondary behavioral outcomes) in an independent cohort of HIV-positive individuals drawn
      from each of the neighborhoods included in the intervention. We will also evaluate the
      implementation process and cost of the enhanced care approach including implications for
      cost-effectiveness, feasibility of expansion, and sustainability.

      Study Design

      The overall goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a community-level, structured
      approach, the &quot;Enhanced HIV Care Access and Retention Intervention&quot; for drug users in San
      Juan, Puerto Rico. It will bring HIV care directly to five San Juan neighborhoods in which a
      high proportion of HIV-positive injection drug users (IDUs) reside. The enhanced care
      intervention is comprised of 4 components: A) a neighborhood-level HIV Testing Campaign to
      identify HIV-positive drug users who are not aware of their HIV status, B) a Treatment
      Re-engagement Campaign using patient navigators for out-of-care HIV-positive IDUs, C) a
      Patient Navigator Linkage to Care and Substance Abuse Treatment team for both newly diagnosed
      and out of care HIV-positive IDUs and D) a Mobile HIV Care Clinic staffed by HIV clinicians
      to facilitate linkage into and retention in care. The intervention will be evaluated using a
      randomized roll-out design, a refinement of the stepped-wedge design.

      The intervention will be rolled-out at 6-month intervals in each of the five neighborhoods.
      The order in which neighborhoods will receive the intervention will be determined randomly.
      Once a neighborhood begins to receive the intervention, it will continue receiving the
      intervention throughout the remaining period of the study. The number of individuals served
      by the intervention who enter into care, their appointment adherence, viral loads and health
      service and substance abuse treatment utilization will be documented. The success of the
      intervention will be determined by examining the proportion of virologic suppression over
      time in an independent assessment cohort of approximately 400 HIV-positive drug-using
      individuals drawn from the five neighborhoods included in the intervention. The primary
      evaluation outcomes of this study are to see whether the intense saturation of our
      intervention results in persons in the assessment cohort being offered and receiving
      intervention services and the impact on their viral load.

      Assessment Cohort

      Exposure to the intervention will be evaluated by the assessment cohort as the intervention
      strategy is rolled out in each of the 5 intervention neighborhoods. Eligible participants
      (defined below) will be scheduled for a baseline appointment, and asked to bring
      documentation of their HIV status if available. At the baseline visit, participants will: 1)
      review and sign the consent form; 2) complete a rapid HIV test; 3) provide blood to assess
      CBC (including CD4 and plasma HIV RNA; and 4) complete a behavioral assessment using an audio
      computer assisted interview (ACASI). Participants recruited into the assessment cohort will
      be counseled on the importance of HIV care and risk reduction practices following existing
      standards within Puerto Rico. At the end of the baseline visit, participants will be
      compensated for their time and travel costs and reminded about the next scheduled visit in
      six month's time. Participants will then be followed at six month intervals for a period of
      30 months (and 36 months for neighborhood 5). At each assessment points they will be asked to
      complete the behavioral assessment using an ACASI and to have their blood drawn for CD4 and
      viral load.

In addition to these intervention components, study participants will receive screening and access to treatment for other physical and mental co-morbidities, general primary health care, and social/psychosocial services addressing unstable housing, food insecurity, interpersonal violence, legal issues. All HIV-positive IDUs identified either through the HIV Testing Campaign or the Treatment Re-engagement Campaign will be enrolled in the HIV Care Cohort. The HIV Care Cohort will be comprised of the HIV-positive injectors who are receiving direct services in the Mobile Care Clinic. The 4 intervention components are detailed below:</description>

    <description>When the intervention is initiated in a neighborhood, HIV rapid testing will begin and continue in a particular neighborhood from the time that the neighborhood's intervention begins until the end of the study period.

    <description>Simultaneously with the introduction of the HIV Testing Campaign, a patient navigator team will approach HIV-positive IDUs identified as not having seen their HIV care provider in the last 6 months. In addition, known HIV-positive IDUs within the designated neighborhoods will be approached for service enrollment and meet with a patient navigator.</description>

    <description>The patient navigator team will provide informational support to the HIV-positive injectors, motivate them to attend HIV care visits and engage in substance abuse treatment, encourage their use of and adherence to antiretroviral therapies, and work with them to overcome any barriers to attendance at HIV care visits and substance abuse treatment. All clients of the patient navigator will become part of the HIV Care Cohort; they will have been identified either in the HIV Testing Campaign or the Treatment Re-Engagement Campaign.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mobile Care Clinic</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants who choose to receive services in the study mobile HIV care clinic will receive an initial appointment and the patient navigator will ensure that the client attends it. At the initial visit, clients will have a medical history taken, be examined and have blood drawn to measure CD4 and viral load. The mobile care clinic doctor will also prescribe medications for the client at the subsequent visit which will be scheduled as soon as lab results are available and interpreted, approximately one week later. The mobile HIV care clinic van will provide health services to the general IDU population within each intervention neighborhood to avoid any stigmatization of the HIV positive clients.</description>
