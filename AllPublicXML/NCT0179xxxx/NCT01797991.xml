  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, unicentric, two-arm, parallel, controlled, and double
      blind pilot study.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a trial designed to compare
      the quality of life of patients taking dexamethasone in two different ways to prevent
      hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel.

      Dexamethasone given intravenously (IV) 30 minutes before paclitaxel could improve quality of
      life, could adequately prevent hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel and could reduce
      adverse effects compared to dexamethasone given orally 12 hours and 6 hours before
      paclitaxel.

      Primary objective:

      To assess the feasibility of a randomized, parallel, two-arm, controlled and double blind
      trial designed to compare the quality of life of patients taking dexamethasone 20 mg IV 30
      minutes before paclitaxel with those taking a standard dose of dexamethasone, 20 mg orally 12
      hours and 6 hours before paclitaxel, in patients taking paclitaxel every two to three weeks
      for a minimum of two cycles in order to estimate a sample size.

      Secondary objectives:

      Between the two study groups, to compare:

        -  Quality of life during the first two cycles of chemotherapy;

        -  Efficacy of dexamethasone in preventing acute hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel
           in the first two cycles of chemotherapy;

        -  Adverse effects associated with dexamethasone on a daily basis during the first seven
           days of the first two cycles of chemotherapy.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups.
