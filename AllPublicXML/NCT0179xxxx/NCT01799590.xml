    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topiramate in
      participants with migraine (type of severe headache that occurs periodically and is often
      associated with nausea, vomiting and constipation or diarrhea) who completed the
      JNS019-JPN-02 study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter
      (conducted in more than one center), dose-titration (dose escalation/reduction) study of
      topiramate in participants with migraine. This study is a continuous study for the
      participants who were enrolled in the JNS019-JPN-02 study. Participants who completed the
      JNS019-JPN-02 study will receive treatment for 52 weeks starting at Visit 4 of the
      JNS019-JPN-02 study. The present study will consist of 3 weeks of Transfer period (during
      this period the dose titration will take place and along with dose titration the new
      treatment will be initiated at 25 milligram per day [25mg/day]), Continuous treatment period
      (32 weeks), Exit period (up to 3 weeks) and Follow-up period (4 weeks). Participants in the
      Continuous treatment period will receive topiramate tablets orally in the dose range of 50
      mg/day to 100 mg/day. Dose can be increased or decreased as per Investigator's discretion.
      The maximum daily dose will be 200 mg/day. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by change
      from Baseline in the number of monthly migraine attacks in Continuous treatment period.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (28 days before randomization) and Continuous treatment period (Day 1 up to Day 225)</time_frame>
    <description>As per 24-hour rule, if symptom of pain because of migraine continues for more than 24 hours, it should be considered as 2 or more migraine attacks considering the maximum duration up to 24 hours. If interval between the latest migraine attack (ending time) and previous migraine attack (onset time) was less than 24 hours, 2 migraine attacks were considered as 1 migraine attack. If the onset of the migraine was prevented by a rescue drug it was considered as 1 migraine attack even if the aura had started.</description>

    <description>Migraine headache day was defined as a calendar day with any occurrence of migraine headache pain of at least 30 minutes in duration. Average was calculated as total number of monthly headache days divided by total number of days of assessment and multiplied by 28, where a month was considered to last 28 days.</description>

    <description>Migraine has 2 major subtypes: migraine without aura (minimum 5 attacks of headache lasting for 4-72 hours, has 2 of these characteristics [unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity] and either nausea/vomiting or photophobia and phonophobia) and migraine with aura (2 attacks of headache with typical aura with migraine headache or typical aura with non-migraine headache or typical aura without headache or familial hemiplegic migraine or sporadic hemiplegic migraine or basilar-type migraine).</description>

    <description>Responders were defined as participants who had a 50 percent or more reduction in frequency of migraine attacks. Migraine is common disabling headache disorder with 2 subtypes: migraine without aura (at least 5 attacks lasting 4-72 hours with at least 2 characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate/severe pain or aggravation by/causing avoidance of routine physical activity and either nausea/vomiting or photophobia and phonophobia) and migraine with aura (attack with reversible focal neurological symptoms that develop over 5-20 minutes and last for less than 60 minutes).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Number of Migraine Attacks as Per 24-hour Rule Over Day 197 to Day 225 in Continuous Treatment Period</title>
          <description>As per 24-hour rule, if symptom of pain because of migraine continues for more than 24 hours, it should be considered as 2 or more migraine attacks considering the maximum duration up to 24 hours. If interval between the latest migraine attack (ending time) and previous migraine attack (onset time) is less than 24 hours, 2 migraine attacks were considered as 1 migraine attack. If the onset of the migraine was prevented by a rescue drug it was considered as 1 migraine attack even if the aura had started.</description>
