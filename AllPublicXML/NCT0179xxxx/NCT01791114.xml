  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent findings document the presence of active brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans. Cold
      exposure via adrenergic stimulation activates BAT, which combusts significant amounts of
      blood glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) to produce heat. Animal studies suggest that BAT
      activation improves insulin sensitivity. However, the effect of cold-induced BAT activation
      on insulin sensitivity and glucose kinetics in humans remains unknown. The investigators'
      central hypothesis is that cold-induced BAT activation increases whole body insulin
      sensitivity in humans via augmented plasma glucose and FFA clearance. The specific aims of
      this study are to define the effects of prolonged (8h) cold exposure BAT activation on:
      insulin sensitivity (Aim 1); lipolysis and plasma glucose and FFA kinetics (Aim 2); on
      thermoregulation (Aim 3). Moreover, the investigators plan to investigate for alternative
      ways, which can activate BAT including cold water ingestion, a single meal ingestion, and a
      single bout of moderate intensity exercise (Aim 4). For the cold exposure study, subjects
      will complete 3 trials: a) 8hrs of cold exposure at their individually determined shivering
      threshold; b) 8hrs of cold exposure at their individually determined shivering threshold plus
      propranolol; c) 8hrs in thermoneutral conditions (26 - 28°C). For the rest of the arms of
      subjects will complete two trials: cold or tepid water ingestion, a single meal ingestion or
      no food ingestion, and a single bout of moderate intensity exercise or no exercise.To study
      the above aims, the investigators will use positron emission tomography - computed
      tomography, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, infusion of stable isotopes, and tissue
      biopsies. The findings will illuminate the role of BAT on plasma substrate regulation and
      insulin sensitivity and may aid in the development of lifestyle recommendations and
      pharmacotherapy for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and insulin resistance.

Specifically, a primed, constant 4hr infusion of 6,6-D2-glucose to assess glucose kinetics; b) a constant 4hr infusion of potassium uniformly labelled with carbon 13 [U-13C16] palmitate to assess FFA kinetics (27, 28); and c) a primed, constant, 4hr infusion of [1,1,2,3,3-2H5]glycerol dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution, to assess whole body lipolysis , and) a bolus of labeled with carbon13 sodium bicarbonate(NaHCO3) dissolved in 09% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution to assess substrate oxidation.</description>

    <description>We will use a telemetric pill and wireless thermistors to monitor the body core and skin temperatures of the participants. Moreover, thermal sensation will be assessed using a visual analog scale of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers. Heart rate and blood pressure will be also measured to assess the cardiovascular response to cold exposure.</description>

    <description>For the cold exposure trial, the subjects will follow an individualized cold exposure protocol maximize the elicited non-shivering thermogenesis. Subjects will be wearing liquid conditioned garments (Polar Products Inc, Stow, OH). The temperature will initially be set at 18°C, then decreased at 1 degree celsius intervals thought the air- conditioned temperature control bath until subjects report shivering. Electromyography (EMG; Delsys, Bagnoli 8, Boston, MA) will be performed continuously to verify shivering muscle activity. Upon shivering, the temperature will be increased by 1degree Celsius intervals until shivering resides. Subjects' core temperature will be measured at 10-second intervals with the use of a telemetric pill (Core Temp Inc., Palmetto, FL).</description>

    <intervention_name>Cold exposure plus propranolol</intervention_name>
    <description>For the cold exposure plus propanol trial, temperature will be titrated as previously described. The non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (0.5mg/kg and up to 40) will be given orally before the beginning of the study and again after 4-6 hours. In case participant's heart rate after propranolol administration decreases below 50 beats per min or systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg second dose of propranolol will not be administered. Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored continuously throughout the study. Propranolol doses up to 80 mg have been shown to significantly reduce fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in brown fat in clinical patients.</description>
