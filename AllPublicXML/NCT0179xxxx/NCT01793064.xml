  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an adaptive shaping intervention based
      on Behavioral Economics and Operant principles to promote physical activity behaviors
      (adaptive group) and compare to a static physical activity intervention (static group) using
      a two-group randomized controlled trial design. Participants will include 20 overweight men
      and women (BMI 25-35 kg/m2) between 18 to 55 years. Both groups will receive the following
      components: 1) a pedometer, 2) self-monitoring of physical activity, 3) brief educational
      materials, 4) motivational prompts, 5) physical activity goals, and 6) small financial
      incentives. The Adaptive Intervention (AI) group will receive adaptive goals and feedback
      based on percentiles and a &quot;moving&quot; window of their recent physical activity, with incentives
      linked to goal attainment. Comparison intervention participants will receive the static
      10,000 steps per day goal, with matching incentive amounts but without incentives linked to
      goal attainment. The study will compare differences in goal setting and shaping procedures
      that aim to increase physical activity behavior.

      Primary aims include:

        1. To determine whether physical activity (pedometer-measured steps/day) in both the
           Adaptive and Static interventions increased compared to their respective baselines.
           Hypothesis: Both the adaptive and static interventions will result in increased physical
           activity over 6 months.

        2. To evaluate whether the Adaptive Intervention results in greater change in physical
           activity (pedometer-measured steps/day) compared to the Static Intervention. Hypothesis:
           The adaptive intervention will result in significantly greater physical activity,
           measured by pedometer, compared to the static intervention over 6 months.

        3. To assess participants' satisfaction with the overall program. Hypothesis: Adaptive
           Intervention participants will report greater overall satisfaction with the intervention
           than the Static Intervention participants.

    <description>At the end of the intervention phase, participants completed a satisfaction interview to rate on Likert-type scales and open-ended questions how motivating or burdensome specific study components were to them, their overall satisfaction with the study, personal experience with the intervention, any side effects or injuries, and their recommendations for improvement.</description>
