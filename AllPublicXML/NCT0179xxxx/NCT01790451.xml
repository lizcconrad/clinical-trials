  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 16 patients with confirmed low- or intermediate risk prostate cancer scheduled for a
      radical prostatectomy will be asked to have the Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) procedure
      approximately 30 days prior to the prostatectomy. Ablation with IRE will be performed using
      similar planning criteria, procedure protocol, instruments and software used for
      brachytherapy, a conventional targeted radiation therapy where radioactive seeds are
      implanted into prostate tumours. Patients will have an ultrasound of the prostate and the
      imaging data will be entered into the Planning Software system. The volume of the prostate is
      measured and a specified ablation zone will be determined. The IRE will be performed under
      general anaesthetic and the specified zone identified in the planning stage will be ablated.
      Four IRE electrode needles will be placed into the prostate under ultrasound image guidance.
      When the needles are in place, electric pulses of one to two minutes duration are used to
      ablate the specified zone. The total procedure time will be approximately 1 hour. Safety data
      will be collected and patients will be followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks post IRE, pre-
      prostatectomy, post prostatectomy and 1 week post prostatectomy. The safety data collection
      is at 2 weeks post IRE. Before the IRE procedure, patients will have a Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) of the prostate. The patients will have
      their scheduled prostatectomy at approximately 30 days after the IRE procedure.
      Pre-prostatectomy, the ablation zone will be radiologically assessed by a control MRI/CEUS.
      Post prostatectomy, efficacy of ablation will be determined by histological examination of
      the prostate by the Pathology Department and measured as complete or incomplete ablation.

      The primary outcome is safety as measured by the composite of procedural device and post
      procedural adverse events, measured with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v
      4 (CTCAE), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) score, International Prostate
      Symptom Score (IPSS) or required catheterization time and International Index of Erectile
      Function (IIEF) and efficacy of ablation determined by histological examination post
      prostatectomy. Secondary outcomes will be patients procedure satisfaction measured by patient
      satisfaction questionnaire, post procedural pain management and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
      pain score, time to ambulation, length of hospital stay.
