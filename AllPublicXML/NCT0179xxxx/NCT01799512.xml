  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress hyperglycemia occurs in 50-85% of patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit
      (MICU) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, randomized
      controlled trials examining the effects of strict glycemic control demonstrated conflicting
      results. A common finding in these trials was the high risk of hypoglycaemia.

      This randomized controlled trial evaluates the impact of real-time continuous glucose
      monitoring (RT-CGM) on glycemic control and risk of hypoglycemia in severely ill MICU
      patients with an APACHE-II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score ≥20.

    <description>real-time continuous glucose monitoring: Use will be made of the online real-time (RT) monitoring facility of the GlucoDay® (a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)system). This will allow immediate adaptation of the insulin dose in order to maintain values within an optimal range.
The same IV insulin infusion protocol will be used in the experimental and the active comparator group (adapted Yale protocol).
When glycaemic changes of &gt;25 mg/dl per 30 minutes are observed from the RT-CGM - GlucoDay data, this will be checked by measuring arterial blood glucose and the insulin infusion rate will be adapted according to the adapted Yale protocol.</description>

    <description>In the active comparator group the same continuous glucose monitoring device (GlucoDay) will be used in a blinded fashion. Glucose data will be analysed retrospectively.
