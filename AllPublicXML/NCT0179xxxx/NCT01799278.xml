  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the response rate of MLN8237 in patients with histologically
      confirmed or clinically suspected metastatic neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). MLN8237
      is an orally administered Aurora kinase A inhibitor that has demonstrated broad antitumor
      activity in vitro and in vivo. In preclinical models, aurora kinase inhibition resulted in
      dramatic and preferential anti-tumor activity in NEPC with suppression of neuroendocrine
      marker expression.

      This is a multi-institutional single-arm, open-label Phase 2 trial evaluating MLN8237 in
      patients with histologically confirmed or clinically suspected metastatic neuroendocrine
      prostate cancer. Subjects will be treated with MLN8237 at 50 mg twice daily for 7 days
      repeated every 21 days. Individual dose reductions will be made on the basis of the AEs
      observed. Therapy will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity as a result
      of MLN8237, or withdrawal of patient consent. Patients will be followed with history,
      physical, and blood tests at each visit to monitor for toxicity. Response and progression
      will be evaluated by CT/MRI scan and bone scan after every 3 cycles and determined using
      RECIST v1.1. PSA and serum chromogranin A and NSE will be followed every cycle. CTC counts by
      CellSearch will be performed at baseline, at 4-6 weeks, and upon progression. Patients will
      be followed for survival endpoints following completion of this study until death.

    <description>Evaluated per RECIST 1.1 guidelines: Complete response (CR) is defined as complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable lesions by physical examination or imaging studies and normalization of PSA with no appearance of new lesions for &gt; 1 month. Partial response (PR) is defined as a 30% 56 or greater reduction in the sum longest unidimensional diameter of all measurable lesions. There may be no new lesions. Stable Disease (SD) is characterized by patients who do not meet the criteria of PR and who are without signs of progressive disease for at least 1 month. Disease Progression (DP) is defined as a greater than 20% increase in the sum longest unidimensional diameters of the indicator lesions or the appearance of new lesions. Bone scan progression (evaluable disease only) is defined by PCWG2 criteria. Per consensus guidelines in CRPC, to be considered measurable, lymph nodes need to be at least 2 cm in greatest dimension and 1.5 cm in short axis.</description>

        <description>Evaluated per RECIST 1.1 guidelines: Complete response (CR) is defined as complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable lesions by physical examination or imaging studies and normalization of PSA with no appearance of new lesions for &gt; 1 month. Partial response (PR) is defined as a 30% 56 or greater reduction in the sum longest unidimensional diameter of all measurable lesions. There may be no new lesions. Stable Disease (SD) is characterized by patients who do not meet the criteria of PR and who are without signs of progressive disease for at least 1 month. Disease Progression (DP) is defined as a greater than 20% increase in the sum longest unidimensional diameters of the indicator lesions or the appearance of new lesions. Bone scan progression (evaluable disease only) is defined by PCWG2 criteria. Per consensus guidelines in CRPC, to be considered measurable, lymph nodes need to be at least 2 cm in greatest dimension and 1.5 cm in short axis.</description>
