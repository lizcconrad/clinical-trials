  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol is intended for the clinical evaluation of fat reduction in male breasts
      (pseudogynecomastia) using the ZELTIQ Coolsculpting System. The ZELTIQ Coolsculpting system
      has received market clearance from the U.S.FDA for non-invasive fat layer reduction in the
      flanks, and is commercially available.

      Primary study endpoint is changes in the shape and reduction of the fat in the breast as
      established by photographic imaging and ultrasound imaging of the treated area.

      Secondary endpoints will provide supportive data to evaluate device performance (subject
      satisfaction &amp; fat reduction measured with ultrasound).

                  and minimal fibrous tissue.

               3. Subject has not had weight change exceeding 10 pounds in the preceding month.

               4. Subject agrees to maintain their weight (i.e., within +/- 5 pounds) by not making

               1. Subject has had a surgical procedure(s) in the area of intended treatment.

               2. Subject has had an invasive fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction or
                  mesotherapy) in the area of intended treatment.

               3. Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in
                  the area of intended treatment.

               4. Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of, subcutaneous injections
                  into the area of intended treatment (e.g., heparin, insulin) within the past
                  month.

               5. Subject has a known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, or paroxysmal
