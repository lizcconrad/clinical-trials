  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will study the effects of 12 months of therapy with ARN-509
      alone, or in combination with an LHRH agonist (LHRHa), each compared with LHRHa alone, in men
      with a rapidly rising serum PSA after prior definitive local therapy for prostate cancer. The
      endpoints selected reflect measurable short term effects of androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT), including quality of life and several metabolic parameters. In addition, the relative
      effect of each treatment strategy on PSA suppression as well as testosterone recovery (and
      subsequent PSA progression) after 12 months of therapy will be evaluated.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-P includes a 27-item &quot;core&quot; quality of life measure (FACT-G) grouped into 4 sub-scales: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. The prostate cancer-specific subscale contains an additional 12 items; 10 of which are prostate cancer specific physical problems. Items are rated on a 5-item Likert scale, from 0, &quot;not at all&quot;, to 4, &quot;very much&quot;. Total range of scores is from 0 - 156. Higher scores indicate higher degree of functioning and better quality of life.</description>

             serum testosterone level is greater than or equal to (≥)150 ng/dL
