  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the lumbar proprioception of patients with
      chronic back pain to that of healthy volunteers during low- and high-frequency muscle
      vibration.

      The order of measures (low frequency of vibration, high frequency vibration and no vibration)
      is randomized in a cross-over design.

      Patients and volunteers are matched by age and body mass index.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A-Measure the effect of low- and high-frequency vibrations on lumbar repositioning in
      patients with chronic lower back pain.

      B-Measure the effect of low- and high-frequency vibrations on lumbar repositioning in healthy
      volunteers.

      Our working hypothesis is that low frequency vibrations induce an illusion of shortening, and
      high frequency vibrations induce an illusion of elongation. The variability of the error
      should not increase.

    <description>Subjects will be seated on a table, feet dangling, blindfolded, arms crossed over the chest and held in place by bandages to minimize the visual and proprioceptive inputs that may contribute to the realization of the task.
The investigator uses an electronic goniometer to measure the maximal extension and flexion during a pelvic pivot. These measures will be used to determine a &quot;target&quot; position midway along the pelvic movement range.</description>

    <description>Propioception test: The movement required is flexion - extension of the lumbar spine without moving the shoulders; it is a pelvic rocking motion. The patients will be helped to the target position by the investigator. After keeping the target position for 5 seconds, they will be asked to completely pivot the pelvis to a forward position, then return to the target position.
Each subject will have three (non-measured) tries at the proprioception test without vibration, then three tries with low frequency vibration (20 Hertz), and then three tries with high frequency vibration (60 Hertz). Between each series of tries, a 2-minute rest period with walking is required.</description>
