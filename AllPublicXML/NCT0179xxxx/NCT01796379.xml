  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to end-stage heart failure, a patient's situation is usually greatly improved after
      a heart transplant (HTx), but the exercise capacity remains sub-normal, also long-term,
      ranging from 50 to 70% in most studies. While effective rehabilitation, including regular
      exercise, is considered an effective tool of improving health related quality of life (HRQoL)
      and prognosis of cardiac patients in general, the knowledge about and the effect of different
      rehabilitation programs among HTx recipients is limited. Exercise training is considered one
      of the most central parts in rehabilitation, but the mode of exercise used in different
      studies varies considerably. It is documented that high intensity interval training (HIT) has
      superior effects compared to training with moderate intensity in cardiac and heart failure
      patients. In contrast, HTx recipients have a denervated heart, and HIT had been considered
      unphysiological. However, the investigators have recently demonstrated highly beneficial
      effects on exercise capacity, muscle strength, body composition, reduced progression of
      cardiac allograft vasculopathy and HRQoL among long-term HTx recipients. In the present study
      the investigators want to test the hypothesis that systematic aerobic exercise with high
      intensity improve exercise capacity also in newly transplanted recipients, and secondarily
      that it gives favourable effects on the heart, peripheral circulation and a better HRQoL.
