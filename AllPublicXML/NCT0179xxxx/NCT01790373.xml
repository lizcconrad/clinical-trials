  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Suubi+Adherence is to examine the impact and cost associated with an innovative
      intervention to increase adherence to HIV treatment for HIV-infected adolescents. Multiple
      intervention studies by our team in Rakai and Masaka Districts of southern Uganda with
      AIDS-orphaned adolescents have revealed that if given an opportunity to participate in
      economic empowerment interventions, youth and their caregivers take full advantage of these
      interventions to save and invest in their future, show improvements in family financial
      outcomes, future aspirations, health functioning, sexual-risk taking behaviors, and mental
      health. The Suubi+Adherence study capitalizes on this prior work, positing that economic
      empowerment may be a missing, yet critical ingredient to HIV treatment adherence
      interventions for adolescents and young people. Suubi+Adherence incorporates an economic
      empowerment design, with a savings-led income generating component, to promote economic
      stability, and apply it to adherence to HIV treatment regimens for HIV-positive adolescents
      in a region of southern Uganda with the highest HIV incidence and prevalence in the country.

    <description>Using a series of standardized and pre-tested instruments, potential mechanisms of protective health behaviors, knowledge, and beliefs, including: 1) financial/economic stability, 2) sexual risk-taking behavior, 3) personal beliefs about HIV medication, 4) hopelessness, 5) future plans and aspirations, and 6) adherence self-efficacy, will be measured during a structured interview at baseline and at every subsequent follow-up assessment.</description>

    <description>Cost-effectiveness analyses measure the cost of achieving an agreed upon benefit, such as an additional year of schooling, employment, or a reduction in a disease. Costs will be measured on a per person basis. The costs of the intervention will include all program costs. Research costs will not be included.</description>
