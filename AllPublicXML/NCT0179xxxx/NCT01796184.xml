    <textblock>
      Background. Obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are closely associated with
      chronic inflammation characterized by abnormal cytokine production. Some authors have found
      discordances between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and other measures of glycemic control,
      suggesting that a &quot;glycation gap&quot;, defined as the difference between the HbA1c concentration
      and that predicted by the fructosamine concentration, could explain the excess
      interindividual variation in HbA1c.

      The present study was aimed to examine the association between inflammation, sociodemographic
      (age, gender) and lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and tobacco consumption), and
      common diseases. In addition, we also examine levels of blood glucose, HbA1c, fructosamine
      and &quot;glycation gap&quot; determining the prevalence of &quot;high glycators&quot; in a general adult
      population and their association with lifestyles and prevalent diseases.

      Methods. Selection of a random sample of the general adult population from a single
      municipality (A-Estrada, Pontevedra, Spain), stratified by age. The initial sampling includes
      3,500 subjects. Considering approximate 67% participation rate, the final study population
      would include more than 2,000 individuals. The standard workup includes structured
      questionnaires, skin prick test, periodontal examination, psychological tests, physical
      examination and blood determinations to allow for categorization of participants in terms of
      basic demographics, profession, education level, socioeconomic level, quality of life,
      physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption and smoking, atopy, obesity, diabetes, metabolic
      syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease. We determine blood levels
      of inflammation markers, HBA1c, fructosamine and glucose. We will collect a urine sample for
      microalbuminuria determination. In addition, blood will be drawn to be stored at the Biobank
      of our Hospital. One half of participants (~1000 individuals) will undergo continuous glucose
      monitoring. The design is cross-sectional, followed by a longitudinal study using population
      registries for the determination of events (mortality).

      Discussion. This comprehensive study in a general adult population provides an excellent
      opportunity to determine serum concentrations of inflammation and glycation markers and how
      they can vary widely with age, sex, common habits, metabolic abnormalities, and chronic
      diseases. The findings from this study should also help to find out the relationship between
      glucose profiles and HbA1c and fructosamine concentrations with diet and inflammation
      markers.

      Keywords: Inflammation, glycation, glycated hemoglobin, glycation gap, continuous glucose
      monitoring, obesity, allergy, periodontal diseases, depression, metabolic diseases.
