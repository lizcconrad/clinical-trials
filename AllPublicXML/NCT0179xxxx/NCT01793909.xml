  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the effects of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on exercise blood
      flow and muscle oxygen uptake. This study will evaluate &amp; compare exercise function during
      single leg plantar flexion exercise in a total of 45 subjects from the Denver area (15 lean
      controls, 15 people with T2DM, and 15 overweight control subjects).

      Differences between the exercise responses in people with T2DM and healthy people will help
      further identify the disease process of T2DM and direct future research of treatments and
      interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that functional exercise capacity and peak oxygen uptake (VO2) are
      reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with healthy counterparts.
      The mechanisms underlying the exercise deficit in T2DM remain largely unknown, but previous
      work has suggested that reduced exercise blood flow and impaired submaximal VO2 may be
      contributing factors. Both of these findings are consistent with a peripheral impairment of
      skeletal muscle oxygen delivery, oxygen utilization, or both. Indeed, dysfunction of skeletal
      muscle metabolism plays a key role in the pathophysiology of T2DM, and considerable work has
      described abnormalities of oxidative function in the skeletal muscle of people with T2DM.
      Given this, it is likely that the causes of exercise intolerance in T2DM may relate to
      specific defects at the level of the skeletal muscle, particularly given that skeletal muscle
      blood flow and oxidative capacity are impaired in diabetes. However, to our knowledge, no one
      has related these peripheral muscle abnormalities to the diminished exercise function in this
      patient group.

      The overarching hypothesis for the proposed research is that both a failure to adequately
      increase muscle oxygen delivery following the onset of exercise and reduced oxidative
      function of skeletal muscle contribute to the acute oxygen deficit and diminished exercise
      tolerance that has been observed in patients with T2DM.

    <description>The investigators will evaluate the dynamics of leg blood flow (and thus oxygen delivery) using Doppler ultrasound, muscle deoxygenation (O2 extraction) using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and pulmonary VO2 during single leg plantar flexion exercise to identify the predominant mechanisms of oxygen delivery versus oxygen utilization abnormalities in the muscle of T2DM during the transition from rest to exercise. These measurements will be gathered continuously for 2-5 minutes of multiple exercise bouts within two visits, one prior to the exercise intervention period and one post exercise intervention. This innovative set of experiments will be the beginning of an important link between metabolic abnormalities of T2DM and exercise capacity.</description>
