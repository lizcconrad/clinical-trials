    <textblock>
      A large proportion of frequent ED users have Medicaid insurance. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of patient navigation for reducing Emergency Department (ED)
      visits and hospitalizations and improving patient-centered outcomes (e.g., self-reported
      health status, quality of life, access/barriers to care) among Medicaid patients who are high
      utilizers of the ED, as well as to identify best practices for engaging and providing
      healthcare services to underserved patients using patient navigation. This study will address
      needs that have been identified within the New Haven community and the local healthcare
      system, contribute to knowledge and literature surrounding the use of patient navigation to
      improve care for underserved patients and improve health system efficiency, and inform the
      design and development of programs that address these needs both locally and in other
      communities.
