    <textblock>
      The propose of the study is to test the hypothesis that an eight week program consisting of
      walking exercise and social cognitive theory based group workshops will increase physical
      activity adherence six months later in older adults with type 2 diabetes or metabolic
      syndrome.

    <description>Participants will be instructed in safe walking exercise. They will participate in an eight week, tapered, on-site program. Participants will also attend group workshops where they will learn self-regulatory skills such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, barrier trouble-shooting, rewarding, and relapse prevention and recovery.</description>
