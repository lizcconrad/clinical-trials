      This study will use the Clinical Impact Method to develop a patient reported outcome for use
      in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension Clinical personnel at the study sites will
      approach and discuss possible participation in Phase I and II of the study with subjects from
      the existing pool of patients currently receiving usual and customary care at the site.

    <measure>The primary endpoint for the study will be a composite symptom score derived from items in the instrument.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients in Phase 1 and 2 shall be engaged in the study for approximately one hour's time; Phase 1 will take 3 to 6 weeks, and Phase 2 will proceed until sufficient sample size is obtained (saturation); we anticipate completion by September 2013.</time_frame>
    <description>Composite symptom score shall be derived from the actual items selected as a result of Phase 2.
The final scoring logarithm shall provide a score for each dimension, as well as an anxiety/concern scale derived from single items from each of the dimensions, and a total score.</description>
