  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of school-age children with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience neurocognitive
      deficits, even in the absence of stroke. In particular, deficits in attention and working
      memory have emerged as two of the most common neurocognitive sequelae of SCD. Thus, the goal
      of the present proposal is to address feasibility and compliance of a novel computerized
      cognitive training program, Cogmed. Pilot data will also be collected to establish
      preliminary efficacy. Twenty-four children meeting initial age and diagnostic criteria will
      be identified and approached about participation by their attending physician during
      regularly-scheduled SCD clinic visits. Baseline assessments will include a brief measure of
      intellectual functioning, a brief cognitive testing battery evaluating processing speed and
      working memory, in addition to questionnaires regarding behavior and quality of life.
      Children will then be randomized to the computerized CT program Cogmed (n=12) or a waitlist
      control (n=12). Participants enrolled in the computerized CT program will be asked to
      complete 25-sessions of Cogmed over a five to eight week period (3 to 5 sessions per week).
      Following completion of the program, children and their parents will be asked to return to
      clinic for a follow-up visit. After a five to eight-week waiting period, children in the
      waitlist condition will also be asked to return to clinic for a second visit. Following this
      assessment, participants initially enrolled in the waitlist will be offered an opportunity to
      participant in the intervention. If interested, they will follow the same intervention
      protocol described above. These children will return to clinic for a third visit following
      completion of the intervention. Compliance rate and its confidence interval will be
      calculated for the overall study population. A t-test for binomial proportion with continuity
      correction will be used to examine whether the compliance rate is lower than the target.
      Participants' change in criterion outcomes will be evaluated (i.e., those neurocognitive
      measures such as attention, executive functioning and working memory, that are most closely
      related to the trained tasks).
