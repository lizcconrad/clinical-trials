    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the study drug (CDX-1135) in patients with dense deposit disease
      (DDD). The objective is to evaluate the safety and activity of repeated doses of CDX-1135 in
      pediatric and adult patients with DDD. After screening, eligible patients will be entered
      into the Induction Period. The Induction Period is up to 4 weeks. Following normalization of
      complement activity, patients will enter into the Maintenance Period.The total treatment
      duration is up to 26 weeks.

    <description>► Induction Period
Patients will receive CDX-1135 as an IV infusion twice weekly (Mon-Thur or Tues-Fri). There will be two doses of 5 mg/kg, with intrapatient dose-escalation in 5 mg/kg increments up to a maximum dose of 30 mg/kg. This period may last up to 8 weeks.
► Maintenance Period
The starting dose for CDX-1135 Maintenance will be the same dose level as the last dose during the Induction Period; however, the Maintenance Period allows for dose decrease to 2 mg/kg, which is lower than the starting dose in the Induction Period.
Patients will receive CDX-1135 as an IV infusion twice weekly (Mon-Thur or Tues-Fri) for up to a total of 26 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Among other criteria, patients must be

          1. Patient and/or parent/legal guardian (as appropriate) must give written informed
             consent

          2. Four (4) years of age or older

          3. Must have DDD, confirmed by renal biopsy within 6 months of study enrollment
             (Confirmation by University of Iowa investigators is required). If the patient is post
             transplant, the repeat renal transplant biopsy must show C3 dominant
             glomerulonephritis, and the patient must have a history of known DDD in the native
             kidney

          4. Signs of abnormal complement pathway activity

          5. Serum creatinine level must be abnormal

          6. Screening lab values criteria:

               1. Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm^3

               3. ALT and AST ≤ 3.0 x upper limit of normal

               4. C3 serum &lt;50% of the lower limit of normal

               5. 24 hour urine protein &gt;1000 mg/day, or urine protein:creatinine ratio &gt;1.0

          7. Both male and female patients of childbearing potential enrolled must use adequate
             birth control during the trial and for 1 month after stopping study drug

          8. Willing and able to comply with study procedures, including pre-study vaccinations
             (meningitis, haemophilus and pneumococci) and agree to a renal biopsy at Week 13 and
             at the end of the study

          9. Any anti-proteinuric medications (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,
             angiotensin II receptor blockers) must be at a stable dose for 4 weeks prior to first
             dose of CDX-1135

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Among other criteria, patients must not be

          1. Dialysis or a low estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m^2 over a
             4-week period prior to Screening

          2. Active or untreated systemic bacterial infection

             normalized by study entry)

          5. Immunosuppressive therapies (except for low dose steroids [≤10 mg per day] given for
             non-DDD related conditions such as asthma). Exceptions will be made for renal
             transplant patients, who may receive any appropriate therapies as needed to maintain
             the transplant (i.e., to prevent rejection)

          6. Treatment with any complement inhibitor within 3 months of study entry or any other
             investigational drug, device, or experimental procedure within 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment

          7. For renal transplant patients only: histology findings of treatable rejection (i.e.
             that the usual transplant physician would seek to treat). Chronic allograft
             nephropathy is not exclusionary provided the patient's glomerular filtration rate
             meets other entry criteria

          8. Preexisting condition with an association as a potential cause of DDD (i.e.,
             Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance) or an alternate glomerular disease

          9. Cancer except for adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer,
             curatively treated in situ disease, or other cancer that the patient has been
             disease-free for ≥ 5 years
