  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to assess the potential for PLX3397 to improve the efficacy of
      standard of care radiation therapy (RT) + temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma (GBM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study drug will be administered twice daily for 7 days prior to the initiation of RT
      (radiation therapy)and will continue twice daily during the course of RT. The RT schedule
      will be once daily for 5 days per week for 6 weeks (total radiation dose of 60 Gy. Oral
      temozolomide will be administered once daily (7 days per week) for the duration of RT. Four
      weeks after the completion of the course of RT, patients will be started on once-daily
      adjuvant temozolomide (Day 1-5 of a 28 day cycle) and PLX3397 twice daily (28 days of a 28
      day cycle) for up to 12 cycles in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable
      toxicities. After discontinuation of study drug, patients will continue to be followed for OS
      every 6 months. For patients participating in the run-in Phase 1b of the study, intra patient
      dose escalation will be permitted after a RP2D has been established. The Phase 2 portion of
      the study will enroll patients to be treated with PLX3397 at RP2D.

      For the Phase 1b portion of the study, 2 cohorts (800 mg/day and 1000 mg/day) are planned to
      be enrolled at approximately 7-10 sites. Each cohort will consist of approximately 7
      patients. Therefore, a minimum of 14 patients are planned to be enrolled in Phase 1b.
      Additional patients may be required for replacement patients, or if lower dose cohorts (600
      mg or 400 mg) are required. For the Phase 2 portion of the study, enrollment is planned to
      include approximately 44 patients.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A total of approximately 7 patients will be enrolled in each dose level. The starting dose level of PLX3397 will be 800 mg/day, using a twice daily (BID) dosing regimen. If that dose level is tolerated, the next dose level to be tested will be 1000 mg/day, which is the RP2D for single agent PLX3397 in solid tumors. Lower doses may be explored, if required. These lower doses are planned to be 600 mg/day (if PLX3397 is not tolerated at 800 mg/day) and 400 mg/day (if PLX3397 is not tolerated at 600 mg/day). Conversely, if the dose level of 1000 mg/day is tolerated, higher dose levels of PLX3397 may be investigated, at up to 50% increments, depending on the observed pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicities.</description>

    <description>Subjects will take oral doses of PLX3397 twice a day. Physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), adverse events, hematology and serum chemistry will be used to assess safety throughout the study. Adverse events will be monitored and reviewed for safety issues/abnormal changes in the above mentioned tests.
Ongoing safety will be continuously and rigorously monitored by the Sponsor. Additionally, biweekly teleconferences are planned to review in detail the safety across all study sites.</description>
