    <textblock>
      Retinal ischemia is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Recent
      findings have confirmed that there is a direct correlation between the levels of venous
      oxygen saturation and the degree of the glaucomatous disease, presumably due to a decrease in
      retinal cell metabolism.

      However, glaucoma patients have been suggested to have a different pattern in retinal venous
      circulation. For instance, the observation of a visible pulsating central retinal vein is a
      phenomenon that can be seen in up to 98% of the healthy individuals but is identifiable in
      less than 50% of glaucoma patients. While the nature of these venous changes are not year
      clear, the lack of a visible pulsating flow could suggest an increased intraluminal venous
      pressure due to some obstruction from both ocular or extraocular structures. This
      undetermined increase in venous pulse pressure could then significantly decrease perfusion
      pressures and therefore further decrease oxygen supply to the retinal tissues.

      The investigators will therefore try to determine if there is a significant difference
      between the oxygen saturation of the retinal vessels in both glaucoma patients with and
      without a visible pulsating central vein

      1. Visual field examen will be performed.

        2. Structural examination of the optic disc (confocal microscopy) will be performed.

        3. Spontaneous venous pulsation will be recorded after a one minute fundoscopy observation.

        4. Oximetry reading in the non-contact retinal oximetry of the first 3 order retinal
           vessels
