      This is a registry of moderate preterm infants, born alive at 29-33 weeks gestational age, in
      NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN) centers. The registry collects observational baseline
      data on both mothers and infants, and the therapies used and outcomes of the infants. The
      information collected is not specific to a disease or treatment (i.e., it is &quot;generic&quot;). Data
      are analyzed to find associations and trends between baseline information, treatments, and
      infant outcome, and to develop future NRN trials.

    <textblock>
      The Moderate Preterm Registry is a registry of moderate preterm infants (29-33 weeks
      gestational age) born alive in NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN) centers. The purpose is
      to collect baseline and outcome data in a uniform manner on a cohort of infants.

      The registry collects observational baseline data on both mothers and infants, and the
      therapies used and outcomes of the infants. The information collected is not specific to a
      disease or treatment (i.e., it is &quot;generic&quot;). Baseline data is collected soon after admission
      to the NICU; outcome data is collected at the time of death or discharge from the hospital.
      The data collected includes information on:

        -  Demographics of mother and infant

        -  Mother's health (e.g., pregnancy history and complications)

        -  Labor and deliver (e.g., rupture of the membranes, steroids and antibiotics given, mode
           of delivery)

        -  Infant's health (gestational age, Apgar scores, weight, length, delivery room
           resuscitation, respiratory support, etc.)

        -  Infant's medical outcome (heart, lung, nervous system, gastrointestinal system, hearing,
           and vision, known infections, and major malformations/syndromes, and mortality or number
           of days hospitalized).

      These data are used: to examine associations between baseline characteristics, treatments,
      and outcomes; to track trends in incidences of disease and effectiveness of therapies; and to
      identify questions requiring additional in-depth research.

      Informed Consent: As required by local IRBs.
