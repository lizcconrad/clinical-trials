  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is on the rise on a global scale. The number of
      cancer-related deaths related to CRC is also rising to an alarming level. This picture is
      similarly seen in Egypt where the incidence of colorectal carcinoma is increasing annually,
      moreover, CRC in Egypt exhibits an alarming characteristic which is the affection of much
      younger patients than their counterparts worldwide. Fortunately, the early detection of CRC
      and its precursor (adenoma) has been shown to markedly decrease morbidity and mortality
      related to this tumor, this has prompted the development of robust screening programs for CRC
      in several western countries. The implementation of a CRC screening program in Egypt has been
      hampered by the low compliance of the patients and the relatively high cost of colonoscopy.
      There is a need for an affordable, non-invasive, simple, accurate and socially accepted
      screening test to allow such a program to succeed in Egypt. Recent studies have shown that
      DNA is the future target of screening tests for several malignancies. Particularly for CRC a
      few preliminary studies have shown encouraging results with separate DNA methylation markers
      both in blood and stool. In our efforts to develop a screening test with the criteria stated
      above, the investigators have decided to join the forces of 2 of the largest medical centers
      in Egypt and the middle-east: Kasr-Alaini hospital and the National cancer institute (NCI).
      The investigators plan to test a panel of 7 DNA methylation markers in peripheral blood for
      their performance as an early marker for CRC and colorectal adenomas. Data from this study
      will pave the way for the development of a screening test for CRC &quot;tailored&quot; to the Egyptian
      population, moreover, it will supply essential data about the genetic alterations occurring
      in CRC in Egyptian patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing colonoscopy as part of their clinical care or part of screening
             program.

          -  Complete endoscopic examination (up to the caecum)

          -  Adequate colonic preparation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Incomplete colonoscopic examination due to technical causes e.g. difficult
             colonoscopy, patient intolerance (N.B. a neoplastic mass causing lumen stenosis will
             not be excluded.)

          -  Poor colonic preparation obscuring adequate mucosal examination.

          -  Patients who have received any treatment for CRC and/or adenomas.

          -  Patients with known malignancy elsewhere (i.e. non-colorectal malignancy)
