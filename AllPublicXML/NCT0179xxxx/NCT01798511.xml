  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most common diseases in routine clinical practice of
      surgeons and gastroenterologists throughout the world. The high rate of pain relapse after
      oral refeeding contributes to high consumption of healthcare resources and prolonged hospital
      stay in AP patients. The data from the pilot MIMOSA trial suggest that early administration
      of nasogastric tube feeding may prevent pain relapse after oral refeeding in AP. The
      potential beneficial effects of enteral tube feeding include induction of postprandial
      gastrointestinal motility and improving the tolerance of oral refeeding. This may reduce the
      risk of pain relapse, thereby shortening length of hospital stay and reducing cost of
      treatment. The primary endpoint of the ORION trial will be the incidence of oral food
      intolerance. All eligible AP patients will be randomly allocated to either the Early
      Nasogastric Tube (ENT) group or Conventional Nutritional Management group (CNM) at 24h of
      hospital admission.

    <description>Patients who are to have NTF will receive enteral nutrition within 6 hours after randomisation via a nasogastric tube placed into the stomach. A commercially available low fat semi-elemental feed (PeptisorbÂ®, Nutricia Clinical NZ) will be used. The caloric target will be 2000 kcal per day. Enteral tube feeding will be commenced at a rate of 30 mL/h and increased gradually until 100 mL/h over 24-48 h.</description>
