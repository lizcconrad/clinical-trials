      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of an educational program of
      Narrative Medicine &quot;workshop reading diaries&quot; dedicated to medical students on their empathy.

      Design: Randomized Controlled Trial in 2 arms. Participants: Medical students (4th years) of
      the University Paris Descartes. Methods: participants will be randomized in 2 groups. The
      allocation of participants will be done by a computerized randomization list, the sequence
      will be created by an independent statistician. Participants will be blinded of the study
      hypothesis. Allocation concealment will be provided because only the statistician will have
      access to the randomization list.

      A program of Narrative Medicine with lesson in small group of &quot;workshop reading patients'
      diaries &quot; vs &quot;workshop reading literature&quot;.

      Outcome: The primary endpoint will be a first measure of the empathy of the medical students.
      The secondary endpoints will be a second measure of the empathy of the medical student;
      satisfaction of the student relative to the educational program .

      Potential interests: We believe that the workshop &quot;reading patients' diaries&quot; can develop the
      thinking of the student with respect to his behavior with the patient, and so the relation
      between student and patient.

      Sample size expected: 200 participants.
