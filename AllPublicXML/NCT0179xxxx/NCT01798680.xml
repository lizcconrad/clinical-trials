      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of vitamin D3
      (cholecalciferol) supplementation on HIV progression and incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis
      among HIV-positive Tanzanian adult men and women initiating highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings experience
      high mortality, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other comorbidity rates during the first year of
      HIV treatment. Observational studies have shown low vitamin D is a risk factor for HIV
      progression and incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis among adults initiating HAART; however,
      whether this relationship is causal and if vitamin D supplementation starting at HAART
      initiation can improve health outcomes has not been determined. This study is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to examine the effect of vitamin D3
      supplementation on morality and pulmonary tuberculosis for adults initiating HAART.
      Participants are HIV-positive Tanzanian men and women aged 18 years and older, who are
      initiating HAART at the time of randomization whose baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)
      concentration is &lt;30ng/mL. Eligible individuals are randomized to receive a) a vitamin D3
      regimen consisting 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 taken orally once per week for 4 weeks (weeks 0,
      1, 2, 3) followed by 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 supplements taken orally once per day starting at
      4 weeks until study discharge at 12 months or b) placebo pills taken once weekly for 4 weeks
      (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3) followed by placebo pills taken daily starting at 4 weeks until study
      discharge. Participants will be followed for 12 months after ART initiation.
