  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of infusing immune cells from
      a donor as treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is resistant to
      chemotherapy or who have experienced relapse. Unlike standard bone marrow or stem cell
      transplantation which uses donors who are well 'matched' to the patient, this study uses
      donors whose immune cells are not compatible with the patient. With standard stem cell or
      bone marrow transplantation, the well-matched immune cells will attack the leukemia but they
      also attack the patient's organs (a situation called graft-versus-host disease, which can
      persist in the long term). Our hypothesis is that the mismatched donor cells will fight the
      leukemia but will then be eliminated from the patient's body, so long-term side effects like
      graft-versus-host disease should not occur.

      The ATAC cell therapy product contains unselected, non-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells from related donors who are mismatched to the recipients at 3 or more (out of 6) HLA
      loci. Cohorts of 3 patients will be treated at each of four pre-specified dose levels (T
      cells per kg recipient weight). One ATAC infusion is administered 24-48 hours following
      re-induction chemotherapy (for relapsed or primary refractory AML patients not in remission).
      In situations where ATAC infusion is not available immediately following re-induction
      chemotherapy and patients nonetheless achieve complete remission, one ATAC infusion is given
      24-48 hours after consolidation chemotherapy.

        Recipient Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years (no upper age limit, but physician discretion is advised)

          -  AML that is refractory to 2 courses of induction therapy (that together constitute the
             'first-line' therapy) or that has relapsed after a period of morphologic complete
             remission or morphologic remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)

          -  Candidacy for intense induction chemotherapy (ECOG 0-2, adequate renal, liver and
             cardiac function, absence of uncontrolled infections)

          -  Availability of parents, siblings or children who are HLA haploidentical (and not
             homozygous for the shared haplotype), who are deemed suitable donors after medical
             evaluation, and who complete peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection

          -  No history of autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant, purine analog

          -  Prior or concurrent receipt of any marketed or investigational agent deemed on an ad
             hoc basis to cause immunomodulation, pose a threat of permanent engraftment or
