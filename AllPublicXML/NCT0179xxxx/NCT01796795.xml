        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 17 years old.

          2. The diagnosis of CW is based on visual inspection by an experienced dermatologist.

          3. Patient is selected ≤ 5 CW lesions; each of the target lesion(s) needs to be ≤ 15 mm
             in diameter. For patient with only 1 selected lesion, the size of target lesion needs
             to be measuring 2 to 15 mm in diameter.

          4. Patient agrees to apply the study medication on target CW lesion(s) with an occlusive
             dressing for at least 20 hours per day.

          5. Patient or the legally acceptable representative of patient under 20 years of age, is
             willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          6. Patient agrees not to use wart-removing product/modality (prescription or
             over-the-counter) other than the study product during the course of the study; and is
             willing to refrain from using cosmetics or other topical products in the treatment
             area for the duration of the study.

          7. Any non-target CW receiving wart-removing procedures including cryotherapy and
             surgical therapy should be at least 5 cm apart from the target lesions.

          8. Patient is free of any systemic or dermatologic disorder, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase the risk to the
             patient.

          9. Patient is judged to be in good health based upon the results of physical examinations
             (PEs), medical history, and safety laboratory tests.

         10. Patient in good general health condition (performance status ≤ 2 Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG)).

         11. Patient agrees to be photographed of the CW target lesion(s) and used of such data as
             part of the study package.

         12. Female patient of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test at Screening day, and is willing to use effective contraception during
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             visit, or is currently participating in another clinical study.

          3. Patient had used any wart-removing product/modality in the treatment area within 30
             days prior to the Randomization visit or received cryotherapy in the treatment area
             within 60 days prior to the Randomization visit.

          4. Patient who has immune-compromised conditions, have required or will require systemic
             intake of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medication (oral or parental
             corticosteroids are included) within 30 days prior to the Randomization visit or
             during the course of the study. Routine use of inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids

               1. Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease based on medical history.

               2. Current uncontrolled infection, current skin infections and/or skin disorder in
                  the treatment area other than CW and/or in the area surrounding the warts that
                  may confound or affect study assessment procedure of the study endpoints.

               3. Chronic or acute medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
                  interfere with the study results or place the subject at undue risk (including

          7. Patient has a history of allergy or sensitivity to Solanum undatum plant extract, SM,
