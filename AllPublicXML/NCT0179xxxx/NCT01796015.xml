  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial hypertension (ICH) is a mortality risk factor in severe traumatic brain injury
      (TBI), in purulent meningitis, in hepatic encephalopathy and in Reye's syndrome. It is also a
      risk factor for severe neurologic sequelae in survivors. Intracranial pressure (ICP)
      monitoring is likely to guide therapeutics, and certain research on adults or on children,
      suggest that IH therapeutic approach, for instance for bacterial meningitis, would improve
      the prognosis. Two monitoring techniques are currently recommended. They are reference
      methods for ICP measure :

        -  monitoring with intraventricular catheter,

        -  intra-parenchymal monitoring using optical fiber catheter. Non invasive methods have
           been suggested, including ultrasound measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD)
           which is the most interesting one. The ONSD measured ultrasonically is correlated with
           ICP level in adults with severe TBI. A diameter over 5,9 mm predicts ICH within the
           first 24 hours. In children, ONSD average values have been worked out, and an ONSD
           increase is found in children suffering from hydrocephalus with IH and in children with
           TBI. ICH precocious detection is fundamental in children sensitive to ICH because their
           cerebral development is not finished yet. Difficulties met for ICP monitoring
           implementation in infants and its invasive nature are often disliked by clinicians. A
           non-invasive exam is then essential to allow a better care of children with ICH in
           intensive care unit.

    <description>Description of the ONSD ultrasound: ONSD is measured 3 mm behind the globe and perpendicularly to the optic nerve axis (2 dimensions mode).
For each optic nerve, 2 measures are performed: 1 sagittal and 1 transverse. The patient is positioned in 30° dorsal elevation. Gel is applied on the eyelid and a 7,5 MHz probe is used.
At the same time and on the same side, a transcranial Doppler is performed using a 2 MHz probe placed on the temple. Are measured: systolic velocity, mean velocity, diastolic velocity, resistance index and pulsatility index.
As ONSD measures cannot be done blinded (regarding ICP monitoring), a centralised evaluation (by 2 experts) of the recorded sonograms is planned.</description>
