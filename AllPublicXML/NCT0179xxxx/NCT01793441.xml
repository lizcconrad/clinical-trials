  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, proof of
      concept study will investigate the efficacy and safety of RG7314 in adult participants with
      ASD. In Stage I of the study, participants will be randomized in 2:1 to receive daily oral
      doses of 1.5 milligrams (mg) RG7314 or placebo for 12 weeks. After an independent safety
      review, the study may proceed to Stage II. In Stage II of the study, additional participants
      will be randomized in 2:1 to receive daily oral doses of 4 mg RG7314 or placebo for 12 weeks.
      After an independent safety review, Stage III will be started wherein additional participants
      will be randomized in 2:1 to receive daily oral doses of 10 mg RG7314 or placebo for 12
      weeks. During Stage III, safety will be reviewed by independent safety review twice and if no
      safety signal is observed, then additional participants will be randomized in 1:1:1 either to
      receive 1.5 milligrams per day (mg/day) or 10 mg/day RG7314 orally or placebo for 12 weeks in
      Stage IV.

          -  CGI-S &gt;/=4 (moderately ill)

          -  Participants have an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) &gt;/=70 (Wechsler Abbreviated State of
             Intelligence)

          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18 to 40 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2) inclusive

             participant's status via completion of study assessments. Any period of absence must
             be covered by another caregiver. Non-cohabitating caregiver(s) must spend sufficient
             time with the participant so that, in the opinion of the investigator, the
             caregiver(s) can reliably assess participant's mental status, activities and behavior.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alcohol and/or substance abuse/dependence during the last 12 months

          -  A significant risk for suicidal behavior, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Systolic blood pressure greater than (&gt;) 140 or less than (&lt;) 90 millimeters of
             mercury (mm Hg), and diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 or less than (&lt;) 50 mm Hg

          -  Resting pulse rate &gt;90 or &lt;40 beats per minute

          -  Use of prohibited medications or herbal remedies within 2 weeks prior to
             randomization, or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)

          -  Initiation of a new major change in psychological intervention within 4 weeks prior to
             randomization. Minor changes in ongoing treatment are not considered significant
