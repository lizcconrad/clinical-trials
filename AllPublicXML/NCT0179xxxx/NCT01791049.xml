        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a healthy nonsmoking male or a female of non-child bearing potential and 18
             to 50 years old, inclusive, at Screening. Females are considered to be of
             non-childbearing potential if they have had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation or are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 2 years) with a follicle-stimulating hormone
             (FSH) level &gt;20 IU/L.

          -  Subject has a body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighs at least
             50 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has evidence or history of clinically significant allergic (except for
             untreated, asymptomatic seasonal allergies at time of dosing), hematological,
             endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, or
             neurological disease.

          -  Subject has a history of allergies or hypersensitivities to glycopeptide (e.g.,
             vancomycin), penicillin, or cephalosporin antibiotics.

          -  Subject has participated in another clinical trial of an investigational drug (or
             medical device) within 60 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to
             Screening or is currently participating in another trial of an investigational drug
             (or medical device).
