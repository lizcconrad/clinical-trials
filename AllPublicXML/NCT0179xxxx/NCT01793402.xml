  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is an essential nutrient. Deficiency of vitamin D is widespread. The prevalence of
      vitamin D deficiency in early preterm infants is unknown. The American Academy of Pediatrics
      recommends a daily intake of 400 IU in order to achieve a serum concentration of 20 ng/ml of
      vitamin D. This recommendation presumes exposure to sunlight, the best source of vitamin D.
      This study assesses vitamin D status at birth and during hospital stay in infants delivered
      delivered at earlier than or at 32 weeks gestation. We also assess the adequacy of intake
      relative to the target set by the American Academy of Pediatrics for children.

      Vitamin D is important for bone health. Deficiency of vitamin D is widespread and is
      associated with a variety of diseases. Preterm infants are susceptible osteopenia of
      prematurity (OP). Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to OP. The American Academy of
      Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a daily intake of 400 IU in order to achieve a serum
      concentration of 20 ng/ml of vitamin D. This recommendation presumes exposure to sunlight,
      the best source of vitamin D. Whether this level of intake or target serum concentration are
      achieved in early preterm infants is unknown. We hypothesize that because early preterm
      infants are sequestered in the Newborn Intensive Care Units for an extended period of time,
      they will be deficient in vitamin D and that the current nutritional intake may not be
      adequate in meeting the AAP recommendation. We assessed the concentration of serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin-D in parturient mothers and in their newborns if they were less than 32
      week gestation. We monitored vitamin D intake during hospitalization in the Newborn Intensive
      Care Unit and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D at discharge.

    <description>This is a longitudinal study that assessed vitamin D status at birth in infants as well as in their mothers. Daily intake of vitamin D was analyzed. The serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D at discharge was assessed. We correlated maternal vitamin D with infants' vitamin D concentrations at birth. We also correlated vitamin D concentration at birth with the concentration at discharge.</description>

        All infants born at or less than 32 weeks postmenstrual age admitted to the Newborn
        Intensive Care Unit at University of Cincinnati Medical Center were eligible. Intake of
        vitamin D and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D concentrations were assessed during stay in the
        Newborn Intensive Care Unit.
