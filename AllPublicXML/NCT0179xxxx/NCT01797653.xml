  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial (therapeutic vs. placebo CPAP) including 46 patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to define the physiological effects of continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy withdrawal on myocardial perfusion and dermal and renal
      microvascular function during a 2 week period.
