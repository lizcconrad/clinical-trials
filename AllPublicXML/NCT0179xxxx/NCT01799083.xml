                  dimension by traditional computerized tomography (CT) scanning technique or ≥ 1
                  cm in the largest dimension by spiral CT scanning (per RECIST criteria); or if,
                  in the Principal Investigator's opinion, evaluable disease can be reliably and
                  consistently followed, the subject may be eligible upon approval by the Medical

               -  For lymphoma patients; patients with prior stem cell transplant therapy
                  (autologous SCT within the prior 8 weeks; allogeneic SCT within the prior 16
