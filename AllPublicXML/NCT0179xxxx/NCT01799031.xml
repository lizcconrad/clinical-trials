      This randomized clinical trial studies an educational intervention for reducing work
      disability in breast cancer survivors. Web sites providing symptom management education may
      be an effective method to help breast cancer survivors reduce work disability after treatment

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility and usability of the Work Ability Improvement Through Symptom
      Management and Ergonomic Strategies (WISE) and empirically evaluate its effect on short-term
      work ability among breast cancer survivors (BCS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore individual and workplace factors associated with work ability in BCS.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive access to the WISE web-based educational intervention to help BCS
      manage their symptoms, identify ergonomic workplace problems and risks, and implement
      ergonomic modifications. Patients also receive standard of care comprising symptom management
      therapies and a pamphlet on employment rights.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care comprising symptom management therapies and a
      pamphlet on employment rights.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
