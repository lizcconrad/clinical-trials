    <measure>30-Day Adjusted Rate of Total and Nocturnal Hypoglycemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycemic episodes are defined as an event which is associated with reported signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, and/or a documented blood glucose (BG) concentration of &lt;=70 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) (3.9 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]). A nocturnal hypoglycemic event is defined as any total hypoglycemia event that occurred between bedtime and waking. Group mean rates of total and nocturnal hypoglycemia (per 30 days) are presented and were calculated from negative binomial regression models with treatment, baseline sulfonylurea/meglitinide use, baseline event rate of the corresponding hypoglycemia as covariates, log (exposure/30 days) as the offset in the model. Group Mean is estimated by taking the inverse link function on individual participant covariates first and then averages over all participants.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 26 Weeks in European Quality of Life - 5 Dimension 3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using a three level scale 1-3 (no problem, some problems, and extreme problems). These combinations of attributes were converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United States (US) population-based algorithm. The EQ-5D-3L US based index scores ranged from -0.11 to 1.0 where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health. LS means were calculated from ANCOVA using treatment, stratification factor (country, baseline sulfonylurea sulfonylureas/meglitinide use [Yes/No], baseline HbA1c strata [≤8.5% or &gt;8.5%]) and baseline value of EQ-5D-3Las covariates.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 26 Weeks in Adult Low Blood Sugar Survey (LBSS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adult LBSS (also referenced as Hypoglycemia Fear Survey - II [HFS-II]) contains 33 items, with each item scored on a 5-point response scale: 0 (never) to 4 (always). Items are categorized in 2 domains: Behavior (or avoidance) with 15 items and Worry (or affect) with 18 items. Sum all the items to obtain a total score (range 0-132). Higher total scores reflect greater fear of hypoglycemia. LS means were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for treatment, stratification factor (country, baseline sulfonylureas/meglitinide use [Yes/No]), baseline HbA1c (≤8.5% or &gt;8.5%), and baseline value of LBSS.</description>

Least Squares (LS) means were calculated by mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) using treatment, stratification factors (country, sulfonylureas/meglitinide use [Yes/No]), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline HbA1c as the fixed effects.</description>

        <title>30-Day Adjusted Rate of Total and Nocturnal Hypoglycemic Events</title>
        <description>Hypoglycemic episodes are defined as an event which is associated with reported signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, and/or a documented blood glucose (BG) concentration of &lt;=70 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) (3.9 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]). A nocturnal hypoglycemic event is defined as any total hypoglycemia event that occurred between bedtime and waking. Group mean rates of total and nocturnal hypoglycemia (per 30 days) are presented and were calculated from negative binomial regression models with treatment, baseline sulfonylurea/meglitinide use, baseline event rate of the corresponding hypoglycemia as covariates, log (exposure/30 days) as the offset in the model. Group Mean is estimated by taking the inverse link function on individual participant covariates first and then averages over all participants.</description>

          <title>6-Point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG)</title>
          <description>6-point SMBG profiles were obtained on 3 nonconsecutive days in the week prior to Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 26. The SMBG measurements were performed while fasting (prior to the morning meal [breakfast]), prior to the midday meal (lunch), prior to the evening meal (dinner), at bedtime, at approximately 0300 hours, and the next day fasting (prior to the morning meal). LS means were calculated by MMRM using treatment, stratification factors (country, sulfonylureas/meglitinide use [Yes/No]), ], baseline HbA1c strata [≤8.5% or &gt;8.5%]), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline SMBG at the same time point of the response variable as the fixed effects.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26 Weeks in European Quality of Life - 5 Dimension 3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) Index</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using a three level scale 1-3 (no problem, some problems, and extreme problems). These combinations of attributes were converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United States (US) population-based algorithm. The EQ-5D-3L US based index scores ranged from -0.11 to 1.0 where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health. LS means were calculated from ANCOVA using treatment, stratification factor (country, baseline sulfonylurea sulfonylureas/meglitinide use [Yes/No], baseline HbA1c strata [≤8.5% or &gt;8.5%]) and baseline value of EQ-5D-3Las covariates.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Insulin Antibodies</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with a positive treatment-emergent anti-LY2605541 antibody response (TEAR) is summarized. TEAR was defined as change from baseline to postbaseline in the anti-LY2605541 antibody level either (1) from undetectable to detectable or (2) from detectable to the value with at least 130% relative increase from baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with TEAR anytime during the treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100.</description>
