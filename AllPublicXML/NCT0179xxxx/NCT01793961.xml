  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of driving under the influence of cannabis have risen in recent years. Cannabis is
      involved in 1/3 of motor vehicle collisions. The chronic use of cannabis is known to affect
      dopaminergic regulation and may thus impair contrast sensitivity. In turn, contrast
      sensitivity disorders could originate difficulties to anticipate and avoid collision with
      objects, especially when objects are in movement. The investigators goal is to examine the
      effects of a chronic intake of cannabis on contrast sensitivity. The observed values will be
      compared to standard references. In addition, since smoking cannabis is always associated
      with tobacco, the investigators will control the effects of tobacco on contrast sensitivity.

      In this study, the investigators will include 36 cannabis addicts, 36 tobacco addicts and 36
      no smokers. The investigators will present gratings with different spatial frequencies and
      the investigators will determine contrast thresholds for static and dynamic (moving)
      gratings. The investigators predict that cannabis addicts will present abnormal contrast
      sensitivity especially in case of dynamic presentation of gradings.
