  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plavix (clopidogrel) is a drug that is approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to
      reduce the risk of having another heart attack by preventing platelets (blood cells that are
      important in forming blood clots) from sticking together and forming another clot. Platelet
      activity can be measured by a machine called VerifyNow.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether Hispanic women and White non-Hispanic women have
      the same platelet response to a commonly used drug, Plavix (clopidogrel). Recent studies have
      shown that platelets may be more active in Hispanics, making it more difficult to prevent
      clots from forming, even when using Plavix. In addition, studies have shown that women may
      also have more active platelets than men. There have been no studies of Hispanic women and
      the effect of Plavix on platelet activity.

        Females, age ≥ 45 years, with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), undergone a percutaneous
        coronary intervention and currently treated with clopidogrel will be enrolled. The
        subjects' race and ethnicity will be self -reported and Hispanic ethnicity by self-report
        of having both parents of Hispanic/Latino descent.
