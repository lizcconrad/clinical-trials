      Apathy is one of the most under recognised, underdiagnosed and poorly managed aspects of
      Parkinson's disease. Depending on methodological approach of the study, its prevalence is
      estimated to be between 16 and 51%.

      Apathy derives from a dysfunction of the dopaminergic meso cortico limbic systems, which
      seems to play a central role in the control of mood and motivation. The subcortical
      components of this system are the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and
      the constituents of the limbic system (particularly the hippocampus and amygdala), all of
      which are located deep inside the brain (18). The hypothesis is that depletion of striatal
      dopamine from regulators located in the midbrain (VTA and SNpc) in striato-thalamo-cortical
      circuits results in hypofunction of these circuits and the loss of frontal cortical activity,
      particularly within in the frontal orbital cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the
      prefrontal cortex

      The objective of this study is to explore, using diffusion weighted MRI, the regions of the
      brain which are proposed to play a role in motivation in apathetic Parkinson's disease
      patients and to define more precisely the relation between dopaminergic fibres and the
      meso-cortico-limbic system with the help of tractography methods

      3 groups :

        -  20 apathetic patients with Parkinson's disease

        -  20 non apathetic paired patients)

        -  20 healthy paired control

      Description of the protocol for patients :

      J0 : Inclusion visit (duration : 4h):

        -  motor assessment (UPDRS)

        -  neuropsychological and psychiatric assessment : Cognitive assessments : Mini Mental
           State MMS, MATTIS Apathy assessment: Apathy Inventory from Robert et al (2002); Lille
           apathy rating scale (LARS) ; Starkstein scale.

      Depression assessment : Montgomery et Alsberg depression rating scale (MADRS)

      J0+1 day : MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) acquisition (30 minutes) Multimodal MRI
      examinations will be performed (Diffusion-weighted data and high-resolution 3-dimensional
      (3D) T1- weighted as well as T2-weighted images) on each subject on a GE 3-T.
