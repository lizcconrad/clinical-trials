  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center randomized controlled Phase II clinical trial. Patients with
      oligometastatic stage IV (number of distant metastases ≤ 5) non-squamous non-small cell lung
      cancer treated with second-line erlotinib150mg daily for 3 months with clinical benefits
      (free-from progression) were randomized (stratified according to smoking status and different
      research centers) to the radiotherapy group (n = 100) and the non-radiotherapy group (n =
      100). Radiotherapy group (experimental group) patients started simultaneously radiotherapy
      for all gross tumors soon after randomization; non-radiotherapy group (control group)
      received no radiotherapy for all gross tumors. Erlotinib was continuously used until to
      disease progression or unbearable adverse effect, and the subsequently further salvage
      therapies were determined by the investigators. The primary endpoint was PFS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has signed informed consent;

          2. Male or female aged 18 years or older;

          4. PS score 0-2;

          5. Stage IV patients with distant metastasis (according to the latest AJCC/UICC lung
             cancer staging, upper neck lymph nodes belonging to distant metastases;
             ipsilateral/contralateral mediastinal lymph nodes, supraclavicular and lower neck
             lymph nodes belonging to local regional areas and are not included in distant
             metastases), who occurred disease progression after receiving a course of systemic
             chemotherapy, or who hadn't complete the planned course of the first-line chemotherapy
             but they were intolerance or refused to continue treatment;

          6. Received second-line erlotinib treatment;

          7. The patients who taking erlotinib for 3 months then the efficacy evaluation found
             clinical benefits (CR+PR+SD);

          8. Metastatic NSCLC with distant metastases number ≤ 5 (for metastases in the same organ,
             the number counted as the separate metastatic focus) and the longest diameter of each
             metastatic foci on CT should &gt; 1cm, but brain (including the parenchyma and meninges)
             metastasis, malignant pleural/pericardial effusion, or abdominal effusion were not
             allowed;

          9. Have never received local treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, and
             radiofrequency ablation for primary and distant metastases;

         10. Patients must received systemic PET-CT examination before treatment with erlotinib, to
             more accurately identify the status of patients with distant metastases;

         11. The diagnosis of bone and liver metastases:

               1. On the basis of clinical symptoms, an imaging support was necessary for the
                  clinical diagnosis of bone metastases; if the clinical symptoms were absent, two
                  imaging supports of bone metastases were necessary for the clinical diagnosis of
                  bone metastasis; adjacent bone metastases (such as the two adjacent vertebral
                  metastases) was considered to be a single metastasis.

               2. MRI or enhanced CT confirmations were needed for liver metastases diagnosis;

         12. Have never received other targeted drug treatments for EGFR inhibition;

         13. If metastases in a same organ ≤ 4 and the amount of metastatic focus ≤ 5, it should be
             determined by the radiation therapists in the research group to judge if the patients
             can tolerate all positive focus (including primary and metastatic focus) receiving
             radiotherapy, the radiotherapy dose should be selected by treating physician according
             to the patients' conditions from several regimens including conventional split
             curative doses or palliative doses, and hypofractionated radiotherapy (for details
             please refer to the radiation therapy section);

                  aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 times of the
                  upper limit of normal (if liver metastases existing, ALT, AST ≤ 5 times of the
                  upper limit of normal were allowed) ;

               3. Kidney: serum creatinine ≤ 2 times of the upper limit of normal or creatinine

             treatment completion; serum or urine pregnancy test must be negative; mustn't be in
             lactation. For male patients: surgical sterilization, or took contraceptive measures
             during treatment and within 3 months after treatment completion.
