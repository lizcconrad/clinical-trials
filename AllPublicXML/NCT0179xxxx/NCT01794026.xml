  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative staging for gastric adenocarcinoma is an important procedure to detect advanced
      disease stateS for the patients in which the surgery may be unnecessary to perform. Although
      there are many imaging techniques for this purpose, sensitivity and specificity of these
      techniques still remains to be low.Preoperative detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis and
      involvement of lymph nodes beyond D2 may prevent surgical procedures.

      Removal of the determined lymph nodes according to the type of the surgery is the accepted
      surgical method. However, accurate determination of malignant lymph nodes may prevent
      dissection of some groups of the lymph nodes. These findings may cause a new definition of
      gastric lymph node dissection.
