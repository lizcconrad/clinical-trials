      This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open label, dose-escalation, nonrandomized study to
      evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of a 60-minute infusion of carfilzomib
      for patients with progressive multiple myeloma.

      The study will consist of a screening period, followed by a treatment period of up to eight
      28-day treatment cycles, followed by a period of maintenance treatment. Subjects are to be
      treated until disease progression.

    <description>Maximum tolerated dose will be established by the number of dose limiting toxicities and the overall safety and tolerability of the study drug.
Safety and tolerability will be determined by the following:
incidence and frequency of adverse events throughout the study
clinical laboratory test results at study visits
vital signs measurements at each study visits
medical history and physical examination findings
ECOG performance status at study visits
concomitant medication usage throughout the study</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Establish efficacy as assessed by the overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>monthly, up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate will be determined by the following:
SPEP, UPEP, and quantification of immunoglobulins and immunofixation
bone marrow aspirates and biopsies to confirm CR
roentgenographic skeletal survey
Response rate will be assessed by the following:
Clinical benefit response rate
Progression-free survival
Time to progression
Duration of response
Overall survival

    <description>Phase 1: Carfilzomib will be administered at an escalating dose by cohort as 60-minute IV infusion on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle. On Cycle 1 Days 1 and 2, carfilzomib will be given at 20 mg/m^2. For all subsequent doses, carfilzomib will be administered at the dose assigned to the cohort (56, 70, or 88 mg/m^2). Dexamethasone (8 mg IV or PO) will be administered prior to carfilzomib on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.
Phase 2: Carfilzomib will be administered at the MTD determined in phase 1. Maintenance: From Cycle 9 onward, carfilzomib and dexamethasone will be administered in the same fashion as during the previous treatment cycle, but only on days 1, 2, 15, and 16.</description>
