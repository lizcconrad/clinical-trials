  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ranibizumab for the treatment of
      macular edema (ME) secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in patients with initial
      fair visual acuity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lucentis was approved for ME due to BRVO based on the results from BRAVO study. The inclusion
      criteria in BRAVO was &quot;best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 20/40 to 20/320&quot;. Therefore, the
      patients with VA better than 20/40 who are out of inclusion criteria of BRAVO study had no
      treatment and just wait to reach spontaneous improvement. But, there is unmet needs of these
      patients and, in actual clinical practice, many retina specialists treat these patients with
      Ranibizumab. These patients have been experiencing VA improvement after the injection. Based
      on these clinical backgrounds, the investigator wants to suggest the treatment guidelines in
      these patients group, which is, early treatment of ranibizumab would be effective and
      increase patients' QOL. In other words, there are many experiences in these cases among
      ophthalmologists, but there have been no clinical trials that can endorse the treatments. To
      confirm the efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with initial fair vision, the investigators
      started the prospective randomized clinical trial on the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab
      for the patients.
