  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pegasys (peginterferon
      alfa-2a) in patients with chronic hepatitis B who have failed antiviral treatment with
      nucleoside (nucleotide) analogues. Data will be collected from patients treated according to
      the current Summary of Product Characteristics and local standard of care and regulations
      during 48 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of follow-up.
