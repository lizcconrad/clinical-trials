      The use of Indocyanine green diagnostic dye will identify areas of vascular leakage which
      will provide more effective laser treatment by targeting these specific areas.

    <textblock>
      The Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study showed that early treatment of Clinically
      Significant Macular Edema (CSME) with focal and grid laser preserved vision in diabetic
      patients. Indocyanine Green angiography, which was not available at the time of the Early
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), is now standard-of-care for diagnostic
      evaluation of the choroidal circulation and is routinely done in combination with Fluorescein
      angiography for a more complete visualization of retinal pathology. Simultaneous examination
      of both retinal and choroidal circulation allows for identification of microaneurysms that
      are hyperfluorescent both on Fluorescein angiography and Indocyanine green angiography. Such
      microaneurysms are sites of increased vascular leakage and represent a means for providing
      more effective laser treatment by targeting these areas directly with focal laser.
