      This study is conducted to compare Koning Breast CT (KBCT) to mammography to evaluate if KBCT
      can improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer. It will also compare contrast-enhanced
      KBCT (CE-KBCT) to mammography to evaluate if CE-KBCT can further improve the diagnostic
      accuracy of breast cancer.

    <description>About 187 subjects, who had diagnostic imaging of the breast including mammography and were categorized as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System(BIRADS) scores 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, received KBCT imaging without contrast injection.</description>

    <description>About 231 subjects, who had diagnostic imaging of the breast including mammography and were scheduled for biopsy or surgery, received contrast-enhanced KBCT imaging of the affected breast before biopsy or surgery.</description>

    <description>Contrast-enhanced KBCT includes pre-contrast KBCT scan and post-contrast KBCT scan. After the pre contrast scan is completed, a bolus injection of a low osmolar, nonionic, iodinated 300mg of iodine per mL contrast agent, will be injected at a rate of approximately 2.0 mL/s, for a total injection time of approximately 30-60 seconds. 30-60 seconds after the contrast injection, the post-contrast scan will be acquired.</description>
