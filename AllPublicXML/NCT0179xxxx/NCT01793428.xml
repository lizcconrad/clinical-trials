  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      13% of injured normotensive patients arriving in emergency unit need mass blood-transfusion
      of six or more units of packed Red Blood Cells. It is currently difficult to predict the need
      for such a mass blood-transfusion. Indeed hemoglobin point of care testing (hemocue) and
      blood pressure can be normal during the first hours despite intensive bleeding.

      It's well known that blood or arterial lactate measures correlate with trauma severity but
      these measures are not available in a pre-hospital setting. The investigators want to test
      whether capillary lactate measures also correlate with trauma severity and can therefore
      predicts earlier transfusion needs.
