    <measure>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) Psychological Score at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) is a validated MS specific questionnaire consisting of 29 questions of which 20 addressed the physical impact component and 9 assessed the psychological impact. A combined score can be generated, or both components can be reported separately. The psychological wellbeing assessment portion of the MSIS-29 was comprised of 9 questions in which subjects rate the impact of MS on their day-to-day life from 1=no impact to 5=extreme impact. The total Psychological Score was calculated using following formula: sum of score for 9 questions - 9/0.36. The total score range ranges from 0-100 where, lower total score indicates less psychologically-related impact while a higher total score indicates greater psychologically-related impact on a subject's functioning.</description>

    <description>Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) is a validated MS specific questionnaire consisting of 29 questions of which 20 addressed the physical impact component and 9 assessed the psychological impact. A combined score can be generated, or both components can be reported separately. The total score of the MSIS-29 was comprised of all the 29 questions in which subjects rate the impact of MS on their day-to-day life from 1=no impact to 5=extreme impact. The total Score was calculated using following formula: sum of score for 29 questions - 29/1.45. The total score range ranges from 0-100 where, lower total score indicates less psychologically-related impact while a higher total score indicates greater psychologically-related impact on a subject's functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Euro Quality of Life Questionnaire With 5 Questions Alternatives (EQ5D-5L) Summary Score at Month 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed using the EQ5D-5L score, which is one of the most widely used generic index measures of health-related quality of life. It consists of a 5-item descriptive system that measures 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores ranging from 1 (no problems) through 5 (extreme problems) in which 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. A unique EQ5D-5L health state was defined by combining the numeric level scores for each of the 5 dimensions and the total score ranges from 5 to 25. An increase in the EQ5D-5L total score indicates worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a method of evaluating fatigue in multiple sclerosis and is designed to differentiate fatigue from clinical depression, since both share some of the same symptoms. The Fatigue Severity Scale is a 9-item questionnaire developed to assess the level of fatigue due to neurological disease, were each assessed on a 1-7 scale (1= no fatigue and 7= severe fatigue). The total score was calculated as the average of individual 9-items and ranged from 1 to 7 with a higher value indicating greater impairment due to fatigue.</description>

A total score ranged from a possible 0 (no fatigue impact) to 84 (almost always impacted by fatigue). A lower total score indicates less fatigue-related impact while a higher total score indicates greater fatigue-related impact on a subject's functioning.</description>

        <description>Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) is a validated MS specific questionnaire consisting of 29 questions of which 20 addressed the physical impact component and 9 assessed the psychological impact. A combined score can be generated, or both components can be reported separately. The psychological wellbeing assessment portion of the MSIS-29 was comprised of 9 questions in which subjects rate the impact of MS on their day-to-day life from 1=no impact to 5=extreme impact. The total Psychological Score was calculated using following formula: sum of score for 9 questions - 9/0.36. The total score range ranges from 0-100 where, lower total score indicates less psychologically-related impact while a higher total score indicates greater psychologically-related impact on a subject’s functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Euro Quality of Life Questionnaire With 5 Questions Alternatives (EQ5D-5L) Summary Score at Month 6 and 12</title>
        <description>Quality of life was assessed using the EQ5D-5L score, which is one of the most widely used generic index measures of health-related quality of life. It consists of a 5-item descriptive system that measures 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores ranging from 1 (no problems) through 5 (extreme problems) in which 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. A unique EQ5D-5L health state was defined by combining the numeric level scores for each of the 5 dimensions and the total score ranges from 5 to 25. An increase in the EQ5D-5L total score indicates worsening.</description>

The Fatigue Severity Scale is a 9-item questionnaire developed to assess the level of fatigue due to neurological disease, were each assessed on a 1-7 scale (1= no fatigue and 7= severe fatigue).

        <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale is a list of 21 statements describing how fatigue may affect a person's functioning. Answers ranging from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost always). A total score ranged from a possible 0 (no fatigue impact) to 84 (almost always impacted by fatigue). A lower total score indicates less fatigue-related impact while a higher total score indicates greater fatigue-related impact on a subject's functioning.</description>

        <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this the study drug. An AE was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>
