  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravascular devices in intensive care units are often associated to complications. The
      investigators estimate that 23.5% of catheters placed and used in intensive care are subject
      to at least one complication; the goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new
      Tegaderm ™ IV Advanced dressings to achieve a decrease of 35% in the number of complications
      associated with intravascular catheters in intensive care.
