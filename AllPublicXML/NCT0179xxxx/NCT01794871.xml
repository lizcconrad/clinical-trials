      Identify the cause of chronic allograft dysfunction using a combination of comprehensive
      clinical and histologic information in Chinese renal transplant recipients, then to identify
      the position of CNI nephrotoxicity in CAD.Chronic allograft dysfunction reflects the dual
      impact of both immunologic and nonimmunologic (primarily calcineurin inhibitor
      [CNI]nephrotoxicity) injury. In previous, CNI nephrotoxicity is overstated and considered one
      of the major causes of CAD, however, recently there has been found most death-censored graft
      losses to be the result of alloimmune or autoimmune injury, with only a minority of cases
      attributable to CNI toxicity. Unfortunately, Situation of objective CNI toxicity in CAD in
      China is not well analyzed. To improve perception of Neo safety with more local evidence, we
      want to do a retrospective study to identify the cause of chronic allograft dysfunction using
      a combination of comprehensive clinical and histologic information in Chinese renal
      transplantation recipients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Kidney transplant recipients, only including recipients of living-donor grafts

          -  Underwent an allograft biopsy between January 2005 and December 2011 because of
             developing deterioration of graft function*.

               -  Deterioration of function was defined as (1) an unexplained and persistent
                  greater than or equal to 25% increase of CR over baseline (in the absence of
                  potential confounding factors) or (2) new onset proteinuria (defined as
                  albumin/CR ratio â‰¥0.2 or a protein/CR ratio &gt;0.5).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple organ transplants, prior transplant with any other organ or tissue

          -  Patients who did not have the information regarding the pathological diagnosis

          -  Patients who did not have the histological sections of the allograft biopsy
