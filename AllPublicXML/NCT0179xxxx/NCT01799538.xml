      Background:

      - Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare type of lung disease that occurs almost
      exclusively in women. In LAM, muscle tissue grows in the lungs and starts to block the flow
      of air. It is a progressive disease, and in severe cases may require a lung transplant. One
      possible treatment to improve breathing in people with LAM is inhaled albuterol. Albuterol
      can be given in a metered dose inhaler (MDI) or with a nebulizer. Researchers want to compare
      these methods to see which method best improves lung function in women with LAM.

      Objectives:

      - To see whether a nebulizer or MDI can better improve lung function in women with LAM.

      Eligibility:

      - Women at least 18 years of age who have impaired lung function because of LAM.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. No lab tests
           will be needed for this study.

        -  Participants will have a 3-day overnight stay at the National Institutes of Health.
           Those who are using long-acting inhalers will have to stop taking these drugs 1 week
           before the study.

        -  Participants will receive either the nebulizer or two or four puffs of the inhaler. Four
           puffs of albuterol is a higher dose than is normally prescribed, and is being tested on
           this study.

        -  Participants will have each treatment around the same time of day on each of the 3 days.
           Before and after taking the albuterol, participants will have lung function tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have reported that approximately one third of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
      who have airflow obstruction respond to bronchodilators such as albuterol, a Beta2-adenergic
      receptor agonist, with an increase in forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV1) of 12% and
      200 ml above baseline values. Others however, have questioned these findings, reporting
      instead, a low rate of response of only six percent. Contrasting with our study, in this
      study albuterol was administered with a metered dose inhaler whereas in ours it was given by
      nebulizer. We propose to measure changes in lung function after administration of albuterol,
      respectively by metered inhaler and nebulizer, for 3 consecutive days in 150 LAM subjects.
      Our hypothesis is that albuterol administered by nebulization will produce a greater increase
      in FEV1 than two puffs of inhaled albuterol. If this hypothesis is confirmed, then we may
      recommend that patients with LAM and airflow obstruction use as a method of drug
      administration a nebulizer, rather than a metered dose inhaler.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Diagnosis of LAM either by tissue biopsy, evidence of lung and other organ involvement
             (renal angiomyolipomas, chylous effusions, lymphangioleiomyomas), high serum levels of
             vascular endothelial growth factor D (VGEF-D)(1) or a diagnosis of TSC associated with
             cystic lung lesions.

          -  Age 18 years or over

          -  Evidence of airflow obstruction: FEV1/VC ratio &lt; fifth percentile of predicted normal
             and an FEV(1) &lt;80% predicted of the normal values.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet one or more of the following
        criteria:
