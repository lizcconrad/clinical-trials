    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 28 in Quality of Life Scale (QLS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The QLS is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). Definitions were provided for 4 anchor points of the 7 points. Each item had a brief description of the judgement to be made and a set of suggested probes for the clinician. The total score was calculated as the sum of all 21 items giving a range of 0 to 126, where the higher score indicated normal or unimpaired functioning.</description>

    <measure>Investigator's Assessment Questionnaire (IAQ) Total Score at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The IAQ is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess the relative effectiveness (efficacy, safety and tolerability) of antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The IAQ consists of 12 items: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, other efficacy symptoms, cognition, energy, mood, somnolence, weight gain, signs and symptoms of prolactin elevation, akathisia, EPS (other than akathisia) and other safety or tolerability issues. For each item, the current medication was compared with previous antipsychotic medication on a five-point scale from 1 (Much better) to 5 (Much worse), or that item is Not applicable. The sum of the 12 items ranged from 12 (the current medication was much better than previous antipsychotic medication) to 60 (the current medication was much worse than previous antipsychotic medication).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The SWN-S is a patient-rated scale designed to measure subjective effects of neuroleptic drugs to psychopathology, quality of life, and compliance over the past 7 days. The 20 items (10 positive and 10 negative statements) are grouped in 5 subscales (mental functioning, self-control, physical functioning, emotional regulation and social integration). Each subscale contains 4 items. Each item was rated on a six-point Likert scale, from not at all to very much. A score was calculated for each subscale, and the total score ranged from 20 to 120, where the higher score indicated better well-being.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 28 in Quality of Life Scale (QLS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The QLS is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). Definitions were provided for 4 anchor points of the 7 points. Each item had a brief description of the judgement to be made and a set of suggested probes for the clinician. The total score was calculated as the sum of all 21 items giving a range of 0 to 126, where the higher score indicated normal or unimpaired functioning.</description>

The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). The Common Objects and Activities domain score was calculated as the sum of 2 items (numbers 18 and 19) giving a range of 0 to 12, where the higher score indicated less unimpaired functioning.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 28 in the 'Instrumental Role' QLS Domain Score</title>
          <description>The QLS is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). The Instrumental Role domain score was calculated as the sum of 4 items (numbers 9 to 12) giving a range of 0 to 24, where the higher score indicated less unimpaired functioning.</description>
          <population>Effectiveness data is based on all patients who received study medicine, who had a valid baseline assessment, and at least 1 valid post-baseline assessment of the QLS (Full analysis set). Effectiveness was measured at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16, and 28.</population>

The 20 items (10 positive and 10 negative statements) are grouped in 5 subscales (mental functioning, self-control, physical functioning, emotional regulation and social integration). Each subscale contains 4 items. Each item was rated on a six-point Likert scale, from not at all to very much. A score was calculated for each subscale, and the total score ranged from 20 to 120, where the higher score indicated better well-being.</description>
