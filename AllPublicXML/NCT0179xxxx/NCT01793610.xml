      This small (&quot;pilot&quot;) study is designed to provide information on whether psychotherapy
      combined with the drug MDMA is safe and helpful for people with posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). The researchers plan to use the results of this study to design further studies. This
      study will compare two doses of MDMA active dose 1, two doses of MDMA active dose 2, or
      comparator-dose MDMA. There will be an initial dose possibly followed one and a half to two
      and a half hours later by a second dose half the size of the first dose. The study will
      measure symptoms of PTSD, depression, general psychological well-being and sleep after a low
      dose versus active doses of MDMA. Subjects experiencing pain or tinnitus (ringing in the
      ears) at the start of the study will report on levels of pain or tinnitus during the study.
      The study will also examine whether following the standardized treatment is related to
      changes in PTSD symptoms. Subjects will be prepared for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy prior to
      the first session, and he or she will work with the same pair of therapists after having two
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions, with the second session occurring three to five weeks
      after the first session. Symptoms of PTSD, depression, general psychological well-being,
      feeling that you or the world are unreal (dissociation), potential positive effects of
      traumatic events and sleep quality will be assessed one month after the second MDMA-assisted
      session. Cognitive function will be measured one month after the second MDMA-assisted
      session. Participants who received comparator-dose MDMA can enroll in Stage 2, wherein they
      will have three MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions. People who received either active-dose
      MDMA will have a third MDMA-assisted session. Cognitive function will be measured again after
      two months last Stage 1 or Stage 2 MDMA-assisted session.Subject PTSD symptoms, depression
      psychological symptoms, other symptoms and sleep two months after their final MDMA-assisted
      session and at least 12 months after they began the study.

    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that can develop after people
      experience a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life threatening event.
      PTSD is a worldwide health problem. PTSD is treated with psychotherapy or drugs, but these
      treatments do not help everyone. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted
      psychotherapy might be a potential treatment for PTSD. MDMA is the active ingredient in
      ecstasy. Before it was made illegal, some psychotherapists combined MDMA with psychotherapy
      to help treat people with psychological problems, including PTSD.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind dose-response study comparing comparator-dose MDMA
      with full-dose MDMA. The study drug will be given as an initial dose possibly followed 1.5
      hours later by a second dose half the size of the first dose. This Phase 2 pilot study will
      examine the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in 23 subjects with chronic,
      treatment-resistant PTSD of at least 6 months duration who were unable to recover despite
      having received prior treatment with either drug or psychotherapy, or who discontinued
      treatment due to lack of tolerance for the treatment. Seven subjects will be randomized to
      full-dose MDMA and five subjects will be randomized to comparator-dose MDMA.

      MDMA will be administered in two experimental sessions lasting up to 8 hours and scheduled
      three to five weeks apart.

      The study will last up to one and a half years, including approximately three to five months
      of psychotherapy, and a long-term follow up visit scheduled a year after the final
      experimental session. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination to make
      sure that they can take part in the study. Once in the study, they will see the same male and
      female psychotherapist for the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA-assisted
      psychotherapy and the investigators will learn more about the subject during three
      preparatory sessions occurring before the first experimental session. During experimental
      sessions, subjects will receive an initial dose of either full or comparator-dose MDMA along
      with psychotherapy, and one and a half to two and a half hours later, the subject may have a
      supplemental dose half the size of the initial dose of MDMA. Vital signs and psychological
      distress will be measured throughout the experimental session. There will be three
      integrative psychotherapy sessions after each experimental session, including one occurring
      the day after an experimental session. Subjects will express, understand, bring together and
      connect any of their thoughts or feelings about your symptoms and their causes, and they will
      discuss their experience during experimental sessions with the therapists.

      Subjects will learn whether they received the comparator or the full dose of MDMA one month
      after their second experimental session. Subjects who received full-dose MDMA will finish
      Stage 1 and have a third experimental session, while subjects who received comparator-dose
      may go on to Stage 2, an open-label stage that is nearly identical to stage 1, with one
      instead of three preparatory sessions, and with experimental sessions with one of two active
      doses of MDMA.

      Symptoms of PTSD and depression, sleep quality, general psychological well-being,
      dissociation and posttraumatic growth (potentially positive effects of experiencing a
      traumatic event) will be measured in all subjects at baseline, one month after the second
      experimental session and 12 months after their final experimental session. Cognitive function
      will be assessed in all subjects at baseline and one month after the second experimental
      session. Participant reporting pain or tinnitus will record their symptoms throughout the
      study via visual analog scale. Subjects who received either Active Dose 1 or Active Dose 2
      and go on to the third experimental session will complete questionnaires and measures of
      their symptoms of PTSD and depression, general psychological well-being, dissociation, sleep
      quality and posttraumatic growth two months after the third experimental session. Depending
      upon condition assignment or continuation to Stage 2, cognitive function will be assessed two
      months after the third Stage 1 or Stage 2 session. Subjects assigned to comparator-dose MDMA
      will be tested one month after their second Stage 2 experimental session and two months after
      the third experimental session. People will also complete measures of their experience of the
      experimental session soon after each experimental session.

      This study will compare the effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with comparator versus
      full-dose MDMA, and it will also assess the duration of any changes in symptoms a year after
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.
