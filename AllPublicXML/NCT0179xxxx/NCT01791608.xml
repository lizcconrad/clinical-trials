  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infection and acute diarrhea are among the most prevalent diseases of
      childhood increase the burden of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years.

      Among the possible strategies for its prevention is important to count on good nutritional
      status for use in developing a good immune response to infections. Zinc deficiency has been
      shown to favor the development of infections and has been considered a real public health
      problem.

      Within the zinc compounds used are zinc amino acid chelate and zinc sulphate, the first that
      has shown evidence of being better absorbed and tolerated.

      We propose a study showing the effectiveness of zinc amino acid chelate and zinc sulphate in
      the prevention of acute diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection.
