  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achievement of a deep and long-durated anesthesia is vital before most endodontic procedures;
      therefore, the investigators conducted this study to compare the local infiltration effect of
      epinephrine-containing lidocaine with/ without fentanyl on depth and duration of anesthesia
      in maxillary molars with painful irreversible pulpitis.

      This study was planned with a randomized double-blind, parallel design clinical trial on 64
      healthy patients after taking into account some inclusion and exclusion criteria. The control
      group were received the mixture of normal saline and 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine
      and the experimental group were received the mixture of fentanyl and 2% lidocaine with
      1:200,000 epinephrine. The depth and duration of pulpal anesthesia were evaluated with an
      electric pulp testing in 5-minute intervals during a period of 60 minutes and the pain
      intensity recorded in five times, before injection, after injection, during access cavity
      preparation, pulpotomy and pulpectomy using visual analog scale(VAS). All data were analyzed
      and compared using chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests.
