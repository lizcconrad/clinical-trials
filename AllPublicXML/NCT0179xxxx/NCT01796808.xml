  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that the average person with an eighty year old life span will walk the
      distance of the world twice in their lifetime. The foot is comprised of a specialized fat pad
      to provide shock absorption and protection against breakdown. With all the walking humans do
      however, foot fat pad breakdown is inevitable. Trauma to the foot is compounded in the
      diabetic patients due to many reasons: loss of protective sensation secondary to neuropathy,
      reduced skin hydration, decreased soft tissue elasticity, elevated blood sugars and increased
      body weight to name a few. Increased foot pressure and decreased fat pad protection are the
      main contributing factors to callus formation, foot pain and ulcer formation.

      Fat grafting is a cosmetic and reconstructive procedure that is used sometimes to help
      improve one's soft tissue thickness, shape and integrity. Autologous fat transplantation is a
      procedure using a patient's own fat that is taken by a small liposuction tube, from areas
      with a substantial amount of fat ( i.e. abdomen or thighs) and then transferred into the fat
      atrophied (decreased or worn out) area (in this case, the foot).

      The investigators are performing this research in an effort to decrease foot pressure during
      activity and to increase the soft tissue thickness of the sole of the foot during one's
      lifetime. Ultimately this could help reduce foot pain, callus formation and even ulcer
      formation. The goal of this research is to see whether fat grafting will help decrease the
      prevalence of the aforementioned foot complications. The investigators hope that by using
      one's own fat tissue, he or she may have a longer duration of relief than by using other
      methods.

      This is a randomized, cross-over designed study. Randomized means that patients will be
      enrolled by chance (like the flip of a coin) to one of two groups for the first part of the
      study. Cross-over means that, after the first part of the study or at one year, patients will
      move into the opposite group. One group will receive the fat grafting procedure with one year
      follow up (year A pathway) and the other will receive standard of care treatment from the
      patient's primary podiatrist during the first year (year B pathway). After the first year,
      patients will switch to the opposite year pathway for the next 12 months. Participation in
      this study will last approximately 24-26 months.

      The etiology of plantar fat pad atrophy may be age-related, due abnormal foot mechanics,
      steroid use, or collagen vascular disease. Displacement or atrophy of the fat pad can lead to
      osseous prominences in the forefoot that may be seen with painful skin lesions. Disease
      states, such as diabetes, may have loss of soft tissue integrity. Fat pad atrophy, regardless
      of the etiology, may result in significant pain, epidermal lesions, or metatarsalgia. In
      sensate patients, the pain can lead to emotional and physical pain, leading to productivity
      and financial losses.1

      It is well documented that plantar pressure is directly correlated with plantar tissue
      thickness, with the loss of plantar fat being a fundamental mechanism for pressure related
      foot disorders.2,3 Autologous fat grafting to areas of plantar fat pad atrophy may reduce
      plantar pressures, and thus serve as a treatment for metatarsalgia, corn and callus
      prevention, and possibly ulcer prevention in diabetics. Plastic surgeons, with significant
      skills in fat grafting, can make a significant contribution.

      Current treatment modalities for fat pad atrophy include silicone injections, fat injections,
      and other temporary fillers; however, no objective studies using autologous fat have been
      performed. Approximately 30 adults who experience pain from fat pad atrophy, will have the
      option to participate. Through a randomized, controlled, cross-over study, some patients will
      receive autologous fat grafting, while some will receive standard of care podiatric
      treatment, then cross-over to fat grafting treatment after a year. Through pedobarograph and
      ultrasound assessments, the focal pedal pressure and tissue thickness following treatment
      will be documented over two years.

      The investigators hypothesize that fat grafting for areas of increased pedal pressure will
      help decrease foot pressure during gait and increase soft tissue thickness on the foot pad,
      ultimately reducing pain. The investigators also hope to demonstrate that by using autologous
      fat with evidence-based fat transfer techniques, results may be durable. This pilot study
      will help build new collaborative efforts between Foot and Ankle Surgery, Podiatry and
      Plastic Surgery, combining expertise in foot biomechanics with reconstructive fat grafting.

    <description>Fat grafting is a minimally invasive clinical procedure that has been widely used by plastic surgeons within reconstructive surgery for many years and is considered a standard of care procedure in plastic surgery. Fat tissue to be used for grafting is harvested (usually from abdomen or thighs) with a small liposuction cannula. The fat tissue is then sterilely centrifuged and allowed to decant before separating the fluid and oil layers from the fat tissue fraction. The aspirated fat is then loaded into 1cc syringes and injected into the plantar fat pad using specialized injection cannulas.
Postoperatively, the foot will be bandaged for twenty-four hours and the subject will be advised to limit ambulation. Over the next three weeks, the patient will be instructed to wear a cushioned, supportive sneaker and participate in only activities of normal daily living, with no excessive aerobic activity.</description>

    <intervention_name>Local anesthetic</intervention_name>
    <description>To numb the foot for the fat grafting procedure, lidocaine with epinephrine will be used. This will be injected near the posterior tibial nerve to numb the bottom of the foot.
Local anesthetic of lidocaine with epinephrine will also be used to numb the fat graft harvest site (i.e. abdomen or thigh). This will allow a small incision to make so that tumescent solution can be injected into the area of fat graft harvest. Tumescent solution is a combination of injectible saline, epinephrine and lidocaine that causes numbness and vasoconstriction in the area where the fat will be harvested. This limits pain and bruising during the procedures. Only a very small amount of tumescent should be needed (i.e. &lt;200ml). Only a few cc's of fat are needed for injection into the foot.</description>
