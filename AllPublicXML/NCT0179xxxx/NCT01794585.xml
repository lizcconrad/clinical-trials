      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectivenes of a home-based physical therapy
      program designed to improve balance following traumatic brain injury by incorporating the use
      of a virtual reality system.

    <measure>Change from Baseline on Community Balance and Mobility (CB&amp;M)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-weeks, 12 weeks, 24weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Specifically developed to assess balance function for individuals with TBI. Includes 13 balance based activites such as single leg standing, tandem walking, hopping, running, descending stairs.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6weeks, 12weeks, 24weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Used to evaluate balance system function. Movement characteristics and timed criteria are used to rate 36 items on a scale of 0 (maximum limitation) to 3 (within normal limits).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on Activity-specific, Behavior Confidence Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6weeks, 12weeks, 24weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Used to assess fear of falling, the ABC scale includes 16 items that describe everyday community activities and which are scored on a scale of 0 (no confidence) to 100 (complete confidence).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools-Objective (PART-O)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12weeks, 24weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 17-item assessment of community participation will be used to measure overall societal participation.</description>

    <description>A structured, individually tailored, protocol driven, reproducible therapeutic intervention. The study intervention will consist of individually prescribed selections from three off-the-shelf VR games that target the type and severity of balance deficits elicited during the completion of a baseline assessment. Participants randomized to receive this intervention will be assigned a home balance program that utilizes an Xbox Kinect system to provide balance activities.</description>

    <description>An individualized home balance exercise program that also targets identified balance system-specific deficits, however, utilizes no VR components.</description>

          -  is at least one year post TBI;

          -  is at least 18 and no more than 64 years of age at the time of enrollment;

          -  is English or Spanish speaking

          -  is at least three months beyond completion of formal PT, including acute inpatient
             rehabilitation, outpatient and home-based therapy;

          -  provides written medical clearance for participation in an in-home balance exercise
             program;

          -  ambulates independently within the home (with assistive devices and/or orthotics as
             needed);

          -  has active range of motion of bilateral upper extremities of at least 90 degrees of
             abduction to allow for control of the VR system;

             behavioral reaction;

          -  self-reports ongoing balance deficits and demonstrate such deficits by scoring at or
             below one standard deviation above the mean (75 or below) on the CB&amp;M; and

          -  provides informed consent, or has a guardian available to provide consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  has a history of another medical illness or neurological disorder which may affect
             balance;

          -  has experienced a seizure within the last year;

          -  has a history of psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization;

          -  is currently participating in another RCT;

          -  is currently using VR technology to address specific balance goals;

          -  is unable to communicate effectively to complete standardized assessments;

          -  has cognitive impairment that precludes completion of baseline testing;

          -  is unavailable to participate in 12 continuous weeks of therapy;

          -  has no access to television able to connect to VR-gaming system; and
