      The effectiveness of antibiotic treatment at reducing post-abortion infection is unclear. The
      experiences of women prescribed routine antibiotics after medical abortion is missing from
      the existing evidence. This study seeks to add to the literature evidence of the side effects
      associated with antibiotic treatment that women experience and their adherence to prescribed
      regimens.

      Medical abortion (MA) consists of administering medication, typically a combination of
      mifepristone and misoprostol, to induce an abortion without any invasive procedures. Early
      first trimester MA is effective1, highly acceptable to women, and safe. The risk of infection
      following medical abortion is small, at less than 1%. In rare circumstances, pelvic infection
      with clostridia bacteria following medical abortion has resulted in death. Since 2000, when
      mifepristone was registered in the United States, 8 such deaths have been recorded in the US.

      Following the publication of case reports of four clostridium-associated deaths after medical
      abortion in 2005, the reproductive health community reacted swiftly. Medical abortion
      protocols were altered in an effort to curb these drastic and rapidly fatal infections.
      Antibiotic treatment, typically a seven-day course of doxycycline, has become widespread in
      the United States.

        This study will enroll 610 women. Women will be recruited from 5 clinics and will
        self-administer, or if necessary, a study coordinator will administer, a computer-based
        questionnaire 7-14 days following administration of mifepristone.
