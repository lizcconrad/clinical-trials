    <textblock>
      In a 4-arm, Randomized Control Trial among members of CVS Caremark or Penn Medicine Patients
      with suboptimal cholesterol control who are at high risk for CVD, the study investigators
      propose to test the effectiveness of different behavioral economic techniques in inducing
      habit formation for adherence to statin use and sustained reductions in LDL cholesterol after
      financial incentives are discontinued. Primary outcome is changes in LDL from enrollment to
      12 months (6 months after cessation of financial incentives).
