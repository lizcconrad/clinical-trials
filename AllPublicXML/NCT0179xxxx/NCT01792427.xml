    <textblock>
      In this study we analyzed the overall survival for all newly diagnosed patients with
      non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis from June 2006 onwards. The investigators wanted to
      confirm the known risk factors such as age, gender, smoking history and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and evaluate the impact on survival of etiology, number of different
      bacteriological species in retrospective and prospective sputa, azithromycin use and
      presence/development of pulmonary hypertension.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically significant and radiologically proven bronchiectasis

          -  Chest CT scan confirming the presence of bronchiectatic lesions and had symptoms of
             chronic productive cough

          -  Bronchiectasis was deemed to be present if there was one or more of the following
             criteria: a bronchoarterial ratio greater than 1, lack of tapering of the bronchi and
             visualization of bronchi within 1 cm of costal or paravertebral pleura or abutting the
             mediastinal pleura

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosis of cystic fibrosis

          -  underlying tumoral problem causing the bronchiectatic lesions (postradiotherapy,
             secondary immunodeficiency due to chemotherapy or postinfectious due to tumoral
             obstruction)

          -  patients with asymptomatic traction bronchiectasis caused by interstitial lung disease
