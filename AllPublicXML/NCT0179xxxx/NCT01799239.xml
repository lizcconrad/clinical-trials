    <description>leakage is measured using a 4-point leakage scale developed by Coloplast A/S. At every baseplate change the subjects had to look at the skin facing side of the baseplate and access which of the four scenarios described below provided an accurate description of the baseplate.
The subjects tick of one of the four possible answers:
No leakage
Starting to leak (leakage under the baseplate)
Leakage (seepage of faeces resulting in leakage on clothes)
Sudden leakage (the baseplate pops off resulting in sudden leakage under the baseplate and outside the baseplate)</description>
