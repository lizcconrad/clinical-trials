      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals'
      HZ/su vaccine in adults with solid tumours undergoing chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      The study will be randomised into two groups based on the vaccination schedule in relation to
      the start of a chemotherapy cycle:

        -  The OnChemo group receives their first HZ/su vaccination at the start of a chemotherapy
           cycle,

        -  The PreChemo group receives their first HZ/su vaccination at least 10 days before the
           start of a chemotherapy cycle.

      The protocol summary has been updated following Protocol Amendment 2, August 2014, leading to
      the increase of the enrolment.

             malignancy, i.e., not a blood element malignancy).

          -  Subject who is receiving or will receive a cytotoxic or immunosuppressive chemotherapy
             (such that the study vaccine can be administered at the latest at the start of the
             second cycle of chemotherapy).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than one year.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study:

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
                  hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause;

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects receiving only newer, more targeted therapies if not taken together with a
             classical chemotherapy.

          -  Chronic administration and/or planned administration of systemic glucocorticoids
             within one month prior to the first vaccine dose and up to Visit 3 (Month 2). Inhaled,

          -  Previous vaccination against HZ or varicella within 12 months preceding the first dose
             of study vaccine/ placebo.

          -  Planned administration during the study of a HZ vaccine (including an investigational
             or non-registered vaccine) other than the study vaccine.

          -  Previous chemotherapy course less than one month before first study vaccination.

          -  Occurrence of a varicella or HZ episode by clinical history within the 12 months
             preceding the first dose of study vaccine/ placebo.

             the vaccine or study material and equipment.

          -  Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30
             days before the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of

             vaccine within 8 days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine.

          -  HIV infection by clinical history.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. Acute disease is defined as the
             presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever, but excludes the
             underlying malignancy, as well as the expected symptoms/signs associated with that
             disease or its treatment:

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F on oral, axillary or tympanic
                  setting, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal setting. The preferred route for
                  recording temperature in this study will be oral.

               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
                  infection) without fever, may receive the first dose of study vaccine/ placebo at
                  the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular
             injection unsafe.

             precautions (if of childbearing potential) before Month 3 (i.e., 2 months after the
