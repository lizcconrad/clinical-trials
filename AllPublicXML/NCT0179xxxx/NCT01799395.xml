  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer may cause central airway obstruction through several different mechanisms
      (invasion by the primary tumor, invasion by metastatic lymph nodes, airway metastasis).

      The aim of the present study is to determine the prevalence at the time of diagnosis, the
      incidence at 1 year from the diagnosis, and the predictors of central airway obstruction
      associated with advanced lung cancer.

    <description>All patients with advanced lung cancer candidate for chemotherapy or chemotherapy + radiation therapy will be enrolled and followed-up for 1 year clinically and radiologically (Chest CT) to verify whether or not central airway obstruction is present at the time of diagnosis or occurs in the year following diagnosis (or in the life span from diagnosis and death in patients who die before 1 year of diagnosis). Furthermore, predictor variables possibly associated with central airway obstruction will be studied.</description>
