    <textblock>
      Obesity is perhaps the most urgent public health crisis in pediatrics. Thus, managing
      childhood obesity is a top priority among pediatricians in primary care settings. However,
      effective treatment typically is multidisciplinary, and most practices currently do not have
      the infrastructure for coordinating integrated care. With the advent of the Affordable Care
      Act (ACA), innovative systems for building multidisciplinary teams to provide integrated care
      through a patient-centered medical home will be at a strategic advantage. The use of
      electronic technologies for delivering health-related information or services, known as
      telehealth, is an innovation with the potential to streamline integrated care and transform
      interventions for chronic diseases. We propose a pilot study to evaluate telehealth for
      treating pediatric obesity in collaboration with a community practice (Wareham Pediatrics).

      Patients aged 10 to 17 years who participate in the telehealth intervention study (N=40) will
      be randomly assigned to an &quot;immediate&quot; intervention group or a &quot;wait list&quot; control group.
      Subjects in the &quot;immediate&quot; intervention group will begin the 6-month telehealth intervention
      at the time of enrollment in the study and then receive general patient/family counseling
      from their primary care providers (PCPs) at routine office visits during a 6-month follow-up
      period. Those in the &quot;wait list&quot; control group will receive general patient/family counseling
      from their PCPs for 6 months followed by the telehealth intervention for 6 months. Thus, the
      total duration of participation in the study for each subject will be 12 months. The
      telehealth intervention will include dietary, physical activity, and behavioral management
      counseling provided by videoconferencing from the OWL clinical providers at Boston Children's
      Hospital to children in their homes, or at a telehealth station at Wareham Pediatrics.

    <description>Telehealth visits will alternate between a dietitian and behavioral medicine provider for either 30 minutes or 1 hour. Over a 6-month period, 12 telehealth sessions will be scheduled for each participant. The dietitian will provide dietary and physical activity recommendations, and the behavioral medicine provider will counsel on strategies for achieving specific goals. Applying a Chronic Care Model, self-management support will be augmented by linkages to community resources.</description>
