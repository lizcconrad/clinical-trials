    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (how the
      drug concentrations change over time) of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg when administered as a
      single dose in healthy male volunteers.

      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), randomized (treatment
      sequences will be assigned by chance) study of a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg
      administered orally (by mouth) in approximately 36 healthy male participants under fasted and
      fed conditions. Three doses of abiraterone acetate will be administered with a 7-day washout
      period between each dose. The total study duration for each participant will be 21 days.
      Participants will be randomized to one of six treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB,
      CBA): Treatment A = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered after a high-fat meal; Treatment
      B = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered after a low-fat meal; Treatment C = abiraterone
      acetate 1000 mg administered in the fasted state. No food will be ingested for 4 hours
      post-dose. Participants will be confined at the clinical research unit from the day prior to
      dosing until clinic discharge on the day following dosing in each treatment period. Serial
      pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and safety will be monitored throughout the study.
