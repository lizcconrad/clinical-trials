  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the treatment of choice for tibial fracture is intramedullary nailing. This
      procedure has been shown to have low rates of infection, high rates of bone healing, and a
      faster return to weight bearing and activity in comparison to conservative treatment. In
      concurrent fractures of the posterior or medial malleolus and the tibia, it is now common to
      identify, reduce, and fix the malleolar fracture prior to intramedullary nailing of the
      tibia. In this retrospective study, our aim is to establish that reducing malleolar fractures
      prior to tibial nailing is a safe treatment in which the reduction of the malleolus is
      maintained intraoperatively, postoperatively, and remains reduced until the fracture has
      healed.
