      This randomized clinical trial studies metformin hydrochloride in overweight or obese
      patients at elevated risk for breast cancer. Metformin hydrochloride may decrease the
      expression of early tumor makers in breast tissue of patients at increased risk for breast
      cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the changes in the signal pathway profiling of breast tissue using reverse
      phase proteomics in tissue biopsy of overweight or obese women at elevated risk for breast
      cancer treated with metformin (metformin hydrochloride) (850mg orally twice a day) for 12
      cycles.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of metformin on breast tissue density of overweight or obese women
      at elevated risk for breast cancer using qualitative mammographic fat density criteria.

      II. To determine the effect of metformin on the insulin axis in serum of overweight or obese
      women at elevated risk for breast cancer treated with metformin (850mg orally twice a day)
      for 12 cycles.

      III. To determine the toxicities associated with metformin.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride by mouth once daily on days 1-30 in course 1
      and twice daily on days 1-30 thereafter. Treatment repeats every 30 days for 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo by mouth once daily on days 1-30 in course 1 and twice daily
      on days 1-30 thereafter. Treatment repeats every 30 days for 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reverse phase proteomic assays (RPPA) will be performed to measure changes in the phosphorylation of proteins after metformin exposure. Changes in the phosphorylation of proteins after metformin exposure will be calculated and compared using two-sample t-tests. As a supplemental analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to model the 12 month levels adjusted for baseline. Assumptions for analysis will be checked and non-parametric methods used if needed; however it is expected that the data will be normally distributed on the log scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in ordinal level of breast density</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in ordinal level of breast density will be performed using the breast density criteria previously established by Boyd and colleagues (New England Journal of Medicine 2007). Each image will be grouped into one of six categories: 0%, &lt;10%, 10-25%, 25-50%, 50-75% and &gt;75%. Changes will be compared between the two groups using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests.</description>
