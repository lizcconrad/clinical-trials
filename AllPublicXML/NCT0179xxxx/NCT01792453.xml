    <textblock>
      The GI MRI Research group at the University of Nottingham has been developing new,
      non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to image the gastrointestinal tract.
      The investigators now want to characterise; in collaboration with the College of Pharmacy at
      the University of Michigan, the fasting volumes of gastric and small bowel liquid and their
      time courses over 2 hours after drinking the FDA recommended 240 mL of water drink for oral
      solid dosage forms testing.

    <textblock>
      Solid oral delivery is the most frequently used route of administration for pharmaceutical
      drug products. Along with other important physiological parameters, the volume of liquid in
      the small intestine (SILV) has the potential to greatly influence the rate and extent of drug
      dissolution and absorption in the GI tract, or &quot;oral bioperformance&quot;. Modeled small bowel
      absorption of a drug can vary by more than five-fold as SILV decreases from 500 to 50 ml. To
      obtain reasonable predictions of oral bioperformance scientists must design meaningful in
      vitro dissolution tests and mechanistic drug transport models that capture the range of SILV
      in humans. However, little is known about liquid volumes in the gut, mostly due to
      invasiveness of previous techniques. A recent study has drawn great attention to the
      possibility of the liquid in the small intestine existing in discrete liquid &quot;pockets&quot; hence
      it would also be desirable to monitor the time courses and volumes of individual water
      pockets in the small intestine.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the ideal tool to carry out serial and non-invasive
      imaging of gastrointestinal function. MRI is inherently suited to image liquid materials and
      this ability has been exploited to image liquids in the undisturbed gastrointestinal tract.
      Gastric emptying measurements have been long established and validated. Small bowel liquid
      volumes measurements have been recently validated against naso-duodenal infusion. Ultimately,
      the findings with this study will provide novel insights on the volume and distribution of
      ingested liquids in the gastrointestinal tract.
