  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in New Zealand (40% of all
      deaths). 37% of New Zealanders suffer from high blood pressure (World Health Organisation
      2008 figures), a well established modifiable risk factor for CVD. Above 115/75 mmHg, CVD risk
      doubles for each increment of 20/10 mmHg that blood pressure is raised. An increase in BMI
      and waist circumference has been associated with an increase in blood pressure. The leaves of
      the olive plant are rich in plant compounds known as polyphenols. This particular group of
      polyphenols are known secoiridoids, which are also present in olive oil and olives though at
      lower concentrations, are only found in this family of plants. Diets high in polyphenols have
      been found to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Studies have shown that consumption of
      phenolic-rich olive leaf extract (OLE) can significantly reduce blood pressure in individuals
      suffering from high blood pressure (hypertension), with the magnitude of effect being
      comparable to a commonly used antihypertensive drug. In such trials OLE also resulted in an
      improved blood lipid (a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerides) which
      also reduces CVD risk. One study testing the effect of OLE on individuals with mild or
      prehypertension (i.e. those with systolic blood pressure in the range 121-139 mmHg and
      diastolic blood pressure in the range 81-89 mmHg but not taking antihypertensive medication)
      also found these same improvements. OLE has been indicated to have the potential to improve
      other cardiovascular risk markers such as vascular function, inflammation, platelet
      aggregation, oxidation of LDL and glucose tolerance however much of this evidence is derived
      from animal, in vitro and ex vivo studies and so well designed and controlled human studies
      are required to verify that these findings are applicable to humans. Therefore OLE
      supplementation may be a useful dietary strategy for reducing CVD risk in a cohort of
      overweight prehypertensive individuals.

      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of OLE intake on blood pressure and other CVD
      risk markers in overweight subjects with mild hypertension and to link any study outcomes
      with the presence of OLE phenolics in urine
