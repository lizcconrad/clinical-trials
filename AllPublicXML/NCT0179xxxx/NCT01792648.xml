  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased abdominal adiposity is a key feature of metabolic syndrome, which describes a
      cluster of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors that also includes insulin resistance,
      high blood pressure and an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype characterized by increased
      plasma triglycerides, low HDL-C, and increased levels of small LDL particles. While lifestyle
      intervention remains the cornerstone for managing obesity and metabolic syndrome, the optimal
      dietary macronutrient distribution for improving blood lipids and CVD risk remains a topic of
      controversy. While both low carbohydrate diets and weight reduction are effective for
      managing atherogenic dyslipidemia, long-term compliance is low, and it becomes imperative to
      identify alternative dietary approaches.

      Increased consumption of almonds has been shown to lower LDL-C, an effect that exceeds that
      predicted from changes in fatty acid intake. However, although LDL-C lowering by almonds has
      been demonstrated in patients with diabetes, there have been no trials in non-diabetic
      patients with abdominal obesity. Moreover, there is limited information of the effects of
      almond intake on LDL particle subclasses.

      The overall objective of the present study is to determine whether lipoprotein measures of
      CVD risk in individuals with increased abdominal adiposity are reduced by almond
      supplementation in a diet with overall macronutrient content that conforms to current
      guidelines. Our main hypothesis is that in these individuals, almond consumption can reduce
      levels of small and medium LDL particles without the need to restrict dietary carbohydrates
      to levels below those currently recommended.

      This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the lipoprotein effects of an almond-supplemented
      diet (20%E) with those of two reference diets that do not contain almond products: one with
      similar content of carbohydrate, protein, and fat (standard reference), and the other in
      which carbohydrate content is reduced by substitution of protein and monounsaturated fat
      (low-carbohydrate reference).

      We will provide the diets for 3 weeks each in a randomized 3-period crossover design to 40
      individuals with increased abdominal adiposity. We will test whether the almond supplemented
      diet will result in lower levels of lipoprotein measures of CVD risk, specifically LDL-C and
      small and medium LDL particles, compared to either the standard or low-carbohydrate reference
      diets.
