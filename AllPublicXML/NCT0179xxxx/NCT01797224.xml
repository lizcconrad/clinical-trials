    <textblock>
      The purpose of the OTIS Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy Study is to monitor planned and
      unplanned pregnancies exposed to certain medications, to evaluate the possible teratogenic
      effect of these medications and to follow live born infants for five years after birth. With
      respect to fetal outcome, it is important to evaluate the spectrum of outcomes that may be
      relevant to a medication exposure during pregnancy, and these include both easily
      recognizable defects which are visible at birth, as well as more subtle or delayed defects
      that may not be readily identifiable without special expertise and observation beyond the
      newborn period.

      The purpose of the OTIS Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy Project, Cimzia Pregnancy Exposure
      Registry is to follow pregnant women with or without a Cimzia approved indication who have or
      have not been treated with Cimzia during pregnancy to evaluate the possible effect of these
      diseases, and or this medication on the pregnancy outcome including child development and
      growth up to five years of age.
