    <textblock>
      Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) refers to a pathological condition where the sinonasal mucosa is
      inflamed for greater than 12 weeks(1). It is associated with a constellation of symptoms,
      including facial pain, anosmia, and nasal congestion. It has been estimated that CRS affects
      close to 5% of the Canadian population(2). When medical therapy fails, patients are often
      referred to Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgeons for consideration of surgical management.
      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is one of the mainstays of therapy for CRS that has failed
      medical management(3). Traditionally, the microdebrider has been the go-to tool for
      performing these surgeries, but recently the Coblator (ArthroCare, Austin, Texas) has begun
      to define its' role in surgery. By using bipolar radiofrequency energy to ablate tissue (with
      temperatures up to 60Ëš C)(4), theoretically the Coblator will result in less bleeding than
      so-called &quot;cold&quot; surgical techniques (i.e. the microdebrider). In a retrospective study by
      Eloy et. al, patients with CRS and nasal polyposis had a statistically significant amount of
      less intraoperative blood loss when the Coblator was used in their surgery, than those
      patients who underwent surgery with the microdebrider. The investigators plan to further
      investigate this in a randomized, controlled fashion
