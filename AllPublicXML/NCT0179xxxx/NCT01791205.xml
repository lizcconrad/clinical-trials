  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in routine
      clinical practice in Italy. In the retrospective Part 1 of the study, clinical and
      demographic factors associated with the use of a biologic drug in monotherapy as compared to
      therapy in combination with Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) will be
      evaluated. In the retrospective/prospective Part 2 of the study, efficacy and safety of the
      use of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in monotherapy will be evaluated. Patients will be
      followed for up to18 months.

    <description>Percentage of participants with change in HAQ (Delta HAQ) of &gt;= 0.21 after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months from the first infusion with tocilizumab as monotherapy are reported. The HAQ consisted of 20 questions in eight domains (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities) rated on a 4-point scale, where 0 (equals) = without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2= with great difficulties; and 3= unable to perform these actions at all. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores and ranged from 0 (mild disability) to 3 (severe disability), where higher scores represents higher disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Phase II: Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events, Any Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest, and Tubercular Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions that worsened during the study were reported as AE. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or results in disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect. The AE were captured only for Phase II.</description>

        <title>Phase I: Number of Participants With Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index in Monotherapy and Combination Therapy</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a participant-reported questionnaire that measured quality of life in terms of physical function of participants with rheumatoid arthritis. It consisted of 20 questions in eight domains (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities) rated on a 4-point scale, where 0 (equals) = without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2= with great difficulties; and 3= unable to perform these actions at all. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores and ranged from 0 (mild disability) to 3 (severe disability), where higher scores represents higher disease activity. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past seven days. Participants with scores =&lt; 0.8625 and &gt; 0.8625 are reported.</description>

        <title>Phase II: Retention Rate in Therapy, Percentage of Participants Achieving DAS 28 ESR &lt;2.6 and &lt;3.2 at Month 18</title>
        <description>Participants who retained the therapy were analyzed for disease activity (DAS28 ESR) at Month 18. The DAS28 ESR is a measure of the participant’s disease activity calculated using TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PtGA using 0-10 cm VAS (0 = no disease activity and 10 = worst disease activity), and ESR. It is calculated by using the following formula: DAS28 ESR = 0.56 x square root of TJC + 0.28 x square root of SJC + 0.70 x log n at ESR + 0.014 x PtGA. The DAS28 ESR scores ranged from 0.49 (less disease activity) to 9.07 (maximal disease activity); decrease in score indicated improvement of disease.</description>

        <title>Phase I: Mean Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index in Monotherapy and Combination Therapy</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a participant-reported questionnaire that measured quality of life in terms of physical function of participants with rheumatoid arthritis. It consisted of 20 questions in eight domains (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities) rated on a 4-point scale, where 0 (equals) = without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2= with great difficulties; and 3= unable to perform these actions at all. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores and ranged from 0 (mild disability) to 3 (severe disability), where higher scores represents higher disease activity. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past seven days.</description>

        <title>Phase II: Percentage of Participants Maintaining Delta DAS 28 CRP of &gt;= 0.6 at Months 3, 6, 12, and 18</title>
        <description>Participants who maintained the change in DAS28 (Delta DAS28) CRP of &gt;=0.6 after 3, 6, 12, and 18 months from the first infusion with tocilizumab as monotherapy are reported. The DAS28-CRP is a combined index that measured RA disease activity. It is calculated using TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PtGA using 0-10 cm VAS (0 = no disease activity and 10 = worst disease activity), and CRP (mg/dL). It is calculated by using the formula: DAS28 CRP= 0.56 × square root of TJC 28 + 0.28 square root of SJC 28 + 0.36 × log n at (CRP+1) + 0.014 × PtGA + 0.96. The DAS28 CRP- scores ranged from 0.49 (less disease activity) to 9.07 (maximal disease activity); decrease in score indicated improvement of disease.</description>

The DAS28 ESR is a measure of the participant’s disease activity calculated using TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PtGA using 0-10 cm VAS (0 = no disease activity and 10 = worst disease activity), and ESR. It is calculated by using the following formula: DAS28 ESR = 0.56 x square root of TJC + 0.28 x square root of SJC + 0.70 x log n at ESR + 0.014 x PtGA. The DAS28 ESR scores ranged from 0.49 (less disease activity) to 9.07 (maximal disease activity); where decrease in score indicated improvement of disease.</description>

        <title>Phase II: Percentage of Participants Achieving DAS 28 ESR (&lt; 2.6) and Low Disease Activity (&lt;3.2) at Months 3, 6, 12, and 18</title>
        <description>The DAS28 ESR is a measure of the participant’s disease activity calculated using TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PtGA using 0-10 cm VAS (0 = no disease activity and 10 = worst disease activity), and ESR. It is calculated by using the following formula: DAS28 ESR = 0.56 x square root of TJC + 0.28 x square root of SJC + 0.70 x log n at ESR + 0.014 x PtGA. The DAS28 ESR scores ranged from 0.49 (less disease activity) to 9.07 (maximal disease activity); decrease in score indicated improvement of disease. The DAS28 ESR &lt; 2.6 indicates disease remission and &gt;=2.6 to 3.2 indicates low disease activity.</description>

The CDAI total score ranges from 0 (no disease activity) to 76 (maximal disease activity), where higher scores represents higher disease activity.

        <description>The mean change from Baseline (day of the first infusion with tocilizumab as monotherapy) in the TJC And SJC after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months is reported. The TJC and SJC were determined for 28 joint counts. The scores ranged from 0 (no disease activity) to 28 (higher/worsen disease activity), where higher scores represents higher disease activity.</description>

        <title>Phase II: Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events, Any Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest, and Tubercular Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions that worsened during the study were reported as AE. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or results in disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect. The AE were captured only for Phase II.</description>
