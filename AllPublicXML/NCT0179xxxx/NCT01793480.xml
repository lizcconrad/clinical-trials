  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, randomized, open-label, phase IIIb national study, to evaluate the
      clinical effects (success/failure) of methadone for the treatment of cancer-related-pain in
      patients with inadequate pain relief or intolerable side effects when treated with level 3
      opioid.

      Principal objective is to compare the clinical effects (success/failure) of two methods of
      methadone titration in patients with cancer-related pain inadequately relieved or with
      intolerable side effects after treatment with level 3 opioid.

      Secondary objectives are : Overall safety of methadone during the study, to describe the
      patients' characteristics, to describe the effects of methadone on pain relief, to describe
      the methadone administration, to evaluate patient's quality of life, to evaluate the
      prescriber's opinion regarding the handling of methadone initiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomisation (1:1) will consider the two titration methadone switching methods:

        -  Group A: patient-controlled dose of methadone with no overlapping with the previous
           opioid treatment

        -  Group B: fixed-dose of methadone with overlapping with the previous opioid treatment

      Study Description:

      Screening visit (Visit 1) within 48 hours before the inclusion Inclusion visit (Visit2) and
      randomisation on Day 1 Visit 3 from Day 2 to Day 7 (hospitalisation for all patients). Four
      follow-up visits on Day 14 (Visit 4), Day 21(Visit 5), Day 28 (Visit 6), Day 42 (Visit 7) End
      of study visit on Day 56 Follow-up phone contact on Day 84.

    <description>The success is defined as the adequate pain relief on Day 4 and no occurrence of overdose between Day 1 and Day 4. All unmet definition of success will be considered as a failure.
The adequate pain relief is defined as the composite criterion:
Decrease of at least 2 points on the pain numeric scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unacceptable pain) evaluated on Day 4 when compared to the pain numeric scale score at baseline,
And a pain numeric scale score &lt;5 during two consecutive days (between Day 1 and Day 4)</description>
