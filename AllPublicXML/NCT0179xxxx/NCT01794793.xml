      The purpose of this study is to allow continued use of pasireotide in patients who are on
      pasireotide treatment in a Novartis-sponsored, Oncology Clinical Development &amp; Medical
      Affairs (CD&amp;MA) study and are benefiting from the treatment as judged by the investigator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, phase IV study to provide continued supply of pasireotide
      to patients being treated in a current Novartis-sponsored, Oncology CD&amp;MA study and who are
      benefiting from treatment with pasireotide. Eligible patients are to be consented and can
      then continue treatment with pasireotide in this protocol. All patients at their scheduled
      visits will have drug dispensing information and reported adverse events and serious adverse
      events collected.

      A patient will reach the end of study when pasireotide treatment is permanently discontinued
      and the end of treatment visit has been performed. All patients must be followed up for
      safety evaluations for 3 months following the last dose of pasireotide LAR treatment and for
      1 month following the last dose of pasireotide s.c. treatment.

      The study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years or until such time that
      enrolled patients no longer need treatment with pasireotide or are able to obtain commercial
      supply according to local regulations for their medical condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is currently participating in a Novartis Oncology sponsored study receiving
             pasireotide (LAR and/or s.c.) and has fulfilled all required assessments in the parent
             study (unless the study is being terminated) and patients that are benefiting from the
             study drug have no other alternatives

          -  Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with pasireotide, as determined by
             the investigator

          -  Patient has demonstrated compliance, as assessed by the investigator, with the parent
             study requirements

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other
             study procedures

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in roll-over study and receiving
             study medication • If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally
             documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has been permanently discontinued from pasireotide study treatment in the
             parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures,
             withdrawal of consent or any other reason

          -  Patient has participated in a Novartis sponsored combination trial where pasireotide
             was dispensed in combination with another study medication and is still receiving
             combination therapy. (only patients receiving pasireotide monotherapy can be included)

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 1 months after pasireotide s.c. last dose and 3 months after
             pasireotide LAR last dose Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository In case of use of oral contraception women should have been
                       stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study
                       treatment

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 1 months after pasireotide s.c. last dose and 3 months after pasireotide LAR
             last dose and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be
             used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal
             fluid If a study patient or partner becomes pregnant or suspects being pregnant during
             the study or within 1 month after the final dose of pasireotide s.c. or 3 months after
             the final dose of pasireotide LAR, the Study Doctor needs to be informed immediately
             and ongoing study treatment with pasireotide has to be stopped immediately For
             patients taking pasireotide LAR, the future dose injections will be cancelled.
