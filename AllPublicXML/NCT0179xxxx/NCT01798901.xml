      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of AR-42 when given together with
      decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia. AR-42 may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving AR-42 together with
      decitabine may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the biologic effective and tolerable dose (BETD) of AR-42 (histone
      deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitor AR-42) in combination with a 10 day schedule of decitabine in
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults (Stratum 1) and children (Stratum 2).

      II. To define the specific toxicities and the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of AR-42 in
      combination with a 10 day schedule of decitabine in adults and children.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe biologic activity of the combination of AR-42 and decitabine (changes in micro
      ribonucleic acid [RNA] [miR]-29b expression; specificity protein 1 [Sp1], deoxyribonucleic
      acid [DNA] (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase [DNMT]1, 3A and 3B, KIT and FMS-like tyrosine
      kinase 3 [FLT3] RNA and protein levels).

      II. To provide preliminary data for clinical response with the combination of AR-42 and
      decitabine in adults and in children.

      III. To provide preliminary data on correlation of biologic endpoints and clinical response
      (particularly miR-29b expression).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of HDAC inhibitor AR-42.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive HDAC inhibitor AR-42 orally (PO) daily on days 1, 3, and
      5 or 1, 3, 4, 5 and decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 6-15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving complete remission (CR) or morphologic CR with
      incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) receive HDAC inhibitor AR-42 as in Induction Therapy
      and decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 6-10. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

             adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; if the patient does not agree, the
