  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the allergen ethylenediamine dihydrochloride when
      prepared using methylcellulose versus preparation using polyvinylpyrrolidone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose an open, prospective, single-site study to evaluate the bioequivalence of
      ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in methylcellulose (MC)and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
      formulations. Bioequivalence will be determined in 15 adult subjects, with a clinical history
      of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to ethylenediamine
      (&quot;sensitives&quot;).

          -  18 years of age or older, otherwise in good health

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must consent to a urine pregnancy test;
             results must be negative for study inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects unable to meet inclusion requirements

          -  Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant

          -  Topical treatment during the last 7 days with corticosteroids or other
             immunosuppressive agents on or near the test area

             visits and activity restrictions (e.g., protecting test panels from excess moisture
             due to showering or vigorous activity)

          -  Subject participation in clinical trials of investigational drugs, treatments, or
             devices, other than T.R.U.E. TEST, during this study or 3 weeks prior to inclusion in
