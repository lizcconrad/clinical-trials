  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New anticoagulants are being introduced to replace warfarin. These drugs do not require
      monitoring and are safer. There is currently no recommended way to reverse these drugs
      rapidly in the event of undue bleeding or need for emergency surgery. This is a lab study to
      look at ways to reverse the drugs rapidly

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are developing in vitro assays of measurement of the effect of these drugs on the relevant
      coagulation pathways in plasma; such assays are not widely established. This will then allow
      us to test potential reversing agents such as activated Factor VII (Novo-SevenÂ®), or Factor
      VIII inhibitor bypassing agent (FEIBA) for their ability to reverse these anti-coagulants
      invitro. The aims of this reversal research strategy is to provide a means whereby patients
      who present with serious bleeding or who need rapid reversal for surgery, for example, can be
      offered such treatment to allow rapid normalisation of their coagulation system.

      As part of this developmental programme, we wish to obtain samples from patients receiving
      Rivaroxaban or Dabigatran for therapeutic reasons, to test the effect of the respective drug
      on the relevant coagulation factors and to test in vitro reversibility.

      The only requirement for the patient is to have an extra 20ml of blood taken at a time when
      the patient is having other blood tests. There are no risks or experimental procedures
      planned to be carried out on patients.
