  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the acute and chronic effects of consumption
      fructose containing sugars and glucose in a real word setting when consumed in a manner and
      amount typical in the American diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fructose is known to be metabolized differently than the other common monosaccharides. In
      addition to the well know lipogenic effects, more recent evidence has shown that the acute
      changes in hormones and metabolic parameters that control appetite and energy regulation when
      with fructose consumption may promote caloric overconsumption and, in the long-term, weight
      gain. However, fructose is rarely consumed in isolation, but instead is consumed in
      combination with other sugars (with glucose in the case of the two most common sources of
      fructose: high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and sucrose, or as part of a mixed macronutrient
      meal. As such, the practical significance of these short-term findings of isolated
      monosaccharide consumption is limited.

      AIM 1: investigate the response to ten weeks of daily consumption of different fructose
      containing sugars and glucose at typical intake levels on various metabolic parameters and on
      fat content of the liver and skeletal muscle.

      AIM 2: To investigate whether ten weeks of daily consumption changes the acute metabolic
      response when these sugars are consumed as part as mixed nutrient meals.
