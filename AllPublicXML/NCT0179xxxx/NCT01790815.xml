      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE :

      To determine whether mothers, given minimal group training, are capable of using a MUAC
      (mid-upper arm circumference) bracelet to screen their children for malnutrition and
      categorise them into one of three groups : 'red' (SAM ; severe acute malnutrition), 'yellow'
      (MAM ; moderate acute malnutrition) or 'green' (normal nutritional status)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES :

      To establish whether there is a difference in the MUAC value if measured on the right arm as
      opposed to the left, in young children

      To determine whether there is a difference in the MUAC value if the mid upper arm position is
      determined visually as opposed to being measured in the 'classical' fashion

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and its complications are major causes of death in under 5s
      in the developing world. A simple, reproducible, scalable way to recognise acute malnutrition
      and target early intervention would be a huge advance. Can mothers with limited training
      reliably measure and interpret the results of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), a
      measurement performed with a MUAC measuring tape costing $0.06? MUAC contrasts with Z-score
      (WHZ), which requires both scales and a height gauge, both health worker interventions
      susceptible to considerable error, sensitive to non-nutritional factors, requiring
      calculations and growth curves, yet much less accurate in predicting risk of death compared
      with MUAC.
