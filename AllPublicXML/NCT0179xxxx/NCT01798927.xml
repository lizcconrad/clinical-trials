  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a specifically designed ankle foot
      orthosis (AFO, hinged, with Tamarack joint and adjustable check strap) on the spatial and
      temporal gait parameters, electromyography (EMG) and walking endurance, in select individuals
      living with Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be 10 weeks long. Following fitting with unilateral or bilateral
      custom-fabricated AFOs the subject will participate in 4 gait training sessions which will be
      at weeks 1, 2, and 7. Each training session will be 45-60 minutes in duration. Various
      outcome measures will be completed at the following times: time of consent (T1), treatment 1
      at time of brace delivery (T2), week 5 (T3), and week 10 (T4). Subjects will be closely
      monitored throughout the 10 week study and will be unenrolled by self-request or the
      following medical reasons: 1. New diagnosis with direct consequences affecting gait training,
      2. Inability to tolerate the study AFO(s).

    <description>Surface electromyography will be done on key muscles in the lower extremity (quads, anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius) during computerized gait assessment. Changes in EMG activity include things such as increases in amplitude or timing that might indicate increases in strength or motor learning as a result of wearing the ankle foot orthosis.</description>
