  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators are looking to compare standard treatment for the management of small cell
      lung cancer (SCLC) which is prophylactic cranial Irradiation (PCI) (shown to be very good in
      patient survival) with cranial sparing PCI. Although standard of care PCI is successful in
      patient survival it also has neurologic side-effects. The Investigators are hoping the
      cranial sparing PCI has the same positive survival results with the added benefit of lowering
      neurological side-effects.

    <textblock>
      -The standard of care in management of small cell lung cancer consists of chemotherapy plus
      thoracic radiation followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) based on a randomized
      trial that demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with PCI.
      Unfortunately radiation therapy to the brain is associated with neurocognitive toxicity,
      which may be at least in part related to radiation induced injury to neural progenitor cells
      in the hippocampus. Both human and animal data suggest an inverse relationship between
      radiation dose to the hippocampus and performance on neuropsychological testing. We
      hypothesize that hippocampal sparing PCI will allow improved performance on tests of short
      term memory and executive function compared to a historical control (RTOG 0212) receiving the
      same dose of conventional PCI. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate performance
      on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised for delayed recall at 6 months following
      hippocampal-sparing PCI relative to the historical control. Secondary objectives are to
      estimate: 1) composite cognitive function following hippocampal-sparing PCI relative to the
      historical control and 2) the rate of metastases in the hippocampus at 2 years following
      hippocampal-sparing PCI. The long term goal of this research is to reduce the long term
      sequelae of radiation therapy for both primary and metastatic brain tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have newly diagnosed and confirmed small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)

          -  Patient must have a performance status of 1 or higher

          -  Patients must not have received previous irradiation to the brain

          -  Patients must have limited stage disease with complete response to chemotherapy and
             consolidative chest radiotherapy that was documented at least on standard chest x-rays
             within one month of study entry

          -  Negative MRI or CT scan of the brain at least one month before protocol entry

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and also agree to
             use adequate contraceptives while on protocol

          -  Patient must be able to understand and sign the informed consent document

          -  Patient must be informed of the investigational aspect to this trial prior to singing
             the informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving prior external beam irradiation to the head or neck, including any
             form of stereotactic irradiation

          -  Radiographic evidence of brain metastases and/or ipsilateral lung metastases/malignant
             pleural effusion

          -  Planned concurrent chemotherapy or antitumoral agent during PCI

          -  Concomitant malignancy or malignancy within the past five years other than
             nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Patients with minimal pleural effusion evident on chest X-ray; minimal pleural
             effusion visible on chest CT is allowed.

          -  Patients with epilepsy requiring permanent oral medication

             _ Patients must not have a serious medical or psychiatric illness that would, in the
             opinion of the investigator, prevent informed consent or completion of protocol
             treatment, and/or follow-up visits.

          -  Patients may not take Memantine. This is the only eligibility criterion that has been
             added to those of RTOG 0212, since some physicians might now prescribe Memantine. This
             medication would not have been given at the time of enrollment on RTOG 0212 and its
             administration could confound the results of this study.
