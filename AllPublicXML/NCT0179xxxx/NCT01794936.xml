      This study is designed to evaluate the use of a disposable laparoscopic Doppler probe in
      robotic assisted prostatectomies. The Vascular Technology, Inc. (VTI) laparoscopic probe is
      simply a sterile, disposable Doppler probe that can be inserted through a laparoscopic trocar
      and placed on structures to determine if there is vascular flow demonstrating an audible
      pulse. During robotic-assisted prostatectomy, identification of vasculature is critical in
      order to prevent hemorrhage and effectively treat the underlying pathology. The investigators
      routinely utilize a combined Doppler ultrasound laparoscopic probe to identify vasculature
      during renal surgery, but Doppler ultrasound usage has not been adopted for prostatic
      surgery.

      From a mechanical standpoint, these combination probes differ from the VTI probe in that they
      are approximately 2 times the diameter of the VTI probe, and the portion of the probe
      utilized for imaging much longer and on the side of the device. The VTI probe is much
      narrower, and the portion of the probe utilized for vessel identification is at the tip of
      the probe. For robotic-assisted prostatectomy, patients will be randomized to VTI
      laparoscopic Doppler System to identify pedicles and neurovascular bundles (NVB) or to
      robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with no Doppler probe, which is the current
      standard of care.

      The VTI Laparoscopic Doppler System is a blood flow detector that compensates for the loss of
      tactile sensation during laparoscopic procedures by helping the surgeon to identify vascular
      anatomy before it is visible to the eye. The system's sterile doppler probes fit through
      standard 5mm ports. It is simple to use and no special training is required. This study is
      designed to evaluate the use of the VTI (Nashua, NH) 20 megahertz (MHz) Microvascular Doppler
      probe in laparoscopic urological surgery.

      Patients will take a preoperative sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) questionnaire. The
      investigators will then assess presence or absence of arterial and venous blood flow, in
      real-time during surgery. Additionally, the investigators will evaluate the safety of Doppler
      probe use, the surgical margin status on final pathology, and the post-operative erectile
      function of the patients with a followup SHIM questionnaire (to be performed 3 months after
      surgery). Finally, the robotic surgeon will document whether or not our original surgical
      plan was changed or remained the same after the Doppler use.

    <description>During robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, the VTI Doppler probe (test) will utilized to measure blood blow within the neurovascular bundles. This is to be completed after the bladder neck and seminal vesicles are identified and dissected. To use the probe, the assistant surgeon will place the Doppler probe within the abdomen and systematically move it cephalad along the lateral prostate pedicles to identify NVB vessels. The Doppler flow in these regions will be quantified as arterial (strong) flow, venous (minimal) flow or no flow. The procedures will proceed by dissecting the lateral margin of prostate step by step up to the gland's apex. Blood loss and the time required to identify and dissect the NVB will be recorded.</description>
