  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging causes anatomical and physiological changes in the respiratory system and respiratory
      muscle strength with decline in its maximum function. This study aimed to evaluate the
      effects of inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle strength, thickness of the
      diaphragm and diaphragmatic mobility in older women. The investigators' hypothesis is that
      inspiratory muscle training improves respiratory muscle strength, the thickness of the
      diaphragm and diaphragmatic mobility in older women.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Diafragmatic Excursion and Thickness of the Diaphragm at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound was used to evaluate diaphragm thickness non-invasively in the zone of apposition during tidal breathing and with changes in lung volume.
During respiration to total lung capacity, measurement of the diafragmatic excursion was made by ultrasonography.</description>
