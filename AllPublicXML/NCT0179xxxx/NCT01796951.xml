  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular aspirin use has been associated with a reduction in the development of a number of
      different malignancies including lung cancer. The mechanism of aspirin's cancer prevention is
      not known. This study will evaluate whether once daily aspirin use can reduce the production
      of a protein named prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), which is known to promote cancer. Specifically,
      this study will evaluate if aspirin can inhibit the production of PGE-2 by blocking an enzyme
      named cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). To accomplish these goals, participants will take either
      aspirin 325 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, or the combination of both during various
      days of this 16-day study. Urine be collected to evaluate for PGE-2 production at 4
      timepoints in this 16-day study.

    <measure>Change in COX-2 dependent urinary PGE-M (ng/mg Cr) production after 16 days of aspirin treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>16 days</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline urinary PGE-2 metabolite (PGE-M) will be measured. Then after 3 days of COX-2 blockade with celecoxib, it will again be measured. Participants will then undergo 10 days of treatment with aspirin and urinary PGE-M will be measured. Finally, participants will be treated with combined aspirin and celecoxib for 3 days and urinary PGE-M will be measured one last time. Using these values, the degree of aspirin inhibition of COX-2 specific urinary PGE-M production can be calculated.</description>
