  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the radiological component of an earlier registered RCT under the title:
      Efficacy of Exercise on Physical Function and Cartilage Health in Patients With Knee
      Osteoarthritis. The main purpose in this component of the study is to evaluate the efficacy
      of aerobic exercise and strength training on the T2 and T1 rho relaxation times of the
      articular cartilage. It has been proven that exercise can improve function and reduce the
      need for analgesics in patients with osteoarthritis. With this study, we wish to investigate
      if different kinds of exercise can cause measurable improvements in T2 and T1 rho relaxation
      times of the articular cartilage, and also if this improvements are transient or permanent.
