        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the
             clinical investigation

          -  Judged by the Investigator as suitable for participation in the study without safety
             concerns based on medical history, physical examination and laboratory results

          -  Age: 18-65 years of age.

          -  Gender: Male or female subjects.

          -  Negative urine drug screen (amphetamine, benzodiazepines, cocaine, marijuana,
             metamphetamine, morphine) at screening and Visit 2.

          -  Female subjects have to be post-menopausal for more than one year or use a highly
             efficient method of contraception (i.e. a method with less than 1% failure rate [e.g.
             sterilisation, hormone implants, hormone injections, some intrauterine devices,
             abstinence, or vasectomised partner]). Oral contraceptives: combined pill (estrogen /
             progestin) and medium-dose progestin pill (for example desogestrel 75ug) are accepted
             only in combination with the partner using condoms.

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures and restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

          -  Ongoing respiratory infection including the nasal cavity.

          -  Current malignancy of any kind.

          -  History of frequent nose bleeds or a condition that increases the risk of excessive
             bleeding.

          -  Pronounced anterior septal deviation or other significant nasal pathology.

          -  Known allergy to polyvinylchloride or medicinal liquid paraffin.

          -  Ongoing treatment with drugs indicated for respiratory or cardiac disorders.

          -  Any disease, condition (medical or surgical) including allergic, immunological and
             gastro-intestinal conditions and/or chronic medications which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise the study results, or would place the subject at
             increased risk.

          -  Vital signs with clinically significant deviations that would make the subject
             unsuitable for the study, as judged by the investigator.

          -  Evidence of significant cardiovascular disease defined by the following:

               1. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure;

               2. Presence of symptomatic coronary artery disease or unstable angina;

               3. Persistent arrhythmia requiring chronic pharmacotherapy or implantable device;

               4. Clinically significant abnormalities seen on the screening electrocardiogram as
                  assessed by the investigator;

          -  Clinically significant deviations in, hematology (including coagulation parameters
             aPTT and INR) variables, blood chemistry variables or urinalysis as assessed by the
             investigator.

          -  Positive screening test for HIV or hepatitis B or C

          -  Positive alcohol breath test at Visit 1 or at Visit 2.

          -  Non-smoker since at least six months at time of screening.

          -  Is currently implanted with an electrical and/or neurostimulator device, including but
             not limited to cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, vagal neurostimulator, deep brain
             stimulator, spinal stimulator, bone growth stimulator, or cochlear implant.

          -  Previously treated with radiation on the face

          -  Previous radiation therapy to the head or neck regions

          -  Previously treated with an implantable stimulator or any implantable device in the
             head and / or neck

          -  Has a recent or repeated history of syncope.

          -  Has a recent or repeated history of seizures.

          -  Surgery within the past three months, determined by the PI to be clinically relevant.

          -  Strenuous exercise within 2 days of Visit 1 or Visit 2.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Female subjects: unwilling to use adequate contraceptive measures from the signing of
             the informed consent until end of the study at the follow-up visit.

          -  Received study drug in a clinical trial for an investigational drug within the
             previous 30 days, or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.

          -  Blood donation or loss of whole blood exceeding 100 mL within 30 days from screening
             or plasma within 14 days from screening.

          -  Excessive intake of alcohol, defined as an average daily intake of greater than three
             units, or a maximum weekly intake of greater than 21 units ((three units equal 250 ml
             of 12% alcohol by unit wine).

          -  Concurrent condition or risk of non-compliance that, in the investigator's opinion,
             may affect the interpretation of performance or safety data or which otherwise
