    <textblock>
      A prospective post-market study to evaluate the performance and clinic usability of heart
      failure risk status (HFRS) feature on CareLink.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with systolic heart failure (HF) implanted with Medtronic wireless implantable
      cardiac defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy device with defibrillation
      capabilities (CRT-D) devices will be enrolled in the study. The purpose of the study is to
      evaluate the usability of CareLink HFRS to manage a patient's heart failure.
