      The purpose of this study is to see the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) on the pain and itching associated with burn injury. This study is part of the
      Boston-Harvard Burn Model System. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a decrease
      in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham stimulation, using a 3 week
      stimulation schedule- 2 weeks of stimulation (10 consecutive days) followed by 1 week of
      stimulation (5 consecutive days) after three follow up visits at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after
      initial course of stimulation. The subject will also have follow ups at 2, 4 and 8 weeks
      after the second course of stimulation.

      If a subject receives sham during the experiment, he/she may enroll in an open-label portion
      of the study and receive 10 days of active stimulation.
