  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, many studies has showed that compared with air insufflation colonoscopy,
      water-related colonoscopy could shorten the cecal intubation time and relieve the pain of the
      patients,especially for training the beginners,the investigators conduct this study to
      preform the &quot;air assisted&quot; water injection colonoscopy in experienced endoscopists.

      In order to further develop water skills and apply the water assisted colonoscopy technique
      more flexibly, the investigators designed this study.
