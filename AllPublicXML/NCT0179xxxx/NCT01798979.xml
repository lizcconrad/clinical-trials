  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of
      GLPG0634 on the single dose pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam administered in fasted
      normal healthy males. Each subject will receive a single oral dose of midazolam (2 mg) on 2
      occasions: on Day 1, before dosing with GLPG0634 and on Day 8, after multiple oral doses of
      GLPG0634 (daily for 7 days).

      Also, the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of GLPG0634 co-administered with
      midazolam in healthy male subjects will be evaluated.
