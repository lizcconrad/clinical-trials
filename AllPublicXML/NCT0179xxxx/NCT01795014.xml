  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A spontaneous venous pulsation over the optic disc is an ophthalmological sign that can
      potentially be found in up to 98% of healthy individuals. In fact, the lack of this
      spontaneous retinal venous pulse has been consistently implicated as an indicator of a more
      advanced form of certain ocular diseases, specifically open-angle glaucoma. However, the
      mechanisms behind these change in the retinal venous system are not clear. Some evidence
      suggests that extraocular features such as intracranial pressure (ICP) may play a role in
      regulating the intraocular venous outflow. The reasons for this hypothetical downstream
      resistance to venous outflow are not fully understood, with advances in this field being
      limited by our technological-imposed difficulties in assessing the structures behind the
      globe.

      However, it has been established that the volume of cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the optic
      nerve correlates with the ICP at the orbital level. Recent studies have suggested that
      non-invasive ultrasound-based recordings have correlated this surrogate for orbital ICP with
      the intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients with an otherwise normal IOP range
      (normal tension glaucoma - NTG).

      The investigators will therefore conduct a test to determine if this cerebrospinal volume
      surrounding the optic nerve correlates with the frequency of observation of an otherwise
      signal of venous dysfunction (i.e. the lack of a visible pulse in the retinal central vein)
      Additionally, the investigators will assess if this correlation is different between healthy
      individuals, hypertensive primary-open angle glaucoma or NTG patients.

      1. Spontaneous venous pulsation will be recorded after a one minute fundoscopy observation.

        2. B-mode ultrasound of the orbit will be performed and the optic nerve sheath diameter
           measured 3mm behind the globe

        3. Visual field examination will be performed.

        4. Structural examination of the optic disc (confocal microscopy) will be performed.
