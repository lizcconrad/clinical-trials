  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see how safe the combination of eribulin and carboplatin is and
      if it will work to help people with advanced breast cancer. Eribulin and carboplatin are both
      chemotherapy drugs. They work by killing cancer cells. A person is made up of cells which
      control every function in the body. Some cells stop working like they should and become
      cancer cells. These cancer cells grow and multiply rapidly and can cause destruction to
      normal body organs. Eribulin and carboplatin have both been approved by United States Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of breast cancer. The combination of
      these two drugs and the safest dose of eribulin to use is experimental.

    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of eribulin mesylate and carboplatin in combination. The primary safety endpoint is dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD is defined as the dose at which the percentage of patients experiencing a DLT is the closest to 30%. Planned doses for evaluation of eribulin mesylate include 0.9, 1.1, and 1.4 mg/m^2.</description>

    <description>Response rate will be provided for the subjects in the study overall. Response rates and 95% confidence intervals will be provided. Eribulin mesylate pharmacokinetic variables: peak concentration (CPeak) and trough plasma concentrations (Ctrough) will be calculated as appropriate and summary statistics will be provided.</description>

Carboplatin dose will be calculated using the Calvert formula using AUC of 2 as follows: Carboplatin dose (mg) = 2 X (GFR + 25).</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer that is
             metastatic or if the disease is locally advanced and unresectable, then the standard
             curative measures are no longer effective.

          -  Must have received no more than 3 prior cytotoxic therapies in the metastatic setting.
             If patients demonstrated positive Her2/Neu disease they must have progressed on
             Herceptin. Once maximum tolerated dose is established; 10 patients are to be treated
             at that dose and must have received no more than 2 prior cytotoxic therapies in the
             metastatic setting.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  leukocytes ≥3,000/µL
