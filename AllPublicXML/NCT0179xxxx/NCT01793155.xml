      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of postoperative inspiratory muscle
      training on the recovery of respiratory muscle strength in high risk patients referred for
      lung cancer surgery. Furthermore, to assess longitudinal changes in respiratory muscle
      strength, physical capacity and health-related quality of life after lung cancer surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in early detection and treatment improve life expectancy after surgery for lung
      cancer, but living with lung cancer is frequently associated with symptoms as dyspnoea,
      decreased physical capacity and fatigue several years after treatment. Lung cancer (LC)
      surgery is associated with a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC),
      having a negative impact on recovery. Although the causes of PPC are multifactorial,
      respiratory muscle (RM) dysfunction has been proposed to be associated with the development
      of PPC, explained by changes in RM mechanics- and function due to surgery. There is scarcity
      of literature on the impact of RM dysfunction on surgical and functional outcomes after LC
      surgery.

      Aims: to describe longitudinal changes in RM strength in patients undergoing lung cancer
      surgery and identify associations between RM strength and functional capacity. Furthermore,
      to evaluate the effect of inspiratory muscle training on the recovery of respiratory muscle
      strength in high risk patients referred for LC surgery.

      Target population: 88 patients referred for lung cancer surgery at the Department of
      Cardiothoracic Surgery, Aalborg Universityhospital.

      Design: The core of this research is a prospective longitudinal observational study (study
      1); included is a randomized controlled trial, based on a subpopulation from study 1.

      Statistical analysis is based on mixed linear regression models and ANOVA. For the RCT we use
      the generalized estimating equivalent method for parametric and Fisher´s exact test for
      nonparametric data.

    <description>Inspiratory muscle training, as a supplement to placebo comparator, starts the day before surgery and continues for two weeks after surgery. No sessions are performed on the surgery day. Each session consists of 2 sets of 30 inspirations with a pause between each set of 2 minutes. The target intensity before surgery is 30% of the measured MIP and starts at 15% after surgery. The intensity is incrementally increased by 2 cm H20 the first days after surgery. Patients grade their perceived exertion and register eventual adverse effects in a training diary.</description>
