  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a randomized, double blind, double dummy two period crossover
      study in stable asthma patients. A total of 16 stable asthma patients treated in accordance
      with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, will be included.

      Objectives:

        -  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of both the study drugs
           under investigation on Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) parameters and to evaluate
           the particle deposition in the lungs using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD)

        -  The secondary objectives are to assess the effect of both the study drugs on lung
           function (spirometry and body plethysmography), on exercise capacity (6 Minutes Walking
           Test = 6MWT) and on dyspnea (Borg Category (C) Ratio (R) 10 Scale and Visual Analog
           Scale (VAS) dyspnea). Furthermore the safety of the 2 products under investigation will
           be evaluated through monitoring of adverse events (AEs) throughout the study.
