      The purpose of the present study is to examine the impact of ePREP when it is administered to
      couples. More specifically, investigators will test whether--compared to placebo
      controls--participants who receive ePREP will experience better outcomes for relationship
      relevant variables.

    <description>Participants in the control condition will view a presentation that teaches inert information about anxiety, depression, and relationships such as definitions, prevalence rates, common problems associated with these conditions and available forms of treatment. This presentation was used initially in Cuckrowicz &amp; Joiner (2007) and has since been shown to be effective as a placebo in two previous ePREP studies (Braithwaite &amp; Fincham, 2007; Braithwaite &amp; Fincham, 2008). This presentation is identical to the ePREP intervention in its set up, the only difference being, there is no information included in this presentation that teaches specific skills or strategies for improving relationships, depression or anxiety.</description>

    <description>The ePREP intervention teaches individuals how to recognize and combat dynamic risk factors that lead to relationship distress. Specifically, it teaches communication techniques and problem-solving skills that help couples to effectively deal with conflict. It also teaches couples how to enhance positive aspects of their relationship by fostering fun and friendship.</description>
