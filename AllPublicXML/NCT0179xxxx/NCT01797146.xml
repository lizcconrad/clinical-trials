    <description>This intervention will be implemented by ward nurses and responsible physicians. The details of intervention are shown below.
Nurse: Every morning, a ward nurse will check if any patient has a urinary catheter or a central venous catheter in place. An order sheet will be marked with a CARE-rubber stamp and the following information will be added by hand-writing.
Type and duration of urinary catheter use.
Indication of urinary catheter _________
Type and duration of central venous catheter use
Indication of urinary catheter _________
Responsible physician: During a morning round, a physician needs to fill the indication of catheter use. If a given physician does not fill the indication of urinary catheter use, the catheter will be automatically removed. If a given physician does not fill the indication of central venous catheter, the CARE team will be notified.</description>
