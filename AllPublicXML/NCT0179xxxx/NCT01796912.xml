  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angina which is refractory to conventional medical therapy and revascularisation is
      challenging to manage. Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) is a genetically determined form of
      LDL-cholesterol, elevation of which is an independent risk factor and predictor of adverse
      cardiovascular events. Lp(a) is felt to increase cardiovascular risk via its prothrombotic
      effect and by enhancing intimal lipoprotein deposition. Lipoprotein apheresis is the most
      effective treatment for raised Lp(a). Lipid lowering agents such as statins have little to no
      effect on Lp(a) levels.

      The goal of this study is to determine the impact of apheresis on clinical parameters and
      symptoms of patients with refractory angina and raised Lp(a). The investigators will conduct
      a prospective, randomised controlled crossover study of 20 patients with refractory angina
      and raised Lp(a), randomised to undergoing lipoprotein apheresis weekly for three months or
      sham apheresis weekly for three months with assessment of myocardial perfusion, carotid
      atherosclerosis, endothelial vascular function, thrombogenesis, exercise capacity, angina
      symptoms and quality of life at the beginning and end of treatment. Patients will then
      crossover to the opposite study arm with the protocol repeated. The hypothesis is that the
      above parameters will be improved by lipoprotein apheresis in patients with raised Lp(a) and
      Refractory Angina. Investigators will also test for the genotypic presence of
      apolipoprotein(a) gene (LPA) locus variants (rs10455872 and rs3798220) which are thought to
      be associated with an increased level of Lp(a) and an increased risk of coronary disease.
