  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare two antibiotic
      pre-authorization strategies (Fellow-based vs. Pharmacist-based). We believe that amount and
      duration of antibiotic consumption would be lower in the pharmacist group while the clinical
      outcome would be equivalent between two groups.
