  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at comparing learning mechanisms to increase vegetable acceptance in infants
      at complementary feeding, namely repeated exposure (RE), flavor-flavor learning (FFL) and
      flavor-nutrient learning (FNL); measuring the stability of the learning effect; and examining
      the impact of infants' feeding history on vegetable acceptance.

    <description>In this conditioning trial, the effect of repeated consumption of different types of artichoke purée was studied. In Arm 1, participants were repeatedly exposed to basic artichoke purée. In Arm 2, participants were repeatedly exposed to sweet artichoke purée. In Arm 3, participants were repeatedly exposed to fat artichoke purée. Change in intake and liking of basic artichoke purée was evaluated at baseline and after 10 exposures to artichoke purée ; and at 3 follow-ups: after 2 weeks (FU2W), after 3 months (FU3M) and after 6 months (FU6M).</description>
