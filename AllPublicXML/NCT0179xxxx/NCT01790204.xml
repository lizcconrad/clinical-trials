      The aim of this clinical trial is to examine the effects of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC),
      a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables, on oral cells with mutant p53. The p53
      protein's normal (wild-type) function within cells is to act as a tumor suppressor, or
      anti-cancer protein. When mutated, the p53 protein not only no longer executes the functions
      of a tumor suppressor, and it can gain functions as a pro-cancer protein.22 The proposed
      clinical trial will utilize oral cells collected from subjects who are heavy smokers. Since
      the subjects are regularly exposed to mutagenic chemicals it is the thought that their oral
      cells will contain measurable levels of mutant p53. The participants will consume watercress
      juice, which is rich in PEITC (See Figure 1). Previous studies in the laboratory showed PEITC
      selectively depletes mutant p53, and not wild type p53, in cell culture. Our hypothesis is
      that the ITC in the watercress juice will lead to the depletion of mutant p53 within the oral
      cells. This depletion could lead to a possible clinical application of this compound, such as
      chemopreventives or oncologic treatments of individuals with oral cancers.

    <description>The juice is prepared, by a trained member of the Chung laboratory staff, in the following manner; each serving of watercress juice will be prepared with 55gm watercress (from a local grocery store) with 220 ml purified water, for a proportion of 1:4 (w/w). The watercress and water will be placed in a 1.5 L mechanical blender and blended at low speed for approximately 15 seconds, followed by blending at a high speed for one additional minute. The resulting suspension will be filtered through two layers of cheese cloth. Remaining liquids will be manually extracted from the cheese cloth into the same container. Each serving will be measured to 200 ml. The remaining 20 ml will be used for analysis of ITC content. Each serving will be prepared and kept at 40 C until needed, no more than one hour prior to participant consumption by the subject.</description>
