  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cancer diagnosis is a stressful phenomenon and a life-threatening experience that creates
      immediate psychosocial distress for the patient and his or her family. Distress is also
      experienced across the disease trajectory. Stress can manifest in a variety of psychological
      symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, intrusive cancer-related thoughts, or physical
      symptoms, such as fatigue, increased pain, and impaired sleep. Intensified stress in cancer
      patients has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, decreased immune
      function, increased relapse, and decreased health-related quality of life. Given the known
      negative impact of stress on cancer patients, stress has become a priority issue in cancer
      treatment and research. Targeting stress-related variables with psychosocial interventions
      has been an important emphasis in cancer-care models. One of these care modalities is
      Inquiry-based stress reduction.

      The IBSR intervention, developed by Byron Katie, is a simple yet powerful process of inquiry
      that teaches the individual to identify and question the thoughts that cause him or her to
      experience stress and suffering. It is a way to understand what is hurting the individual,
      and to address the cause of his or her problems with clarity. This mindful-process, named
      &quot;The Work&quot;, facilitates that through four questions and a turnaround, which is a way of
      experiencing the opposite of what the individual believes in. The Work provides skills for
      self-inquiry and management of stressful thoughts which can be easily implemented in daily
      life. The study will focus on breast, colorectal and prostate cancer patients. These types of
      cancers have high incidence along with high survival rates.

      The primary objective is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of IBSR for breast,
      colorectal and prostate cancer survivors on quality of life. We hypothesize that this
      intervention will lead to significant improvements in all quality of life domains (physical
      well-being, psychological well-being, social well-being etc.)

      Effects on secondary outcomes will be assessed, including depressive symptoms, anxiety and
      stress levels, and fear of recurrence. Physical symptoms (disturbance in sleeping patterns,
      fatigue, and pain), will be assessed as well. Biological measurements will be measured in
      blood samples in order to observe effects on neural and immune components.

      Additionally, we are interested in evaluating whether positive effects achieved from the IBSR
      program are modified by specific patient characteristics measured at baseline (optimism,
      social support, and spirituality).

    <description>During a 12-week intervention program, participants will be encouraged to identify and inquire their stressful thoughts. Through the use of self-inquiry practices participants are taught to increase awareness of their thoughts and feelings, to observe their emotional and physical responses during situations perceived by them as stressful, and allow their mind to return to its true, peaceful, creative nature. Through the process of self-inquiry, participants take an active role in investigating their stressful thoughts, and by this regulating their stress and managing symptoms and emotions, thus enabling them to cope better with the distress related to the possibility of cancer.</description>
