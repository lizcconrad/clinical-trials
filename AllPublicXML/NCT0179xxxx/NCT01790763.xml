  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which Keramatrix dressing promotes
      the healing of second-degree burn wounds in pediatric patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy in promoting wound healing will be determined through comparison to Mepilex, an
      established burn wound dressing.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 0.75 days per every percent burn until wound heals</time_frame>
    <description>Wound healing will be determined by measuring wound surface area. Wound surface area will be determined through planimetry, which will be performed on digital photographs of the wounds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infection rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 0.75 days per percent burn until wound heals</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be monitored for unusual occurences, including signs and symptoms of infection.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scarring</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks up to 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scarring will be evaluated using the Vancouver Clinical Scar Scale. Assessments of graft pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and height will be performed at follow-up visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 0.75 days per every percent burn until wound heals, up to 3 times a week during dressing changes</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed using pain scales according to age.</description>
