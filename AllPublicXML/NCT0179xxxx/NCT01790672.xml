  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Understanding and accepting the study procedures and signing the informed consent.

          -  Male and female volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. No fixed sex ratio has been
             established.

          -  Clinical history and physical examination demonstrating no organic or psychiatric
             disorders.

          -  The ECG and general blood and urine laboratory tests performed before the study should
             be within normal ranges. Minor or occasional changes from normal ranges are accepted
             if, in the investigator's opinion, considering the current state of the art, they are
             not clinically significant, are not life-threatening for the subjects and do not
             interfere with the product assessment. These changes and their non-relevance will be
             justified in writing specifically.

          -  The body mass index (BMI=weigh/height2) will range from 19 to 25 kg/m2, and the weight
             from 50 to 100 kg. 25-27 could be accepted.

          -  Women with regular menstrual cycle of 26-32 days.

          -  Subjects socially drinking and who had ingested wine at least once.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not meeting the inclusion criteria.

          -  History or clinical evidence of gastrointestinal, liver, renal or other disorders
             which may lead to suspecting a disorder in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion, or that suggest gastrointestinal irritation due to drugs.

          -  History or clinical evidence of psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse, or
             regular use of psychoactive drugs.

          -  Blood donation in the previous 8 weeks or participation in other clinical trials with
             drugs in the previous 12 weeks.

          -  Having suffered any organic disease or major surgery in the three months prior to the
             study start.

          -  Subjects with intolerance or serious adverse reactions to ethanol.

          -  Regular use of any drug in the month prior to the study sessions, except for vitamins
             or diet supplements, that, in the opinion of the principal investigator or
             co-investigators designated by him, do not involve a risk for the subject and do not
             interfere with the study objectives. In this case they should be discontinued from one
             week before the experimental sessions to the end of them. The treatment with single or
             limited doses of symptomatic medicinal products in the week prior to the study
             sessions will not be a reason for exclusion if it is calculated that it has been
             cleared completely the day of the experimental session.

          -  Taking more than 20 g of alcohol a day in women and more than 30 g in men.

          -  Taking more than 5 coffees, teas, cola drinks or other stimulating drinks or with
             xanthines daily in the 3 months prior to the study start.

          -  Subjects unable to understand the nature, consequences of the study and the procedures
             requested to be followed.

          -  Smokers or ex-smokers of less than one year.

          -  Subjects with positive serology to Hepatitis B, C or HIV.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or positive pregnancy test in urine. Women not undertaking
             to follow reliable contraceptive measures during the study (such as abstinence,
             hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, double-barrier methods or vasectomised
             partner).

          -  Women with amenorrhea or premenstrual syndrome of moderate or severe intensity.

          -  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants or vitamins consumption in the last
             2 weeks.

          -  Total cholesterol &gt;6.00 mmol/l (240 mg/dl) or triglycerides &gt;2.26 mmol/l (200 mg/dl).

          -  Vegetarians or subjects following aberrant diets.

          -  Physical exercise of &gt;2h/day or &gt;3000 kcal /week.

        To be eligible, the subjects must agree to follow a poor polyphenols diet in the 72 hours
        prior to the start of each session and until 24 hours after.
