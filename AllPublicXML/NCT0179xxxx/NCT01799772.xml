  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo a replacement of their knees are generally older adults who have dealt
      with severe knee pain and joint degeneration for a long time. The majority of them are
      sedentary, and around 1/3 are obese. The knee replacement surgery decreases knee pain and
      helps patients to live a better life. However, after the surgery, some patients have
      difficulty performing basic activities such as walking, or going up-down stairs, and the
      majority remains sedentary and gain weight. These combined problems leave patients at risk of
      worsening their health. Therefore, a treatment that takes care of all these combined problems
      is needed. We propose an all-inclusive treatment, called comprehensive behavioral
      intervention (CBI) that intends to improve the long-term effects of exercise programs. The
      CBI combines exercise program with promotion of physical activity, orientation on healthy
      nutrition, and an education approach that promotes self-initiative towards healthy habits.
      The overall aim of this proposed study is to test how patients post TKA will like the CBI
      program, how safe the program is, and adapt the program as needed for better acceptability.
      We believe the CBI will be safe, well tolerated, and will improve the ability of patients to
      perform physical tasks. We also believe the program will increase the amount of physical
      activity, will promote maintenance of healthy weight, and will help the patients to obtain
      and maintain healthy habits. In this study subjects will be selected by a flip of a coin to
      receive either our CBI program or a more traditional exercise program. Subjects will be
      tested before and after the treatments. Our measures of main interest are how well subjects
      move around and how physically active they are. We are also interested on the effect of the
      interventions on body weight, blood pressure, eating habits, and general health. The team of
      researchers for this study includes several disciplines. The proposed study will defend the
      need for a larger study that can have a very important impact on the public health of
      patients post TKA. The reason for the public health impact is if the physical limitations
      experiences by patients post TKA are left untreated, they tend to get worse. Furthermore, by
      increasing physical activity and promoting healthy weight, it may improve general health and
      prevent chronic diseases. Last, developing educational intervention that promotes
      self-initiative will result in long-term health benefits post TKA.

    <description>It will involve regular contacts over 6 month period. It will include 2 weekly contacts for weeks 1-6, weekly contacts for weeks 7-8, bi-weekly contact for months 3-4, and monthly contact for months 5-6. There is a combination of 20 individual and group-based sessions.
It is a combination of 4 components: a) Evidence-based exercise program, b) Physical activity promotion, c) Healthy nutrition guidance, and d) Self-management.</description>

    <description>The SCE will be delivered by a physical therapist. It represents the typical rehabilitation after TKA surgery. It is expected to provide small and short-lived functional improvement. Subjects will participate in 12 supervised sessions (2 x/week, for 6 weeks). The SCE consists of: a) lower extremity range of motion and stretching exercises, b) lower extremity strengthening exercises of moderate intensity, and d) endurance exercises using treadmill.</description>

    <description>Evidence-based exercise program - Combination of high intensity lower extremity strengthening, endurance on the treadmill, functional task-oriented exercises, and balance techniques. During 12 sessions, subjects will be instructed to become independent in performing the exercises at home.
Physical activity promotion - Instructions to engage in moderate intensity exercise 5 days/week will be delivered along with the exercise program.
Healthy nutrition guidance - Instructions on healthy nutrition delivered by a dietitian.
Self-management - Basic self-management skills advocated by the Arthritis Foundation Self-Help Program and behavioral strategies (self-monitoring, problem solving, relapse prevention, and goal-setting) and feedback into approaches a, b and c.</description>
