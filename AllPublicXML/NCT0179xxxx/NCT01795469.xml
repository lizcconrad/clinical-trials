  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common cause of orthostatic intolerance
      in adolescents and adults. Compression stockings are commonly recommended as a treatment
      modality for POTS, but the effects of abdominal and lower extremity compression during tilt
      table testing have not been measured in adolescent patients. The aims of our study are to
      compare heart-rate changes and symptom onset during tilt table testing (a) with and without
      abdomen/lower extremity compression and (b) with abdominal compression only versus lower
      extremity compression only. During phase 1, 20 adolescents with POTS will undergo up to 10
      minutes of tilt without compression (trial #1), a repeat study of up to 10 minutes with full
      compression (trial #2), and a third study without compression up to 10 minutes (trial #3).
      Compression will be performed using the non-inflatable Zoex anti-shock garment. During study
      phase 2, an additional 20 adolescent POTS patients will undergo up to 10 minutes of tilt
      without compression (trial #1), a repeat study of up to 10 minutes with abdominal compression
      only [n=10] or lower extremity compression only [n=10] (trial #2), and a third study repeated
      without compression up to 10 minutes (trial #3). To limit compression to the abdomen only, we
      will use the Zoex garment strap numbers 4 and 5 (thigh and abdomen) without straps 1-3 (lower
      extremities). For lower extremity-only compression, we will use Zoex garment straps 1-4
      (lower extremity and thigh) without strap 5. Data collected will include mean and peak heart
      rates and timing of symptoms with each trial. A paired-samples t-test will be used to compare
      mean heart rates between trials for each study phase. Hazard analyses will be used to assess
      time-based endpoints.
