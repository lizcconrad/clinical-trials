  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a large-scale, randomized longitudinal evaluation of Second Step: Student
      Success Through Prevention (Second Step - SSTP), a middle school intervention (Committee for
      Children, 2008), which targets the shared underlying risk and protective factors for
      bullying, sexual harassment, and dating aggression. This program is unique in its emphasis on
      the role of peer group norms, attitudes, and behavior in the initiation and maintenance of
      bullying and other forms of violence. Because of this, this investigation will involve a
      direct test via social network analysis the extent to which peer norms or shifts in peer
      attitudes are impacted by the intervention. Bullying is conceptualized as including verbal,
      physical, relational, and cyber-aggression. Sexual violence is conceptualized as including
      sexual harassment, sexual coercion in dating relationships, and homophobic teasing.
      Thirty-six schools were drawn from four school districts in Illinois and one large district
      in Wichita, Kansas and randomly assigned to Second Step - SSTP or a control condition. Second
      Step -SSTP program draws from the risk/protective factors model and social-cognitive theories
      of aggression. Lessons focus on the outcomes of bullying, relational aggression, sexual
      harassment, dating relationships, and substance use. Risk factors targeted include
      inappropriate classroom behavior, favorable attitudes toward aggression and substance abuse,
      deviant peer affiliation, peer rejection, and impulsiveness are targeted as risk factors.
      Targeted protective factors include empathy, problem-solving skills, school connectedness,
      assertiveness and adoption of conventional norms. The P3R: Stories of Us - Bullying program,
      composed of a series of film-based education will be used in the control schools. All 6th
      graders at each school will be recruited and followed for the three year study period.
      Students and teachers will complete self-report and nomination tasks. Growth curve analysis
      via hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1992) will be utilized to assess
      change in the major dependent variables (bullying, sexual harassment perpetration, dating
      aggression), structural equation modeling will test for mediators across the study period,
      and social network analysis will be instrumental in identifying peer norms and attitudes.

      Seven outcome measures were evaluated including bullying perpetration, peer victimization,
      physical fighting, homophobic name calling (victimization and perpetration), and sexual
      violence (victimization and perpetration). Given that students in the intervention received
      only one-year (15 lessons; 50 minutes/week) of the developmentally-sequenced three-year
      curriculum, it was hypothesized that the strongest intervention effect would be seen for
      overt physical aggression, followed by more subtle effects for bullying and peer
      victimization outcomes. Because students were not introduced to concepts of prejudice, bias,
      and sexual violence (referred to sexual harassment) until the 7th and 8th grade curriculum,
      it was hypothesized that no significant intervention effects would emerge for these
      constructs at this point in time.
