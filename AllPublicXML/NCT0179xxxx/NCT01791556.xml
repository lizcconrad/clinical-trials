      The study is funded through the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC #KE-07-0044). The
      purpose of this study is two-fold. The first purpose is to see if routine monitoring of the
      level of HIV virus in the blood (viral load) every six months is superior to monitoring by
      standard clinical evaluations and or immune status (CD4 count) with intermittent viral load
      monitoring in adults receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The second purpose is to
      understand the cost implications and possible benefits of routine HIV viral load monitoring.

      The Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and manual for
      ART providers recommend targeted viral load monitoring in ART management. While only limited
      use of viral load monitoring exist due to limitations in technical and financial resources,
      the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of viral load monitoring has not been prospectively
      studied in ART roll-out at the clinic level.

      &quot;Clinic-based ART Diagnostic Evaluation&quot; (CLADE) is an unblinded, randomized (1:1),
      prospective, observational, cohort public health evaluation (PHE) aimed at evaluating the
      superiority and cost-effectiveness of two recommended Ministry of Health ART diagnostic
      evaluation approaches at the clinic level in adult treatment naive patients beginning
      Ministry of Health approved first-line ART: &quot;routine care&quot;, the most common approach to ART
      roll-out where clinical (World Health Organization) staging and immunological (CD4)
      monitoring are the primary baseline and follow-up evaluations and targeted viral load
      monitoring; and &quot;viral load care&quot;, where routine viral loads are included with clinical and
      immunological evaluations.

      In this study we plan to enroll 820 adult participants starting ART, 410 people will be
      enrolled in each of the public health evaluation arms. Arm A/ &quot;routine care&quot; will receive MoH
      standard of care monitoring consisting of baseline CD4 and WHO staging every 6 months, or as
      clinically indicated, with CD4 and WHO staging criteria guiding care and treatment in
      addition to routine clinical evaluations. In addition, MoH criteria for targeted viral load
      monitoring will be used. Arm B/ &quot;viral load guided care&quot; will receive MoH standard of care as
      in Arm A but also have routine viral load monitoring at baseline and every 6 months, or as
      clinically indicated, to guide care and treatment. Each arm will receive Kenya Ministry of
      Health first-line ART. Participants meeting MoH criteria for treatment failure will being
      second-line ART.
