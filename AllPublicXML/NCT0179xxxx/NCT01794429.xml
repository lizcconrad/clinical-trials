  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine if 3 months of treatment with a GLP-1 (glucagon-like-peptide-1) analogue can
      induce weight loss in obese, non-diabetic patients with a diagnosis within the schizophrenic
      spectrum.

      The investigators will also examine possible associations between GLP-1 treatment and
      peripheral metabolic parameters such as change in body fat and HbA1c. Moreover, the GLP-1
      analogue treatment will be associated with the effects/changes on cognition and subjective
      quality of life. Possible cerebral effects (pro-cognitive) of the GLP-1 analogue treatment
      will associated and correlated with changes in the brain, functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI).

  <detailed_description>

      The primary endpoint is weight loss after 3 months of treatment with the GLP-1 analogue
      exenatide (Bydureon®).

      Secondary endpoints comprise both physiological/metabolic parameters and cognitive
      measurements:

        -  Metabolic endpoints include amongst others: changes in body fat (DEXA-scan) and changes
           of the HbA1c(average blood glucose levels), cholesterol and triglycerides. Moreover
           physiological effects will be examined eg possible effect on central/peripheral
           bloodpressure and heart rate.

        -  Cerebral endpoints will be investigated via functional magnetic resonance imaging
           (fMRI); including potential neuroprotective effects of exenatide. The main focus is
           potential hippocampal volume changes and potential changes in cerebral blood flow.
           Functional MRI will provide this data and the images will be correlated to both
           cognitive tests and questionnaires.

        -  Cognitive endpoints comprise potential improvements in cognition with focus on specific
           memory tests (BACS, DART and Rey's Complex Figure) and possible improvements in
           subjective quality of life (questionnaires).
