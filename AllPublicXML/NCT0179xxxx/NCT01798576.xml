  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, national, multicenter, observational study will evaluate in routine
      clinical practice the efficacy and safety of re-treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon
      alfa-2a) plus ribavirin or regimens containing direct-acting antivirals in participants with
      chronic hepatitis C who failed previous treatment. Participants will be followed for the
      duration of their treatment (24, 48 or 72 weeks) and for 24 weeks of follow-up.
