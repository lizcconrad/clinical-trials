  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive elderly individuals have showed higher basal level of cortisol and lower level of
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Moreover, changes on these hormone levels have also observed
      in reactivity of an acute stress, such as physical exercise. On the other hand, physical
      training can modulate the release of these hormones. Therefore, depressive elderly
      individuals physically actives might show attenuated reactivity of an acute physical stressor
      compared to sedentary elderly individuals. The aim of these study is to compare the effect of
      an acute physical stressor on cortisol levels in depressive and healthy individuals,
      physically actives and sedentaries. Additionally, the sulfated form of DHEA (DHEAS) serves as
      a reservoir for DHEA, because of that it is expected that DHEAS levels might reduce after the
      acute physical exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depressive and healthy individuals were submitted to one session of 30 minutes of physical
      exercise of moderate intensity. Before and soon after the exercise it was collected saliva -
      to analyse cortisol and DHEAS hormones - and some psychological and physical aspects were
      also collected, such as anamneses, scales of anxiety, temperaments, mood, stress and quality
      of life. Moreover, during exercise heart rate and mood scale were assessed. To evaluate the
      reactivity and recovery of physical stressor (physical exercise) saliva tubes and
      psychological scales were collected 30 minutes and 45 minutes after the end of exercise.
