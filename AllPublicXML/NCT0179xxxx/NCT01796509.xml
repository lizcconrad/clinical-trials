      Study Hypothesis:

      Critical illness is associated with long-term medical and psychological sequelae that can
      impact the professional and private life. The purpose of the present multicenter randomized
      controlled trial is to assess whether or not a medical, psychological and social follow-up
      improves quality of life of critically ill patients at one year after their discharge from
      intensive care unit (ICU).

      Primary Purpose:

      Death or severe alteration of quality of life assessed with help of EQ5D questionnaire at one
      year after ICU discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients who had required at least 3 days of mechanical ventilation and who
      consented to participate will be randomized at time of ICU discharge in either follow-up or
      not follow-up arm. The medical, psychological and social follow-up consists of
      multidisciplinary consultation at time of ICU discharge (i.e. inclusion), at three, six and
      12 months afterward. Patients of the &quot;non follow-up group&quot; will be seen only at one year.
      Medical consultation will be focused on evaluation of pre-existing co-morbidities, detection
      of new ones and of physical disorders related to critical illness (i.e. ICU-acquired paresis,
      pain, functional disability, cognitive dysfunction…). Psychological assessment will be
      focused on detection of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Social
      follow-up will assess the social need of the patient in the professional and private domains.
      Each assessment will be standardized by using validated or appropriate scores. At the end of
      each multidisciplinary consultation, a report will be sent to the patient and his general
      practitioner. When necessary, a consultation with a specialist will be organized. At one
      year, an observer blinded from randomization will call all the patients to assess their
      quality of life with help of EQ5D questionnaire. Economical cost of multidisciplinary
      follow-up will be assessed.

      To our knowledge, there is no follow-up studies that have combined a medical, psychological
      and social cares. For instance, the PracTical study has not evidenced an improvement of
      quality of life in patients who had beneficiated from nurse consultations at 3 and 9 months.

    <description>After having given his consent, the patient filled auto questionnaire, and then randomized either in follow up arm (i.e. intervention group) or in no follow up arm (i.e. control group). In the follow up arm, medical, psychological and social consultation will be planned within the first seven days after inclusion, and then 3, 6, 12 months. During medical consultation a general examination will be performed, muscle strength, cognitive function, functional disabilities will be assessed with help of MRC, MMS. During psychological consultation, anxiety and depression will be assessed with the help of HAD, IES. The psychologist will also have a free interview. During social consultation personal and professional reinsertion will be assessed.</description>
