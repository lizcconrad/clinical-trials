  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant recipients have a high risk to develop skin malignancies. This effect depends on
      the one hand on the immunosuppressive drugs themselves and relates on the other hand on the
      dosage. Based on the encouraging results of previous, retrospective studies on patients
      treated with Sirolimus (SRL), these patients should be switched to an immunosuppressive
      regime including SRL, decreasing the dosage of calcineurin-inhibitors or converting from
      former immunosuppression. A conversion to a SRL-based therapy is effective in
      immunosuppression and safe regarding graft and patient survival.

      This study was designed to assess whether a switch to a SRL-immunosuppressive therapy
      decreases the incidence/reoccurrence of skin neoplasm.

    <description>Patients who meet all inclusion criteria will be included into the study and randomised. If converted to Sirolimus (SRL), patients will take SRL according to the investigator's instructions and medication label, once daily preferably 4 hours after calcineurin-inhibitor medication or in case without calcineurin-inhibitor co-medication in the morning. The dose of SRL will be correlated to the former immunosuppressive therapy according to the study's conversion protocol.</description>
