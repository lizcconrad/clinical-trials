  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to provide data of the effectiveness and feasibility of
      the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in enhancing the physically active lifestyle among
      sedentary adults. The psychological and motivational factors related to physical activity and
      behavior change will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In more detailed the study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the acceptance- and
      commitment-based behavioural intervention concerning physical activity level and
      self-efficacy, as well as regarding planning and the acceptance of psychological and physical
      discomfort related to physical activity after 3 and 6 months compared to providing only
      individual written feedback on their physical activity. A further aim was to explore
      stability and maintenance of changes in physical activity at the 6 months follow-up. It was
      hypothesised that acceptance- and commitment-based behavioural intervention is more effective
      than feedback only in improving physical activity and related beliefs and cognitions.

    <measure>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, AAQ-2</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and change after 3, 6, 9 and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological wellbeing is measured using the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-2), which is a 10-item Likert-type questionnaire that assesses people's ability to take a non-elaborative, non-judgmental approach to their internal events, so that they can focus on the present moment and act in a way that is congruent with their values and goals, rather than with their internal events (e.g., fears, urges, prejudices).</description>

    <measure>the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and change after 3, 6, 9 and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KIMS is a 39-item self-report inventory used to assess mindfulness skills. The questionnaire contains four different specific subscales or skills: 1) observing, 2) describing, 3) acting with awareness, and 4) accepting without judgment. Participants rated each item on a 5-point Likert type scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (almost always or always true). Items reflects either direct descriptions of the mindfulness skills or the absence of that skill, and are reverse scored.</description>

    <description>The participants will get written feedback about their physical activity level after the baseline, and after 3, 6, 9 and 15 months of baseline compared to the current physical activity recommendations. Feedback will be created to illustrate participants´ activity level during the measurement week combining also the information from the diary. Feedback will be posted home and don´t include face to face interaction. As an incentive for participation, participants will also have opportunity to attend a body composition analyze and get short interpretation (15 min) of their own results in the research center.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>ACT group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>The ACT group gets the same procedure as the REF group. In addition, they will participate the ACT based program. The intervention program consists of six group sessions, about 90 minutes per session during the 9 weeks period of time. All the participants get also pedometers for monitoring their physical activity during the intervention.
The program aims to enhance physically active lifestyle and well-being through important life values and build committed action based on the chosen important things. The importance is also placed to a mindful awareness and flexibility to everyday actions related to physical activity. The program don´t include psycho-educational elements or counseling of the health or the health benefits of physical activity.</description>
