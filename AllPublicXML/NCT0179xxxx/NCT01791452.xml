  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a world-wide problem with a global prevalence
      estimated at 1.5 billion people. It is characterised by significant diversity and phenotypic
      heterogeneity. Morbidity rates are estimated at 20% to 30% in Western adults, increasing to
      90% in patients who are morbidly obese or diabetic. Risk factors in non-obese NAFLD patients
      are of especial practical and theoretical importance. Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease
      (CESD) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease of variable phenotype, caused by a
      deficiency in lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) and characterized by accumulation of fat in tissues
      and organs. Hepatic accumulation of fat in this disorder can cause hepatomegaly with varying
      degrees of damage varying from steatosis to fibrosis, elevated aminotransaminases, and
      isolated splenomegaly. Since the contribution of LAL deficiency to non-obese NAFLD is poorly
      understood, the investigators propose to evaluating the association between NAFLD and LAL
      deficiency in a prospective study in our population.

        400 subjects will be enrolled and informed consent obtained. After clinical evaluation,
        subjects will undergo liver ultrasound, non-invasive liver elastography (Fibroscan) and
        standard biochemical evaluation including glucose, insulin, TG, HDL, LDL, leptin,
        adiponectin and TNF-alpha. They will then be divided into 2 groups: NAFLD, and NAFLD with
        fibrosis (NASH). In addition a cohort of healthy volunteers will also be studied. LAL
        activity in dry blood spots (DBS) will be measured using the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl
        palmitate. LAL activity will be measured by measuring total lipase activity and lipase
        activity in the presence of Lalistat2.
