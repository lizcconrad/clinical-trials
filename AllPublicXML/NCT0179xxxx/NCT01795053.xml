  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 60 children is randomly assigned to an intervention and a control condition. The
      intervention group receives 15 sessions of child-focused treatment with play training to
      enhance play persistence and intensity. The control group receives the same amount of placebo
      play sessions. The intervention group receives subsequently 15 sessions of parent training.
      All children are 3 to 6 years old and meet diagnostic criteria for ADD or ADHD. Main
      hypothesis are a stronger reduction of ADHD symptoms of the child in different settings in
      the intervention than in the control group. Play-persistence and -intensity should also
      increase more in the intervention group. An additional effect of a subsequent parent training
      shall furthermore be tested.
