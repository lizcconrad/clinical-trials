  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether the 8-week Hopeful Outdoor Parkinson's Exercise (HOPE) Program would be
      effective in improving balance performance, physical functions, gait parameter, balance
      confidence, health-related quality-of-life, disease-specific motor performance and
      fall-related outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD) non-fallers and single fallers.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies demonstrated that multi-modal balance training program was effective in
      improving balance performance in people with PD. However they did not include all the balance
      domains and outdoor fall-prone activities have been overlooked. We designed a task- and
      context-specific balance training program based on the framework of the Balance Evaluation
      Systems Test (BESTest) to target all six balance domains including biomechanical constraints,
      stability limits and verticality, anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural
      responses, sensori-motor integration and dynamic gait control.
