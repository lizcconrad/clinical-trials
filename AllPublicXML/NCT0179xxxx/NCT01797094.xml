    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving None or Mild on the Investigator's Assessment of the Severity of Crow's Feet Lines (CFL) at Maximum Smile Using the Facial Wrinkle Scale-Asian (FWS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of the participant's Crow's Feet lines at maximum smile using the 4-point Facial Wrinkle Scale where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe. The percentage of participants with a score of none or mild at Day 30 is reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Much Improved or Very Much Improved in the Subject's Assessment of Appearance of CFL as Measured by the Global Assessment of Change in Crow's Feet Lines (SGA-CFL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated the change in their Crow's Feet Lines using the SGA-CFL 7-point scale where 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse or 7=very much worse at Day 30. The percentage of participants who reported Much Improved or Very Much Improved at Day 30 is reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a ≥2-Point Improvement From Baseline for Facial Line Outcomes Questionnaire (FLO-11) Item 2 at Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The FLO-11 questionnaire is comprised of 11 items that assess the subject's perceptions about specific aspects of their facial lines for the previous 7 days. Each question was scored on an 11-point scale (0=not at all, 5=somewhat, 10=very much). FLO-11 responders were defined as the percentage of participants with a ≥2-point improvement from Baseline in FLO-11 Item 2 : &quot;When I look in the mirror, my facial lines make me look older than I want to look&quot; score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Rate Themselves in a Younger Self-Perception of Age Category Than at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were considered to judge themselves as looking younger if the category change was from &quot;look my current age&quot; at Baseline to &quot;look younger&quot; at Day 30 or from &quot;look older&quot; at Baseline to &quot;look my current age/younger&quot; at Day 30.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Mostly or Very Satisfied With Their Crow's Feet Lines on the Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their overall satisfaction at the present moment using a 5-point scale where -2=very dissatisfied, -1=mostly dissatisfied, 0=neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, 1=mostly satisfied and 2=very satisfied. The percentage of participants mostly or very satisfied is reported.</description>
