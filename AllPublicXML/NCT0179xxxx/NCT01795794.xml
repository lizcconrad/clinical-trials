    <textblock>
      Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia Type I (CDAI) is a recessive autosomal disease caused by
      ineffective erythropoiesis that causes Anemia &amp; accumulation of iron due to increased
      absorption of iron in the intestine.

      The iron is being accumulated in the body &amp; causes damage of the liver, heart &amp; endocrine
      glands.

      The standard follow up of iron levels is done by ferritin blood test &amp; although the test is
      not accurate it is the most available.

      Medical treatment to removal of iron excess from the body is given in ferritin levels of
      500-1000.

      3 drugs are approved in the market:

        -  Deferoxamine, given subcutaneous during the night, 5-7 nights/week and therefore is less
           used today.

        -  Deferiprone-given 3 times a day, is a weaker chelator, although it seems like it is good
           to give it in combination with one of the 2 other drugs because it removes the iron from
           the heart's cells better.

      A rare but severe adverse effect is Agranulocytosis. This drug is usually not given in
      childbirths.

      -The 3rd drug which is mostly in use today is Deferasirox, given once daily, but has also
      adverse effects, among them- damage of liver &amp; kidney function, damage to the digestive
      system, hearing and seeing.

      Iron is being absorbed in acidic area, &amp; thus drugs which decrease the acidity like hydrogen
      pump's inhibitors, can inhibit the absorption of iron, and indeed there are reports that
      these drugs decrease the absorption of iron and were used as treatment to hemochromatosis as
      well.

      Those hydrogen pump's inhibitors have also adverse effects. The rarest but most severe is
      intestine infection by Clostridium.

      In children, reports of adverse effects are minimal- mostly headaches &amp; abdominal pains and
      nosocomial infections. In adults, there are reports of fractures, magnesium deficiency &amp;
      vitamin B12 deficiency. All in all, the adverse effects are rare &amp; uncommon.

      The aim of this study is to check whether treatment with drug which inhibits the hydrogen
      pump and therefore decreases acidity, will reduce the iron's absorption in patients with CDA
      TYPE I and whether it will be possible to use it for a period instead of giving drugs which
      have much more adverse effects, for removal of iron excess from the body.

      Therefore, we would like to enroll 10-12 patients over 30 kg who can swallow tablets (age
      over 12) and whose ferritin levels are higher from the normal range, but still don't require
      medical treatment (ferritin levels between 400-700).

      These patients will be given LOSEC 20 mg X 1/day for 6 months. That group will be her own
      control group in the 6 months later. Drug will be dispensed to the patients.

      In the beginning of the study, after signing Informed Consent Form, blood tests will be taken
      for Complete Blood Count, iron levels, iron saturation, ferritin, complete chemistry panel,
      including calcium &amp; magnesium.

      Same tests will be taken after 3 and 6 months and also 3 and 6 months after end of treatment.

      In every event of fever, headaches, abdominal pain or diarrhea, patients need to apply the
      doctor and report.
