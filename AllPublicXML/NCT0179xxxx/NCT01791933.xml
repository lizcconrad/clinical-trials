      cervical spine pain patients due to spinal disease.

      After subjects selected by screening, who receive CAM treatments 1-2times a week for more
      than 2 months and F/U at 1st, 2nd, 3rd month by meeting and F/U at 6nd, 12nd month by
      calling.

      The CAM treatments used in this study consists of 120ml of Chuna herbal medicine(Ostericum
