      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ESBA1008 versus EYLEA® in
      the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of 16 visits (Screening, Baseline [Day 0], and 14 post-baseline
      assessment visits) that occurred at 4-week intervals through Week 56. Enrolled subjects were
      randomized 1:1 to receive ESBA1008 or EYLEA. All subjects received active intravitreal (IVT)
      injections at baseline with 2 additional loading doses of the assigned investigational
      product at 4-week intervals (ie, at Weeks 4 and 8) and then received further injections at
      8-weeks intervals at Weeks 16, 24, and 32. Subjects in the ESBA1008 group also received an
      injection at Week 44, while subjects in the EYLEA group also received injections at Weeks 40
      and 48. To maintain the study masking, subjects in the ESBA1008 group received sham
      injections at Weeks 40 and 48 (when the subjects in the EYLEA group received active
      injections), while subjects in the EYLEA group received a sham injection at Week 44 (when the
      subjects in the ESBA1008 group received an active injection). All subjects were followed up
      to Week 56. Week 40 visit was the end of assessment period for the 8-week treatment cycle.

    <measure>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Change From Baseline (No. of Letters) to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure was used to compare the ESBA1008 and EYLEA groups in regards to fluctuations in treatment effect during the maintenance phase with 8-week treatment cycles (ie, to evaluate treatment effect stability during the maintenance phase). BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing was reported in letters read correctly. Improvement of BCVA was defined as an increase (gain) in letters read from the baseline assessment. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Average BCVA Change From Baseline (No. of Letters) Over the Periods of Week 4 to Week 16, Week 4 to Week 24, Week 4 to Week 40, and Week 4 to Week 56</measure>

    <description>The purpose of this outcome measure was to assess the integrated effect of the treatment for different study periods and to provide more robust estimate of the absolute treatment effects. BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) using ETDRS testing was reported in letters read correctly. Improvement of BCVA was defined as an increase (gain) in letters read from the baseline assessment. These changes were computed as the average of the changes from baseline to each monthly study visit corresponding to each period. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this outcome measure was to assess the average maintenance level of BCVA following the 3 loading treatments (ie, after Week 12). BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) using ETDRS testing was reported in letters read correctly. Improvement of BCVA was defined as an increase (gain) in letters read from the baseline assessment. These changes were computed as the average of the changes from Week 12 to each monthly study visit corresponding to each period. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this outcome measure was to assess the stability of BCVA during the second month of 8-week/12-week treatment cycles and specifically to identify potential under treatment. BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) using ETDRS testing was reported in letters read correctly. Improvement of BCVA was defined as an increase (gain) in letters read from the baseline assessment. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <title>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Change From Baseline (No. of Letters) to Week 12</title>
        <description>This outcome measure was used to compare the ESBA1008 and EYLEA groups in regards to fluctuations in treatment effect during the maintenance phase with 8-week treatment cycles (ie, to evaluate treatment effect stability during the maintenance phase). BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing was reported in letters read correctly. Improvement of BCVA was defined as an increase (gain) in letters read from the baseline assessment. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <description>The purpose of this outcome measure was to assess the integrated effect of the treatment for different study periods and to provide more robust estimate of the absolute treatment effects. BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) using ETDRS testing was reported in letters read correctly. Improvement of BCVA was defined as an increase (gain) in letters read from the baseline assessment. These changes were computed as the average of the changes from baseline to each monthly study visit corresponding to each period. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>
