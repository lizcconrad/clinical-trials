  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects on brain perfusion of the two currently vasopressors used to treat accidental
      hypotension occurring during carotid surgery (i.e. ephedrine and phenylephrine) is not known,
      but a disadvantage to use phenylephrine is suspected, due to its mechanism of action and
      according to published reports
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised trial comparing ephedrine and phenylephrine as used for accidental
      hypotension occurring during carotid surgery, on cerebral perfusion, assessed by
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
