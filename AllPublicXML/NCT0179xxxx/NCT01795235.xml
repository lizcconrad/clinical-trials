  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon has been used for decades as a test of growth hormone (GH) reserve. The pathway by
      which GH is stimulated by glucagon is not established. Acyl ghrelin has been shown to
      increase GH levels and to be stimulated by an increase in adrenergic activity. The proposed
      study will test the concept that with the fall in blood glucose it is likely that there is a
      sympathetic discharge which contributes to the increase in acyl ghrelin and indirectly leads
      to the increase in GH and cortisol.

    <textblock>
      Glucagon given to healthy adults in doses of 1-1.5 mg i.m. has been shown to result in a peak
      glucagon level in the circulation after 30 min, followed by an increase in glucose and
      insulin levels. The subsequent decline in glucose, insulin and glucagon was followed by an
      increase in cortisol and GH. Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid peptide which is released from the
      fundus of the stomach, within the oxyntic glands and the small intestine. It circulates in
      two major forms, acylated and des-acylated ghrelin. Acylated ghrelin has strong GH-releasing
      effects which are mediated via the G-protein coupled ghrelin receptor. The proposed study
      will test the concept that with the fall in blood glucose during a glucagon test it is likely
      that there is a sympathetic discharge which contributes to the increase in acyl ghrelin and
      indirectly leads to the increase in GH and cortisol.
