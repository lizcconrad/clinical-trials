  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SD-809 for the treatment of chorea
      associated with Huntington's Disease. Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized (1:1) into
      the study, with approximately 45 subjects receiving SD-809 and 45 subjects receiving placebo.
      The study will be conducted at approximately 30 centers in the U.S. and Canada.

    <description>Change in the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) physical functioning score (based on items 3a to 3j) from Baseline to Week 12. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>The Berg Balance Test (BBT) is a 14-item assessment of sitting, standing, transferring, and turning. Each task ranging from standing up from a sitting position, to standing on one foot each task is given a score of zero (unable) to four (independent), and the final measure is the sum of all of the scores.The scale range, which is 0-56, with higher scores indicating better balance/lower fall risk.</description>
