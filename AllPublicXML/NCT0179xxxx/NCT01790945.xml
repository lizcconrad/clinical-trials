    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is explore if a partnership and screening program put in place
      between a busy retina practice and their referring diabetes care offices can improve diabetic
      retinopathy and diabetic macular edema diagnosis, care and overall diabetes control in
      patients with diabetic eye disease.

      Retina Institute of Hawaii will place an infrastructure to screen for diabetic
      retinopathy/diabetic macular edema in 5 of the states largest Primary Care Clinics, General
      Medical and or Endocrine practices which re our primary referrals for diabetes patients. Each
      Sub-site will receive a DRS Automated Retinal Camera and our staff will train the sub-site's
      staff on taking images. The submission of these images to our practice will be administered
      by an automated job scheduler in the DRS Automated Retinal Camera removing the requirement of
      the locations to send images. Images will be electronically uploaded and sent to the Retina
      Institute of Hawaii for detailed interpretation and report sent back to the patients, their
      diabetes care MD's and their nurse practitioners/diabetic educators.
