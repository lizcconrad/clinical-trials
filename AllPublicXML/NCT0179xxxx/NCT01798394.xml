  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to investigate the potential efficacy of exogenous
      progesterone (with supplemental relapse prevention counseling) on postpartum relapse in new
      mothers. Also to determine the feasibility of enhanced compliance monitoring and
      identification of collateral factors effecting outcomes.

      Pregnant women will be recruited at gestational weeks 33-36 who have quit smoking during
      pregnancy and are motivated to maintain abstinence after delivery. At the time of delivery,
      women will be randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of active or placebo exogenous
      progesterone starting on the 4th day postpartum. Participants will be in contact with study
      staff either by phone or clinic visits until 12 weeks postpartum to collect data on smoking
      status and protocol compliance, measure serum progesterone levels and receive behavioral
      counseling.

    <description>This was determined by the Feasibility Questionnaire; a 10-item measure used to assess participant expectations, satisfaction of study protocol, study medication and electronic data capture. All questions were answered on a four-point Likert-type scale (1=low acceptability and 4=high acceptability). The total score was determined by adding up all the scores and dividing by 10.</description>
