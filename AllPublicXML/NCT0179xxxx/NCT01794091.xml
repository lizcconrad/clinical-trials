    <textblock>
      People with diabetes are at an increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure, and it is
      important to be able to treat people with diabetes who are at risk for heart disease to
      prevent these outcomes. This study is looking at the importance of &quot;diffuse scar tissue&quot; that
      is found in the heart of diabetic people. We have discovered a way to detect diffuse scar
      tissue by cardiac MRI, a non-invasive test. In this study, we do cardiac MRI on diabetics
      with low risk stress test results and follow them for 5 years to see if the measure of scar
      tissue in the heart by MRI is related to events. If this study is positive, we will be able
      to use cardiac MRI scar tissue measurements to target those patients with diabetes who are at
      highest risk.

      This study will be conducted in TWO (2) PHASES:

      Phase 1: Prospective cohort study of patients with diabetes mellitus, in which index cardiac
      MRI will be done after screening to determine FIBROTIC INDEX. Patients are subsequently
      followed for 5 years for a primary endpoint (composite cardiovascular event).

      Phase 2: Of the patients with &quot;HIGH&quot; FIBROTIC INDEX, 50 patients will be randomly selected
      and randomized 1:1 to placebo:eplerenone 25 mg daily for 6 months, and a repeat cardiac MRI
      will be done to assess the fibrotic index post-treatment.

      Phase 2 is a PILOT study of 50 patients.

      The inclusion/exclusion criteria for the different phases is shown below.

             sarcoid, or amyloid)

          -  history of prior MI or coronary revascularization (by Q waves on electrocardiogram in
             2 contiguous leads or by clinical history)

          -  clinical HF (with prior hospital admission for HF or documentation of reduced LV
             ejection fraction after index CMR)

          -  metallic hazards

          -  hematocrit &lt; 30% (within 1 year of nuclear stress test) or history of active bleeding
             (within 3 months of stress test)

             of planned CMR)

             malignancy, advanced HIV/AIDS)

        For PHASE 2:

          -  Included in Phase I

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg on two occasions (at the initial nuclear stress
             test and at the index cardiac MRI)

          1. Concomitant cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or inducers;

          2. Concomitant potassium supplementation or potassium sparing diuretics;
