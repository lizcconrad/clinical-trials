      The purpose of this protocol is to improve the current FDA-approved continuous positive
      pressure auto-titration algorithm, including treatment precision, residual disease detection
      characteristics and phenotyping with the DeVilbiss brand AutoAdjust CPAP device.

    <measure>% Agreement Between Reviewer and Machine Pressure Settings During Sleep Study</measure>
    <time_frame>1 night</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective for the study was demonstrating effectiveness of therapy provided by the DeVilbiss AutoAdjust device as reported by the expert human reviewer. The primary endpoint was that expert human reviewer should agree with pressure changes made by the machine during each 20-minute epoch at least 80% of the time. Expert human reviewer reviewed each study and made a determination at 20-minute time points, in context of REM/NON-REM sleep and supine/non-supine positions, marking the machine pressure response with an &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;disagree.&quot; Pressure changes might show no change, increase or decrease during the 20-minute epoch.</description>

    <description>Subjects attended a one-night polysomnogram (PSG) titration study. DeVilbiss AutoAdjust CPAP with a revised algorithm was compared to hand-scored PSG to determine whether the machine results were equivalent to hand scores. Each subject acted as their own control for assessing accuracy of sleep event analysis and prescribed CPAP pressure.</description>
