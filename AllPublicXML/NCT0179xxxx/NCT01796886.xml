  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pupillary examination is a major component of the clinical examination and monitoring of
      brain-damaged patients in intensive care. The occurrence of abnormal size or pupillary
      reactivity is a prognostic factor of poor neurological outcome or an indicator of the
      neurological status degradation. To date, the monitoring of the pupils is clinical. The
      subjectivity of this measure and, the lack of reproducibility and definition of the
      abnormality remain as many obstacles to the development of a monitoring of early neurological
      deterioration. The recent development in pupillometer electronics allows the assessment of
      responsiveness to a calibrated light stimulus. It offers a reliable and reproducible measure
      of the pupil diameter. The pupillometers were funded by the association of &quot; Gueules Cassées
      &quot;.

      This study aims to establish a relationship between an abnormal pupillary reactivity
      detection by the electronic pupillometer and a deterioration in neurological status of the
      patient brain-damaged in the intensive-care unit (ICU). This is considered clinically
      relevant and has been defined by a lower Glasgow Coma Score of at least 2 points for 2 hours
      or involving a therapeutic action. If this relationship is demonstrated, the temporal
      relationship between data pupillometry and the patient's neurological status remain to be
      established more precisely. This is particularly relevant in neurosurgical context and aim to
      define the status of the electronic pupillometer in intensive care but also in emergency
      rooms services, the neurovascular units or in the pre-hospital care.

      Therefore the investigators will compare the pupillometry data in two patients groups,
      defined accordingly to the appearance or absence of neurological aggravation in the first 5
      days of treatment in intensive care, time-frame defined as the maximum risk period in
      patients with brain damage. The primary endpoint is represented by the estimated area under
      the ROC curve corresponding to the last measure of the change in pupil size before the onset
      of neurological deterioration and worse for the fifth day for non-aggravated.

      Thus the investigators propose to conduct a prospective trial, aiming to record the
      diagnostic value of pupillary reactivity by the electronic pupillometer in the monitoring of
      the neurological aggravation of brain damaged patient in ICU. The duration of the follow-up
      for a subject does not exceed 5 days. The statistical analysis requires the recruitment of 90
      patients, which sets the length of the inclusions to 14 months.
