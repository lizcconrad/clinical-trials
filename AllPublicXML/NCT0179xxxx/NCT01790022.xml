  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, efficacy of methylprednisolone in reduction of signs and symptoms (back pain,
      stiffness, joint pain and swelling) of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) will be
      investigated. It is expected, that a single dose of methylprednisolone 500 mg given
      intravenously at baseline will lead to a rapid reduction of symptoms of active AS, which can
      be seen already 2 weeks after drug administration.
