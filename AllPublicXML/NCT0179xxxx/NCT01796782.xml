      Primary End Point:

      - To compare the overall survival (OS) using QYHJ Granules or Xeloda as the second therapy in
      patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary End Points:

        -  Compare clinical efficacy by other measures including PFS,tumor response,and changes in
           quality of life (QOL) between these two groups.

        -  Examine the feasibility and assess the side effects of treatment using QYHJ Granules in
           patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically/cytologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patients have failed from the prior chemotherapy without Xeloda. Adjuvant chemotherapy
             containing Xeloda and 6 months before recruitment is included.

          -  Patients haven't taken QYHJ Granules before. Prior exposure to Traditional Chinese
             Medicine not based on QYHJ Formula is allowed provided that at least one week washout
             time is given prior to initiation of experimental treatment.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST criteria must be present. Bone scan abnormalities alone
             will not be accepted as measurable disease. Lytic lesions seen on plain radiographs
             will not be accepted as measurable disease but will be evaluated in conjunction with
             bone scan abnormalities. Pure blastic bone metastases will not be accepted as
             measurable disease. Pleural or peritoneal effusions will not be accepted as measurable
             disease. Irradiated lesions are not considered measurable.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant. Serum beta-HCG will be checked in all premenopausal
             patients.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ functions reflected by the laboratory criteria
             below: neutrophil counts ≥ 1.5×109 /L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, hemoglobin ≥ 85
             g/L, Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL, Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, ALT &lt; 3 x normal, albumin
             &gt;30g/L.

          -  Age ≥ 18.

          -  Prior local therapy, e.g., TACE or radiation, is allowed provided that at least 4
             weeks washout time is given.

          -  Concomitant bisphosphonates are allowed for patients with bone metastases. Patients

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status 3 or 4.

          -  Known central nervous system involvement and leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Previous Xeloda-based chemotherapy （except usage for Adjuvant chemotherapy and 6
             months before recruitment）.

          -  Prior treatment with QYHJ Granules.

          -  Other serious illness or condition including cardiac disease including congestive
             heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification III or IV),unstable angina,

          -  Concurrent infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, active HIV infection/HIV
             disease, psychiatric disorders, drug abuse.

          -  Known allergies to the QYHJ or Xeloda.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females. Serum pregnancy test to be assessed within 7 days prior
             to study treatment start, or within 14 days with a confirmatory urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to study treatment start. Men and women of childbearing potential
             not using effective means of contraception.

          -  Known other non-adenocarcinoma pathological type.

          -  Other primary tumour (including primary brain tumours) within the last 5 years prior
             to enrollment, except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal
             cell skin cancer.

          -  Inability to take oral medication, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption or
             unwilling to take the Traditional Chinese Medicine.

          -  Patiens who are suffering from diarrhea.
