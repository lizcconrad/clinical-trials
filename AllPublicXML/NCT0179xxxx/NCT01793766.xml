  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of overweight men and women. Everybody will receive a very low calorie diet
      to eat in place of meals for 10 weeks. During the last two weeks of the diet, half of the
      patients will receive an intervention to activate parts of their brain that can help them eat
      less. The other half of the patient will receive a placebo or sham intervention. The
      intervention will involve a small electric current given every day for 10 days. Everybody
      will be monitored for 16 more weeks (total of 26 weeks) while on a weight maintenance diet to
      see if the intervention helps people keep the weight off.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in weight from week 11 to 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 11 to 26</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be placed on a very low calorie diet from baseline to week 11. The primary end point is the maintenance of weight loss from week 11 to week 26 after the very low calorie diet is stopped.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in appetite hormones on mixed meal challenge test</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to 8, 11 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite hormones such as ghrelin change in response to nutrition. Dieting increases ghrelin and decreases other appetite hormones. We will assess if the brain modulation intervention will prevent the dieting induced increase in ghrelin and changes in other appetite hormones.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in appetite</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to 8, 11, 18 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>Degree of hunger (or satiety) can be assessed by use of visual analog scale and monitoring food intake diaries and questionnaires. We will assess if the brain modulation intervention can prevent the diet induced increases in appetite using the visual analog scale, food diary and questionnaires.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to 8 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>Weight loss can affect both fat mass and muscle (lean) mass. We will assess if the weight loss by low-calorie diet and weight maintenane facilitated by brain modulation will preferentially affect fat mass or lean mass by use of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in metabolic parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to 8, 11, 18, 26</time_frame>
    <description>Weight loss and successful weight loss maintenance can improve insulin resistance (risk for diabetes mellitus) and cholesterol profile. We will assess the changes in risk for diabetes and cholesterol from the low-calorie diet and brai modulation mediated weight maintenance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women age 20-55 years old

          3. Willing to undergo 10 week supervised VLCD

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Obesity due to a known secondary cause (Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, etc) or a
             history of weight loss surgery

          2. Subjects who have a known history of diabetes, fasting blood sugar &gt;125 mg/dl or using
             any anti-diabetic drugs

          3. Changes in lipid lowering or anti-hypertensive regimen within 3 months of screening

          4. Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL, Creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL

          5. QT interval &gt;440 ms on EKG

                  consciousness.

               2. Current or past history of skin disease or damaged skin on the scalp at the site
                  of stimulation (i.e. eczema, skin with ingrown hairs, acne, razor nicks, wounds
                  that have not healed, recent scar tissue, broken skin, etc.).

               3. Prior neurosurgical procedure or radiation treatment to the brain.

             (Note: Intake of centrally acting medications will be allowed, as there is no evidence
             that any medication can increase the risk of adverse effects during tDCS.)

          9. Subject is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial(s), or
