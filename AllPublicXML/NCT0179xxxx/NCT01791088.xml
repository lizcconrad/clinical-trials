    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies sirolimus in treating patients with solid tumors that are
      metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Sirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the magnitude, inter-individual variability and time course of
      sirolimus-induced changes in fasting serum glucose and triglycerides.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess candidate genetic variants for their correlation with changes in fasting glucose
      and/or triglycerides.

      II. To assess tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST,
      version 1.1) and explore whether there is any correlation between response and changes in
      fasting glucose and/or triglycerides.

      III. To assess toxicity by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version
      4.0) and explore whether there is any correlation between toxicities and changes in fasting
      glucose and/or triglycerides.

      IV. To quantify and determine the functional status of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs)
      before and during treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>These data will be analyzed by fitting mixed effects models for longitudinal data. A model linear in time with random patient intercept and slope effects will be fit initially and residuals examined. If a linear model does not fit the data adequately a quadratic term will be added. Simple paired t-tests of the glucose and triglyceride levels on day 8, 15, and 29 relative to baseline will also be performed.</description>

             metastases

          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease will be allowed

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation, up until 30 days after final study treatment;
             should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating in
             this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Patients taking substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 should
             be encouraged to switch to alternative drugs whenever possible, given the potential
             for drug-drug interactions with sirolimus

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (including
             sirolimus) is allowed; however, patients with &gt;= grade 3 toxicities with an mTOR
             inhibitor are excluded

          -  Fasting glucose &gt; 126 mg/dL or fasting triglycerides &gt; 150 mg/dL; patients are allowed
             to be on oral anti-hyperglycemic and anti-lipid therapies, but cannot be on insulin

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks of starting study
             drug, or radiotherapy within 14 days of starting study drug, or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or any concomitant

             with prior prostate cancer)

          -  Serious underlying medical or psychiatric illnesses that would, in the opinion of the
             treating physician, substantially increase the risk for complications related to
             treatment; similarly, any unstable medical condition that in the opinion of the
             treating physician or study investigators, would interfere with determination of the
             study objectives

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks
