  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) combined inductive and concurrent chemotherapy with more intensive regimen (cisplatin
      and paclitaxel) is feasible and effective than current standard treatment for high-risk
      locally advanced NPC patients.

      Meta-analysis showed chemotherapy when combined with conventional radiotherapy in locally
      advanced naso-pharyngeal carcinoma can improve 5-year overall survival with 6%, and beyond
      all concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin benefits most. However, from Lin's (Lin JC, 2004)
      study, locally advanced NPC with high risk factors can not benefit from conventional
      concurrent chemoradiation. Failure pattern analysis revealed that local and distant failure
      accounted for 50% respectively. Large-scale data has demonstrated that with IMRT, local
      control can achieve 90%. Previous studies showed inductive chemotherapy can decrease distant
      metastasis. We need more effective and stronger chemotherapy, and we still need to testify
      concurrent chemotherapy combined with inductive chemotherapy.

      A prospective trial would thus provide valuable information to help physicians and patients
      more precisely identify the feasibility and effectiveness of inductive + concurrent
      chemotherapy combined with IMRT for high-risk locally advanced NPC.
