  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggest that an increase in doses of weekly etanercept from 50 mg to 100 mg
      improves the efficacy of the treatment in patients with cutaneous psoriasis, rheumatoid
      arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. In this same line of study, during the 2007 2008 period,
      we conducted a multicenter, double-blind, 12-week Study (LoadET, 0881A3-102090) comparing the
      efficacy of etanercept at a standard dose (50 mg/week) versus a double dose (100 mg/week) in
      subjects with AS refractory to conventional therapy. The interim results of said study do not
      appear to support the value of doubling the dose of etanercept in the treatment of subjects
      with AS. Once this study was finalised, the subjects continued to be monitored by their
      regular physician, who decided on the dose and treatment to follow according to the
      conditions of standard clinical practice.

      The objective of this observational study is to evaluate the course of the disease in the
      long-term (three years) under the conditions of standard clinical practice, in subjects who
      had participated in the LoadET study. Therefore, we would like to follow-up on those patients
      by reviewing their clinical histories for the three-year period between the finalisation of
      their participation in the LoadET Study (0881A3-102090) and now. This will allow us to assess
      the efficacy and survival of the drug, as well as the possible appearance of side effects in
      the three years following the finalisation of the study by comparing the results according to
      if the subjects had received 50 mg/week or 100 mg/week during the LoadET study (0881A3
      102090).

      Given that this is a follow-up study of subjects who participated in the LoadET study
      (0881A3-102090), we have planned the inclusion of all subjects who completed said study, that
      is, 97 of the 108 subjects in the LoadET study.

    <description>During the LoadET study (0881A3-102090), subjects were treated with etanercept 100 mg versus 50 mg weekly. After completing this study, the subjects were allowed to continue the treatment with etanercept 50 mg weekly, etanercept 100 mg weekly, another drug, or abandoned medication at the discretion of their physician.
This is a non-interventional study in which historic data will be collected retrospectively from the patient's clinical history. During the historical period covered in the Study, patients would have received the treatment and the medical care that their treating physicians considered appropriate under the conditions of standard clinical practice.</description>

        <title>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)</title>
        <description>BASFI is a validated self-assessment tool that determines the degree of functional limitation in ankylosing spondylitis. Utilizing a VAS of 0-10, 0 = easy, 10 = impossible, participants answered 10 questions assessing their ability in completing normal daily activities or physically demanding activities. The BASFI score is a sum of the scores of the 10 questions, final score ranged from 0-100, where higher score referred to higher impairment in the functional ability.</description>
