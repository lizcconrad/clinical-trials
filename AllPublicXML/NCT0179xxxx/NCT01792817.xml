    <textblock>
      Multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled pivotal study of
      non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation with the GammaCore® device for the acute treatment of
      cluster headache. The study compares the safety and effectiveness of an active treatment
      (GammaCore) against a sham treatment.

    <description>The primary outcome measurement for effectiveness is the rate of responders for the active treatment group, compared to the sham control group.
A responder is defined as a subject who has recorded an intensity of 0 or 1 on the 5-point headache pain scale (no pain, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) at 15 minutes post-initiation of treatment of the first treated cluster headache attack of Phase 1.</description>

    <measure>Sustained Treatment Success at 1 Hour Post-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>For 1 hour post stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained treatment success at 1 hour post-treatment was defined as having recorded an intensity of 0 or 1 on the 5-point headache pain scale at 15 minutes and 1 hour post-initiation of treatment of the first treated cluster headache attack of Phase 1, and having refrained from use of rescue medications during the full 60 minute period</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Mean Attack Intensities Experienced Per Subject</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Cluster headache attack intensity was reported on a 5-point scale: no pain, mild, moderate, severe, very severe, whereas no pain =1 is the best outcome and very severe=5 is the worst outcome . The average of all subjects' mean attack intensities experienced at 15 minutes post-initiation of treatment during Phase 1 for the active treatment group, compared to the sham control group. The mean 15-minute scores were calculated for the first five attacks suffered by each subject during Phase 1. For subjects with fewer than five treated attacks, the scores for those available were averaged.</description>

The average of all subjects’ mean attack intensities experienced at 15 minutes post-initiation of treatment during Phase 1 for the active treatment group, compared to the sham control group. The mean 15-minute scores were calculated for the first five attacks suffered by each subject during Phase 1. For subjects with fewer than five treated attacks, the scores for those available were averaged.</description>
