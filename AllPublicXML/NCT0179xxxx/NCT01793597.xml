  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have a heart attack are regularly treated with either clopidogrel or ticagrelor.
      In a large clinical trial, treatment with ticagrelor before coronary bypass surgery (CABG)
      was associated with a lower risk of death than treatment with clopidogrel. The reason for
      this difference cannot be explained on the basis of the study. One possible explanation is
      that the reversible binding of ticagrelor is advantageous because when new platelets are
      released, they are inhibited by the drug. Because clopidogrel binds irreversibly it cannot
      redistribute. The investigators will recruit patients who are scheduled for surgery after an
      acute coronary syndrome who have been treated with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. After
      the patient provides informed consent, the investigators will review their medical
      record,record information and on the day after surgery the investigators will take one sample
      of blood. That blood will be analyzed for evidence of platelet activation (platelet
      microparticles, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates), the reactivity of young platelets, and
      the concentration of inflammatory cytokines. The investigators hypothesize that the evidence
      of platelet activation (platelet microparticles and platelet-leukocyte aggregates) and the
      reactivity of young platelets will be less in patients who have been treated previously with
      ticagrelor.
