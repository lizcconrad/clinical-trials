  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient receives a kidney transplant particularly if the kidney is from an older donor
      or one who has had the kidney removed after their heart has stopped, there is a risk that the
      newly transplanted kidney may not function immediately. If the delay in function means that
      dialysis is needed in the first 7 days after the transplantation then this is known as
      delayed graft function or dDGF. Also delayed graft function that does not require dialysis
      but is present because the serum creatinine does not fall sufficiently is known as functional
      delayed graft function or fDGF. This problem is often due to an excessive inflammatory
      reaction to not having had a blood supply between the time of donation and transplant.

      OPN-305 is a monoclonal antibody that blocks Toll-like Receptor 2 which is thought to be
      partly responsible for increasing the risk of this inflammation. It is hoped that the effects
      of the inflammation will be reduced and therefore prevent dDGF and fDGF from occurring.

      The purpose of the study is to explore how effective OPN-305 is in preventing dDGF and fDGF
      as well as improving other measures of kidney function and the overall safety of the
      antibody. In the first part of the study, each patient received an Infusion of one of three
      possible doses of OPN-305 or a placebo and in the second part the most suitable dose of
      OPN-305 and a placebo would be used. The purpose of this second part of the study is to find
      out if a dose of OPN-305 which has already been tested in an earlier part of this study can
      prevent kidney graft dysfunction. For the purposes of this study, kidney function will be
      assessed using the composite of delayed graft function (dDGF) because dialysis is necessary
      in the first 7 days and functional delayed graft function that does not require dialysis but
      is present because the serum creatinine, a key measure of renal function, does not fall
      sufficiently (fDGF) in the first 7 days post-transplant.

      Protocol OPN305-103 follows out to 12 months post-transplant the clinical status and graft
      function of patients who have completed the 6-month post-transplant period under Part A or
      Part B of OPN305-102.
