  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The end of treatment is for cancer patients the beginning of a critical
      rehabilitation period including numerous physical, emotional, professional and cognitive
      challenges. Specific interventions adapted to this post-treatment period need thus to be
      designed. Interventions such as group cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis have been
      shown to be effective. However, moderate effect sizes, no comprehensive description of the
      treatment interventions and assessments relying only on self-report measures warrant further
      investigation. This study aims to assess, in breast cancer patients at the end of treatment,
      the impact of a group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis versus
      a group intervention on patient's adjustment and emotion self-regulation.

      Design: This is a two-armed, longitudinal, randomized controlled trial. Breast cancer
      patients finishing their radiation therapy treatment will be randomized to either an
      immediate group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis or a group
      intervention. Patients will be assessed at three time points during the first year following
      the end of treatment: at 1 (T1), 6 (T2) and 12 (T3) months after the end of treatment.
      Patients' adjustment will be assessed through questionnaires. Patient emotion self-regulation
      ability will be assessed through their ability to respond both subjectively (self-reported
      emotional state) and objectively (heart rate) to two emotion self-regulation tasks.

      Discussion: It is hypothesized that a group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral
      therapy and hypnosis will be more effective than a group intervention. Results of this study
      will contribute to improving post-treatment care for breast cancer patients.
