  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety, tolerability and effects on central diastolic blood pressure
      (cDBP) of MK-8892 given as single oral doses in healthy male participants (Panel A and B) and
      in male participants with mild-to-moderate hypertension (Panel C).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to three planned panels of either 8 healthy participants (Panels A and B) or 8
      participants with mild to moderate hypertension (Panel C) will be enrolled. In Panels A and
      B, 8 participants will alternately receive single rising doses of MK-8892 or placebo. All
      doses will be administered in the fasted state, except Panel A, Period 5 in which a standard
      high-fat breakfast provided approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing.

      Panel A will begin first. At least 3 days will elapse before participants in the alternate
      panel (Panel B) will receive the next higher dose. In Panel C, 8 mild to moderate
      hypertensive male participants will receive single rising doses of MK-8892 or placebo. Panel
      C may begin after the first 4 periods of Panels A and B have completed dosing. For all
      panels, there will be at least 7 days washout between treatment periods for any given
      participant. Participants may only be enrolled in one panel of the study. Subsequent doses in
      any panel will be administered only after careful evaluation of safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacodynamic effects of a given dose.
