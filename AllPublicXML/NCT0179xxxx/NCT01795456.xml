    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of contrast enhanced carotid ultrasound
      to serve as an indicator of disease activity in patients with Takayasu's arteritis or Giant
      Cell arteritis and to determine if patients with active arteritis have a thickening of their
      blood vessel walls compared to healthy people of the same age and gender.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Takayasu's arteritis and Giant Cell arteritis are chronic, relapsing diseases of the large
      arteries which can lead to significant narrowing of the arteries through episodes of
      inflammation within the artery walls. The changes in the vessel walls will be determined by
      an ultrasound test looking at and measuring: carotid vessel wall changes called carotid
      Intimal-Media Thickness (cIMT) and the presence of new blood vessels (neovascularization)
      using a contrast agent. Ultrasound findings will be correlated with markers of inflammation
      in the blood, findings from other radiology studies (such as MRI) already ordered as part of
      routine clinical care, and physical exam findings and symptoms of consistent with disease
      activity. 15 arteritis patients and 5 healthy controls will be recruited.
