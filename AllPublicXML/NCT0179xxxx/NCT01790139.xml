    <textblock>
      CT colonography (CTC) is a recently developed radiological examination to find colorectal
      neoplasia. Fecal/fluid tagging using oral administration of contrast is an essential
      procedure for CTC. Iohexol, which has recently started being used as an agent for fecal/fluid
      tagging, has great advantages as it has much more tolerable taste and much lower rates of
      adverse effects such as clamping or diarrhea compared with traditionally used
      Gastrografin/Gastroview. However, iohexol is frequently associated with an occurrence of a
      lot of bubbles in the colon, which makes CTC interpretation more time-consuming and
      laborious.

      Past experience in colonoscopy field suggests that simethicone, a safety-proven highly
      inexpensive over-the-counter medicine, might resolve this issue. Given the fact that patient
      convenience is an important factor for a successful CTC and the fact that time-intensive
      nature of CTC interpretation is one of the major deterrents to wide spread adoption of CTC
      while CTC also needs to be as time efficient as possible in order to effectively serve the
      role of population screening for colorectal cancer, investigating the effect of simethicone
      to prevent the colonic bubbles on the time efficiency of CTC interpretation would be
      important. If simethicone can resolve the colonic bubble problem, CTC can be performed more
      conveniently for the patients as well as for the interpreting radiologists.

      This study is to determine whether colonic bubbles associated with CT colonography performed
      with iohexol for fecal/fluid tagging could be reduced by adding simethicone to the standard
      cathartic preparation.

The tagging is done by administering orally 50 mL of iohexol (Omnipaque 350, GE Healthcare) 10 minutes after the completion of Colonlyte. As the interventional procedure in this intervention group, 10 mL of simethicone is administered orally immediately following the administration of iohexol.</description>
