    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of
      entospletinib and idelalisib. Participants will be enrolled who have one of the following
      hematological tumor types: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL),
      mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or non-FL indolent
      non-Hodgkin lymphomas (iNHL; including lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström
      macroglobulinemia [LPL/WM], small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL], or marginal zone lymphoma
      [MZL]).

    <description>Objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), defined as the subjects' best overall response during entospletinib/idelalisib therapy and will include complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (or very good partial response [VGPR] or minor response [MR] for subjects with LPL/WM)</description>

    <measure>Safety and tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety: laboratory data, adverse events (AEs), and treatment-emergent AEs will be collected. Safety will be assessed by grading of laboratory values and AEs according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose level</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum tolerated dose level (MTD), defined as the highest dose level that was consistently well tolerated without dose limiting toxicity for the majority (ie, &gt; 50%) of the subject's time on treatment as determined by the investigator for each subject</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the interval from the first dose of entospletinib/idelalisib to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR), defined as the interval from the time first response (CR or PR [or VGPR or MR for subjects with LPL/WM]) is achieved to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause</description>

    <measure>Time to response</measure>
