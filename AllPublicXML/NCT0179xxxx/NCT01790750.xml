    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, feasibility study involving all neonates admitted to the neonatal
      intensive care unit with orders for a cardiac echo evaluation. Parents will be approached and
      provided a description of the study. No written consent will be requested, but parents have
      the option of opting out. Each patient will have a 5 minute Pocket echocardiography system
      scan followed by a full echo performed on a traditional full featured echo system. The
      objective is to assess if the current Food and Drug administration (FDA) approved Pocket
      echocardiography system (PES) can detect patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in neonates as
      comparable to traditional full featured echo systems (FFES) and/or physical exam alone.

      All newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with orders for a cardiac echo
      evaluation will be included in this study. Parents will be approached and provided a
      description of the study. No written consent will be requested, but parents have the option
      of opting out. If parents agree to be part of this study, a 5-minute PES scan will be
      performed first so as to not bias the sonographer. Then, a full echocardiogram study will be
      performed on a traditional FFES. The scans will be performed at the bedside. The images will
      be reviewed and compared by fellow and/or attending and by experienced sonographer. The scans
      will include short axis view, ductal view and arch view.

      The objective of the study is to assess if the current FDA approved PES can detect PDA in
      neonates as comparable to traditional full featured echo systems and/or physical exam alone.
      Using PES for PDA diagnosis will be an accessible, economic and effective way of
      complementing the findings in our physical exam by increasing diagnostic accuracy, and
      detecting PDA's at the bedside comparable to a full size traditional echocardiographic
      system.
