      The study is intended to collect specimens to support the application of genome analysis
      technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing. This study will ultimately provide
      cancer researchers with specimens that they can use to develop comprehensive catalogs of
      genomic information on at least 50 types of human cancer. The study will create a resource
      available to the worldwide research community that could be used to identify and accelerate
      the development of new diagnostic and prognostic markers, new targets for pharmaceutical
      interventions, and new cancer prevention and treatment strategies. This study will be a
      competitive enrollment study conducted at multiple institutions.

      This study will enroll subjects diagnosed with various cancers and who are scheduled to
      undergo surgical treatment. Prior to scheduled surgery, subjects will be asked to donate a
      10-20 ml blood sample. After surgery, surplus tissues (including tumor and adjacent normal
      tissues) not required for diagnosis will be collected. Subject clinical information will be
      collected, including basic demographic information, medical history, family history, current
      cancer history and treatment. After surgery, a final pathology report will be obtained for
      each subject's surgical specimen. In some instances and based on the cancer indications
      required, longitudinal data may also be collected at a frequency of every 6 months to once
      per year. Longitudinal data will include information on study subject survival and disease
      recurrence.

    <description>The specimens collected for this project will support genomic studies on the molecular basis of cancer. This study aims to collect specimens for a project that will systematically explore a spectrum of genomic changes involved in human cancer. Specifically the project will analyze DNA copy number changes, including large (on the order of chromosomal segments) and small (1,000 to 100,000 KB) scale rearrangements, transcription profiles, epigenetic modifications, sequence variation, and sequence in both tumor tissue and case-matched germline DNA. The suite of analysis platforms for collaborating laboratories will be applied to a common set of molecular analytes obtained from clinically annotated high-quality tumor specimens and case matched normal control specimens obtained form this specimen collection study. Initial measures critical to ensure specimen quality and qualification for subsequent analysis include confirmed histopathology and RNA integrity.</description>

      Surplus Surgical Tissues

      Tissue procurement will involve the collection of tissues snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      Tissues will include tumors and histologically normal (uninvolved) areas (&gt;2cm from tumor) of
      tissue. A tumor tissue sample is required; a normal tissue sample should be provided if
      available.

      Individual samples will be collected in weights (sizes) approximately 100-200 mg or larger.
      Research tissues sample collection will only be performed on surplus (discard) tissues not
      required for patient diagnosis and will never interfere with clinical diagnosis.

      Blood Samples

      Blood samples will be collected from consented subjects prior to surgery and will involve the
      collection of up to 20 ml of whole blood into appropriate blood collection tubes and freezing
      them.
