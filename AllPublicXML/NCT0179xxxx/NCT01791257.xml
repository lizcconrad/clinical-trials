    <textblock>
      In this study of patients suffering an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) we would like
      to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to the phenomenon delayed cerebral
      ischemia (DCI).

      We will accomplish this through analyzing the profile of microRNA expression in the
      cerebrospinal fluid of SAH patients treated with extraventricular drainage.

      At first we wish to compare the expression of 376 specific microRNA between 12 patients
      developing DCI (group 1) and 12 patients without DCI (group 2) in cerebrospinal fluid drawn
      on day 5 after ictus.

      Secondly specific microRNAs of interest in which the expression differs between group 1 and 2
      are analyzed daily to investigate the dynamic changes in expression and compared to the
      clinical course.

      Should we find no differently expressed specific microRNAs we will compare the expression of
      microRNA in group 1+2 with group 3.

      In addition, some of the patients as part of another clinical trial (NCT01447095

      ) will have established invasive neuromonitoring including microdialysis. It is our intention
      to develop a method for analyzing microRNA in this microdialysate.

      DCI as defined by Vergouwen et al in Stroke 2010;41(10):2391-2395:

      &quot;The occurrence of focal neurological impairment (such as hemiparesis, aphasia, apraxia,
      hemianopia, or neglect), or a decrease of at least 2 points on the Glasgow Coma Scale (either
      on the total score or on one of its individual components [eye, motor on either side,
      verbal]). This should last for at least 1 hour, is not apparent immediately after aneurysm
      occlusion, and cannot be attributed to other causes by means of clinical assessment, CT or
      MRI scanning of the brain, and appropriate laboratory studies.&quot;

    <description>Delayed Cerebral Ischemia as defined by Vergouwen et al in Stroke 2010;41(10):2391-2395.
We found confirmation/exclusion of DCI difficult in a few patients. To minimize error, two clinicians reviewed all clinical, biochemical and radiological data, obtained 3 weeks from ictus, and independently assessed if any clinical deterioration fulfilled the criteria of delayed cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, included patients were categorized as &quot;definitely DCI&quot;, &quot;probably DCI&quot;, &quot;probably not DCI&quot; or &quot;definitely not DCI&quot;.
Therefore we decided to modify our primary outcome measure in this case-control study to compare &quot;definitely DCI&quot; vs. &quot;definitely not DCI&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>21 days following ictus</time_frame>
    <description>Delayed Cerebral Ischemia as defined by Vergouwen et al in Stroke 2010;41(10):2391-2395.
In contrast to our primary outcome measure, these groups will include patients where DCI was difficult to exclude or confirm.
Thereby we wish to compare &quot;definitely DCI&quot; and &quot;probably DCI&quot; vs. &quot;probably not DCI&quot; and &quot;definetly not DCI&quot;. This would enable comparison between larger groups though less clean.</description>

    <time_frame>Following a blinded description of CT-scans</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of cerebral infarction on CT or MR scan of the brain within 6 weeks after SAH, or on the latest CT or MR scan made before death within 6 weeks, or proven at autopsy, not present on the CT or MR scan between 24 and 48 hours after early aneurysm occlusion, and not attributable to other causes such as surgical clipping or endovascular treatment. Hypodensities on CT imaging resulting from ventricular catheter or intraparenchymal hematoma should not be regarded as cerebral infarctions from DCI.</description>

    <measure>Relation of microRNA profile to the regional area of cerebral injury</measure>
    <time_frame>Following a blinded description of CT-scans</time_frame>
    <description>As microRNAs seem to be specific for different areas of the brain our screening might tell us which area has sustained injury and which has not. This study will not include two groups as the secondary outcome measures above.</description>
