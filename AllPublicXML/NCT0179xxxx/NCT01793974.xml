      This is a prospective study that will study adults and has the objective of examining 'Latent
      Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults' (LADA) to understand how this trait is influenced by genetic
      factors.

    <textblock>
      A case-control study approach will be used to compare the allelic frequencies of
      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) markers of the cases (i.e., LADA patients) to a randomly selected
      control samples that does not have the trait under study. To study the role of genetic
      factors in LADA, the study seeks to determine if certain genomic regions that are captured or
      mirrored by selective Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are genotyped, are over or
      underrepresented in those with the disease compared to those who do not. The level of
      auto-antibodies is the serum can also be studied as a quantitative trait where we ask the
      question if there is correlation with specific SNP alleles that are genotyped. The markers
      that are found to be over or under-represented in the study cases will then be tested in an
      independent set of patients also recruited in this study. This allows us to filter markers
      that show significance simply by chance and prevents us from being misled.
