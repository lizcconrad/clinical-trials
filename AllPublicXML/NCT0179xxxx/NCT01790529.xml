  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) are the most frequent hospital acquired infections in patients
      who underwent surgery. With regards to the increasing financial restraint in patient care,
      the socio-economic burden of SSI in the public health sector and its prevention gains in
      importance.

      The prophylactic application of antibiotics (surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis, SAP) prior
      to the skin incision significantly reduces the risk of SSI, but the correct time point of
      drug administration remains unclear. Most studies recommend application of SAP directly prior
      to skin incision. Other studies, however, suggest that this is too late and more time between
      administration of the SAP and skin incision is necessary for optimal SSI prevention. A large
      cohort study in Switzerland concluded that SAP should be applied between 74 and 30 minutes
      prior to skin incision.

      Due to the obvious importance of this controversy, we want to answer this question with a
      clinical study (randomized controlled trial, RCT) at the University Hospital of Basel and the
      Cantonal Hospital of Aarau. We plan to investigate two administration strategies according to
      the timing of the SAP. Strategy A will consist of SAP application in the anesthetic room
      located in front of the actual operating theatre, where the patient gets anesthesia.
      Therefore, the application of SAP will take place early, approximately between 75 and 30
      minutes prior to skin incision. In strategy B we will apply SAP in the operating theatre,
      which on average occurs later (approximately within the last 30 minutes before skin
      incision).

      We test the hypothesis that strategy A is more effective in preventing SSI than strategy B.
      We will include a total of 5000 patients in abdominal, vascular and trauma surgery (2500 at
      each study site and 2500 per study group). All patients will be followed in the hospital for
      SSI occurrence. Additionally, all patients will be interviewed by telephone after hospital
      discharge at a defined follow-up period of 30 days (1 year if an implant is in place, such as
      hip endoprosthesis or meshes). We expect this study to be completed within approximately 3
      years.

      Additionally, the association between the following pre-defined variables and the occurence
      of SSI, mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay (LOS) will be investigated:

        -  laparoscopy

        -  tutorial assistance during operation

        -  obesity (Body Mass Index, BMI)

        -  preoperative Virtual Reality (VR) training

        -  Adherence to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) concept

        -  smoking status

        -  perioperative blood glucose levels

        -  preoperative levels of HbA1c

        -  intensified insulin resistance as measured by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) and
           quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI)

        -  type of diabetes (IDDM vs. NIDDM)

        -  intraoperative Hypothermia (body core temperature)

        -  Lack of adherence to the principles of asepsis during surgery

        -  surgical experience

        -  patients age

        -  Malnutrition, measured by Hypalbuminaemia

        -  emergency operations

        -  immunosuppression and steroids

        -  Predictive value of Procalcitonin

        -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification

        -  intraoperative blood transfusion

        -  preoperative wound class

      Amendments:

      The following changes were made to the study protocol according to amendments approved by the
      local ethics committee:

        -  As of April 22nd, 2013, or the 222. patient randomized at the University Hospital Basel,
           the time the SAP infusion STARTED was recorded instead of the time that it ENDED. The
           decision to change this important parameter was taken in order to make results of this
           trial more comparable to those of other published studies.

        -  In the original study protocol it was planned to provide each randomized patient with a
           patient's diary to record signs of SSI. This was abandoned for limited benefit and in
           order to minimize patients' time and effort.

        -  Patients who undergo combined surgery (by one of the participating surgical specialties
           plus by a non participating specialty) shall not be included in this trial as outcomes
           (SSI) could be difficult to correlate to one or another part of surgery. This had not
           been specified as an exclusion criterion in the original study protocol.

        -  Patients' information sheets and informed consents in one of the languages other than
           German were only approved by the local ethics committees by May 15th, 2013.

        -  As per ethics committees regulations, patients can only be included in more than one
           clinical trials under specific circumstances. Therefore only a limited percentage of
           patients that are already included in other studies can still be included for this
           trial. However, overall, this only excludes a very limited number of potentially
           includable patients.

      The following additional amendments were authorized by the ethics committees on August 9th,
      2014:

      - Version 4 of the patients' information and the written consent form. In these new versions,
      patients are specifically asked for permission to review their general practitioners' notes
      concerning potential SSI, for planned follow up as well as in case of readmission to
      hospital. This is specified in the study protocol, but had not been specifically mentioned in
      the patients' information and consent forms. This change is also intended to significantly
      decrease the number of patients lost to follow up as it proved difficult to contact some
      patients by telephone.
