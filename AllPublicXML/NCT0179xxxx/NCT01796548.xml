  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and tolerability (how well a participant
      can stand a particular medicine or treatment) of flexible dose Oxybutynin Extended-Release
      (OXY-ER, Lyrinel) including safety and quality of life assessment in participants with
      neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO - the nerves mediating the detrusor muscle do not work
      properly leading to frequent feeling of need to urinate during the day, night, or both).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm,
      prospective (study following participants forward in time), multi-center study of
      participants with NDO. The initial dose of Oxybutynin ER will be 10 milligram (mg) and will
      be titrated to a maximum of 30 mg. Dosage will be adjusted in 5-mg increments at
      approximately 14-day intervals until continence is achieved or the participant cannot
      tolerate side effects. The duration of participation in the study will be 12 weeks. The study
      will consist of 6 visits: baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12. Week 4 and Week 8 will be
      telephone visits. Overall safety and efficacy of Oxybutinin ER will be assessed as well as
      safety and efficacy during the titration and maintenance phases. The efficacy of treatment
      will be assessed using urodynamic parameters (the force and flow of urine) and clinical
      parameters (voiding diary and catheterization [use or insertion of a tubular device to drain
      the bladder] schedules). The quality of life will also be monitored in the study.

    <measure>Maximal Detrusor Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal detrusor pressure represents the maximum pressure (peak amplitude) in the bladder during the first involuntary contraction of the bladder muscle. Detrusor pressure is the component of intravesical (in the bladder) pressure that is created by forces in the bladder wall (passive and active). It was estimated by subtracting abdominal pressure from intravesical pressure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Cystometric Capacity (MCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>MCC represents the maximum volume of urine the bladder holds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Detrusor Leakpoint Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Detrusor leakpoint pressure is the level of pressure at which leakage of urine through the urethra occurs as the bladder fills without an increase in abdominal pressure. This was a measure of both strength of the urethral sphincters and compliance of the detrusor muscle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Void Residual Urine Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Post-void residual urine volume is the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after void completion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reflex Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Reflex volume is the infused volume that induces the first detrusor contraction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urge Incontinence Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Urge incontinence episodes were reported. Urge urinary incontinence is the complaint of involuntary leakage accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency with sudden feeling to go to toilet.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Incontinence Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Episodes of total urinary incontinence were reported. Urinary incontinence is the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With no Episodes of Urge-Urinary Incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with no episodes of urge urinary incontinence was reported. Urge urinary incontinence is the complaint of involuntary leakage accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>King Health Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>King Health Questionnaire assesses the physical and psycho-social aspects of the disease state. It is a self-administered questionnaire containing 21 questions scored in 9 domains (general health perception, incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep or energy, and severity of urinary symptoms). All domains were assessed in a range: 0-100, where 0=best outcome/response and 100=worst outcome or response. Lower scores indicates better outcome or response.</description>

        <title>King Health Questionnaire Score</title>
        <description>King Health Questionnaire assesses the physical and psycho-social aspects of the disease state. It is a self-administered questionnaire containing 21 questions scored in 9 domains (general health perception, incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep or energy, and severity of urinary symptoms). All domains were assessed in a range: 0-100, where 0=best outcome/response and 100=worst outcome or response. Lower scores indicates better outcome or response.</description>

Dose was decreased by 5 mg if there were intolerable side effects. The participants then continued the maintenance dose to 12-week treatment.</description>
