  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bovine colostrum is the initial milk secreted by cows during the first day after calving.
      Colostrum is high in protein and contains a number of substances that have potential to be
      beneficial for the immune system. Preliminary studies about effects of colostrum
      supplementation show its potential for increasing human exercise performance; however, more
      evidence across the lifespan is required to confirm effects and to understand mechanisms of
      action. The objectives are to determine the effect of 8 weeks of bovine colostrum
      supplementation, compared to whey protein supplementation on the following dependent
      variables in men and women 50 years and older while participating in a resistance-training
      program:

        -  muscle mass

        -  strength

        -  blood levels of growth factors and markers of inflammation

        -  urine levels of muscle and bone catabolic markers

        -  tests of cognitive ability It is hypothesized that bovine colostrum supplementation will
           result in greater increases in muscle mass, strength, blood IGF-1 levels (an anabolic
           hormone), and cognitive ability, and greater reductions in inflammation, and markers of
           muscle and bone catabolism, compared to placebo.
