  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses clinical and imaging long-term data, after early or delayed
      interferon-beta-1b treatment in patients with a first demyelinating event suggestive of
      multiple sclerosis (MS), 11 years after enrollment in the Betaferon/Betaseron in Newly
      Emerging Multiple Sclerosis for Initial Treatment (BENEFIT) study (304747). The main
      objectives are to describe the disease course, change in disability, cognitive function,
      resource use and employment status, in relation to Interferon beta-1b in the long term.

      As optic coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are
      essential to standardize the procedures and assessments for all OCT and MRI test centers that
      may take part in this study, 122 additional volunteers will be enrolled to test the dummy
      scans of OCT and MRI, only.

    <measure>Time to First Relapse by Kaplan-Meier Estimates</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Year 11 (Day 3960)</time_frame>
    <description>Relapses are key features of the clinical presentation of multiple sclerosis. Relapses were assessed retrospectively based on clinical records and subject history. Time to first relapse is the difference from date of first relapse to the date of the BENEFIT baseline visit +1 or time to first relapse is the difference from date of last clinical visit to the date of the BENEFIT baseline visit + 1 (right censored).</description>

    <measure>Time to Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) Represented by Kaplan-Meier Estimates</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Year 11 (Day 3960)</time_frame>
    <description>CDMS could be reached due to a qualifying relapse or sustained progression of 1.5 points on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) as compared to the lowest EDSS obtained during screening or Day 1 and a total EDSS of &gt;=2.5. The validity of CDMS diagnoses was confirmed by a central committee. The EDSS scale quantifies disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) in 8 functional systems, values vary between 0=&quot;normal neurological examination&quot; and 10=&quot;death due to MS&quot; measured in half-points on an ordinal scale. Time to CDMS = the difference from date of CDMS to the date of Day 1 + 1 or time to CDMS = the difference from date of last clinical visit to the Day 1+1 (right censored).</description>

    <measure>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at Year 11</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 11</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS scale is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis in eight functional systems and values vary between 0=&quot;normal neurological examination&quot; and 10=&quot;death due to MS&quot; measured in half-points on a scale. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability. The range of main categories include (0) = normal neurologic exam; to (5) = ambulatory without aid or rest for 200 meters; disability severe enough to impair full daily activities; to (10) = death due to MS.</description>

    <description>The MSFC score consists of three subtests (Timed 25 Foot Walk, 9 Hole Peg Test, 3&quot; Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test [PASAT]) whose Z-standardized results (based on baseline values on Day 1 in Study 304747) were combined into a composite score including upper and lower extremities function, and cognitive function. Standardized results (Z-scores) of the subtests and the overall MSFC Z-score as an average of the three Z-scores were derived using baseline data pooled over both treatment arms as reference population. Higher Z-scores reflect a better neurological status.</description>

    <description>The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a cognitive test for sustained attention, concentration, and information-processing speed, with a high sensitivity. Nine different geometrical symbols have one corresponding number each. One-hundred-ten symbols are presented without these numbers; the subject must find the matching number from the top line and verbalize the number to the examiner. The subject is allowed to proceed for 90 seconds, and the number of correct responses in 90 seconds is counted as the total correct score. Also, the numbers of correct responses at 30 and 60 seconds were recorded in this study. Total score ranged from 0 (worst outcome) to best (outcome).</description>

    <measure>Relapse-Based Efficacy domain: Hazard Ratio for Recurrent Relapses</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 11</time_frame>
    <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or the reappearance of a neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The time to the onset of recurrent relapses was determined for each subject according to the counting process representation for recurrent events. Time to a relapse was right censored if a relapse risk period ended without relapse. Based on the Andersen Gill model the hazard ratio for recurrent relapses was estimated with actual treatment in BENEFIT (304747; i.e. IFNB-1b 250 microgram vs. placebo), steroid use during first event (yes vs. no), onset of disease (multifocal vs. monofocal) and number of T2 lesions on BENEFIT screening MRI (categorized as 2-4, 5-8, &gt;=9) included in the model.</description>
