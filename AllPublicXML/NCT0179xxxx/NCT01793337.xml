  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate measurement of core body temperature at the scene of an accident is critical for
      both diagnosis and treatment/triage decisions for hypothermic patients. Measurement in the
      lower third of the oesophagus is considered the gold standard of CT reading, but invasive and
      hardly applicable with a conscious patient. Tympanic membrane sensors for CT reading have
      been widely tested by may be unreliable in extreme environmental temperatures. Similarly, the
      Double Sensor device is a non-invasive device and is promising for prehospital use but has
      not been sufficiently verified under very cold and hot environmental conditions. Furthermore,
      comparisons of different non-invasive methods with oesophageal measurement in extreme
      conditions are lacking. The objective of these studies is to compare different techniques of
      core body temperature measurement with exposure to cold and hot environments.
