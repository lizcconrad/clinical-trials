      The Pain Outcomes comparing Yoga versus Structured Exercise (POYSE) Trial is a 2-arm parallel
      group, randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a yoga-based intervention
      (YOGA) with that of a structured exercise program (SEP) for subjects with fibromyalgia. The
      study aims are: 1) to compare the interventions' (YOGA vs. SEP) effects on overall
      fibromyalgia severity at 1 month (early response), 3 months (immediate post-intervention) and
      at 6 and 9 months (sustained effects); 2) to compare the interventions effects on specific
      fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, sleep, and fatigue), functional impairment, and related outcomes
      (quality of life, psychological symptoms); and 3) to compare the cost-effectiveness of the
      interventions.

      This study sample will include 306 Veterans with fibromyalgia. Patients will be randomized to
      one of two treatment arms. The YOGA arm will involve a standardized 12-week, yoga-based
      intervention. The yoga intervention will consist of three treatment components: 1) in-person
      group yoga taught by a certified yoga therapist; 2) a relaxation audio recording for
      home-use; and 3) a DVD recording to reinforce concepts taught during in-person yoga sessions.
      Patients randomized to the structured exercise program (SEP) arm will participate in a
      12-week exercise program delivered in a group/class format and supervised by a fitness
      instructor. In addition, SEP patients will receive a DVD (for home use) describing the
      benefits of aerobic exercise for fibromyalgia, a one-on-one consultation session with the
      fitness instructor, an individualized exercise prescription, and supervised exercise sessions
      for 12 weeks.

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>is an 11-item, multidimensional pain measurement tool with demonstrated reliability in patients with arthritis as well as other pain conditions. The BPI rates the intensity of pain as well as the interference of pain with mood, physical activity, work, social activity, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PHQ-9 for depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>will be used to assess depression severity. Several studies have validated the PHQ-9 as a diagnostic measure with excellent psychometric properties. Internal consistency has consistently been shown to be high (Cronbach's alpha &gt; 0.80) and test-retest assessment showed the PHQ-9 to be a responsive and reliable measure of depression treatment outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain beliefs and self-efficacy (Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Centrality Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>a 13-item scale that assesses catastrophizing-a pain belief that has been found to be strong predictor of poor treatment response. Validation studies examining the PCS have found strong evidence of criterion-related, concurrent, and discriminant validity.</description>

    <description>A 12-week yoga intervention modified for Veterans with fibromyalgia. Each weekly session will last approximately 75 minutes. The standardized sequence of yoga poses will be introduced to participants and the instructor will tailor them to the participant's needs and abilities. Deep breathing exercises will be taught and emphasized throughout every session. Participants will be encouraged to exercise according to their limits, rather than rigid adherence to posture techniques. The yoga intervention will be tailored to the individual. It will include low intensity, low impact modified poses adapted with pathophysiologic changes of fibromyalgia in mind. Participants will also be given a Playaway(c) device with guided relaxation exercise recorded on it and asked to listen to it three times a week to reinforce the in person yoga session content.</description>

    <description>A 12-week group exercise session consisting of a graded aerobic exercise program. The program will start at low intensity with gradual increases in exercise intensity and duration. Each weekly session will last 75 minutes. The fitness instructor will teach participants to use a table-top ergometer at a sub-maximal level, determine baseline fitness, and develop an individualized exercise prescription. The fitness instructor will provide educational tips on exercise and selection of physical activities. Participants will be given a pedometer and heart rate monitor to track their exercise at home. They will also be given an exercise DVD to use at home.</description>
