  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to establish whether Kinesio Tape (KT) on the ankle (Kase
      protocol for the lateral ankle ligament) improves Joint Position Sense (JPS) in healthy
      volunteers immediately after its application and 48 hours later.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators assessed Joint Position Sense (JPS) through the difference of error (DoE)
      and the deviation of the target angle (DTA). JPS was assessed before the Kinesio Tape (KT)
      was placed, immediately after and 48 hours later.

    <measure>Joint position sense on the Difference of Error from the target angle</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in proprioception at 48h</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome, difference of error (DE) in degrees was calculated to show changes in error from the target angle over time. We compared error, before and immediately after intervention (DoE 1-2), before and 48 hours after intervention (DE 1-3) and immediately and 48 hours after intervention (DE 2-3).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Deviation of the target angle</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in proprioception at 48h</time_frame>
    <description>We also calculated the deviation from the target angle (DTA) in degrees, this secondary outcome to describe the direction of error when subjects tried to reproduce the requested position. Deviation was obtained encoding net error taking as correct position when the target and the estimated angle were equal, considering the precision of the electronic plate a valid range (0.4 degrees). Values above this range were classified as Overestimation and as Underestimation when values were below this range.</description>

    <description>The KT group received ankle KT on the lateral ligament in the non-dominant leg and a recommendation guide. The Kinesio tape procedure was carried out by the same certified athletic therapist to ensure consistency throughout the study.</description>

    <description>The KT used was Kinesiology Tape® of 5 cm and it was applied according to Kase protocol (Kase K). The first layer of tape consisted of a single strip placed over the anterior talofibular ligament from insertion to origin, with a 50% tension, except the two-centimetre proximal and distal ends, applied with no tension. The same procedure was repeated for the calcaneofibular ligament and posterior talofibular ligament</description>
