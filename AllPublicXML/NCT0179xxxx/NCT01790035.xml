    <time_frame>Up to 6 months following the last dose of LGG or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the proportion of patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine being treated with the probiotic LGG who develop CTCAE grade 2 or greater diarrhea to the proportion of patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine being treated with placebo who develop CTCAE grade 2 or greater diarrhea</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days following completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the safety and tolerability of LGG in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine
The DSMC will review the data as part of an interim analysis when the last patient has had 30 days of follow-up. The DSMC will ensure that at least 18 patients have had follow-up at 30 days (with expected 10% drop-out). Accrual to the randomized portion of the trial will occur only if there are no episodes of lactobacillus associated septicemia. Additionally, if two or more serious adverse events of a similar nature occur and a causal relationship to the investigational product cannot be excluded, accrual to the randomized portion will not occur.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diarrhea subscale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years after completion of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The average AUC of the FACIT-D diarrhea subscale scores will be compared between the two treatment groups using a two-sample t-test.
The FACIT-D will be completed at baseline, weekly during radiation treatment, for the two weeks following completion of radiation treatment, 12 months following the end of radiation treatment, and years 2-5 following the completion of radiation treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Need for antidiarrhea medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Need for use of an antidiarrheal medication (Loperamide) will be evaluated at a binary endpoint (Use or No Use). Comparison will be made using Fisher's exact test as previously described (Chitapanarux 2010)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grade 3 or greater diarrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months following the last dose of LGG or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>In patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine, compare the proportion of patients who develop diarrhea of grade 3 or greater (by CTCAE version 4.0) in those treated with the probiotic LGG to the proportion in those receiving placebo</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fecal calprotectin</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of a gastrointestinal, abdominal, or pelvic cancer for which the use
             of continuous definitive or adjuvant external-beam RT to the abdomen or pelvis to a
             minimum dose of 4500 cGy is planned.

          -  Scheduled to receive concurrent administration of fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (5-FU
             or capecitabine) during radiation therapy.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 6 months.

          -  Any history of inflammatory bowel disease.
