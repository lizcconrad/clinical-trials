  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is widely used in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD), however, some patients fail to respond to PPI therapy. Recent reporters suggest that
      depressive disorders, anxiety, sleep dysfunction were related with the symptomatic responses
      to a PPI treatments. Nevertheless, the predictive factors of response to PPI treatment still
      remain controversial. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy of
      PPI therapy, and to evaluate the predictors of the PPI response in patients with symptomatic
      GERD by using the questionnaire which consisted of GERD symptoms, GERD impact scale (GIS),
      Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Hospital anxiety and
      depression scale (HADS), and WHO quality of life scale abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF).

    <description>Responses of dyspeptic symptoms were classified into 4 sections, as follows: complete response (more than 80% of symptom resolution), satisfactory response (symptoms remained less than 50%), partial response (symptoms remained for more than 50%), and refractory response (unresponsive to the eradication therapy). Then, the symptom responses were classified into 2 groups: responder with complete or satisfactory subgroup, and non-responder with partial or refractory responder subgroup.</description>

        Even the patients complain GERD symptoms such as heartburn and acid regurgitation the final
        diagnosis could be erosive reflux disease(ERD), non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and even
        functional heartburn (FH).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult Subjects (From 16 to 85 years old)

          -  The participants with GERD symptoms were treated a PPI therapy.

          -  The participants completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of demographic
             data, GERD symptoms, GERD impact scale (GIS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS),
             Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS),
             and WHO quality of life scale abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of gastrointestinal surgery, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal
             motility disorder, peptic ulcer or gastroduodenal cancer and systemic disease
             requiring chronic medication (except for hypertension and diabetes mellitus) were
             excluded.

          -  Patients who took the PPI therapy less than 4 weeks were excluded.
