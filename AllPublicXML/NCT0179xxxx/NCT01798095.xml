      Determine if investigational products and reference standard produce similar responses.

  <detailed_description>

      Primary:

      To determine if the 2 investigational products (Aplisol formulated from the new Tuberculin
      PPD drug substance and the reference standard PPD-S2) produce qualitatively similar responses
      (positive or negative) in subjects who are uninfected with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) or other
      mycobacteria.

      Secondary:

        1. To determine if the 2 investigational products have equivalent specificity for detecting
           subjects currently or previously infected with Mtb;

        2. To assess the tolerability of the investigational products in terms of the local and
           systemic reactogenicity events.
