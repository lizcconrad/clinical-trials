  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study an investigational medical device that is designed
      to produce lung volume reduction in diseased areas of the lungs in patients with severe
      emphysema.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pulmonx Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (EBV) is an implantable bronchial valve intended to
      decrease volume in targeted regions of the lung. It is indicated for the treatment of
      patients with severe emphysema. The EBV are placed in the diseased region of the lung using
      bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy is a way to access the lungs using a small tube with a camera on
      the end. As the diseased region of the lung shrinks in size, healthier regions may expand and
      function more efficiently, resulting in improved breathing.

      The LIBERATE Study is a clinical trial with two groups. Participants are assigned at random
      to the 'Treatment' group or to the 'Control' group. The 'Treatment' group will receive the
      Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (EBV) in combination with optimal medical therapy. The 'Control'
      group will receive optimal medical therapy alone. For every three participants in the study,
      two will go into the 'Treatment' group and one will go into the 'Control' group.

      It is hypothesized that after placement of the EBV, lung function will be improved as
      compared to standard medical therapy alone.
