  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are: 1) To determine whether patients with acute coronary
      syndrome, the level of environmental exposure to particulate air pollutants in the week prior
      to admission, are related to concentrations of inflammatory molecules and oxidative stress.
      2) To investigate whether the level of environmental exposure is an independent prognostic
      factor in terms of overall and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction or unstable
      angina at 30 days, 6 and 12 months.
