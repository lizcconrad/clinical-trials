  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physicians know that their patients can react differently to the same medical treatment: for
      some of them, the drug will prove inefficient, whereas for others it might provoke
      side-effects, sometimes rather serious. Such differences in response to drug intake are due
      to several factors, of which molecular variations in specific genes, named &quot; ADME &quot;
      (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion). This project aims at investigating the
      evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the diversity of ADME genes in human populations.
      Because of their role at the interface between the organism and its chemical environment,
      ADME genes are likely targets of recent selective pressures linked to changes in the
      environments in which humans evolved, such as changes in dietary habits for instance.

      The aim of this project is to study the diversity of ADME genes and of their expression in
      five populations located along a latitudinal axis that extends from East Africa to Central
      Europe, passing through the Arabian Peninsula and the Mediterranean area, so as to take into
      account environmental factors that might have influenced the evolution of this diversity.
      This project is thus intended to evidence the evolutionary mechanisms that shaped genomic
      regions that are functionally important from the clinical and epidemiological point of view.
      Moreover, it will allow us to extend the knowledge of human molecular diversity and its
      evolution to a key-region of the peopling history of our species.
