      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind (within dose), placebo controlled,
      parallel-group, dose-range finding study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TF0023 spray
      versus placebo in functional improvement of patients with ischemic strokes under standard of
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind (within dose), placebo-controlled, parallel group study will be
      conducted in 2 parts to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TF0023 spray versus placebo in
      functional improvement in patients with ischemic strokes. Part A will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of TF0023 spray in a higher dose . Efficacy will be assessed by the change in
      modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score from baseline to Week 16. At Week 16, a blinded interim
      analysis will be performed to determine if TF0023 shows positive results with a higher
      proportion of patients in the TF0023 group showing a more favorable outcome compared with the
      placebo group. If the results are positive, then Part B will be initiated to further evaluate
      safety and efficacy of TF0023 spray as well as to determine the best dosing regimen for the
      signs and symptoms and functional improvement of patients with ischemic strokes.

      Part A In Part A , approximately 200 patients who are stable per the NIHSS will be screened
      as early as 3 days (72 hours) after the onset of stroke symptoms and approximately 75 will be
      randomized to active or placebo treatment in a 2:1 ratio (TF0023 [50 patients] and placebo
      [25 patients]).

      Each patient enrolled in Group A will receive study treatment in a double-blind manner for 16
      weeks starting between 3 and 60 days after the onset of stroke symptoms (Day 1 of the study).
      Qualified study personnel will instruct the patients and/or caregivers how to apply the study
      treatment accurately so that patients or caregivers will administer high dose of either
      TF0023 or placebo twice daily (approximately every 12 hours).

      Patients will return to the study site at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 for efficacy and safety
      assessments. After the Week 16 assessments have been performed, patients will receive active
      treatment in an open-label manner starting the next day through the end of the study (EOS) at
      Week 32. Patients will return to the study site at Week 24 and Week 32 (EOS) for efficacy and
      safety assessments. An Early Termination visit will occur if the patient is discontinued from
      the study prematurely. Patients will have a follow-up visit approximately 14 days after the
      Early Termination visit or the Week 32 (EOS) visit.

      An interim analysis will be performed using the data collected through the study up to and
      including the Week 16 visit. If the analysis of the mRS shows that treatment with TF0023 is
      positive compared with placebo (mRS score of 0 to 2 indicates functional independence), Part
      B will start to enroll patients. If the analysis shows that treatment with TF0023 is not
      positive compared with placebo (mRS score &gt;2), Part B will not enroll any patients.

      Part B In Part B, approximately 400 patients who are stable per the NIHSS will be screened as
      early as 3 days (72 hours) after the onset of stroke symptoms and approximately 150 will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Group B (middle dose of TF0023 or placebo twice daily) or Group
      C (low dose of TF0023 or placebo twice daily ). Patients will be further randomized in a 2:1
      ratio within each treatment group: Group B - TF0023 middle dose bid [50 patients] or placebo
      [25 patients]) and Group C (TF0023 low dose bid [50 patients] or placebo [25 patients]). The
      study design in Part B will be the same as used in Part A.

      Each patient enrolled in either Group B or Group C will receive study treatment in a double
      blind manner for 16 weeks starting between 3 and 60 days after the onset of stroke symptoms
      (Day 1 of the study).

      Patients will return to the study site at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 for efficacy and safety
      assessments. After the Week 16 assessments have been performed, patients will receive active
      treatment in an open-label manner starting the next day through the EOS at Week 32. That is,
      patients who were receiving active treatment during the double-blinded period will continue
      to receive active treatment, and patients who were receiving placebo will switch to active
      treatment for the remaining 16 weeks of the study. Patients will have a follow-up visit
      approximately 14 days after the Early Termination visit or the Week 32 (EOS) visit.

    <description>The mRS score measures the patient's functional level of activity and is dichotomized as a favorable outcome (score = 0 - 2) versus unfavorable (score â‰¥2). The mRS score ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death) as follows:
0 = No symptoms at all
= No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities
= Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance
= Moderate disability requiring some help, but able to walk unassisted
= Moderate severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance.
= Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent, and requiring constant nursing care and attention.

    <description>The NIHSS is a serial measure of neurologic deficit and is used to objectively rate the severity of ischemic strokes. The scale is composed of 11 items summarizing a specific ability with scores ranging from 0 to 4. Increasing scores indicate a more severe stroke and has been shown to correlate with the size of the infarction on CT and MRI evaluations.

    <time_frame>0, 16 and 32 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of TF0023 spray compared with placebo for functional improvement of patients with ischemic strokes measured by improvement of the The BI is an ordinal scale used to measure a patient's performance in 10 individual activities of daily living (ADL). Each item is scored in increments of 5 points (0, 5, 10, or 15) and the individual items are summed to produce a total score between 0 and 100, where 0 is inferior performance and 100 is optimal. The lowest possible score 0 indicates total dependence on others for ADL, and the highest possible score 100 indicates full independence in ADL. A higher score is associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence. A score of â‰¥95 is considered excellent.
The ADL assessed by the BI include:
Feeding
Bathing
Grooming

    <description>The Trail Making Test is a 2-part assessment (Part A and Part B) used to measure executive function in patients who have had experienced a stroke. Successful performance requires a variety of mental abilities including letter and number recognition, mental flexibility, visual scanning, and motor function. Part A requires the patient to connect numbers 1 - 25 in ascending order and Part B requires the patient to connect numbers and letters in an alternating and ascending fashion. Evaluate the effect of TF0023 spray compared with placebo for functional improvement of patients with ischemic strokes measured by shortening the time for performing the timed Trail-Making Tests (Parts A and B) from baseline to Week 16 and Week 32 for study Part A and study Part B.</description>

    <measure>Volume of new fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesions by DTI-MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>16 and 32 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used in diagnosing acute ischemic stroke and can also be used in detecting changes that occur after a stroke. The high resolution of MRI images provides excellent anatomic details and allows measurement of the volume of infarcts accurately and detection of intracranial hemorrhage. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, has important applications in the imaging of stroke patients. FLAIR sequences offer a sensitive method of detecting lesions in the acute, subacute, and chronic stroke situation. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of stroke patients allows volumetric estimations of cerebral infarctions and lesion volumes correlate with clinical outcomes.</description>

         11. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, lifestyle guidelines, treatment
             plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

         12. Must be willing to discontinue applying any topical preparations containing Vitamin A
             acids (including all-trans-retinoic acid [tretinoin], 13-cis-retinoic acid
