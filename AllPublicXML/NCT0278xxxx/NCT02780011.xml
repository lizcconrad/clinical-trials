    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I trial designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose,
      dose-limiting toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and activity of the combination of alsertib
      (MLN8237) and brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive
      lymphomas and solid malignancies. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive escalating or
      de-escalating doses of MLN8237 based on a 3 + 3 design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, open label phase I trial designed to evaluate the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics, and activity of
      brentuximab vedotin in combination with MLN8237 in patients with relapsed/refractory
      CD30-positive lymphomas and solid malignancies.

      Brentuximab vedotin at a fixed dose of 1.8 mg/kg will be administered on Day 1 every three
      weeks as a 30-minute outpatient intravenous infusion. MLN8237 will be orally administered in
      two divided doses from Days 1-7. The starting dose (level 0) of MLN8237 will be 60 mg daily
      given in two divided doses (30 mg qAM, 30 mg qPM).The dose of MLN8237 will be escalated in
      20-mg increments up to 100 mg daily and de-escalated in 20-mg decrements to 40 mg daily. The
      fixed dose of brentuximab vedotin on Day 1 and daily dose of MLN8237 on Day 1-7 will
      constitute one treatment cycle. If no DLTs are observed in the last study cohort, the cohort
      will be expanded to include a total of 12 patients. If a de-escalation dose is required
      because 2 or more patients experience DLTs, the next lower cohort will be studied. If 2 or
      more patients do not experience DLTs, this dose will be declared the MTD. This cohort will be
      expanded to include 12 patients in order to study the biological endpoints and clinical
      benefit of the combination. If at any point during the expansion cohort phase of the trial
      33% or more of the patients treated at the MTD/maximum administered dose experience a DLT,
      accrual of additional patients at this does level will cease and the next lowest dose may be
      explored.

    <ipd_description>Data and materials on human subjects will be shared with other eligible investigators through appropriate means in accordance with the NIH policy on Sharing Research Data (NIH Guide, February 26, 2003). Data will be also shared with the funding agency and regulatory agencies as required. Data will be shared with other investigators within the limits of HIPAA and other patient confidentiality requirements. This will generally require removal of all patient identifiers for all source documents and the use of arbitrarily assigned one-way identifiers. In some cases, requestors will be asked to sign a formal data sharing agreement that will provide for a commitment to use data only for research purposes and not to identify individuals, keep the data secure, and destroy or return data after analyses are complete. Prior approval will be obtained from collaborating investigators, research sponsors, and/or other stake-holders before sharing if proprietary information or products are involved.</ipd_description>
