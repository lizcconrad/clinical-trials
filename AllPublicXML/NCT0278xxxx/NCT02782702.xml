  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hailey Hailey and Darier disease are rare genetic dermatoses. Mutations of 2 genes (ATP2C1 or
      ATP2A2 respectively) are responsible for the diseases. These genes have a key role in calcium
      pump; their defect create abnormal link between keratinocytes' desmosomes and induce skin
      lesions. Clinically, patients present with inflammatory lesions located in the folds. Quality
      of life is impaired because of pain, pruritus and tendency to infections. Lesions are
      permanent but acute exacerbations occur in hot seasons because of increased sweating. Usual
      therapies are often not effective (local treatment, laser, phototherapy). Because sweating is
      a well established inducing or aggravating factor, botulism toxin could be an effective
      treatment for these diseases.

      Botulism toxin is already used in clinical practice and acts via a decreased sweet secretion.
      Improvement of skin lesions in Hailey-Hailey or Darier diseases has been previously reported
      in a few cases but there is no study properly evaluating the benefit of such treatment.

      The aim of the project is to study the improvement of quality of life for patients suffering
      from Hailey-Hailey or Darier diseases after a injections of botulism toxin in large skin
      folds. The principal objective is to estimate the distribution of the variation of quality of
      life at M1 vs. baseline.
