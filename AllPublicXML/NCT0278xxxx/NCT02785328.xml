  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep exerts a dual effect on learning: on the one hand, good sleep quality allows good
      daytime aptitudes leading to knowledge acquisition. On the other hand, sleep after learning
      is necessary for knowledge consolidation. A key role of sleep has clearly been demonstrated
      in memory consolidation in adults. Sleep leads to strengthen memory by promoting brain
      plasticity. Surprisingly, sleep influence on learning stabilization has scarcely been studied
      during childhood and in children affected by sleep disorders. Yet, sleep disorders concern
      almost 30% of children and are frequently related to a worsening in academic performances.
      Classical neuropsychological evaluations of these children, based on daytime learning, often
      fail to determine cognitive profiles explaining their academic difficulties. The
      investigators hypothesize that a lack of sleep-dependent consolidation could take an active
      part in these children's cognitive and academic difficulties. This proposal aims at
      characterizing interactions between sleep, learning and memory processes that have not been
      studied in children of elementary school age (6-12 years). The investigators will evaluate
      sleep-dependent memory consolidation processes in children with sleep disorders before and
      after treatment and healthy controls. Neuropsychological testing and academic performances
      will be also evaluated.. The comparison of performances obtained before and after medical
      treatment, will allow to understand whether normalisation of sleep quality permits the
      restoration of sleep-dependent memory consolidation.
