      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of electroacupuncture to dredge and
      regulate Dai Meridian combined with lifestyle modification are more effective than lifestyle
      modification only in the treatment of anovulation and hyperandrogenism due to polycystic
      ovary syndrome (PCOS) with abdominal obesity.Two thirds of participants will receive
      electroacupuncture and lifestyle modification in combination, while the other one third will
      receive lifestyle modification only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is one of most common clinical features of polycystic
      ovary syndrome, a widely and seriously influenced complex disorder related to reproduction
      and metabolism. Excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the abdominal organs often leads
      to insulin resistance, which will increase the harm of hyperandrogenism and exacerbate
      ovulation disorders and metabolic abnormalities.

      Weight loss, likely beneficial for both reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in this
      setting , has been generally recommended as a first-line therapy for obese women with PCOS
      and can be accomplished via lifestyle modification and electroacupuncture. What's more,
      stimulating acupoints of Dai Meridian can regulate menstrual cycles and treat infertility
      according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. However, how much benefits patients
      will additionally get from the Combined therapy is not clear now.

    <description>Disposable, single-use, sterilized stainless-steel needles (Yunlong, Beijing, China; length 40/100 mm, diameter 0.30 mm) are inserted into waist, bilaterally. All of the six points are located in the Dai Meridian route corresponding to the ovaries. Four needles, 0.25mm in diameter and 25mm in length, are also placed in distal acupuncture points which are located in the feet and lower arms to enhance local points' effects. Acupuncture needles of 0.3mm in diameter and 100mm in length are inserted into GB26(Daimai) with a depth of 25-65mm by an angle of 15Â°, following the path of Dai Meridian (towards medial and downside). The other needles are inserted vertically into the acupoints with a depth of 10-30mm, depending on the thickness of muscles. Electro-acupuncture is applied to both sides of GB26 and ST25(Tianshu): cathode is connected to GB26; anode to ST25. Needles are stimulated electrically with low frequency (2 Hz) for 20 min.</description>

    <description>The diet restricts patients to 1400 calories a day for 12 weeks.The exercise included 12 weeks of aerobic exercise in moderate level (60 to 70% of maximum heart rate), for 3 sessions a week, each session for 60 min. The exercises included: Warning up: 10 min, main phase (aerobic exercise): 40 min and cooling down: 10 min. Polar Pulse measuring device from China was used to control the intensity of the exercises.</description>
