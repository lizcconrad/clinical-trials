    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the potentiation of muscle relaxation caused by rocuronium by
      inhalational agent sevoflurane. Half the patients will be ventilated with oxygen ,nitrous
      oxide and sevoflurane during induction of anaesthesia and half will be ventilated only with
      oxygen and nitrous oxide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rocuronium is a non depolarizing muscle relaxant. Inhalational general anaesthetic agents
      like Sevoflurane have some muscle relaxation effect by depressing the spinal motor neurons.
      Inhalational anaesthetics also alter the tonic input received from descending modulatory
      systems from the brain. Deep anaesthesia with inhalational agents may cause some degree of
      neuromuscular blockade.
