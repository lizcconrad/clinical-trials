  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will quantify and examine the extent to which the quadriceps femoris muscle group
      atrophies following tibial plateau fractures and the length of time that atrophy affects
      function. The study will also look at the effects of tibial plateau fractures on the
      quadriceps muscle and the effect this atrophy has on functional outcome. Quadriceps atrophy
      will be measured both clinically and by using MRI scans taken pre-operatively, 3 months post
      operatively, and 1 year post-operatively. The injured leg and the non-injured leg will be
      scanned in order for the non-injured leg to serve as the control. In this way muscle volume
      can be estimated from the muscle thickness at specific locations in the thigh. The muscle
      strength of the quadriceps will also be assessed at the 3 month and 1 year visit by measuring
      isokinetic knee-extension torque, and functional assessment questionnaires will be completed
      at each study visit.
