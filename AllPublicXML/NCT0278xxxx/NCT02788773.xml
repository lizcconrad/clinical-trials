      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of giving durvalumab alone or in
      combination with tremelimumab on this type of cancer. In addition, this study will look at
      the side effects of durvalumab when given alone or in combination with tremelimumab.

      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Laboratory tests show that it
      works by allowing the immune system to detect cancer and stimulate the immune response. This
      may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has
      been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in nearly 2000 people and seems
      promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone.

      Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to
      durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. This may also help slow the growth of
      the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. Tremelimumab has been shown to shrink
      tumours in animals and has been studied in nearly 1500 people and seems promising but it is
      not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone when used with
      durvalumab

      Combinations of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied and when combined have
      been shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone. While the
      combination has been studied in 217 people, it is not clear if it can offer better results
      than standard treatment.

             informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those physically
             incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the study.
             Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the
             document signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be
             provided with a full explanation of the study before consent is requested.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)
             placed on patients being considered for this trial. The patient's city of residence
             may be required to verify their geographical proximity. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the tretment, adverse events, and follow-up.

          -  Patients must agree to return to their primary care facility for any adverse events
             which may occur through the course of the trial.

          -  In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days
             of patient randomization.
