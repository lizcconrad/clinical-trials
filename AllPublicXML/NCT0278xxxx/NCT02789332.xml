    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label phase II study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of PO→EC as neoadjuvant treatment of operable and locally advanced breast
      cancer in patients with HR deficiency. Patients will be randomized to receive

        -  paclitaxel 80 mg/m² iv weekly in combination with olaparib tablets 100 mg (4X25mg) twice
           daily for 12 weeks (65 patients) or

        -  paclitaxel 80 mg/m² iv weekly in combination with carboplatin AUC 2 iv weekly for 12
           weeks (37 patients) both followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin 90 mg/m² and
           cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² (EC) either every 3 or every 2 weeks followed by surgery.

      The control arm was chosen to allow direct comparison with one of the currently considered
      standard of care regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of olaparib in germline HRD score high with or without BRCA 1/2 mutation
      carriers with breast cancer is not well described

        -  The efficacy and safety of olaparib included in a standard of care regimen like
           paclitaxel weekly followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (Pw--&gt;EC) is unknown

        -  Carboplatin increased the pCR rate in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
           in two randomized phase II neoadjuvant studies when added to an anthracycline,
           cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel (GeparSixto, CALBG 40603). pCR rates were even higher in
           patients with germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutations (ypT0/is ypN0 65%) and with HRD score high
           (ypT0/is ypN0 63%).

        -  The TNT study showed a doubling in response rate for patients receiving carboplatin vs
           docetaxel in patients with germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutations.

        -  There is a high correlation between tumor and germline BRCA 1/2 mutations.

        -  Data from Geparsixto study showed that triple negative breast patients have an HR
           deficiency in about 70% (67% have a high HRD and 30% have a tBRCA mutation)

        -  About 5% of tBRCA patients have a low HRD score

        -  gBRCA2 patients are older when diagnosed and are more likely to have an HRpos tumor.

        -  The GeparOLA study aims to support the decision for a phase III study exploring the
           addition of olaparib to a Pw--&gt;EC schedule by providing an estimate on the pCR rate in
           the targeted population but also by providing estimate comparison to paclitaxel and
           carboplatin followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (PCb--&gt;EC) as carboplatin is
           more and more considered a standard option of care in HR deficient patients (tBRCA 1/2
           mutations and/or HRD score high).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent for all study specific procedures according to local
             regulatory requirements prior to beginning specific protocol procedures.

          2. Complete baseline documentation must be sent to GBG Forschungs GmbH.

          3. Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not
             allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively
             which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint.

          4. Centrally confirmed negative HER2-status. Centrally confirmed estrogen and
             progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 status detected on core biopsy. ER/PR positive is
             defined as ≥1% stained cells and HER2-positive is defined as IHC 3+ or in-situ
             hybridisation (ISH) ratio ≥2.0. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissue
             from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the Dept. of Pathology at the Charité,
             Berlin prior to randomization.

          5. Centrally confirmed tumor Homologous Recombinant Deficiency score (tBRCA
             positive/mutated and/or HRD high). Patients with known gBRCA and/or tBRCA status can
             be enrolled prior to the central test results available.

          6. Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of &gt; 2 cm or a sonographical size of
             &gt;1 cm in maximum diameter. If the tumor is not detectable with sonography mammography
             assessment can be considered. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions,
             preferably by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation
             can be used as measurable lesion.

          7. Patients must be in the following stages of disease:

               -  cT2 - cT4a-d or

               -  cT1c and cN+ or cT1c and pNSLN+ or

               -  cT1c and ER-neg and PR-neg or

               -  cT1c and Ki67&gt;20% In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the
                  largest lesion should be measured and at least one lesion has to meet the above
                  criteria

          8. Age &gt; 18 years.

          9. Karnofsky Performance status index ≥ 80%.

         10. Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or
             shortening fraction) within 3 months prior to randomization. Results must be above the
             normal limit of the institution.

         11. Laboratory requirements:

             Hematology

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥2.0 x 109 / L and

               -  Platelets ≥100 x 109 / L and

               -  Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL (≥ 6.2 mmol/L) Hepatic function

               -  Total bilirubin ≥1.5x UNL and

               -  ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) ≥1.5x UNL and

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≥2.5x UNL.

         12. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all
             women of childbearing potential.

         13. Complete staging work-up within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must
             have bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound (≥21 days, and in no case exceed 6 weeks
             prior to randomization) (Note MRI/ CT scan may be used as an alternative imaging
             technique). In case of high risk according to guidelines: chest X-ray (PA and lateral)
             or as an alternative breast MRI/CT, abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone
             scan in case of high risk for primary metastasis according to guidelines. In case of
             positive bone scan, bone X-ray or CT scan is mandatory. Other tests may be performed
             as clinically indicated.

         14. Male or female patients

         15. Patients must be available and compliant for central diagnostics, treatment and
             follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy within 5 years.

          2. Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer within 5 years.

          3. Pregnant or lactating patients. Patients of childbearing potential must implement
             adequate non-hormonal contraceptive measures (barrier methods, intrauterine
             contraceptive devices, sterilization) during study treatment.

          4. Inadequate general condition (not fit for anthracycline-taxane-targeted agents-based
             chemotherapy).

          5. Previous malignant disease without being disease-free for less than 5 years (except
             CIS of the cervix and non-melanomatous skin cancer).

          6. Known or suspected congestive heart failure (&gt;NYHA I) and / or coronary heart disease,
             angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication, previous history of myocardial
             infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, uncontrolled or poorly
             controlled arterial hypertension (i.e. BP &gt;140 / 90 mm Hg under treatment with two
             antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment,
             clinically significant valvular heart disease.

          7. History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including psychotic
             disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving of
             informed consent.

          8. Patients currently in an institution by order of jurisdictional or governmental
             grounds.
