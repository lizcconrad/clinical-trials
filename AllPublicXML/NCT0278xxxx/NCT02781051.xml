      The research project is a pilot study to assess the effects of a multi-component intervention
      in increasing physical activity among breast cancer survivors with depression. Individuals
      meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the 12-week intervention with a 6
      month follow up. Intervention components will include print-based education, self-monitoring,
      Active Living counseling, and facility access. Blood samples will be collected at baseline.
      Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample collection will also occur at 3 time points
      during the intervention (Weeks 7, 13, and 25). Changes in physical activity will be assessed
      using Fitbits to measure weekly minutes of moderate/vigorous activity.
