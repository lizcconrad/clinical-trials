  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress is defined by an excess of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species
      or ROS) in cells. ROS are essential to cell life (proliferation, differentiation), including
      kinase activity via inhibition of phosphatases. Very low levels of ROS are observed in
      quiescent cells, including hematopoietic stem cells. Conversely, an excess of ROS can induce
      DNA damage that may lead to the destruction of the cell.

      The level of ROS in cells is the result of production (mainly the NADPHoxydase and the
      mitochondrial respiratory chain) and their disposal via antioxidant enzymes. The hematology
      team of the university hospital of Tours (France) found that certain antioxidant enzymes are
      essential for the self-renewal of normal and leukemic cells such as glutathione peroxidase-3
      (Herault O et al, J Exp Med 2012, 209:895). Their expression is modified in hematological
      diseases (patent WO2012085188A1 / 2012-06-28 and FR1000267310 / 2014-11-27).

      Age potentially affects the level of expression of antioxidant genes, since it was
      established a decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity in women over 65 years (Sara E, J
      Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2008 63: 505). The study HEALTHOX will determine the impact of
      age on the oxidative metabolism of normal hematopoietic cells, and in particular the
      expression of antioxidant genes. It will provide a reference for analyzing disturbances of
      oxidative metabolism in blood diseases. The main objective is the comparison of peripheral
      blood and bone marrow cells depending from 3 groups of healthy volunteers: 18-39 years, 40-59
      years and 60-85 years. The level of ROS and the expression of genes encoding the major
      antioxidant enzymes involved in the regulation of oxidative stress will be studied. The
      secondary objectives are to create a cell bank (blood and marrow), a blood plasma bank and a
      cDNA library (blood and marrow) from healthy volunteers.
