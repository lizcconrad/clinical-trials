  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective studies indicate that patients with depression are at increased risk for
      cardiovascular disease. Depression is also associated with a number of hemodynamic features,
      which are known risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity such as increased heart rate,
      reduced heart rate variability and blood pressure alterations. These hemodynamic alterations
      may explain in part the increased cardiovascular risk associated with depression.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive
      behavior therapy (CBT) is effective in reducing hemodynamic cardiovascular risk factors.
      Hemodynamic assessments including heart rate, heart rate variability, continues blood
      pressure, blood pressure variability, baroreceptor sensitivity and peripheral vascular
      resistance will be conducted at baseline, after treatment and 2-month follow up. In addition,
      circadian hemodynamic variations such as 24-hour heart rate variability, nocturnal blood
      pressure dipping and immunological biomarkers will be assessed. One-hundred patients with
      Major Depression will be randomly assigned to either a CBT treatment condition (14 hour-long,
      weekly sessions) or a waitlist condition, to control for potential changes in hemodynamic
      parameters without any intervention and the impact of repeated-measurement.
