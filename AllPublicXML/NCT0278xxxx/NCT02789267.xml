  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undernutrition in cancerology is frequent because it's present for thirty to fifty percent of
      the patients at the time of the diagnosis. According to the recommendations of the French
      Speaking Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNEP) of November 2012, a five
      percent loss of weight compared to the previous weight increases the risk of toxicity of the
      chemotherapy and worsens the patient's quality of life.

      The treatment of the tumors of the head and the neck comes along very often with a loss of
      weight (17.4 % after one year of radiotherapy according to the study of Larsson et al.) which
      varies with the chosen treatment, and shows a major risk at the patients whose therapeutic
      sequence involves a radiotherapy. The irradiation of the upper aerodigestive tract is source
      of aftereffects and late complications: xerostomia, oedemas of mucous membranes.

      The xerostomia, connected to the damage of the salivary glands, is a frequent complaint of
      the patients. It reveals or even increases, a dysphagia. According to Woisard, six months
      after the end of treatments, forty percent of the patients suffer from a dysphagia.

      All these complications limit quantitatively and qualitatively the food intake. The
      adaptation of the texture of the food is necessary by fifty four percent at three months of
      the end of treatments according to Logemann et al., and a few patients remain dependent on an
      long term enteral nutrition.

      Beyond a change of the nutritional state, the feeding difficulties or even the absence of
      resumption of an oral feeding are responsible for a social isolation. The meal which lost its
      dimension of pleasure becomes a source of fear and obsession for the patient as well as for
      his relations, and this fact generates family tensions. The quality of life of the patient is
      heavily affected.

      Ravasco showed in his study that the impact on the nutritional state of a nutritional care by
      dietary advices was more important as the prescription of oral nutritional supplements but
      based on a short period (the dietary intervention covered only the duration of the
      radiotherapy). But what would happen after the end of treatments? The investigators emit the
      hypothesis that a post-therapeutic systematic and regular dietary support has a positive
      impact on the prevention of the undernutrition among the patients affected by a first cancer
      of the upper aerodigestive tract whom therapeutic sequence involves a radiotherapy.

      The investigators propose a prospective randomized, open and multicentric study. This study
      has to include 224 patients affected by a head and neck cancer which therapeutic sequence
      involves a more or less made sensitized radiotherapy. The beginning of the inclusions is
      planned for May 2016, the end of inclusion 36 months later.

      The nutritional state and quality of life will be evaluated 6 months after radiotherapy.
