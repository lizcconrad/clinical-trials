  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to cataract surgery the lens must be calculated to appropriately fit a patient for the
      intraocular lens implant. Lenstar is an optical biometer that calculates the axial length,
      keratometry, lens thickness, pupillometry, and anterior chamber depth. Dilation drops are
      routinely used in eye exams in addition to pre-cataract surgery. The dilation drops include
      Tropicamide 1%, and Phenylephrine 2.5%. The Tropicamide achieves the dilation of the pupil
      which causes an anterior rotation of the ciliary body, which may affect the Lenstar
      measurements. This study is to determine if dilating medications affect the lens power
      prediction for emmetropia by the Lenstar biometer. Prior to dilation, Lenstar biometry will
      be performed on each eye. Patients will receive dilation medication and after waiting 20
      minutes Lenstar biometry will be performed on each eye. Dilation and measurement with Lenstar
      will be done as standard of care. Measurements and calculations from before and after will be
      compared.

    <description>uses optical principles (laser interferometry) to measure axial length, measuring distance from the corneal apex to the retinal RPE. In addition to axial length, it also measures corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, radii of curvature of flat and steep meridian, axis of flat meridian, white to white distance, and pupil diameter.</description>
