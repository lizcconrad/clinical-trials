  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of surgical procedures for resection of cancer stomach is to resection of the tumor
      mass with safety margin and its drainage lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy).

      There are two main types of techniques (open &amp; laparoscopic) Many studies were done comparing
      these two techniques showed that Laparoscopic resection is superior in early postoperative
      recovery (less pain ,less bleeding and shorter hospital stay) but less radical than open
      resection (less safety margin &amp; less lymphadenectomy) but because of the ongoing advances on
      laparoscopic surgery these results needs more and more revision.

      So the investigators conduct this randomized controlled trial aiming at comparing open and
      laparoscopic resection of cancer stomach to choose the best surgical procedure for resection
      of cancer stomach.

      The surgical procedure for resection of cancer stomach aiming at resection of the tumor mass
      with safety margin and its drainage lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy).

      # Tumor resection;

      Will be done by one of the following techniques:

        1. laparoscopic gastrectomy (totally laparoscopic, laparoscopy-assisted, and hand-assisted)
           types of gastrectomy (according to site of tumour)

        2. Open gastrectomy (according to the site of tumor). # Lymphadenectomy; Will be done
           according to Japanese Gastric Cancer Association guidelines for optimal lymph node
           dissection levels for Early Gastric Cancer (1):

             -  D1+alpha -(perigastric lymph node dissection) for mucosal cancer, for which EMR is
                not indicated and for histologically differentiated submucosal cancer of &lt; 1.5 cm
                in diameter;

             -  D1+ beta for preoperatively diagnosed submucosal cancer without lymph node
                metastasis (N0), for which D1+ alpha is not indicated, and for early cancer &lt; 2.0
                cm in diameter with only perigastric lymph node metastasis (N1);

             -  D2 for early cancer &gt; 2.0 cm in diameter. Follow up: all patients will be followed
                up clinically for the outcomes for each surgical technique.
