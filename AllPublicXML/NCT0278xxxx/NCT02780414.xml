  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia (Pre-E) is a hypertensive disease of pregnancy with multi-system involvement
      that usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy. Pre-E occurs in 5% to 7% of U.S.
      pregnancies, and is the third-leading cause of U.S. maternal death. Improvements to the
      current diagnostic paradigm have been evaluated. However, no stand-alone diagnostic method
      has emerged that more accurately identifies women at risk for preeclampsia, warranting
      improvements in diagnosing Pre-E.

      This sample collection study will obtain serum and urine samples from pregnant women who
      present with clinical signs, symptoms, or conditions contributing to the suspicion of Pre-E.
      Samples will be used to evaluate and validate the performance of an assay intended to aid in
      assessing the risk of Pre-E.

      Eligible subjects will provide written informed consent after which demographic and baseline
      clinical data will be recorded.

      Collection of whole blood and urine samples will be performed at one or more clinic visits
      from pregnant women carrying a single fetus with no known fetal abnormalities.

      Interim study visits will continue every 14 days [+/- 3 days] until the subject either: 1)
      reaches 37 0/7 weeks' gestation, 2) develops Pre-E, 3) delivers, or 4) is lost to follow-up.

      In addition, a group of pregnant women diagnosed with Pre-E will be enrolled as positive
      control cases.
