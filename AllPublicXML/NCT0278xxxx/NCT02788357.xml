  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal evaluates the safety and effectiveness of a noradrenergic drug named
      atomoxetine combined with motor training to enhance cortical plasticity and improve hand
      function after stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive studies in laboratory animals and humans over the last ten years indicate that some
      medications, especially amphetamine, given with specific physical therapy may improve motor
      learning (and therefore recovery from stroke) more than physical therapy alone. However, the
      number of patients in clinical trials who have received physical therapy and amphetamine is
      very small, for two reasons: because amphetamine may interact with many other medications
      that stroke patients are already taking, and because its potential for addiction precludes
      its use on a daily basis. The investigators now wish to evaluate the effectiveness of a more
      selective medication, atomoxetine, known to have many fewer side effects and no potential for
      drug addiction. The proposed mechanism by which amphetamine enhances recovery is by
      increasing central levels of norepinephrine. While the investigators already know that this
      drug is more selective than amphetamine, the investigators would like to evaluate its effects
      on hand motor learning and motor recovery in chronic stroke patients in a clinical setting.

    <measure>Change in Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Score at post-intervention minus baseline, score at 1-month follow-up minus baseline. Each task is scored as amount of time taken to complete a task, which may range from just over 0 to 120 seconds. If the subject is unable to complete the task within 120 seconds, a score of 121 seconds is given. The scores from the 15 individual tasks are averaged, then the log is taken, resulting in the overall score. Therefore, the larger the score, the longer required to perform the tasks. Negative changes in score indicate that a subject, on average, was able to complete the tasks faster at post-intervention or at 1-month follow-up than at baseline.</description>

        <description>Score at post-intervention minus baseline, score at 1-month follow-up minus baseline. Each task is scored as amount of time taken to complete a task, which may range from just over 0 to 120 seconds. If the subject is unable to complete the task within 120 seconds, a score of 121 seconds is given. The scores from the 15 individual tasks are averaged, then the log is taken, resulting in the overall score. Therefore, the larger the score, the longer required to perform the tasks. Negative changes in score indicate that a subject, on average, was able to complete the tasks faster at post-intervention or at 1-month follow-up than at baseline.</description>
