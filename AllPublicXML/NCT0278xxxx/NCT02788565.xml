    <textblock>
      Data from this study will contribute additional knowledge regarding patient outcomes and
      direct somatostatin analogue (SSA) treatment related costs in clinical practice in the Nordic
      countries. Such knowledge can be of importance in a treatment decision, decision support for
      development of care, follow up and training of both patients and primary care nurses.
