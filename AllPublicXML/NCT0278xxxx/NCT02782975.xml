    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the absolute bioavailability of a
      single, fixed sub-cutaneous (SC) dose of aducanumab compared with a single, weight-based
      intra-venous (IV) dose in healthy participants and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      profile of aducanumab. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of aducanumab administered via SC and IV routes in healthy participants and to characterize
      additional PK parameters of a single, fixed SC dose of aducanumab and a weight-based IV dose
      in healthy participants.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A minimum weight of 45 kg, inclusive, at Day -1.

             contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue contraception for
             24 weeks after study treatment dosing (Day 1).

          -  Must be in good health (as determined by the Investigator) based on the medical
             history and screening evaluations.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mini mental state examination (MMSE) score of &lt;27 at Screening.

          -  History of any clinically significant cardiac, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic,
             dermatologic, psychiatric, or renal disease, or other major disease, as determined by
             the Investigator.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions that in the opinion of the
             Investigator is likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study treatment.

          -  History of malignant disease, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
             (with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have
             been completely excised prior to study entry).

          -  History of, or positive test result at Screening for, human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV).

          -  Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb).

          -  Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis B virus (defined as positive for both,
             hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] AND hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]).

          -  Chronic, recurrent, or serious infection (e.g., pneumonia, septicemia) as determined
             by the Investigator, within 90 days prior to Day -1.
