      The goal of this clinical research study is to collect data about the long term safety and
      tolerability of ruxolitinib when given to patients with MF.

    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will continue to receive ruxolitinib as
      prescribed in Study 2007-0169. In addition, you will have study visits (described below) to
      help researchers collect data about any side effects you may be having and what effect, if
      any, ruxolitinib is having on you and/or the disease.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days. You will take ruxolitinib tablets by mouth with a cup of water
      (about 8 ounces) either 1 or 2 times each day. You will continue to receive ruxolitinib at
      the same dose and schedule that you were assigned in Study 2007-0169. The study staff will
      remind you to which schedule you have been assigned.

      You will also be given a study drug diary to write down when you take each dose of
      ruxolitinib and if you miss or vomit any doses. You should bring this diary with you to each
      clinic visit at MD Anderson.

      Study Visits:

      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may be having and about any new
      drugs (over-the-counter drugs, prescription drugs, and/or herbal/dietary supplements) that
      you take or are planning to take.

      Every 6 cycles (± 30 days):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires about your quality of life. They should take about 10
           minutes to complete.

      Every 3 cycles, you will be called by the study doctor or a member of the study staff and
      asked about any side effects that you may be having and to answer any questions that you
      might have about the study. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on) (+/- 14
      days), blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You may choose to have
      these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic closer to your home. The results of this
      testing will then be sent to the study doctor at MD Anderson. The study doctor will discuss
      this option with you.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking ruxolitinib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      As soon as possible after your last dose of study drug, if the doctor thinks it is needed:

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a complete physical exam.

        -  You will complete the 2 questionnaires about your quality of life.

      This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat MF. It is considered investigational to collect data about the long-term effects of
      ruxolitinib. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 14 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
