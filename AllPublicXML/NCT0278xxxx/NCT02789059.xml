  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed modifications of muscle oxygenation parameters in muscular
      dystrophies du to an impairment or an absence of dystrophin.

      Our study aim at assessing muscle oxygenation during effort in different neuromuscular
      diseases (muscular dystrophies related and not related to dystrophin, non dystrophic
      myopathies and motor neuron diseases) compared to a group of healthy controls. Patients and
      controls are invited to perform an inframaximal , standardized effort of the knee extensors
      by the mean of an isokinetic dynamometer. Muscle oxygenation parameters are assessed through
      a Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Device.

      In patients affected by dystrophin related myopathies, a muscle biopsy will be performed in
      order to analyse mitochondrial oxygenation parameters and mitochondrial phenotype.

      Our Hypothesis is that muscle oxygenation is impaired in dystrophin related muscular
      dystrophies compared to other neuromuscular diseases and healthy controls because of lack of
      muscle capillary vessels dilatation during effort and impairment of mitochondrial function.

      This study is a prospective physiological study in a pathological condition (neuromuscular
      diseases).

      5 groups of voluntary participants will be investigated:

      1. 20 subjects affected by Dystrophin related muscular dystrophy (Becker Muscular Dystrophy )
      2. Subjects affected by muscular dystrophy not related to dystrophin impairment : 20 subjects
      affected by facioscapulohumeral dystrophy and 20 subjects affected by Limb Girdle Muscular
      dystrophy 3. 20 subjects affected by non-dystrophic myopathies (Congenital myopathies ) 4. 20
      subjects affected by motor diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), Charcot Marie Tooth
      disease, Spinal Muscular Atrophy .

      5. 20 healthy controls Objective: asses the muscular oxygenation modifications during a
      standardized effort and compare the variables between groups. Analyze the mitochondrial
      function and phenotype in the BMD group compared to healthy controls Outcome : Muscle
      Oxygenation by Near Infrared Spectroscopy parameters; oxygen consumption, Muscle Function
      Measure, Vignos and Brooke score, Borg scale, 6 minutes walk test, mitochondrial phenotype,
      mitochondrial oxygenation 3 visits : 1- inclusion 2- standardized effort protocol 3- for
      Becker dystrophy patients and voluntary controls, muscle biopsy of the Vastus Lateralis
