  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that medical errors account for a large amount of patient harm within the
      hospital setting. This is a significant problem within the emergency context. A system that
      acts as a prompt, guide and scribe for the obstetric emergency has been developed called
      'Mednav'. Mednav is a navigation device for the management of medical emergencies; developed
      at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since 2010. This is a device which acts similar to a
      satellite navigation devices in the automobile industry navigating you from A to B, MedNav
      navigates the clinician from the unwell patient to the well patient.

      Potential participants will be identified by those attending mandatory training/teaching. 2
      weeks before their mandatory training they will be emailed with the study information leaflet
      and a link to a video which explains how to use Mednav. On the morning of the mandatory
      training/teaching they will be approached by the practice development midwife/Chief or
      Principle investigator who will give them a copy of the consent form and again the study
      information leaflet and show the Mednav video. Eligibility criteria will be checked and the
      study explained, before taking written informed consent.

      Participants will personally sign and date the consent form, before any study specific
      procedures are performed.

      Once the team is decided, the investigators will then randomise them to use of Mednav or no
      mednav, The participants will then undertake a simulated management of post partum
      haemorrhage which will be recorded for later review. Faculty will record the timing of
      completion of key technical skills.

      A team of 8 assessors will review these simulated scenario recordings. Assessors will
      complete validated questionnaires to assess teamwork. Assessors will be asked to complete a
      technical skills list, showing timing and completion of various technical aspects of managing
      post partum Haemorrhage.

      The end of the study will be when the required sample size has been recruited or significance
      found on interim data analysis.

    <description>A set of 11 key skills for managing a post partum haemorrhage. Massive obstetric haemorrhage call, Explore trauma, Palpate uterus, Examine placenta, IV Fluids started, Uterotonic started, Bloods taken and sent, Foley Cather inserted, Bimanual compression commenced, Blood transfusion commenced, Decision to move to theatre. Completion and time since emergency buzzer completion. This will be in the form of a table, which will include the skill and the time at which each skill is achieved. These timings will be recorded by the faculty of the simulation session.</description>

    <description>MedNav is a tablet based platform device that acts to help teams manage emergencies. In the way that satellite navigation devices have replaced maps on journeys mednav has replaced paper based checklist and guidelines to give teams real-time guidance as the emergency happens. In supports teams by deligating, prompting and scribing as the emergency unfolds. The intervention arm will be taught how to use this device over 30 minutes and then use it in a simulated scenario managing a post partum haemorrhage.</description>
