      This study is a multi-center, single-arm, open labeling clinical trial, which the objective
      is to evaluate the safety and Efficacy of donepezil in Alzheimer's disease( AD) patients in
      China, and investigate the relationship between Apo-E gene type with adverse events of
      donepezil.

    <description>Eligible patients is treated with Aricept® 10 mg/day for 20 weeks of study period. Aricept® should be taken at night, just prior to sleeping. If patient cannot endure 10mg/d，the patient can reduce to 5mg/d for 4 weeks and then increase back to 10mg/d. Patients who cannot endure the 10mg/d titration of 2nd time and then back to 5mg/d or discontinuance of Aricept® should be regarded as to quit the study. There will be a visting at week 0, the end of week 4 and the end of week 20 ,respectively.</description>
