  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a virtual reality-based treatment for phantom limb pain among
      Veterans and test it against the most established behavioral therapy for phantom limb pain,
      mirror therapy.

      The VA system performs more than 10% of all amputations in the U.S., a percentage translating
      into more than 50,000 upper and lower extremity amputations in the past decade. Among
      Veterans with amputations, research suggests that upwards of 70% experience phantom limb pain
      (PLP), an often chronic and debilitating condition with adverse effects on quality of life
      and poor responsiveness to conventional pain treatments. The use of virtual reality
      technology for chronic pain management is a novel and rapidly advancing area of study, with
      existing research suggesting that virtual reality treatments are effective for acute pain
      management, promising for chronic pain management, and as yet untested for PLP. In the
      current study, the investigators will develop a virtual reality environment that simulates
      mirror therapy - the gold standard behavioral treatment for PLP - comparing the efficacy of
      this modality in a population of Veterans with PLP against a standard mirror therapy
      treatment validated by this research team in a previously supported clinical trial.

    <description>Using a Virtual reality (VR) headset, motion sensors, and VR software, the investigators will create a customized VR treatment for each participant that engages them in movements and exercises involving their missing limb in a game-like environment. For example, participants may use the headset to engage in activities such as driving a race car around a course requiring both arms, ski down simulated slopes, or manipulate objects.</description>

    <description>Standard mirror therapy makes use of an external mirror, wherein an amputee carries out simple exercises (e.g., clenching &amp; relaxing their fist) with their intact limb while positioned by the mirror in a manner that gives the visual illusion of the missing limb also being engaged in the exercise.</description>
