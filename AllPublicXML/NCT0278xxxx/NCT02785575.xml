  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare a novel calculation model (HeProCalc AB) with a standard weight-based
      and activated clotting time adjusted calculation for the dosing of Heparin and protamine and
      assess the impact on postoperative bleeding and blood transfusions after cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), efficient anticoagulation is
      required in order to avoid microscopic clot formation or, in worst case, massive lift
      threatening thrombus formation. Heparin is by far the most common drug used to prevent blood
      from coagulating during CPB. Activated clotting time (ACT) is a point-of-care test of fibrin
      clotting time that has to be well prolonged to initiate safe CPB.

      Following weaning from CPB, heparin is reversed by protamine. Administration of excess doses
      of protamine may have a deleterious effect on coagulation and contribute to postoperative
      bleeding with need of blood transfusions. In connection with CPB management, heparin and
      protamin doses are commonly calculated using body weight and ACT. However, a new
      Heparin-Protamin-Calculation computer program (HeProCalc) has been developed to provide
      patient titrated dosing of both heparin and protamin. However, any benefits regarding
      postoperative bleeding and transfusions has not been thoroughly investigated.
