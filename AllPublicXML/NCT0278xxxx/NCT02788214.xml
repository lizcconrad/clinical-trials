  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori is a common bacterial infection. It can lead to severe stomach problems
      or stomach cancer. Researchers want to look at samples of the bacteria. These will be taken
      from chronically infected people. They want to identify the genetic differences in H. pylori
      strains. This could help predict which people who get infected with the bacteria will get
      cancer. This could lead to the cancer being detected earlier. It could also mean less people
      get stomach cancer.

      Objectives:

      To study genetic variations of H. pylori strains based on samples from chronically infected
      people. To identify the features of strains that might lead to severe stomach problems or
      stomach cancer.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 35 70 who need an upper endoscopy or who were recently diagnosed with stomach
      cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened by the doctor who does their procedure and a study nurse.

      Participants who have endoscopy will have 6 biopsies removed. These are tissue samples. They
      are about the size of a grain of rice. Participants will allow the study team to access
      reports from their stomach exam.

      Participants with stomach cancer will donate some of the tissue that will be removed during
      their clinical care. They will allow the study team to access reports of their surgery. They
      will also allow them to access the microscope slides of their stomach.

      Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium associated with a spectrum of benign and
      malignant gastric conditions, is one of the most genetically variable pathogens. Variations
      in a few genes have been associated with risk of inflammation and carcinogenesis, but to date
      no systematic study has evaluated the entire bacterial genome. We propose a multicountry
      study to establish and analyze an informative international collection of H. pylori clinical
      isolates from residents of defined geographic areas. Molecular characterization will be
      conducted at the NCI/FNLCR. Our hypothesis is that genetic and epigenetic variations in H.
      pylori strains among chronically infected individuals may affect risk of progression to
      gastric cancer. Findings from this study may help to characterize the differential virulence
      among H. pylori isolates and suggest predictive biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancer. The
      bacterial isolates and databases from this study will also provide a foundation for further
      elucidation of H. pylori pathogenesis.
