  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of left gastric artery
      embolization(bariatric arterial embolization) for morbid obesity. When the target vessel is
      blocked, some of the body's signals for feeling hungry will be suppressed and lead to weight
      loss.

      Although there are many ways to treat morbid obesity, surgery is currently the only effective
      method to be confirmed. But surgical treatment is likely to carry a high risk of
      treatment-related complications, such as fistula or intestinal obstruction, etc. This study
      is designed to help treat obesity using a method of transvascular interventional therapy,
      which is minimally invasive and non-surgical.
