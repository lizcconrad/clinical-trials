  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, half a million patients with a potential neck (c-spine) injury are transported to
      Ontario emergency departments (ED). Less than 1% of all these patients actually have a neck
      bone fracture. Even less (0.5%) have a spinal cord injury or nerve damage. These injuries
      usually occur at the time of initial trauma and not during transport to the ED. Currently,
      paramedics transport all trauma victims (with or without an injury) by ambulance using a
      backboard, collar, and head immobilizers. Trauma victims can stay immobilized for hours until
      an ED bed is made available or until x-rays are completed. Importantly, long immobilization
      is often unnecessary, it causes patient discomfort and pain, decreases community access to
      paramedics, contributes to ED crowding, and is very costly.

      The investigators developed the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) for alert and stable trauma
      patients. This decision rule helps ED physicians and triage nurses to safely and selectively
      remove immobilization, without x-rays and missed injury.

      The investigators will evaluate the possibility and benefits of allowing paramedics to use
      the CCR in the field in 12 new communities from across Ontario. Patients have suggested the
      investigators include measures of pain and discomfort from being immobilized during transport
      as important patient-centred outcomes. The investigators will also measure the impact on the
      ED, and how much money could be saved if more paramedics were allowed to use the CCR. The
      investigators will also assess if sex, age, language barriers, or living far from the
      hospital (long transport time) will affect the outcomes of the study.

      Paramedics in participating Ontario communities will all receive standardized training on the
      application of the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR). Once the training has been completed,
      paramedics will begin using the CCR to evaluate patients with potential c-spine injuries. For
      the first three months of the evaluation period, paramedics will use the CCR to evaluate
      eligible patients, but continue to use spinal immobilization for transport according to their
      existing protocols. After this validation period, participating services will be randomized
      in stepped wedge fashion in clusters of 4 services to actively use the CCR and selectively
      immobilize according to the CCR.
