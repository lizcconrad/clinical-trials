  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Manual therapy (MT) techniques applied over cervical region have over both local (neck) and
      distant regions (elbow) in both asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. Neurophysiological
      mechanisms are hypothesized to explain the underlying effects, with effects originating from
      peripheral mechanisms, spinal cord and supraspinal mechanisms.

      There is also an increasing interest in the study of the role of psychological variables in
      the treatment success in neck pain. Psychological variables, like anxiety catastrophizing or
      kinesiophobia are related to poor prognosis in the development of pain outcomes and
      disability in neck pain, being the Fear-Avoidance Model of pain one of the most tested models
      in this field.

    <description>The therapist cradled the subject´s head with the other hand. Gentle ipsilateral side flexion and contralateral rotation to the targeted side were introduced until slight tension was perceived in the tissues at the contact point. The High velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) manipulation was directed upward and medially in the direction of the subject´s contralateral eye. The therapist monitored for cavitation or 'popping sound' accompanying the manipulations. If an audible popping sound was not heard during the first manipulative attempt, the procedure was repeated in the second time.</description>

    <description>The upper limb of the right side of subjects was maintained in rest, with the arm along the trunk and the hand over the abdominal wall. The right hand of the treating therapist was positioned over scapula region, to depress the scapula while left hand cradled the occiput and neck above C5-C6 and left hand produced a passive lateral movement of the occipital and neck region.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cervical mobilisation</intervention_name>
    <description>The patients received a passive cervical mobilization that involved a grade III oscillatory unilateral posteroanterior mobilization to the right articular pillar of C5/C6 segment as described Maitland at a frequency of 2Hz. All the subjects were positioned in prone position as the protocol described by Sterling et al. for 3 sets of 2 minutes with 1 minute rest between sets.</description>
