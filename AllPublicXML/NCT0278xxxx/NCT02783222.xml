  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study evaluating the efficacy and impact on function of two different
      doses of nab-Paclitaxel in elderly patients with advanced breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized phase II trial evaluates in parallel two doses of nab-Paclitaxel
      (100 and 125mg/m2) given weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days, in elderly women aged 65 years or
      older, as first line treatment for advanced breast cancer (locally recurrent or metastatic).
      A short geriatric evaluation of co-morbidity and functional status will be performed before
      study entry. The functional status will be monitored at baseline and at every cycles during
      treatment.
