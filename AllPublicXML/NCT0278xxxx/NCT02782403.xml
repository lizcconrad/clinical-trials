      Objectives:

      Primary:

      Chronic Phase Cohort: To assess the rate of major cytogenetic response (MCyR) of an
      alternating schedule of axitinib and bosutinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia,
      chronic phase (CML-CP) after failure of/intolerance to &gt;/= 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      (TKIs) using standard response criteria.

      Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase I Portion: To determine the recommended phase II doses (RPTDs)
      of axitinib and bosutinib in combination in patients with CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP)
      or blast phase (CML-BP). (AP patients must have received &gt;1 prior TKI).

      Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase II Portion: To evaluate the rate of major hematologic response
      (MaHR) of combined treatment with axitinib and bosutinib in patients with CML-AP or CML-BP
      using standard response criteria. (AP patients must have received &gt;1 prior TKI).

      Accelerated Phase or Blast Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia:

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled into a dose
      level of axitinib and bosutinib based on the phase of CML that you have and when you join the
      study.

      Up to 8 combination dose levels of axitinib and bosutinib may be tested. Up to 6 participants
      will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest
      dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no
      intolerable side effects were seen. If intolerable side effects are seen, lower dose
      combinations of axitinib and bosutinib may also be tested. This will continue until the
      recommended dose of axitinib and bosutinib is found.

      After the recommended dose of axitinib and bosutinib is found, additional participants with
      AP or BP CML will be enrolled to receive the study drugs at that dose.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take bosutinib by mouth at about the same time each day with food. You will also
      take axitinib by mouth 2 times each day, about 12 hours apart, with or without food.

      You will also be given a study drug diary. You should write down each dose of study drug(s)
      that you take, when you take it, and if you miss or vomit any doses. If you miss or vomit a
      dose of axitinib and/or bosutinib, you should not make up the dose. You should take the next
      scheduled dose as planned. You should bring any leftover axitinib and/or bosutinib tablets
      and your study drug diary with you to the clinic at every visit.

      Study Visits:

      Every month (± 1 week) for the first 3 months, then every 3 months (±1 month) until the end
      of the first year, then every 6 months (±1 month) after that, you will have a physical exam
      and urine will be collected for routine tests. If the study doctor approves it, you can have
      some of these tests performed by your local doctor. However, you must be seen at MD Anderson
      at least every 6 months for the first year and every 12 months after that.

      Every week for the first 3 months, then every 2-4 weeks for the next 3 months, then every 3
      months (±1 month) until 2 years, then every 4-6 months (±1 month) after that, blood (about
      3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the study doctor approves it, you may have
      these weekly blood draws at a local lab closer to your home. The results from these routine
      tests will be sent to the study doctor.

      At the end of the first month (±1 week) and at the end of the third month (±2 weeks), then
      every 3 months (±1 month) until the end of the first year, then every 6 months (±1 month)
      until the end of the second year, and then at any time the doctor thinks it is needed, you
      will have a bone marrow aspiration performed to check the status of the disease. This sample
      will also be used for cytogenetic testing and may also be used to measure how the level of
      BCR-ABL in your bone marrow.

      Every 3 months (±1 month) while you are on study:

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn to measure the level of BCR-ABL in your blood
           and to check for any mutations in the BCR-ABL protein.

        -  You will have an EKG. You will stop having EKGs after the first year.

      At about 3 months after the start of your treatment and then at the end of 1 year of
      treatment, you will have an ECHO.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, if you are unable to follow study directions, or if the study
      drugs are no longer available. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 1 month (± 5 days) after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for mutations in BCR-ABL.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration performed for cytogenetic testing and to check
           the status of the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Axitinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of advanced kidney cancer. Bosutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of CML. It is considered investigational to use axitinib and bosutinib in
      combination to treat CML. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to
      work.

      Up to 52 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia:

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take bosutinib by mouth at about the same time each day with food. You will also
      take axitinib by mouth 2 times each day, about 12 hours apart, with or without food. You will
      switch which drug you are taking every 3 months. Some participants may start with axitinib
      and then switch to bosutinib. This means that for 3 months you will take either bosutinib or
      axitinib alone and at the end of 3 months, you will switch to the other drug for 3 months.
      This will continue every 3 months while you are on study. The study doctor will discuss with
      you which dosing schedule you will follow.

      You will also be given a study drug diary. You should write down each dose of study drug(s)
      that you take, when you take it, and if you miss or vomit any doses. If you miss or vomit a
      dose of axitinib and/or bosutinib, you should not make up the dose. You should take the next
      scheduled dose as planned. You should bring any leftover axitinib and/or bosutinib tablets
      and your study drug diary with you to the clinic at every visit.

      Study Visits:

      Every 3 months (± 1 month) for the first year and then every 6-12 months (±1 month) after
      that, you will have a physical exam and urine will be collected for routine tests. If the
      study doctor approves it, you may have some of these tests performed by your local doctor.
      However, you must be seen at MD Anderson at least every 6 months (±1 month) for the first
      year and every 12 months (±1 month) after that.

      Every 1-2 weeks for the first month, then every 4-6 weeks until 1 year from the start of
      therapy, then every 3 months (±1 month) until 2 years, then every 4-6 months (±1 month) after
      that, blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the study doctor
      approves it, you may have these weekly blood draws at a local lab closer to your home. The
      results from these routine tests will be sent to the study doctor.

      Every 3 months (± 1 month) for the first year, then every 4-6 months after that until 3 years
      from the start of therapy, and then at any time the doctor thinks it is needed after that,
      you will have a bone marrow aspiration performed to check the status of the disease. This
      sample will also be used for cytogenetic testing and may also be used to measure how the
      level of BCR-ABL in your bone marrow.

             or substitution is not in the best interests of the patient as determined by the
             investigator. In instances where use of these agents is felt to be required for
             optimal management, inclusion of such patients should be discussed with the PI and the
             rationale documented. These patients, if enrolled on study, may require dose
             modifications for both axitinib and bosutinib. The list of drugs that interact with
