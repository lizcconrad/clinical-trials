  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorders are severe chronic disorders, marked by recurrent episodes of depression
      and (hypo)mania. The disorder usually emerges in early adulthood and tends to have a highly
      unpredictable course. Prevention of these episodes is essential, as they are associated with
      marked impairment in social and occupational functioning. The investigators propose to
      conduct a randomized, multi-center, observer-blind, parallel group controlled trial with an
      78 week (18 month) intervention phase to test the hypothesis that continuous ambulatory
      real-time monitoring of early warning signs for new depressive or (hypo)manic episodes by
      smartphone based, innovative technology (e.g. GPS, acceleration sensor), including individual
      threshold- based early intervention for these early warning signs, will prolong time to a new
      mood episode and reduce hospitalizations (intervention group). In the control group
      ambulatory monitoring of early warning signs for emerging depressive or (hypo)manic episodes
      will occur in an identical manner, but the results will not be transmitted to the treating
      psychiatrist. All patients in this trial, irrespective of their group assignment, will
      receive guideline-based, state-of-the-art maintenance treatment.

      Symptomatic outpatients with bipolar disorders I/II , will be consecutively assessed for
      eligibility. After having signed informed consent patients will receive open,
      guideline-based, state-of-the-art treatment for their current symptomatology ((hypo)manic
      and/or depressed) for up to 16 weeks. As soon as patients meet stabilisation criteria (YMRS
      total score &lt; 12 and IDS total score &lt; 12) they will be equipped with a study smartphone, for
      exclusive use during the study period, to assess the parameters of interest (activity,
      communication pattern, sleep pattern) and define the individual symptoms' threshold during 4
      consecutive weeks of stabilisation . If patients fulfil randomization criteria (4 consecutive
      weeks with YMRS total score &lt; 12 and IDStotal score &lt; 12), they will enter the observer
      (rater) - blind, intervention phase, which will continue for 18 months (78 weeks). At
      randomization patients will be assigned to either the Smartphone-Based Ambulatory Assessment
      group, including real-time data capture and data-driven, individual symptoms'
      threshold-defined therapeutic interventions (SBAA+), in addition to state-of-the-art
      maintenance treatment or the Smartphone-Based Ambulatory Assessment group, only including
      real-time data capture (SBAA), in addition to state-of-the-art maintenance treatment.
