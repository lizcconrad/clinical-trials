  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone metastasis causes bone destruction and skeletal related events (SRE) including
      compression fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. Therefore, palliative
      treatments for pain control and local control have become important and multidisciplinary
      multimodality approach is needed for treatment of bone metastasis.

      The efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) for bone metastasis is well known. And the results that
      bisphosphonate decreases SRE in patients with solid tumor and multiple myeloma reported. In
      previous retrospective reports, the combination of local RT and systemic bisphosphonate was
      more effective than RT alone.

      Therefore, Investigators designed a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of RT in
      combination with zoledronic acid on pain relief and the safety of RT in bone metastasis
      patients with gastrointestinal tumors.
