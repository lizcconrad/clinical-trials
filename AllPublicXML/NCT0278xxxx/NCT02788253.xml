  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mallampati score (classification of the visibility of oropharyngeal structures) should be
      performed in the sitting position, head in the neutral position, mouth widely open, and
      tongue protrudes, without phonation. However, phonation, and position modify the visibility
      of oropharyngeal structures and thus the Mallampati score. Furthermore, some patients cannot
      be evaluated in sitting position because (emergency, fractures, pain, supine position require
      for medical or surgical pathology...).

      We aimed at evaluating the predictive value of the best observable Mallampati score as
      compare to the recommended Mallampati score.

      We aimed at evaluating the predictive value of the best observable Mallampati score as
      compare to the recommended Mallampati score.

      This is a single center prospective observational study comparing the Mallampati score in
      sitting position and supine position by 2 independent observers.

      The Mallampati score in sitting position is evaluated during anesthesia consultation.

      The Mallampati score in supine position is evaluated in the operating room before anesthesia
      procedure started.

      Data and variables concerning airway management during induction of general anesthesia are
      recorded on a specific record sheet.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with difficult tracheal intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Difficult tracheal intubation was defined as an orotracheal intubation requiring more than 2 laryngoscopies, or lasting more than 10 min, or requiring an alternate device (gum elastic bougie, supraglottic device, videolaryngoscope)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patient with difficult Face Mask Ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Difficult mask ventilation was defined as the inability for the anesthesiologist to provide adequate ventilation because of one or more of the following problems: inability for the unassisted anesthesiologists to maintain oxygen saturation &gt; 92% using 100% oxygen, excessive gas leak requiring use of the oxygen flush valve more than twice, excessive insufflation pressure (&gt; 25 cmH2O), absence of spirometric measures of exhaled gas flow or a tidal volume &lt; 3ml/kg, absence or inadequate exhaled carbon dioxide, necessity to perform two-handed mask ventilation</description>
