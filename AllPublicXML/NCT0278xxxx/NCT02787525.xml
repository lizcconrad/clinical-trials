  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare intermedium-term clinical outcomes, including
      thromboembolic events and bleeding complications between patients with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation treated with either oral anticoagulation or who had undergone LAA-closure (left
      atrial closure).

      A questionnaire is sent to the patients and if there is some information missing or unclear,
      the investigators will contact the patient or the treating physicians to get the
      missing/unclear information.

      The study population consists of 500 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who
      underwent LAAC between the years 2009 and 2014 in two centers (the Bern University hospital
      und Zurich University hospital) and a similar group of 500 patients with non-valvular AF
      treated with oral anticoagulation (OAC).

      In order to compare the two groups and reducing the bias due to confounding variables, a
      propensity score matching will be performed.

      Study hypothesis is that left atrial appendage closure is non-inferior in terms of efficacy
      and safety in comparison to lifelong oral anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia with an estimated prevalence
      of 1-2% in the general population, increasing with age. Patients with AF are at increased
      risk of thromboembolism, in particular ischemic stroke.

      LAAC seems at the actual knowledge to be a valid alternative to OAC. The objective of this
      study is to compare intermedium-term clinical outcomes, including thromboembolic events and
      bleeding complications between patients receiving Amplatzer devices vs. propensity score
      matched patients treated with OAC.

      A questionnaire is sent to the patients asking about thrombo-embolic events, stroke, death,
      any bleeding but also on their current medication, comorbidities (i.e. arterial hypertension,
      diabetes mellitus, renal impairment and liver disease), any hospitalizations and their
      quality of life. If there is some information missing or unclear, the investigators will
      contact the patient or the treating physicians to get the missing information.

      The study is an investigator-initiated, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected
      data. The study population consists of 500 patients with non-valvular AF who underwent LAAC
      between the years 2009 and 2014 in two centers (the Bern University hospital und Zurich
      University hospital) and a propensity score matched patients group of 500 patients with
      non-valvular AF treated with OAC.

      Covariates for matching will be age, gender, renal function, coronary artery disease and its
      status of revascularization, left-ventricular function, HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASc-Score.

      Study hypothesis is that left atrial appendage closure is non-inferior in terms of efficacy
      and safety in comparison to lifelong oral anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation.

    <description>A clinical sweep follow up will be performed in all patients of both groups and results will be analyzed. It will be in form of a standardized questionnaire and if necessary telephone interviews asking about thrombo-embolic events, stroke, death, any bleeding but also on their current medication, comorbidities (i.e. arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal impairment and liver disease), any hospitalizations and their quality of life. For all events, the source documents will be gathered from general physicians, cardiologists, hospitals or registry offices.
The questionnaire will be sent by mail to the patients. If information is missing or unclear, patients and if necessary their treating physician will be contacted by phone.</description>
