  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) provokes a systemic inflammatory response
      that can often lead to dysfunction of major organs. Activation of the contact system,
      endotoxemia, surgical trauma, and ischemic reperfusion injury are all possible triggers of
      inflammation. Previous studies demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important
      role during this process. However, very little is known about the susceptibility of the
      splanchnic organs to ischemic reperfusion injury. Although the incidence of intestinal
      complications reported to be low, the in-hospital mortality in these patients was high at 15%
      to 63%.

      Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist, can reduce the consumption of
      other sedative and antinociceptive drugs and provide sufficient sedative effects with minimal
      respiratory side effects. In addition, dexmedetomidine gradually has gained popularity in the
      field of critical care. Preemptive administration of dexmedetomidine has shown to be
      protective against inflammation, intestinal, renal, and myocardial injuries in animal and
      human studies. Dexmedetomidine is also used as an anesthetic adjuvant during surgery to offer
      good perioperative hemodynamic stability and an intraoperative anesthetic-sparing effect.
      Perioperative use of dexmedetomidine can reduce intestinal and hepatic injury after
      hepatectomy with inflow occlusion under general anesthesia. However, whether or not it can
      exert protective effects on the above-mentioned organs, especially intestine, after cardiac
      surgery remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine
      on intestinal, hepatic, and other organ injury in patients receiving cardiac surgery with
      CPB.

      In this double-blinded randomized controlled study, serum diamine oxidase activity, which is
      a sensitive and specific marker for the detection of intestinal injury, is taken as the
      primary endpoint. Other parameters reflecting the functions of liver (AST/ALT), lung (lung
      injury score and CC-16), kidney (BUN/Cre), and heart (CK-MB/Troponin T), the biomarker of
      endothelial injury (endocan) will also be determined. Besides, microcirculation parameters
      measured with Cytocam® and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) will be used to estimate the
      protective effect of dexmedetomidine on microcirculation. The variables will be collected
      perioperatively and will be followed up for 3 days after the surgery. Clinical outcome
      parameters will be followed up for 3 months after the surgery.
