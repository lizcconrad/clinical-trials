    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop new rating scales to help diagnose and measure the
      severity of blepharospasm. This is a condition involving a lot of blinking and spasms of eye
      closure that people can't control. This study will also test some video software to see if it
      can help diagnose people or tell the severity of disease using only a video recording of an
      exam. There is an additional plan to create an educational video to teach others the proper
      use of the scale and video software.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blepharospasm is a chronic disorder characterized by too many contractions in the muscles
      around the eye and nearby facial muscles, leading to involuntary eye closure. This study
      involves a comprehensive evaluation for patients with blepharospasm, other eye and face
      disorders, and people without any neurologic or eye or face disorders. It addresses abnormal
      movements of the muscles around the eye, pain in those muscles, psychological accompaniments,
      and impact on regular daily life. The evaluation for each participant will be done on a
      single visit, and it may take up to 1.5 hours to complete. Each participant in this study
      will be asked to do the following:

        -  Provide a copy of medical records and provide a medical history relating to the
           diagnosis of blepharospasm.

        -  Have an examination by a neurologist or ophthalmologist to reveal the features and
           extent of dystonia or other eye and face disorders. The examination will be video
           recorded so it can be reviewed later by different experts.

        -  Complete some questionnaires about quality of life and psychiatric well being

      The doctors will also complete various scales and questionnaires based on the participant's
      study visit.
