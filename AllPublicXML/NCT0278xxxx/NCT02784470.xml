      Selection of the optimal treatment for gastric outlet obstruction in patients with radically
      unresectable gastric cancer remains controversial because previous studies comparing the two
      procedures had a small sample size as well as they included various etiologies such as
      gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, duodenal cancer and pancreaticobiliary cancer in selecting the
      patient population. Therefore, to establish the standard of care for patients with radically
      unresectable gastric cancer with gastric outlet obstruction, a larger prospective,
      randomized, controlled clinical trial using a single type of stent is warranted.

             ring or duodenal bulb obstruction) caused by gastric cancer

          -  Patients who are not eligible for radical operation due to local progression of

          -  Patients with findings consistent with malignant gastric outlet obstruction on imaging
             studies including upper GI endoscopy, upper GIseries or abdominal computed tomography
             (CT)

          -  Patients who are eligible to undergo both gastroduodenal stent placement and
             gastrojejunostomy (eligibility will be determined by agreement by at least one
             gastroenterological surgeon and at least one radiologist)

          -  Patients who have been provided with an explanation of the procedures of the clinical

             malignant gastric outlet obstruction

          -  Patients with past history of palliative bypass surgery or gastrectomy

          -  Patients with peritoneal metastasis or multiple intestinal obstruction caused by other
             cause on imaging scan including abdominal CT or small bowel series

             surgery
