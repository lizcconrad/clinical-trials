  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular events remain the main cause of death of the industrialized world (Global
      status report on noncommunicable diseases 2010. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2011).
      Arterial hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, smoking, diabetes and family history represent
      the main cardiovascular risk factors. Arteriosclerosis leads to coronary heart disease,
      cerebrovascular insufficiency and peripheral vascular diseases that reflect in myocardial
      infarction and stroke.

      The main objective of this experiment is to investigate the differential effect of
      microgravity on central aortic blood pressure.

      The main criterion is the central aortic pressure (measured in mmHg). The hypothesis is that
      microgravity leads to an increased central aortic pressure.

    <description>Blood pressure will only be measured during the 0g (microgravity) phase. Seven 5 ml blood sample will be drawn in the aircraft: before the first parabola (1) and after each block of 5 parabola (6).
On ground after flight, a 9th 5 ml blood sample will be drawn and then the mobil-o-graph, the SOMNOtouch NIBP and the intravenous cannula will be removed.</description>
