      Prospective, multicenter, paired-eye, randomized, masked, clinical trial of the
      bacterially-derived Healon5 OVD versus the currently available Healon5 OVD control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include only subjects undergoing bilateral, primary, cataract extraction and
      intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and who meet all of the study inclusion and exclusion
      criteria in both eyes. Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and agree to
      participate will be randomly assigned to receive the investigational OVD in one eye and the
      currently-available (i.e., commercial) OVD in the fellow eye (control). Thus, a single group
      of subjects will provide data for both the investigational OVD and the control OVD.

             both eyes

          -  Potential for postoperative best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) of 20/40
             Snellen or better

          -  Clear intraocular media, other than cataract

          -  Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures

          -  Signed informed consent and HIPAA authorization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pupil abnormalities (non-reactive, fixed pupils, or abnormally shaped pupils)

          -  Recent ocular trauma or ocular surgery that is not resolved/stable or may affect
             visual outcomes or increase risk to the subject

          -  Prior corneal refractive (LASIK- laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis,
             LASEK-laser-assisted sub-epithelial keratectomy, RK- radial keratectomy, PRK-
             photorefractive keratectomy, etc.) or intraocular surgery

          -  Corneal abnormalities such as stromal, epithelial or endothelial dystrophies that are
             predicted to cause visual acuity losses to a level worse than 20/40 Snellen during the
             study

          -  Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g., macular degeneration or
             other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause visual acuity losses to a level
             worse than 20/40 Snellen during the study.

          -  Conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture, including capsular or
             zonular abnormalities that may lead to IOL decentration or tilt, such as
             pseudoexfoliation, trauma, or posterior capsule defects

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision

          -  Prior, current, or anticipated use during the course of the 3-month study of
             tamsulosin or silodosin (e.g., Flomax, Flomaxtra, Rapaflo) that may, in the opinion of
             the investigator, confound the outcome or increase the risk to the subject (e.g., poor
             dilation or a lack of adequate iris structure to perform standard cataract surgery)

          -  Poorly-controlled diabetes

          -  Acute, chronic, or uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease or illness that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would increase the operative risk or confound the
             outcome(s) of the study (e.g., immunocompromised, connective tissue disease, suspected
             glaucoma, glaucomatous changes in the fundus or visual field, ocular inflammation,
             etc.).

          -  Known steroid responder

          -  Ocular hypertension of ≥ 20 mmHg, medically-controlled ocular hypertension (regardless
             of IOP value ), or glaucomatous changes in the optic nerve

          -  Endothelial cell count (ECC) lower than 1800 cells/mm2 preoperatively (based on the
             lowest value of the three cell counts as taken by the Konan Specular Microscope)

          -  Known ocular disease or pathology that may affect visual acuity or that may be
             expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical intervention during the
             course of the study (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, diabetic
             retinopathy, etc.)

          -  Patient is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, is lactating or has another condition
             associated with the fluctuation of hormones that could lead to refractive changes

          -  Concurrent participation, or participation within 45 days prior to preoperative visit,
             in any other clinical trial
