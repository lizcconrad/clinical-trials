  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using a pressure- vs. simple adhesive
      dressing affects the postoperative course and wound healing outcomes following Mohs surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize patients undergoing Mohs surgery to receive either a
      pressure or a simple adhesive dressing following their procedure. The hypothesis is that
      patients with the simple adhesive dressings will be more satisfied and comfortable with their
      wound care on follow-up. These patients are also expected to cite greater convenience
      managing the simple dressing at home. Finally, the investigators anticipate no difference in
      the number of postoperative complications between the two groups and expect that there will
      be a lower cost associated with the simple adhesive dressing as compared to the pressure
      dressing.

    <description>Patients are asked to complete a survey regarding their satisfaction with their post-operative dressing. Surveys will be distributed at their first clinical follow-up visit. They are asked to rate their overall satisfaction and difficulty sleeping, bathing, and returning to normal activity following their Mohs procedure.</description>
