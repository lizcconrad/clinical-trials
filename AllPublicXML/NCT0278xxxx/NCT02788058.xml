      To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy
      for limited metastatic NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations after first line TKI
      therapy. An exploratory biomarker analysis in blood and tumor samples is also planned.

      Rational:

      After inductive TKI therapy in NSCLC with sensitizing EGFR mutations, the residual lesion
      might be the source of subsequent disease progression, defined as acquired resistance to TKI.
      Two reasons can be used to explain the formation of the residual lesion：1）there is a subgroup
      of cancer cells that are not sensitive to TKI therapy because of tumor heterogeneity, like de
      novo T790M mutation; 2)some cancer cells can keep static state during the beginning
      treatment, and then develops acquired resistance to TKI therapy under the long-term drug
      pressure and continue to re-proliferation. From this point of view, elimination of residual
      lesion provides the chance to reduce or slow the possibility of developing resistance to TKI.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy
      for limited metastatic NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations after first line TKI
      therapy. An exploratory biomarker analysis in blood and tumor samples is also planned.
