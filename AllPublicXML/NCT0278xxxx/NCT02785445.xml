      The objectives of the Healthy.io Method Comparison and User Performance Study are:

        1. To evaluate the performance of Dip.io Device in comparison to the ACON U500 Mission®
           U500 Urine Analyzer.

        2. To evaluate the user performance of Dip.io Device under actual use conditions (home
           environment) based on a user questionnaire and rating scale.

    <description>All study participants once enrolled into the study were asked to collect their midstream urine in the designated device urine cups. The urine sample was then tested sequentially; first by the Dip.io Home Based Dipstick Analyzer (first intervention) and by the ACON U500 Mission® U500 Urine Analyzer (comparative device - second intervention). Part of the participants (100 out of 302) were asked to perform the Dip.io urine test by themselves for the user performance evaluation.</description>
