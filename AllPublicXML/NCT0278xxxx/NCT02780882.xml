    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective open-label phase II study, is to evaluate the efficacy of
      pasireotide twice daily subcutaneous injections for normalizing 24 hour urine free cortisol
      in patients with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors as measured by the proportion of patients
      achieving normal UFC at the end of the study period.

             diaphragm) and the partner should use a condom. If oral contraception is used in
             addition to condoms, the patient must have been practicing this method for at least
             two months prior to screening and must agree to continue the oral contraceptive
             throughout the course of the study and for 3 months after the study has ended. Male
             patients who are sexually active are required to use condoms during the study and for
             three month afterwards as a precautionary measure (available data do not suggest any
             increased reproductive risk with the study drugs)

          -  Patients who have participated in any clinical investigation with an investigational
             drug within 1 month prior to screening or patients who have previously been treated

          -  Known hypersensitivity to somatostatin analogues

          -  Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
             potentially unreliable or will be unable to complete the entire study
