  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using novel decellularized
      tissue matrices to isolate and culture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) collected from patients
      with metastatic solid tumor malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently very few practical or reproducible model systems which recapitulate the
      metastatic process well. CTCs are important for the development of metastases and there is
      interest in isolating and culturing them ex vivo to better characterize their biology,
      metastatic potential, and response to different therapies. The investigators have previously
      demonstrated efficient capture and enumeration of CTCs in 4 unique patient cohorts
      (metastatic prostate and locally advanced rectal, cervical and head and neck cancers) in the
      investigators prospective clinical study, LCCC 1408 (Investigation of Circulating Tumor Cells
      from Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy). However, CTCs are difficult to culture
      with conventional methods. The investigators propose to culture CTCs using novel
      decellularized tissue matrices. Blood will be collected from cancer patients with metastatic
      solid tissue tumors prior to starting definitive or palliative radiotherapy. The
      investigators will then isolate CTCs and attempt to grow them on various decellularized
      matrices. If this study is successful and feasibility is demonstrated, important pilot
      information will also be gathered which will then be used in power and sample size
      considerations for future CTCs studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any metastatic solid tumor malignancy. Metastatic is defined as biopsy
             proven disease involving at least one organ other than the primary tumor organ.
             Regional lymph node metastases are not considered metastatic. Patients with newly
             diagnosed metastatic disease who have not had systemic therapy in at least six months
             or are progressing on systemic therapy will be eligible for enrollment.

          -  Scheduled to initiate radiation for management of their disease, and schedule
             accommodates blood sample collection prior to radiation

          -  Male and female of â‰¥18 years of age

          -  Male and female patients capable of reproduction must agree to use medically
             acceptable methods of contraception, such as an intra-uterine device, diaphragm, with
             spermicide, condom with spermicide or abstinence, during radiation therapy. Inclusion
             of females of childbearing potential requires a negative pregnancy test within 14 days
             prior to study initiation (part of standard of care in radiation oncology).

          -  Written informed consent obtained and signed

          -  Able to have blood collection without excessive difficulty

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient unwilling or unable to complete informed consent

          -  Physical or psychological inability to complete sample collection for any reason
             including but not limited to: inability to tolerate any study procedures, any physical
             limitation that would undermine the safety of the subject in the study, or any
             psychiatric or neurological condition that inhibits full comprehension of study
             requirements and inability to complete informed consent, as determined by treating
             physician

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating women
