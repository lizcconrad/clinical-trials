    <textblock>
      The objective of the PRELUDE study is to describe the use of lanreotide Autogel® (LAN ATG)
      combined with Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) in the treatment of progressive
      neuroendocrine tumours located in the lung or in the digestive system as there is currently
      limited data on these treatments used together for these types of neuroendocrine tumours.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathologically confirmed metastatic well differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumour
             (NET) (Grade G1 or G2 according to the World Health Organisation 2010 classification):
             Gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) or Bronchopulmonary (BP) primary tumour, or tumour of
             unknown origin believed to be of GEP origin, if a primary tumour elsewhere was
             excluded by multiphasic computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI)

          -  Disease progression radiologically documented with evaluable imaging (CT or MRI,
             digital or print-out), performed within 12 months and within 6 months prior to the
             first PRRT/LAN ATG cycle

          -  Metastatic- or locally-advanced, hormonal functioning or nonfunctioning GEP-NET or
             BP-NET;

          -  Confirmed presence of Somatostatin Receptors (SSTRs) on all target lesions based on
             positive SSTR scintigraphy (Octreoscan®/99mTC-tektrotyd) or 68Ga SSTR Positron
             Emission Tomography-Computerised Tomography (PET/CT) imaging, i.e. Grade ≥2
             respectively per the Krenning scale or per the modified Krenning scale

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absence of information regarding LAN ATG treatment: dose received, start date,
             frequency of injections

          -  No CT or MRI within 12 months and within 6 months preceding the baseline, or at the
             end of the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle

          -  Absence of information on cumulative activity of PRRT with 177 Lutetium (177Lu)
             DOTATOC or 177Lu-DOTATATE received (at least 500 mCi (equivalent to 18.5 GBq), for the
             entire therapy)

          -  PRRT prior to the first combination cycle of PRRT/LAN ATG
