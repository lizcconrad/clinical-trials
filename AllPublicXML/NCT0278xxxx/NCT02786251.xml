  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent discovery of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has led to a paradigm
      shift in adipose tissue biology; it is now believed that adipocytes may play a significant
      role in regulating substrate metabolism. Given that the resurgence in the interest in human
      BAT is still in its infancy, a number of fundamental questions pertaining to the role of BAT
      in human physiology remain unanswered. One area of particular importance, but poorly
      understood, is the potential effect of BAT on triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Data from a
      series of studies have found that BAT is inversely associated with adiposity, high blood
      lipids, and fatty liver in people. However, the role of BAT in the regulation of TG
      metabolism in people is not known. The overall goal of this study is to determine the
      physiological importance of the human BAT in TG metabolism. To this end, we are planning to
      study forty overweight/obese women with high amounts of BAT (BAT+, n=20) and with no/minimal
      BAT (BAT-, n=20) both under thermoneutrality and mild cold exposure (~2 weeks apart). The
      investigators hypothesize that BAT+ subjects will demonstrate greater plasma very low density
      lipoprotein-triglycerides (VLDL-TG) clearance rate during cold exposure compared to BAT-
      subjects and upregulation of genes and proteins involved in lipid metabolism only in BAT (but
      not muscle and white adipose tissue). Infusion of stable isotope tracers and metabolic
      modeling techniques will be used to assess VLDL-TG kinetics. Positron emission tomography
      computed tomography will be used for the identification and quantification of BAT.
      Supraclavicular BAT, abdominal white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle tissue biopsies
      during cold exposure and thermoneutral conditions in conjunction with molecular biology
      techniques will used to measure expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid
      metabolism.
