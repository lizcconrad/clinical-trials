    <textblock>
      This study is designed to analyze the frequency and incidence rate of pulmonary complications
      in JIA participants who received biological DMARDs and non-biologic DMARDs. The participants
      having evidence of of a prescription or administration of one of the biologic or non-biologic
      DMARDs will be included in five different treatment groups. Data from the Thomson Reuters
      MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Databases will be used to estimate
      the incidence rate of pulmonary complications.
