  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ear, nose, throat (ENT) and jaw surgery departments, up to 60% of patients suffer from
      alcohol dependence (Allen et al., 2009), and may develop an alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS)
      when undergoing sur-gery. Caring for these patients creates a major challenge for all persons
      involved: Health care staff is not only challenged by the primary illness but also by
      increased risk of life-threatening complications (infection, bleeding, cardiopulmonary
      dysfunction, impaired wound healing, re-operation), higher mortality rate, and longer
      duration of hospitalization due to preoperative alcohol use and the development of an AWS
      (Delgado-Rodriguez, Gomez-Ortega, Mariscal-Ortiz, Palma-Perez, &amp; Sillero-Arenas, 2003; Eyer
      et al., 2011; Foy, Kay, &amp; Taylor, 1997; Genther &amp; Gourin, 2012; Kuo et al., 2008; Mayo-Smith
      et al., 2004; McCusker, Cole, Abrahamowicz, Primeau, &amp; Belzile, 2002; Neyman, Gourin, &amp;
      Terris, 2005; O'Brien et al., 2007). Moreover, nearly five percent of all patients with an
      AWS develop an alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) which, without any therapy, will end
      lethally in 15% of all cases. With adequate medical and other interventions lethality is
      about two percent (Diener, 2003; Wright, Myrick, Henderson, Peters, &amp; Malcolm, 2006).
      Additionally, the occurrence of an AWS and / or AWD represents a threatening, time-intensive
      and complex situation for family members (Repper-DeLisi et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2012).

      Since 2011, in addition to patients undergoing short-term surgery, also patients with
      oncological diagnoses are hospitalized in the ENT and Jaw Surgery Department at the
      University Hospital Basel (USB). These patients are in need of prolonged surgical treatments
      and resulting longer periods of abstinence from food and drink, including alcohol and other
      substances, increase the risk of alcohol withdrawal. For instance, in the ENT and Jaw Surgery
      Department, in 2011, 74 out of 910 inpatients were at risk for or already experienced an AWD
      and 47 of them needed permanent supervision to guarantee their safety. Bridging the period of
      abstinence by drinking alcohol pre- and postoperatively is a suboptimal option for these
      patients due to the relatively long surgical treatment. This situation called for action:
      based on positive experiences within the dementia-delirium-programme of USB (Hasemann &amp;
      Pretto, 2006), an evidence-based approach to screen for, detect and treat AWS and / or AWD in
      ENT and jaw surgery patients was developed and implemented (Hasemann, 2013). Now, this new
      approach needs to be evaluated.

      The aims of the proposed study are to describe patient trajectories and to evaluate the
      processes and structures of the nurse-led approach in the ENT and Jaw Surgery Department at
      USB. The following research questions were generated:

      Aim 1): Who are the patients captured with the algorithm, what are their risk factors, and
      how are the patient trajectories in terms of decisions, development, start, duration and
      ending of AWS and / or AWD? Specific questions asked:

        -  Which are demographic and medical characteristics of patients?

        -  How many patients are at risk for AWD / AWS?

        -  Which decisions do patients make?

        -  What is the time of onset, duration and ending of AWS and / or AWD?

        -  Were additional resources used to guarantee safety of patients?

      Aim 2): How is the prevention algorithm adhered to? Specific questions asked:

        -  How many patients were risk-assessed by a nurse at hospital admission?

        -  How many patients or those who should have been asked were eventually asked to agree to
           substitution therapy?

        -  How many patients at risk were assessed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal
           Assessment (CIWA)-Ar?

        -  How many times was the delirium expert consultation service contacted due to reasons
           stated in algorithm?
