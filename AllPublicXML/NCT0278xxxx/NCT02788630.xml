  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to improve quality and duration of
      self-regulated nighttime sleep (the amount of time the child maintains a combination of
      uninterrupted sleep, quiet wakefulness, and re-initiation of sleep without parental
      intervention).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of adequate sleep patterns is paramount to the optimal neurodevelopment, as
      well as to promote proper learning, develop memory and preserve cerebral plasticity. Factors
      that hinder sleep patterns can negatively influence the child's growth, neurological and
      motor development.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial within the 2015 Pelotas Birth
      Cohort. At the 3-month follow-up, children who sleep less than 13 hours per 24 hours
      (nighttime sleep and daytime naps) will be eligible for the study. The sample size was
      estimated at 276 children per arm. Nighttime self-regulated sleep duration will be evaluated
      at baseline (age 3 months) and at 6, 12 and 24 months using actigraphy and via a sleep diary
      completed by the mother. Following block randomization, mothers from the intervention group
      will be visited by a trained fieldworker who will deliver counseling on age-appropriate
      normal sleep behaviors, how to facilitate sleep onset and how to manage night awakenings.

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nighttime self-regulated sleep duration is the maximum amount of time the child stays asleep or awake without awakening the parents at ages 6, 12 and 24 months. This outcome will be evaluated by using the actigraphy and diary records for 5 days. The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) will be used at these three visits.</description>

    <measure>Linear growth between age 3-12 and 12-24 months of age</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the intervention on linear growth will be estimated by comparing conditional growth between groups. At 3, 12 and 24 months of age anthropometric evaluation will include measures of length and weight. Length will be measured using a foldable wooden infantometer, custom made for the study, using for measurement a nylon tape measure with 1 mm precision adhered to a groove carved into the body of the instrument. Mother and child weight will be measured using an electronic scale (150 kg capacity and 100 g precision), the mother being weighed first alone then holding the baby. The child's weight will be calculated as the difference between the two measures. The mother will be weighed clothed, but without heavy outfits, and clothes worn by the mother will be recorded. The child will be weighed undressed, whenever allowed by the mother. Otherwise, the child's clothing will be recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The holistic neurodevelopment assessment designed and implemented by the Intergrowth-21st Project (Intergrowth neurodevelopment assessment tool - INTER-NDA) will be used to measure cognitive, motor, language, behavioral, attention, and executive function outcomes in children at 24 months. The recently developed 12-month version of the instrument (Oxford neurodevelopment assessment tool - OX-NDA) will be used to assess the child neurodevelopment at 12 months of age.</description>

    <description>Arm: Experimental: Intervention group Field workers trained in sleep hygiene counseling will advice the mothers randomly allocated to the intervention group. The intervention will be delivered at the child household and will include information on: Normal sleep behaviors during the first year of life; ideal conditions to promote sleep onset like environmental improvements that ensure restful sleep (no screen media, low noise and light); calming naptime routines and avoiding stimulating or stressing children just before naptime; practices that promote child self-regulation of sleep, including putting infants to sleep drowsy but awake; and how to handle nighttime awakenings. A booklet with the intervention content to aid the mother in implementing the intervention will be used.</description>

    <description>The mothers of the eligible infants will be visited at home and will be invited to participate at the study. To those who sign the Consent Form (CF) a following visit will be scheduled to within 5 days. Between CF signature and the 5-day visit, the enrolled children will use an actigraph-device in the leg and the mothers will fill out a sleep diary registering the times of the day the child is asleep, awake, napping, and feeding. At the 5-day visit the child allocation in the trial (intervention or control group) will be uncovered and the sleep recommendations will be delivered to mothers in the intervention group. Phone calls on days 6 and 7 and a home visit on day 8 will be paid to support mothers for possible difficulties in implementing the recommendations.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible to the trial the child will need to belong to the Pelotas 2015 Birth
             Cohort, to be born healthy (newborns that needed intensive care after birth and with
             any congenital malformations will be excluded) from a single pregnancy at gestational
             age 37 weeks or greater, and to sleep regularly on average less than 13 hours per 24
             hours (daytime and nighttime sleep) at three months of age (as reported by the
             mother). The information on child sleep duration per 24 hours will be gathered during
             the interview with mothers from the entire cohort, by means of the answer to the
             questions: &quot;How many hours does the child sleep from 7pm to 7am?&quot; and &quot;How many hours
             does the child sleep from 7am to 7pm?&quot;as well as number and duration of daytime naps,
             number of wake episodes during the night and how long it takes to the child to fall
             sleep after a nocturnal awakening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Because the potential effect of the programmed maternal physical activity during
             pregnancy over the sleep duration or over the poor-sleeper-newborn answer to the sleep
             trial is not known, newborns to mothers that participated at the PAMELA trial will not
             be eligible to the sleep trial. The PAMELA (Physical Activity for Mothers Enrolled in
             Longitudinal Analysis) is a randomized controlled trial nested in the Pelotas 2015
             birth cohort planned to assess the effect of regular exercise during pregnancy on the
             prevention of hypertension, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Eligible pregnant women
             between the 16th and 20th week of gestation are allocated into control group (426
             women who are advised to keep their usual daily activities) or intervention group (213
             women who engage in an exercise program, three sessions a week).

        Also, because the sleep intervention will recommend a series of environmental improvements
        to ensure a restful sleep (no screen media, low noise and light), the intervention will be
        restricted to families living in households with at least one bedroom. Children in
        continued use of medicines that can alter the sleep architecture and/or lead to drowsiness,
        like anticonvulsivants, will be excluded.
