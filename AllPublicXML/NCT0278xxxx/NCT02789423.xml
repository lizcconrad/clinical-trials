      The purpose of this study was clinical and radiographical evaluation of the effect of calcium
      hydroxide cement (Dycal) and calcium silicate cement (Biodentine) in direct pulp capping in
      primary teeth.

      The aim of the present study is to compare Calcium Hydroxide cement (Dycal) ® and Calcium
      Silicate cement (Biodentine)TM as pulp capping agents in primary molars. The objective of
      this study include the evaluation of clinical and radiographic efficacy of Calcium Hydroxide
      cement (Dycal) ® and Calcium Silicate cement (Biodentine)TM, and their response in direct
      pulp capping treatment on primary molars during a 6 months follow up. After following the
      proper standardized procedure for direct pulp cap. In the current study direct pulp capping
      was performed using calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal)® and Calcium Silicate cement
      (Biodentine)TM on 60 primary teeth of children equally divided between 2 study groups
      randomly of both the sexes aged 4-9 years old. Complete case history was recorded in detail
      and intraoral periapical radiograph was also taken for teeth indicated for direct pulp
      capping. Written consent was obtained from the parents of participants before starting the
      procedure. Strict standardized procedure had been followed and the pulp capping agent
      (Dycal®/BiodentineTM) were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions.Each patient
      was evaluated clinically and radiographically for any abnormal clinical signs and symptoms at
      1,3 and 6 months postoperatively.Better results for the success of the study could be
      relatively enhanced by close attention to rigid criteria for case selection, standardization
      of direct pulp capping procedure and meticulous performance of the procedure appear to be
      prerequisites for successful treatment.

Intervention Description:DPC using Dycal for direct pulp exposure was performed in 30 primary molar teeth after proper case selection.Clinical and radiographic evaluation was done.One month post operative criteria evaluated were-Clinical criteria:Spontaneous pain,Defective restoration/Recurrent caries,Sinus formation,TOP,Soft tissue swelling &amp; Mobility. Radiographic criteria:Defective restoration/Recurrent caries,Periapical or furcal radiolucency,Pathological internal resorption,Replacement resorption,Intracanal calcification &amp; Physiological resorption.The follow-up was at 3 and 6 months.</description>

    <description>The operative procedure performed as follows: i)Administration of L.A and rubber dam isolation. ii)High-speed carious enamel removal. iii)Dentine mechanical curettage. iv)Manual final dentine curettage using a spoon excavator. v)Hemorrhage control by cotton pellet moistened with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite placed over the exposure for 1-2min. vi)The exposure site would then be dried with sterile cotton pellet.The operator shall apply the pulp capping agent(dycal/Biodentine)according to the manufacturer's instructions.And then another cover of glass ionomer is applied.This would be followed by permanent restoration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Good health.

          2. Cooperative behaviour.

          3. Informed consent from parents.

          4. Primary molars with clinically active caries.

          5. No history of spontaneous pain in teeth.

          6. Restorable tooth with at least one half of root length present.

          7. Absence of pathological mobility.

          8. Absence of tenderness to percussion.

          9. Normal gingiva and periodontal condition without the sign of pathology such as redness
             and swelling of vestibule, draining sinus tract or sensitivity to palpate in the
             vestibule.

        In addition, the teeth treated by direct pulp capping had only a pin point mechanical
        exposure (0.5 to 1mm), for which haemorrhage control could be achieved within two minutes
        before proceeding with direct pulp capping.

        Radiographically, there was absence of internal resorption, external resorption, periapical
        or furcation radiolucencies and pathology of succedenous permanent tooth follicle.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of spontaneous pain, tooth tender to percussion, absence of
             underlying permanent teeth, internal/external root resorption, apical/furcal lesions,
             sinus tract, physiologic or pathologic luxation, and/or presence of abscess were
             excluded from the study.
