    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to gain initial insights into the biologic and clinical
      effects of Atezolizumab in patients with Asymptomatic Multiple Myeloma (AMM). The data may
      provide novel insights into anti-PDL-1-induced immunologic changes, which could potentially
      be relevant to its future development in Multiple Myeloma (MM) and other indications.

                  MRI and are clinically felt to require therapy will not be included.

          -  Measurable disease defined by: M-spike &gt;1 g/dL, or Bence Jones protein &gt; 200 mg/24
             hours by urine protein electrophoresis or involved serum free light chain (FLC) &gt;10 mg

             results obtained within 28 days prior to the first study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1):

               -  ANC ≥ 1500 cells/ µL

               -  WBC counts &gt; 2500/ µL

               -  Lymphocyte count ≥ 300/ µL

                  mg/dL)

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate
             of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last
             dose of study drug.

               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).

               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper use of hormonal
                  contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices,
                  and copper intrauterine devices.

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:

               -  With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men
                  must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at
                  least 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Men must refrain from donating
                  sperm during this same period.

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.
