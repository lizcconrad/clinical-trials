  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the adjuvant use of cannabidiol
      administered twice daily in doses of 5-25 mg/kg/day through the proportion of responsive
      patients; that is, participants with at least 50% decrease in the frequency of epileptic
      seizures in the last month of the trial relative to baseline (pretreatment with AEDs only).

      Primary end point(s): Rate of responsive patients; that is, participants with at least 50%
      decrease in the frequency of epileptic seizures in the last month of the trial relative to
      baseline (pretreatment with AEDs only).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged 2 years to 18 years.

          -  Diagnosis of treatment-resistant epilepsy according to the criteria of the
             International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) (Kwan et al., 2010).

          -  Participants with at least 4 epileptic seizures with intervals no longer than 21 days.

          -  In treatment with up to 3 AEDs concomitantly and at stable doses for at least 1 month
             before the baseline assessment and expected to remain stable during the period of the
             trial. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) will be considered as an AED.

          -  Availability of a legal guardian able to follow the protocol (e.g., understand and
             fill up diaries) and visitation and medication schemes, according to the decision of
             the investigator.

          -  Availability of brain neuroimaging exams (magnetic resonance or computed tomography)
             collected within the last 5 years.

          -  No significant comorbid conditions, according to medical decision, to other criteria
             in this Protocol, and to additional assessments: medical records, blood pressure,
             heart rate, and temperature measures, physical exam, ECG, EEG, and laboratory tests.

          -  Women in reproductive age may be included as long as they are sexually abstinent or
             using effective contraceptive methods.

          -  Participants and their legal guardians, when applicable, must sign an informed consent
             form approved by the local ethics committee.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Occurrence of simple partial seizures (preserved consciousness) only, with no motor
             symptomatology.

          -  History or presence of pseudoseizures.

          -  History of suicide attempt.

          -  History of major depression.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Drug use.

          -  Hypertension.

          -  Participants with severe dysphagia and no gastric or nasogastric tubes.

          -  Current treatment with drugs that may significantly affect the metabolism of CBD,
             except AEDs if stable for at least 1 month before the screening interview.

          -  Presence of any clinical or neuroimaging finding suggestive of brain disorders, brain
             tumors, or metabolic or neurodegenerative diseases of rapid progression.

          -  Presence of acute and clinically significant diseases as assessed by a medical
             investigator, such as kidney, liver, urinary, bowel, or respiratory infections.

          -  Presence of known chronic and clinically significant diseases as assessed by a medical
             investigator and which may interfere with participation in the trial or pose safety
             risks for the participant.

          -  History of liver, kidney, lung, hematological, heart, or psychiatric diseases that may
             affect the volunteers' health or participation in the trial.

          -  Hypotension or hypertension with any etiology and requiring pharmacological
             management.

          -  History of surgeries that may affect the volunteers' health and/or participation in
             the trial.

          -  Regular or intermittent use of marijuana over the 60 days preceding the baseline
             assessment.

          -  Regular or intermittent treatment with CBD over the 60 days preceding the baseline
             assessment.

          -  History of allergies or idiosyncratic reactions to Cannabis sativa derivatives or
             components of the pharmaceutical formulation.

          -  Clinically significant ECG alterations as judged by a medical investigator.

          -  Participation in other clinical trials within less than 3 months before the baseline
             assessment.

          -  Donation or loss of 450 mL or more of blood within 90 days before the baseline
             assessment.

          -  Impaired liver function: AST, ALP, alkaline phosphatase and γGT values more than 3
             times above the upper limit of the reference value. Results of γGT values 3 times
             above the upper limit will only be accepted if attributable to liver enzymatic
             induction caused by concomitant treatment with AEDs and with levels of other liver
             enzymes lower than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range.

          -  Participants with clinically significant discrepancies from the reference ranges of
             the following laboratory tests: creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min, platelets &lt;
