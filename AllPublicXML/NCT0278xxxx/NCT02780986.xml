      The investigators aim to assess the efficacy of a multi-component intervention on condom use
      and sexually transmitted infection (STIs) in female entertainment workers and men frequenting
      entertainment establishments (EEs), using a quasi-experimental design. Joo Chiat and Golden
      Mile Complex will be selected purposively as control cluster sites (n=220) with follow-up of
      entertainment workers at 6 weeks. The same sites will be used as intervention sites after a
      3-months 'wash out' period. Self-reported condom use, vaginal swab samples for polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) for cervical gonorrhoea and chlamydia infections, and throat swabs for
      culture for pharyngeal gonorrhoea will be assessed. Clark Quay will be the intervention venue
      for the heterosexual men while Tanjong Pagar will be the equivalent control site. Using time
      location sampling, cross-sectional samples of men patronising these establishments will be
      assessed on self-reported condom use at baseline (n=600) and 6 months after the intervention
      (n=400) in both intervention and control groups.

      BACKGROUND:

      Globalisation has led to an influx of women from surrounding Asian countries with high
      prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to work in entertainment establishments
      (EEs) in Singapore. Men frequenting EEs reported high levels of unprotected sex with
      commercial and casual partners.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The aim is to assess the efficacy of a multi-component intervention on STI prevention and
      condom use in female entertainment workers and men frequenting EEs in Singapore, using a
      quasi-experimental design. The hypothesis is that a comprehensive sexual health promotion
      program which incorporates behavioural (STI/HIV education, condom use and condom negotiation
      skills), biomedical (STI screening and treatment services) and structural components (free
      access to condoms) to female entertainment workers as well as behavioural (sexual well-being
      and safe sex edutainment) and structural (free access to condoms) interventions to men
      patronising EEs in Singapore will achieve an increase in condom use (for both target groups)
      and a reduction in incident STIs (only for female EE workers).

      METHODS:

      Female EE workers:

      Joo Chiat and Golden Mile Complex will be selected purposively as control cluster sites with
      220 entertainment workers being recruited and followed up at 6 weeks. The same sites will be
      used as intervention sites with recruitment of a separate sample of 220 participants after a
      3-months' 'wash out' period to ensure comparability. Self-reported condom use, vaginal swab
      samples for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for cervical gonorrhoea and chlamydia infections,
      and throat swabs for culture for pharyngeal gonorrhoea will be assessed. The short follow-up
      period is because almost all of these women come to Singapore to work illegally on 1 to 2
      months social visit passes.

      Heterosexual men:

      The investigators are unable to recruit heterosexual men from the same study sites of the
      female EE workers due to feasibility and safety considerations. Instead, Clark Quay will be
      selected purposively as the intervention site for the heterosexual men. Tanjong Pagar will be
      the equivalent control site. Using time location sampling, cross-sectional samples of men
      patronising these establishments will be assessed on self-reported condom use at baseline
      (n=600) and 6 months after the intervention (n=400) in both intervention and control groups.

      MAIN OUTCOMES:

      The primary outcomes for female EE workers are consistent condom use for vaginal sex with
      paid and casual partner respectively in the past 1 month and the secondary outcome is STI
      incidence. The primary outcomes for heterosexual men are condom use at last vaginal and oral
      sex respectively with casual partner in the past 6 months.

      POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS:

      The study will provide pertinent data for planning STI/HIV prevention programs for female
      entertainment workers and men patronising EEs in Singapore and the region.

    <description>The intervention program for the female EE workers aims to increase STI/HIV prevention knowledge and develop their condom negotiation and application skills so as to increase condom use with both casual and paid partners. It consists of a total of 4 sessions: 2 on-site and 2 online sessions. For each on-site session, groups of 4 to 5 female EE workers will be gathered. The 2 on-site sessions would be delivered by peer educators. The 2 online sessions would be conducted via phone and other modes of network communication (e.g. SMS message or WhatsApp message) depending on the preference of each participant. In addition, all the intervention materials and video demonstrations will also be uploaded onto the web portal for the participant to access during their free time.</description>

    <description>The female EE workers in the control group will receive the same number of 2 onsite and 2 online sessions but covering healthy eating and physical activity.
The following gives a summarised breakdown and content of each session:
Session 1 (on-site immediately after baseline survey, 10 minutes):
The peer educator will share information on healthy eating and physical activity using the educational pamphlets from the Health Promotion Board (HPB) with the participants.
Session 2 (online 1-2 weeks after baseline survey, 5 minutes):
The peer educator will share an app on healthy eating with the participants.
Session 3 (online 3-4 weeks after baseline survey, 5 minutes):
The peer educator will share an app on physical activity with the participants.
Session 4 (onsite during follow-up survey, 10 minutes):
The peer educator will reinforce information on healthy eating and physical activity based on the educational pamphlets from HPB with the participants.</description>

    <description>There will be a simultaneous programme on healthy eating and physical activity at the control site at Tanjong Pagar. Health promoters will go around Tanjong Pagar and distribute pamphlets and brochures developed by the HPB on healthy eating and physical activity to the heterosexual men who step into or out of the EEs there. These health promoters have been trained to give simple health advice on healthy eating and physical activity if the heterosexual men wish to find out more information.</description>

Session 1 (on-site): The peer educator will play 2 videos, demonstrating 5 sexy ways of putting on a condom in a pleasurable manner, and another one focusing on condom negotiation skills.
Session 2 (online): The peer educator will share an app game on condom usage and relevant online resources with the participants.
Session 3 (onsite): There will be discussion of common problems encountered in condom usage and condom negotiation by the participants. The peer educators will then conduct role plays with the participants to demonstrate the counter-strategies. In addition, the peer educators will get the participants who have been successful in condom negotiation to share their success stories.
Session 4 (online): The peer educator will share information about safe consumption of alcohol and tips to avoid getting drunk through the online platforms.</description>
