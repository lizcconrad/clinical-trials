  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the vital signs changes during 3 different dental procedures
      performed for the same patient by the same dentist. The patients will be selected randomly
      and should all be healthy adults.

      The aim is to look for any significant changes in the major vital signs (heart rate,
      respiratory rate, blood pressure, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) and body
      temperature) during specified dental procedures (scaling, simple restoration, and simple
      exodontia) and compare the changes between the 3 procedures.
