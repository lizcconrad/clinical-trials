  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. In one group,
      participants are given capsules of simvastatin to take orally (by mouth) for 24 months. In
      the other group, participants are given placebo (dummy) capsules to take orally for 24
      months. At the start of the study, when they receive their medication, participants complete
      a number of questionnaires and motor (movement) tests (a walking test and a finger tapping
      test). Participants in both groups also attend a further 6 clinic visits after 1, 6, 12, 18
      and 24 and 26 months, where they are asked about their health and any medication they are
      taking, as well as repeating the questionnaires and motor tests. For 4 of the clinic visits,
      the participants will be asked to attend in the 'OFF medication' state (having omitted their
      usual PD medication) so that the researchers can get a true picture of their disease without
      it being masked by their normal medication.

    <description>The MDS-UPDRS is the standard validated tool for the assessment of patients with Parkinson's Disease. This scale includes subsections collecting data regarding the impact of PD on a patient's mood and mental state, (UPDRS part I), their activities of daily living (UPDRS part II) an examination of the motor features of PD (UPDRS part III), and complications arising from the use of dopamine replacement (part IV).</description>

    <description>The PDQ39 is a PD-specific health status questionnaire used both clinically and within research since its publication in 1995. It consists of 39 items covering eight discrete dimensions: mobility, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication and bodily discomfort. The scores from each dimension are computed into a scale ranging from 0 (best, i.e. no problem at all) to 100 (worst, i.e. maximum level of problem). In addition a summary score, the PDQ-39SI (summary index) can be calculated by averaging the scores of the eight dimensions.</description>
