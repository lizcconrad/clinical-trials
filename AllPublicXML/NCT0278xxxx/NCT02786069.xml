      The main objective is to evaluate the effect of single dose Propionyl-L-Carnitine
      Hydrochloride on clinical pharmacokinetic characteristics and its effect of clinical
      pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety on healthy Chinese subjects to provide a basis for
      market authorization registration.

      Before the official start of the study, to determine the appropriate dosing interval and a
      preliminary assessment of drug safety, first carried out the pre-trial, 4 subjects with
      different gender in half, after 7 days of run-in period, collect baseline background sampling
      point at day 4, no medication but water intake. At day 8 fasting oral propionyl L-carnitine
      hydrochloride tablets 0.5g, according to pre-designed schedule for blood samples, urine
      samples and clinical indicators, provide a reference for official trial.

      Official trial is a single, open label, self-controlled, three-period, dose escalation,
      period fasting single oral administration trial. 12 chinese healthy adult subject met the
      inclusion criteria 12 people, each gender in half. Each subject first pass 7 days of run-in
      period, to eliminate the residual substances in food L-carnitine, stable baseline level of
      endogenous L-carnitine class substance within the subject; at day 4 was baseline sampling
      point, tno medication but water intake; at day 8 (1st period day 1) fasting oral propionyl
      L-carnitine hydrochloride tablets 1g; at day 12 (2nd period of day 1) fasting oral
      hydrochloride propionyl L-carnitine tablets 2g; the first 16 days (3rd period day 1) fasting
      oral propionyl L-carnitine hydrochloride tablets 4g.Throughout the trial period, control the
      subjects' diet, eating only allowed as far as possible food without substance L-carnitine
      class and drink boiled water,diet at sampling day 4, 8, 12, 16 need to be fixed consistently.
      Every 4 days of dosing interval washout period.

      Subject need to follow blood, urine collection and diet control as required by protocol
      before the day of run-in period. During the trial should avoid vigorous exercise, meanwhile
      to avoid long-time bedding.
