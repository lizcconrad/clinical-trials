    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and morphological features of
      coronary plaques by means of OCT in patients with acute myocardial infarction but without any
      significant coronary stenosis at coronary angiography. In addition, cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging (CMR) will be performed to assess the prevalence, location, and pattern of
      myocardial injury as well as other concomitant findings. As a secondary analysis, the
      association between the distribution and characteristics of coronary plaques detected on OCT
      and myocardial injury shown by CMR will be evaluated. In addition, a post-hoc survey
      regarding the potential modification of the interventional treatment approach based on OCT
      analysis will be conducted.

      The mechanism of myocardial infarction in patients with nonobstructive coronary artery
      disease remains unknown. The SOFT-MI study has been designed as a single-center, prospective
      observational trial to investigate the prevalence of vulnerable and disrupted plaques in
      patients with acute MI but without any significant coronary stenosis (defined as stenosis of
      &gt;50%) at coronary angiography. All patients will undergo coronary OCT immediately after
      coronary angiography. In addition, CMR will be performed within 1 week of coronary
      angiography to evaluate associated myocardial abnormalities as well as extracardiac findings.
      The study will provide insight into the mechanism of MI without obstructive coronary artery
      disease at coronary angiography, and may be useful in order to establish an appropriate
      therapeutic strategy for the secondary prevention of ischemic events.
