  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of single adductor-canal-block versus
      single femoral nerve block on the recovery after total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of different analgesic effects on the outcome
      of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Patients who will have primary unilateral
      total knee replacement between September 2016 to June 2018 at Peking Union Medical College
      Hospital and meet the inclusion criteria will be included. They are randomized into two
      groups. The total knee arthroplasty is performed by one surgeon and adductor-canal block is
      performed by one anesthesiologist who is not responsible for follow-up. Patients on both
      groups will have intravenous patient control analgesia with 1 mg morphine/bolus. One
      residency is responsible for the follow-up.

    <measure>the time required for functional recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>from the date of the surgery to the time when the patients meet the criteria of functional recovery. The earliest day on which the patient achieves the criteria of functional recovery will be recorded and the average time is 7 days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are evaluated postoperatively to determine whether the patients have meet the criteria of functional recovery.The criteria of functional recovery are as followings: walking distance more than 70m with crutch, getting up or standing up independently and visual analog score less than 5 both in rest and after movement. Before discharge, patients are assessed every morning. After discharge, patients are followed up by phone every two days.</description>

    <time_frame>daily after the surgery until discharge from hospital, expected average up to 5 days after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Any complication, including nause and vomiting, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infection, urinary tract infection,cardiovascular event and falls are recorded during inhospital stay.</description>

    <intervention_name>single adductor-canal-block</intervention_name>
    <description>Single adductor-canal-block is performed before the surgery. A 12Hz linear ultrasound transducer is placed on the medial part of the thigh with the leg slightly externally rotated. The femoral artery was identified in short axis in the adductor canal, underneath the sartorius muscle. After skin disinfection , an 18-gauge needle (B.Braun Medical, Melsungen, Germany) is inserted in-plane from the lateral side of the transducer. The needle tip was placed underneath the sartorius muscle, just lateral to the artery and saphenous nerve, using 2-3 ml of saline to ensure correct placement. 25 ml of 0.35% ropivacaine is slowly injected with repeated aspiration.</description>

    <intervention_name>periarticular infiltration</intervention_name>
    <description>The periarticular infiltration of multimodal agents will involve the preparation of a mixture of 100 ml solution. The mixture contains 30ml (300mg) ropivacaine, 0.5ml (5 mg) morphine, 2 ml (50 mg) flurbiprofen and 0.5 ml of 1:1000 epinephrine, and then is diluted with 0.9% normal saline to a total volume of 100ml. 50 ml of mixture will be injected into the anterior, medial and lateral soft tissues after the implantation of the joint prostheses. The remaining 50 ml of mixture will be injected into intraarticular space after the closure of articular capsule.</description>
