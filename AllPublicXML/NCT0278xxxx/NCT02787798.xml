  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system is a feature of the heart failure and
      the determinants of disease progression and risk of sudden cardiac death. This research
      project aims to study, in the drug use conditions provided in the summary of product
      characteristics based on European marketing authorization (indications and dosage), the
      effect of the Entresto® on the activity of sympathic nervous system using the reference
      method, the microneurographic recording of sympathetic activity in muscle destiny (MSNA).
      This study will try to determine if the double inhibition of AT1 receptor and neprilysin
      activity result in lower sympathic nervous system burst rate versus single AT1 receptor
      inhibition using angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or AT1 receptor of angiotensin II
      inhibitor.
