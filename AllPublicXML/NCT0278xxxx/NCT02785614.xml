      following two different crossover treatments: trazodone hydrochloride prolonged-release
      tablets 150 mg per day for 7 days in T group, trazodone hydrochloride tablets 50mg for 3
      times per day for 7 days in R group. Wash-out period is 14 days.

      Sampling site will be conducted in day 1, 5, 6, 7 before administration in this period, blood
      sampling will be conducted in 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0,
      36.0, 48.0, 72.0h after administration on day 7.

      R group: The subjects will receive 50mg trazodone hydrochloride tablet 50mg for 3 times after
      receiving standard light breakfast at 6:00am, standard meal at 14:00 and 22:00. Blood
      sampling will be conducted on day 1, 5, 6, 7 before first administration in this period,
      blood sampling will be conducted at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 (before the second
      time administration), 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 14.0, 16.0 (before the third time

      administration on day 7.

      5.0 mL venous blood from forearm venous blood was took through venous indwelling needle and
      transfer into the heparin tube. After plasma separation it stored in low temperature in a
      refrigerator.
