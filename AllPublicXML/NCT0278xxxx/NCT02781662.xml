      This study evaluates an intervention to reduce medication errors and adverse drug events in
      older adults who have recently been discharged from the hospital and prescribed
      anticoagulants, diabetes agents, or opioids. Half of the study participants will receive the
      intervention, while the other half will receive usual care.

      The overarching objective of this research study is to pursue a large randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) focused on older patients recently discharged from the hospital who have been
      prescribed medications within one of three high-priority, high-risk drug classes in order to
      reduce the risk of clinically important medication errors. The National Action Plan for
      Adverse Drug Event (ADE) Prevention identified three high-priority drug classes as key
      targets for reducing the risk of drug-related injuries: anticoagulants; diabetes agents
      (insulin and oral agents); and opioids. These medication classes were chosen because they
      account for the greatest number of measurable drug-related harms to patients, and a
      substantial proportion of ADEs associated with these medications is considered preventable.
      The clinical trial will determine the value of a multifaceted medication error and ADE
      reduction intervention with a special focus on in-home assessment.

      Components of the intervention will include: (1) in-home assessment of high-risk patients by
      a clinical pharmacist; (2) best-practice, evidence-based medication safety tools and
      resources targeted to high-risk patients and their caregivers; (3) communication with the
      primary care team via the electronic health record (EHR) regarding concerns relevant to the
      use of high-risk medications as well as other medication safety concerns; and (4) a follow-up
      phone call by the pharmacist to the patient and/or caregiver within 14 days of the home
      visit. The primary outcome of interest will be clinically important medication errors, a
      composite outcome comprised of preventable or ameliorable ADEs and potential ADEs due to
      medication discrepancies or non-adherence. Secondary outcomes will include: (1) preventable
      or ameliorable ADEs; (2) potential ADEs due to discrepancies or non-adherence; and (3)
      preventable or ameliorable ADEs judged to be serious, life-threatening, or fatal.

      The specific aims for our study are as follows:

      Aim 1: To adapt and integrate existing &quot;best-practice,&quot; evidence-based medication safety
      tools, resources, and approaches into a cohesive, multifaceted intervention to reduce the
      occurrence of clinically important medication errors in older adults recently discharged from
      the hospital using one or more of the three high-priority, high-risk drug classes
      (anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioids).

      Aim 2: To assess the impact of the multifaceted intervention on the incidence of clinically
      important medication errors employing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

      Aim 3: To conduct a process evaluation assessing intervention fidelity, adaptation,
      mechanisms of impact, essential components, and the influence of contextual factors.

      Aim 4: To create: 1) a plan for disseminating study findings to stakeholders who might
      implement the intervention or make decisions about its future use; and 2) an implementation
      toolkit for those who wish to implement the intervention in practice.

    <description>To assess for the occurrence of clinically important medication errors, the investigators will use methods that they have developed, tested, and validated in previous investigations relating to drug-related incidents. Two pharmacist-investigators, who will not be involved in the intervention, will screen for signals of possible clinically important medication errors in the patient's electronic health record and in a structured telephone interview. The semi-structured telephone interview will be conducted according to the approach used by Forester, et. al (Forster AJ, Murff HJ, Peterson JF, et al. The incidence and severity of adverse events affecting patients after discharge from the hospital. Ann Intern Med. 2003; 138(3):161-167).</description>
