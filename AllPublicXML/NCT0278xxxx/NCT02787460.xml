      The University of Florida offers relationship education programs named ELEVATE, for couples,
      and Smart Steps, for couples in stepfamilies, in Citrus, Duval, Manatee, Palm Beach, and
      Santa Rosa counties. Each workshop comprises 4 2.5-hour long sessions. The STREAMS evaluation
      will examine whether text messages informed by behavioral insight theory can improve couples'
      attendance at relationship skills education group sessions, and if so, which kinds of
      messages are most effective

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The University of Florida operates the SMART program, which will offer four relationship
      education programs, each targeting a different population: (1) Relationship Smarts PLUS, for
      high school youth; (2) Before You Tie the Knot, for couples interested in marriage; (3)
      ELEVATE, for couples, and (4) Smart Steps, for couples in stepfamilies. All programming is
      offered through the University of Florida's IFAS Extension service in Citrus, Duval, Manatee,
      Palm Beach, and Santa Rosa counties.

      The STREAMS evaluation will test text messaging strategies with couples enrolled in ELEVATE
      and Smart Steps. It will examine whether text messages informed by behavioral insight theory
      can improve couples' attendance at relationship skills education group sessions, and if so,
      which kinds of messages are most effective. ACF staff have noted that among the most common
      technical assistance requests from HMRE grantees are help with improving participation. Even
      if relationship skills sessions are offered in a convenient location where adults receive
      other services and even if programs offer transportation, child care and other assistance to
      facilitate regular program attendance, achieving consistent participation in these voluntary
      programs can be challenging. The University of Florida study will help address these
      challenges by examining whether text messages based on behavioral theories can work as a
      simple, practical strategy for improving program participation in group sessions. More
      broadly, the site will also add to the large and growing effort across the federal government
      to study the use of behavioral interventions or &quot;nudges&quot; to improve social programs.
