    <textblock>
      The median effective dose (ED50) and ED95 of intranasal dexmedetomidine as a single bolus
      have not been described for sedation in children undergoing transthoracic echocardiography
      (TEE) study. This information is important to compare agents and to determine the most
      effective sedative dose. The investigators performed a two-stage study to determine the ED50
      and the ED95 of intranasal dexmedetomidine to investigate age-related differences in
      participants undergoing transthoracic echocardiography study.

      The investigators performed a two-stage study to determine the ED50 and the ED95 of
      intranasal dexmedetomidine in children undergoing transthoracic echocardiography study. In
      phase 1, 120 participants were randomized in a Dixon-Massey study to describe the minimum
      local sedative dose. In phase 2, a further 160 participants were randomly allocated to
      receive sedation with doses in the upper dose-response range to define the ED95

    <measure>The ED50 doses for intranasal dexmedetomidine</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 0.5 hours after transthoracic echocardiography</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 1: The starting dose of dexmedetomidine was 2.5 mcg/kg. These doses varied by 0.1 mcg/kg, according to the up-and-down method 18. If the detected MOAA/S score was &gt;3 within 45 minutes after intranasal administration, or clinically adequate diagnostic-quality images could not be acquired, sedation was considered a failure; and the dexmedetomidine dose was increased by 0.1 mcg/kg in the next patient of the same age group. In contrast, if the detected MOAA/S score was â‰¤3 and the acquisition of clinically adequate diagnostic-quality images was possible, the sedation was considered successful; and the dexmedetomidine dose was decreased by 0.1 mcg/kg in the next patient o</description>

    <measure>The ED95 doses for intranasal dexmedetomidine</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 0.5 hours after transthoracic echocardiography</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2 was a dose-escalation study. After interim analysis of the phase 1 results, four dose levels above the calculated ED50 were defined. Dose spacing was set at 0.3 mcg/kg of intranasal dexmedetomidine consistent with the re-estimated standard deviation (SD). Defined levels were set at about 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, and 3.25 mcg/kg of intranasal dexmedetomidine. Criteria for success and failure were identical to those in phase 1.
Successful sedation was defined as a MOAA/S score between 0-3 and allowed the acquisition of clinically adequate diagnostic-quality images, while failure was defined as a MOAA/S score &gt;3 within 45 minutes or clinically adequate diagnostic-quality images could not be acquired</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>sedation induction time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Successful sedation was defined as an MOAA/S of between 0 and 3, and sedation induction time was defined as the time from drug administration to the onset of satisfactory sedation</description>

    <measure>Wake -up time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Children were classified as awake if the MOAA/S was between 4 and 6. Wake -up time was defined as the time from successful sedation until the time that the child awoke</description>

    <description>Phase 1, Children received a bolus of intranasal dexmedetomidine which adjusted by the &quot;Dixon up-and-down method for TEE study. The first child received 2.5 mcg/kg of intranasal dexmedetomidine dose (100mcg/ml), and the dose varied by 0.1 mcg/kg according to the up-and-down method Phase 2 was a dose-escalation study. After interim analysis of the phase 1 results, four dose levels above the calculated ED50 were defined. Dose spacing was set at 0.25 mcg/kg of intranasal dexmedetomidine consistent with the re-estimated standard deviation (SD).</description>
