  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a multi-institutional
      study that collects cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 6 minute walk distance performance
      testing prior to a cycle of chemotherapy (or transplant), followed by collection of patient
      generated health data (wearable activity monitors and patient reported outcomes) for the
      subsequent month. In addition to demonstrating feasibility, the study looks to generate
      preliminary data that supports the capacity of physical performance testing and
      patient-generated health data to complement clinician-rated performance status in patients
      receiving chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical fitness, based on tests of physical performance and measurements of daily activity,
      can serve as both a risk stratification variable and clinical outcome for patients prior to
      or during cytotoxic chemotherapy. Many cytotoxic therapies cause premature aging and frailty
      in a sizable portion of patients, so measuring and improving physical function may also limit
      late morbidity and mortality in certain patient populations. Clinician-rated performance
      status (cPS; e.g., ECOG or Karnofsky PS) in addition to organ-specific function have been
      used to prognosticate risk and determine treatment strategy, but cPS only readily identifies
      individuals with significant functional compromise. Objective evaluations of physical
      function, such as aerobic capacity and measured daily activity, may have greater potential to
      improve the precision of performance status evaluation.
