  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, the investigator will develop a low-literacy
      Mobile Pain Coping Skills Training (mPCST) protocol for cancer patients with pain (i.e.,
      therapist manual, patient manual including handouts, and the smartphone materials) as well as
      a beta version of the basic smartphone components with the assistance of experts in the
      field. Next, an iterative development design using focus groups with women who have breast
      cancer and pain accrued from medically underserved areas will be used to refine the developed
      mPCST protocol and basic smart phone components. The protocol—designed to reduce cancer pain
      and disability in patients with low literacy in medically underserved areas—will be delivered
      via tele-video conferencing sessions in the community clinic. The smartphone tools (e.g.,
      simple text messages, images, and preloaded intervention content) will allow the intervention
      to extend into the patients' homes. The second study purpose is to pilot test the
      feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the developed protocol. The investigator will
      also obtain an estimate of the effect size of the developed protocol to decrease pain. Focus
      group data will be managed and evaluated in a systematic format using a grounded theory
      approach. Data analyses for the pilot testing period of the study will be assessed by
      examining accrual, attrition, and adherence to the intervention. Simple t-tests will be used
      to examine pre- to post-intervention differences in pain and the other outcomes of interest.
      There are minimal risk or safety issues related to this study.
