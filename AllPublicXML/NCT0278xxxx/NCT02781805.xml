  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to mechanistically define the potential anticancer activities of
      the osteoporosis bisphosphonate (BP) drug alendronate, and extend the analysis to learn novel
      information about the impact of BP on gamma delta (γδ) T cells in breast tissues as well as
      epithelial breast cell differentiation of high-risk women. To this end, we have designed a BP
      &quot;window trial&quot; to examine the effect of 1 - 3 weeks administration of alendronate on women at
      high-risk for breast cancer, at the level of immunosurveillance and mammary epithelial cell
      differentiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients referred for risk reduction mastectomy (ex. BRCA or other high-risk gene
             mutations, strong family history of breast cancer, history of LCIS, ADH, ALH and those
             with DCIS undergoing bilateral mastectomy or prophylactic contralateral mastectomy)

          -  Patients who are premenopausal defined as an individual with at least six menstrual
             cycles in the past year

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older

          -  The effects of Alendronate on the developing fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             heterosexual women must agree to use TWO effective forms of birth control for the
             duration of study participation and for 8 weeks following the last dose of study
             medication. Women must combine a hormonal birth control method (e.g. combined oral
             contraceptive pill, vaginal ring, skin patch, injection, or copper IUD) in continuous
             use for &gt;90 days prior to study entry (except in the case of a copper IUD), with a
             non-hormonal birth control method (e.g. diaphragm, cervical cap, cervical shield with
             spermicide, contraceptive sponge, or condom (male or female) with spermicide).

          -  Women with hysterectomy with intact functioning ovaries, women with Fallopian tubes
             cut, tied, or sealed, and women with a sterilization implant (e.g. Adiana, Essure)
             placed &gt;3 months prior to beginning the study drug are not considered to be able to
             bear children and therefore are eligible to participate without the use of concurrent
             birth control.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within the
             current menstrual cycle and within 7 days before starting drug.

          -  Patients must have recovered from major infections and/or surgical procedures, and in
             the opinion of the investigator, not have any significant active concurrent medical
             illnesses precluding protocol treatment

          -  Participants must have the ability to understand, and the willingness to sign, a
             written informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer

          -  Patients who are post-menopausal (defined as 12 consecutive months without a menstrual
             period).

          -  Patients with an implant in the sampled breast

          -  Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study. Breastfeeding must be
             discontinued for the duration of study participation and for 8 weeks after the last
             dose of the study agent

          -  Patients for whom English is not their native language

          -  Patients with current or previous bisphosphonate therapy

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition of alendronate and other bisphosphonates.

          -  Patients with esophageal dysmotility

          -  Patients unable to sit up or stay up for 30 minutes after taking oral dose

          -  Patients who have taken non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the past two
             weeks

          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy for a malignancy in the past 5 years

          -  Patients who are treated for a medical condition (such as ulcerative colitis) with
             chronic steroids during the 2 years prior to planned mastectomy surgery

          -  Patients with calculated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault) less than 35 mL/min

          -  Patients with a history of hypocalcemia
