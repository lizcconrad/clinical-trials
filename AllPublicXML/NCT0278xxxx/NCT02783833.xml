      Pharmacodynamic profiling will also be studied to characterize the effects of MMV390048 on P.
      falciparum clearance kinetics in healthy subjects using the Induced Blood Stage Malaria
      (IBSM) challenge model to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of MMV390048 for P.
      falciparum (Part B). An approximation of this concentration in healthy subjects will help to
      identify the optimal dose of MMV390048 for subsequent Phase 2 studies in patients. The
      challenge model will enable characterization of the exposure-response relationship for
      MMV390048 and will also provide data regarding the safety and tolerability of MMV390048 in a
      controlled disease-like setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Completion of the written informed consent process.

          2. Men or WNCBP age 18 to 55 years, in good health as determined by past medical history,

          3. Male subjects agree to use acceptable methods of contraception if the male subject's
             partner could become pregnant from the time of the first administration of study
             medication until 130 (90+40) days following administration of the investigational
             medicinal product. One of the following acceptable methods of contraception must be
             utilized:

               -  Condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)

               -  Surgical sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) and a
                  barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps].

               -  The subject's female partner uses oral contraceptives (combination
                  estrogen/progesterone pills), injectable progesterone or subdermal implants and a
                  barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps].

               -  The subject's female partner uses medically prescribed topically-applied
                  transdermal contraceptive patch and a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap
                  [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps].

               -  The subject's female partner has undergone documented tubal ligation (female
                  sterilization). In addition, a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm
                  or cervical/vault caps].

               -  The subject's female partner has undergone documented placement of an
                  intrauterine device or intrauterine system. In addition, a barrier method (condom

                  12 months without an alternative medical cause with a screening follicle
                  stimulating hormone level consistent with local laboratory levels for
                  post-menopause.

          5. Haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis results at screening that are within
             the local laboratory reference range or, if outside the range, not clinically
             significant as judged by the Investigator. More specifically, serum creatinine,
             hepatic transaminase enzymes (AST ALT), and total bilirubin (unless the subject has
             documented Gilbert syndrome) should not exceed the upper laboratory norm and
             haemoglobin must be equal to or higher than the lower limit of the normal range.

          6. Total body weight greater than 50 kg and a body mass index (BMI) within the range of

             of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Male subjects with a female partner(s) who is (are) pregnant or lactating from the
             time of the administration of study medication.

             becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation

          5. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
