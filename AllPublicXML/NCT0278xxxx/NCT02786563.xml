  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, post-marketing, multi-center, open-label study to explore if the initiation of
      adalimumab could influence grey-scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) ultrasonographic (US) score
      using 36-joint plus 4-tendon scoring system, and validate the applicability of different
      simplified US joint scoring systems.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate to severe RA despite treatment with methotrexate (MTX).

          -  Eligible to use adalimumab according to the local label without any contraindication.

          -  Na√Øve to adalimumab, and participants with prior exposure to any other biologic
             disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should have experienced at least five
             half-lives of the biologics after treatment discontinuation.

          -  Participants for whom investigators decided to prescribe adalimumab as per local label
             and are initiating adalimumab at baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other inflammatory condition which may affect the signs on joints ultrasound (eg,
             gouty arthritis, or other chronic rheumatic disease besides RA).

          -  Currently being treated with or has been treated with any investigational drug of
             chemical or biologic nature within a minimum of 30 days of the baseline visit.

          -  Participants with contraindication or are not appropriate to use adalimumab according
             to local label or investigators' judgment.
