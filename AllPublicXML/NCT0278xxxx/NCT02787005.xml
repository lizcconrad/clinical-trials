  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Participants will be enrolled into one of five
      cohorts: Cohort 1 (participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]-positive,
      measurable disease), Cohort 2 (participants with PD-L1 negative, measurable disease), Cohort
      3 (participants with bone-metastases and non-measurable disease) post-chemotherapy, Cohort 4
      (participants with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1- [RECIST
      1.1]-measureable disease) and Cohort 5 (participants with bone metastases only or
      bone-predominant disease) pre-chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Participants with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy in Cohorts 1 to
      3 will receive monotherapy with pembrolizumab. Chemotherapy-naïve subjects with mCRPC either
      having failed or showing signs of failure with enzalutamide in Cohorts 4 and 5 will receive
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in addition to their current regimen of enzalutamide. In all
      cohorts, pembrolizumab administration will occur on Day 1 of each 3-week dosing cycle and
      will continue for a maximum of 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) unless specific
      withdrawal/discontinuation criteria are met. Participants who discontinue after 35 infusions
      of pembrolizumab for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability, or who
      discontinue after attaining a complete response may be eligible for up to 17 additional
      infusions (approximately 1 year) after they have experienced disease progression.

          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease and/or a history of (non-infectious)

             [anti-PD-L1], and anti-PD-L2 [including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways]).

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
