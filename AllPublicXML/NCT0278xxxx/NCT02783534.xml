  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common complaint in menstruating women. Although nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug is an effective treatment, there are concerns about serious adverse
      events. Complementary therapies, including acupuncture, are commonly used for PD. Acupuncture
      has a low risk of adverse effects, while the evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in
      treating PD is inconclusive. Deqi and psychological factors are core concepts in acupuncture
      theory, but they have been largely neglected in primary dysmenorrhea clinical reports. The
      objective of this trail is to assess the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in the prevention
      of PD and investigate what factors will affect the efficacy of acupuncture.The results of
      this trial will significantly add to the current body of evidence on the role of acupuncture
      for PD. If found to be effective and safe, acupuncture will be a valuable treatment option in
      the prevention of PD. In additional, results from this trial will identify what factors will
      affect the efficacy of acupuncture.

      This is a multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled, three-arm, large-scale clinical
      trial. We will recruit 300 PD women who meet diagnostic criteria for PD established in 2005
      from Canada gynaecology and obstetrics association. Exclusion criteria include illiteracy,
      breast feeding women, pregnancy women, serious systemic disease, mental patient, and
      acupuncture experience. Eligible women will be randomly assigned to verum acupuncture group,
      sham acupuncture group and usual care group. Participants in the verum acupuncture group will
      receive traditional acupuncture treatment and will be treated with ture needles, While
      Participants in the sham acupuncture group will be treated with sham acupuncture with
      non-insertive needles at non-acupuncture points. Acupuncture treatment will start from the
      5th or 7th day before the estimated first day of menstrual cycle, and for each cycle,
      participants will receive one session of treatment each day for 5 consecutive days (a
      treatment course), totally for 15 sessions and 3 treatment courses. Participants in the usual
      care group will not receive treatment besides health education as a control group. This trail
      will be composed of a one-menstrual cycle baseline, three-menstrual cycle treatment (cycle 1
      to 3), and three-menstrual cycle follow-up period (cycle 4-6). The primary outcome measure is
      the change of Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale (CMSS) in a menstrual cycle compared to baseline.
      Secondary outcome measures include Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), McGill pain questionnaire
      (SF-MPQ), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and intake of acute medication.
      Psychological outcome measures are Beck Depression Rating Scale (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory
      (BAI), NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), the Doctor-Patient Relationship Scale (PDRQ), the
      Difficult Doctor-Patient Relationship Questionnaire (DDPRQ), and Expectations for
      interventions assessed by acupuncture expectancy scale (AES). Deqi sensation will be measured
      by MGH Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS).

    <description>Participants will receive verum acupuncture plus usual care. Participants will receive acupuncture treatment start from the 5th or 7th day before the estimated first day of menstrual cycle, and for each cycle, participants will receive one session of treatment each day for 5 consecutive days, totally be treated with 15 sessions.Verum needles will be inserted into the skin and manipulated manually until deqi occurs. The needles are retained for 30 min in each session. During the treatment, the acupuncturist inquires the patient about deqi sensations and manipulates the needles to maintain the intensity of deqi. Participants will receive the same usual care as those in the usual care group.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive sham acupuncture plus usual care. The Streitberger placebo needle will be placed at non-acupuncture points which are distant from the meridian parts and not located on the same neuromuscular segments as the prescribed points used in the VA group, so as to minimize any therapeutic and segmental effects. The same acupuncture schedule as that in the verum acupuncture group will be applied. The needles are retained for 30 min in each session. During the treatment, the acupuncturist inquires the patient about deqi sensations and pretends to manipulate the needles but deqi is not sought.Participants will receive the same usual care as those in the usual care group.</description>
