  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study of matched unrelated donor
      BPX-501 T cell infusion in adult subjects with hematological malignancies presenting with
      recurrent disease minimal residual disease (MRD) post-allogeneic transplant.

    <textblock>
      Un-manipulated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is used after stem cell transplantation to
      treat and prevent relapse, to prevent infections and to establish full donor chimerism. The
      addition of mature T cells which exhibit a broad repertoire of T cell immunity against viral
      antigens, as well as against cancer antigens, might provide a clinical benefit. However, an
      expected side effect of the presence of mature T cells is the potential occurrence of acute
      graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). The use of a suicide gene switch which would trigger the
      initiation of the apoptosis of the alloreactive T cells by the infusion of a drug would
      represent the potential optimal strategy for restoring early immunity with a built in &quot;safety
      switch&quot; against GvHD side effects. Evidence has emerged that low-dose DLI followed by dose
      escalation can achieve higher clinical response rate with lower GvHD occurrence. Optimization
      of DLI dose and schedule as well as strategies of donor T-cell manipulation may lead to the
      consistent ability to separate GvHD from graft-versus-tumor (GvT) activity and improve the
      safety of DLI treatment. Our strategy is to infuse escalating doses of manipulated T cells
      (from the same donor who provided the original hematopoietic stem cell graft) in adults and
      children with recurrent or minimal residual disease (MRD) hematologic malignancies
      post-allogeneic transplant to accelerate immune reconstitution thus improving graft versus
      leukemic effect while reducing the severity of GvHD.
