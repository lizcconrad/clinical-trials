  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the drug lenvatinib
      has on the patient and on adenoid cystic carcinoma. This type of cancer study is called a
      phase II study. Researchers hope to learn if the study drug will shrink the cancer by at
      least one-quarter compared to its present size.

      Lenvatinib is an oral medication that can interfere with cancer cell growth and reduce the
      growth of blood vessels around tumors. This study will help find out if lenvatinib is a
      useful drug for treating patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma.
             Cancers arising from non-salivary gland primary sites are allowed.

             curative surgery or radiotherapy.

          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the end of prior systemic treatment (4 weeks
             for bevacizumab- containing regimens) or radiotherapy with resolution of all
             treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 (or tolerable grade 2) or
             back to baseline (except for alopecia, lymphopenia, or hypothyroidism). Any number of
             prior therapies for recurrent/metastatic ACC are allowed.

          -  Patients must have RECIST v1.1 measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that
             can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded
             for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Patients must have documentation of a new or progressive lesion on a radiologic
             imaging study performed within 6 months prior to study enrollment (progression of
             disease over any interval is allowed) and/or new/worsening disease related symptoms
             within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Note: This assessment will be performed by
             the treating investigator. Evidence of progression by RECIST criteria is not required.

          -  Patients must have archival tissue from the primary tumor or metastases available for
             correlative studies. Either a paraffin block or twenty unstained slides are
             acceptable. (If less than twenty unstained slides are available, the patient may be
             able to participate at the discretion of the investigator.)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%)

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 /mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil
                  count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3. Blood transfusion to meet the inclusion criteria will not
                  be allowed.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed
             consent form. A signed informed consent form must be appropriately obtained prior to
             the conduct of any trial-specific procedure.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 2 weeks prior to the start of study drug. Post-menopausal women (defined as no
             menses for at least 1 year) and surgically sterilized women are not required to
             undergo a pregnancy test.

          -  Subjects (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception beginning at the signing of the consent form until at least 3 months
             after the last dose of study drug. The definition of adequate contraception will be
             based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.

          -  Subject must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, definitive radiation therapy, surgery,
