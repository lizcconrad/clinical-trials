    <textblock>
      M2951 is an investigational drug under evaluation for treatment of autoimmune and
      inflammatory disorders. The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of M2951 in
      subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) currently treated with stable dose of methotrexate
      (MTX).
