  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to maximize patient involvement in the treatment of anal cancer.
      Specifically, the investigators will investigate whether patients wish to take part in the
      decision making on radiation dose and whether they want a high or low radiation dose.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will also provide new knowledge on the effect and side effects of irradiation of
      anal cancer, and detailed data from the dose planning will be instrumental in optimizing
      future decision aids.
