  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) is a difficult disease to both diagnose
      and treat. It is defined as an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, or discomfort) perceived
      to be related to the urinary bladder and associated with lower urinary tract symptoms for at
      least 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. Pain is the
      universal symptom, but many also experience symptoms of overactive bladder, possibly directly
      related to the mechanism of pain. Treating pain may influence the symptom of urgency, if the
      urge arises from a need to alleviate pain. In some patients whose pain improves with
      treatment, troubling overactive bladder symptoms still remain. Beta-3 adrenergic agonists
      have been found to decrease signaling of C-fibers in animal models. So, the investigators
      hypothesize that mirabegron, which is FDA-approved for treatment of overactive bladder, would
      also improve symptoms in patients with BPS/IC. As a selective beta-3 agonist, mirabegron acts
      on the beta-3 receptors found in the bladder which mediate relaxation of the detrusor muscle.
      It has been shown to significantly decrease the number or micturition episodes, urgency
      episodes, and increased mean volume of urine voided per micturition. It also has a favorable
      tolerability profile.

             the ICSI, as well as 8 on the ICPI. Participants should be stable on their regimen (no
             increase or change in medications, behavioral treatments or physical therapy in
             previous 4 weeks prior to starting the study) and be willing to remain on this regimen

          2. Gender of subjects: Participants in this study will be female. Pregnant women and
