    <textblock>
      This is a observational prospective study. For patients presenting to the Emergency
      Department with loss of consciousness, emergency physicians will be asked to screen the real
      syncope without an evident and immediate cause for the loss of consciousness (e.g. vasovagal)
      and/or at least one high risk condition as listed by the European Society of Cardiology in
      the 2009 Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (i.e. severe structural or
      coronary artery disease, clinical or ECG features suggesting arrhythmic syncope, and
      important co-morbidities).

      In case of a real syncope not clearly physiopathologically explained and no high risk
      conditions, the emergency physician in charge will check risk factors for high risk syncope
      and categorize again every cases.

      A high risk syncope is characterized by at least one high-risk characteristic (based on 2015
      &quot;Syncope clinical management in the emergency department consensus&quot;): syncope during
      exertion, in supine position, with new onset of chest discomfort, palpitations before the
      loss of consciousness, family history of sudden death, congestive heart failure, aortic
      stenosis, left ventricular outflow tract disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection
      fraction &lt;35%, previously documented ventricular arrhythmia, coronary artery disease,
      congenital heart disease, previous myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, previous
      ICD implantation, anemia (i.e. Hb &lt;9 g/dl), lowest systolic blood pressure in the ED &lt;90
      mmHg, sinus bradycardia (&lt;40 bpm), new (or previously unknown) left bundle branch block,
      bifascicular block plus a first degree AV block, Brugada ECG pattern, ECG changes consistent
      with acute ischemia, a new non-sinus rhythm, bifascicular block, and a prolonged QTc (&gt;450
      ms).

      Low and intermediate risk syncopes will be enrolled and evaluated using an integrated
      point-of-care sonographic approach (based on history, physical exam, electrocardiogram, and
      lung, focus cardiac and venous compression ultrasonography).

      After discharge, the risk of patient's syncope will be determined by reviewing the entire
      medical records.

        The study cohort is composed of all adult patients evaluate in the Emergency Department for
        syncope (defined as transient loss of consciousness due to global cerebral hypoperfusion
        characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery, and
        unrelated to trauma).

        After first evaluation, high risk syncope will be excluded.
