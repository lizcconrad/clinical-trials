      Statin is a preventive medicine for hepatitis B and hepatitis C which decreases the risk
      turning into liver cancer,however, the investigators also discovered that patients taking
      Statin live longer than patients who didn't take Statin in the incidence of liver cancer
      death cases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most liver cancer patients did not accept the cure as the main objective of the treatment
      after diagnosis because they choose alternative therapies palliative based, such as hepatic
      arterial chemoembolization, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      Statin is a preventive medicine for hepatitis B and hepatitis C which decreases the risk
      turning into liver cancer, yet the clinical effect for Statin is still unknown.

      In a previous study of 20,220 liver cancer patients in health care database, the
      investigators discovered that patients taking Statin live longer than patients who didn't
      take Statin in the incidence of liver cancer death cases.

      This study is a continuation of previous health insurance database studies for clinical
      trials to verify whether Statin could prolong disease-free survival role for palliative
      treatment of liver cancer.
