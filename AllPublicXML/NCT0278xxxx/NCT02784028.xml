  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The digestive cancer is the second cause of death worldwide. The presence of peritoneal
      carcinomatosis is common in the evolution of this type of cancer, as well as increased levels
      of ACE. This peritoneal carcinomatosis is often underestimated, this being due to low
      sensitivity detection means.

      In recent years, it has been shown that peritoneal carcinomatosis surgery as complete as
      possible associated with an intraperitoneal chemotherapy gave better results but still
      failures associated with the presence of microscopic residual tumors.

      The use of SGM -101 (developped by SURGIMAB SAS) allows surgeons to detect tumor nodules of
      small size very easily, in real-time, during surgery (shown in animals).

      The digestive cancer is the second cause of death worldwide. The presence of peritoneal

      failures associated with the presence of microscopic residual tumors.

      SGM -101 (developped by SURGIMAB SAS) is a fluorescent antibody that binds to ACE which is
      overespressed at the surface of tumor cells. The use of this fluorescent molecule allows
      surgeons to detect tumor nodules of small size very easily, in real-time, during surgery
      (shown in animals).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cytologically or histologic proven primary or recurrent digestive adenocarcinoma and
             eligible for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) procedure,

          2. Evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, presume resectable, assessed by imaging (CT
             scan (Computed Tomography Scanner) and / or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)) or
             during a previous abdominal surgery,,

          3. CEA positivity by immunohistochemistry on specimen of primary tumor or recurrence
             lesion, or circulating plasma CEA ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal range (ULN),

          4. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology group) &lt; 1

          5. Life expectancy of at least three months,

          6. AST (Aspartate AminoTransferase), ALT (Alanine AminoTransferase) and Alkaline
             Phosphatase levels ≤ 5 times the ULN,

          7. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the ULN, Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the ULN, absolute
             neutrophils counts ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L and hemoglobin ≥ 9
             g/dL,(red blood transfusion is allowed if needed),

          8. Patients aged over 18 years old,

          9. Patients affiliated to a French Social Security System,

         10. Signed informed consent (IC) obtained before any study specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score ≥ 3,

          2. Anticancer therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, concomitant
             systemic immune therapy, or any experimental therapy) within 4 weeks before inclusion,

          3. Known serious immune allergic history,

          4. Rate of circulating plasma CEA ≥ 300 ng / ml,

          5. Other malignancies either currently active or diagnosed in the last 5 years, except
             adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix and basal or squamous cell skin
             carcinoma.

             reproductive potential and who are sexually active must agree to have at least two
             methods of contraception for the duration of treatment (2 weeks before and 8 12 weeks
             after the administration of SGM-101) Male patients, must use an effective method of
             contraception (condom with spermicidal foam or gel; true abstinence; or vasectomy
