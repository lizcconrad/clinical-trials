      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and device performance of the Edwards
      Tricuspid Transcatheter Repair System in patients with clinically significant, symptomatic,
      tricuspid regurgitation who are at high surgical risk for standard tricuspid
      repair/replacement.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and device performance of the Edwards
      Tricuspid Transcatheter Repair System in patients with clinically significant, symptomatic,
      tricuspid regurgitation who are at high surgical risk for standard tricuspid
      repair/replacement. The study is a multi-center, international, prospective, single arm,
      safety study. Enrolled subjects will be assessed for clinical follow-up at 1 month, 6 months,
      1 year and annually for 3 years post implant procedure.

          3. Clinically significant, symptomatic (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional
             Class II or greater), tricuspid regurgitation (per applicable guidelines) requiring
