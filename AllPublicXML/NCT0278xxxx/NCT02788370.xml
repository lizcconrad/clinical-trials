    <textblock>
      It is known that all most structures and physiological functions deteriorate with age,
      leading to decrease exercise performance, functional decline and gradual decrease of physical
      activity in aging.

      The most essential change of respiratory physiology are: dilatation of alveoli, enlargement
      of air space, decrease gas exchange surface area, loss of supporting tissue for distal airway
      (senile emphysema), decrees of chest wall compliance and decrease of respiratory muscle
      strength. These changes leading to decrease lung elastic recoil, increase residual volume and
      functional capacity, and increase work of breathing at rest. In addition, such changes affect
      respiratory function, especially dynamic hyperinflation (DH) development which could be one
      of the factors relate to dyspnea during exercise in aging Positive expiratory pressure (PEP)
      therapy for DH treatment during exercise was reported in several studies.

      It is possible that PEP breathing may improve cardiopulmonary response to exercise in older
      people.
