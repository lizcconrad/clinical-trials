      The promotion of physical activity (PA) is paramount to public health, yet interventions in
      the social cognitive tradition have yielded negligible improvements. Two reasons for these
      results may be the over reliance on intention as the proximal determinant of behaviour and a
      lack of consideration of implicit/automatic determinants of PA. The purpose of this study was
      to apply Multi-Process Action Control (M-PAC), a framework centered on PA
      intention-translation and the gradual building of habit to examine PA change using a two-arm
      parallel design, randomized controlled trial.

      Background: Two of the most prominent limitations of traditional social cognitive models used
      to understand moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are the gap between intention and
      behaviour and the lack of consideration of implicit processes in behavioural enactment. Thus,
      new models are now being examined that attempt to consider these potential limitations.
      Multi-Process Action Control (M-PAC) is one such attempt to build a more comprehensive
      schematic, whereby intention is established via the means of constructs from traditional
      social cognitive theories (i.e., outcome expectations, perceived capability), but the success
      of translating this intention to behaviour depends on behavioural-regulation (self-regulatory
      tactics) (BR), affective judgments (expected pleasure) (AJ) and opportunity (time, access).
      Over time, M-PAC proposes that habit (stimulus -behaviour bonds) and identity (role-behaviour
      bonds) develop from performing the behaviour and largely contribute to the maintenance of PA.

      Aim: The purpose of this study was to conduct at two-arm parallel design, RCT to determine if
      the M-PAC experimental group would demonstrate greater change in PA and post-intention
      constructs across time.

      Methods: Participants (n=94) were inactive new gym members and were randomized into a control
      or M-PAC experimental group. The experimental group attended a workshop and received a
      booster phone call follow-up at week four. Measures for both groups included accelerometry
      and M-PAC at baseline and at week eight.

    <measure>Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (self report, survey question)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four, week eight</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Report Behavioral Automaticity Index (SRBAI) was used to assess preparatory habit. The SRBAI consists of 4 items on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 being strongly disagree to 5 being strongly agree. The question stem stated ''When I prepare to exerciseâ€¦'' which was then followed by four items on the scale: ''I do it without having to consciously remember'', ''I do it automatically'', ''I do it without thinking'', and ''I start before I realize I am doing it''.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Environmental Cues (self report, survey question)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four, week eight</time_frame>
    <description>The following item was used to assess if participants implemented the use of cues: &quot;I use cues at home to remind me to exercise (e.g. placing a water bottle on my desk or gym clothes on the bed). The item was rated on a five point Likert scale which ranged from &quot;1=strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;5= strongly agree&quot;.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal Consistency (self report, survey question)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four, week eight</time_frame>
    <description>The item was worded &quot;How consistently do you exercise at the same time each day? (e.g., exercising every morning at 7 am, or exercising daily after supper)&quot;. The question was asked on a five point Likert scale which range from &quot;1=not consistent at all&quot; to &quot;5=very consistent&quot;.</description>
