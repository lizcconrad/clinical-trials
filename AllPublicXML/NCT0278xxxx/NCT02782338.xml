      Objective: To examine the effect of topical Voltaren-Ophtha 0.1% eye drops after cataract
      surgery on INR levels ( international normalized ratio) in patients taking warfarin.

      Methods: A prospective study. The study population will include approximately 100 patients,
      taking warfarin and that are candidates for cataract surgery. These patients will continue
      their warfarin therapy as usual and at the same dose, before and after the operation.

      INR levels (international normalized ratio) will be checked once a week while taking Voltaren
      eye drops as is customary after cataract surgery.
