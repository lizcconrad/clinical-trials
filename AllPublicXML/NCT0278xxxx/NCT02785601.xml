      Trial I single dose (75mg and 150mg), fasting or postprandial comparative pharmacokinetics of
      trazodone hydrochloride prolonged-release tablets and ordinary formulation; 16 patients
      (males and females, half and half).

      Trial is a 4-period, 4 cross (4x4) Williams crossover design, screened 16 subjects (half
      males and half females) were randomly divided into four groups (I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4), each 2
      men and 2 women, give the following four different crossover treatments:

      (A) postprandial single oral dose of trazodone hydrochloride prolonged-release tablets 75 mg;
      (B) postprandial single oral dose of trazodone hydrochloride prolonged-release tablets 150
      mg; (C) fasting single oral dose of trazodone hydrochloride prolonged-release tablets 150 mg;
      (D) postprandial single oral trazodone hydrochloride tablets 150mg (50mg for 3 times) Time
      for drug administration is around 8:00am. Wash-out period is 7 days. Blood sampling will be
      performed before (0h) and after administration each dose group 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0,
