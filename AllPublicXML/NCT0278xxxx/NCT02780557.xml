  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to test whether giving parents advice about book reading is
      effective in promoting language learning for infants from a range of socio-economic
      backgrounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children from disadvantaged families tend to have limited language skills compared to their
      advantaged peers. While many factors contribute to language ability, two aspects of the early
      caregiving environment are known to be correlated with child language outcomes 1)
      caregiver-child book reading and 2) caregiver contingent talk. Contingent talk refers to a
      style of communication whereby the caregiver talks about what is in their infant's current
      focus of attention. This style of talking can be facilitated when parents read books with
      their babies. The aim of this research is to establish whether asking parents to engage in
      contingent talk in the context of book reading promotes vocabulary learning. This study will
      compare the effects of an intervention to promote contingent talk against a control where
      parents are given books but not given any training in how to read them in a contingent
      manner. The study will include children from socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged
      families.

    <measure>Infant Real Time Language Understanding: Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Infants' real-time comprehension of familiar words will be assessed at 15 months using the looking-while-listening (LWL) procedure (Fernald et al., 2008). Infants will sit in front of a computer screen with a picture on either side of it (e.g., a bottle and a shoe). We will measure the accuracy with which they look to the correct picture upon hearing a word that describes it.</description>

    <description>Caregivers will be provided with 6 picture books. They will be trained to use contingent talk when looking at picture books with their infants. They will be asked to spend 10 mintues each day engaging in contingent talk while looking at picture books. The intervention will run for 4 months. Parents will be asked to keep a daily reading diary.</description>
