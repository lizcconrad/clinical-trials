  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with at least two teeth with dentinal hypersensitivity and who meet the study
      criteria will be enrolled onto this double blind, randomised, parallel, controlled clinical
      trial. After enrolment, suitable subjects will use a fluoride toothpaste for 4 weeks (wash
      out period). Baseline dentine hypersensitivity assessments will be conducted using tactile
      stimuli, air blast, and VAS methods. Tactile methods of assessment will include use of the
      Yeaple Probe and the Jay Sensitivity Sensor probe. Air blast assessments will be conducted
      using the Schiff cold air sensitivity scale. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP)
      questionnaire will be completed at four defined time points during the study. The baseline
      assessments will be conducted on the two teeth identified during the screening visit.

      On completion of the baseline assessments, subjects will be randomly assigned to product.
      Dentinal hypersensitivity assessments will be repeated after 18, 28 and 56 days of product
      use.
