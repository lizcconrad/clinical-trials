  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After stroke, individuals often have persistent difficulty using the arm and hand in everyday
      functional tasks that reduces quality of life. Currently available rehabilitation techniques
      are not adequate and new protocols are needed that are based on an understanding of how brain
      regions work together to produce skilled movement. This research project aims to improve our
      understanding of how the brain controls movement after stroke and determine whether a period
      of motor practice that targets specific brain regions through the addition of action
      selection demands leads to improved arm function. We hypothesize that arm motor function and
      the ability to efficiently activate the action selection motor circuit during movement will
      improve after training.

      Rehabilitation of arm impairment after stroke includes the repetitive practice of functional
      tasks. In healthy adults, planning plays a vital role in the control of skilled movement,
      however, the behavioral and neural correlates of planning have largely been unexplored in
      individuals recovering from stroke. Action selection is an important motor planning process
      that engages dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in controls. While PMd activation is a commonly
      reported neural correlate of motor recovery after stroke, the role of PMd in action selection
      and motor training are not known. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the
      effect of training that includes action selection demands on the behavioral and neural
      correlates of movement after stroke. Thirty-eight individuals in the chronic phase of stroke
      will be recruited. After completion of clinical measures of impairment and function, all
      participants with stroke will complete a motor action selection task and functional MRI
      followed by arm training. Arm training will consist of three weeks (15 sessions) of arm motor
      training (1.5 hours per session) that includes action selection demands on movement.
      Follow-up clinical testing will occur at the end of treatment and three weeks later.

    <description>Treatment occurs in 1.5 hour sessions, 5 times a week for 3 weeks. In each treatment session, you will practice functional tasks with your weaker arm and hand. Additionally, you will be given cues on a computer screen that dictate your movement response (action selection). Practice will be scaled to match your current level of function and progressed over time as able.</description>
