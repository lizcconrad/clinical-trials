  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the comparative effectiveness of
      obesity counseling as covered by CMS in improving weight loss for adults either with or at
      high risk of type 2 diabetes. CMS and most insurers now include obesity screening and
      counseling benefits, with no cost sharing to patients. Since overweight patients are at
      highest risk for diabetes, improved weight management services could prevent diabetes and its
      negative health outcomes. Beneficiaries with obesity are eligible for up to 20 face-to-face
      visits for weight counseling in the primary care setting. We propose comparing weight and
      diabetes outcomes in three states using EHR and claims data before and after this policy was
      implemented by leveraging the novel infrastructure of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
      Institute-funded PaTH Clinical Data Research Network.

      Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of universal preventive service coverage for obesity screening and
      counseling on weight loss, diabetes incidence, and diabetes outcomes, in patients with
      diabetes or at high risk for diabetes (defined by body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25). We will
      determine how the annual probability of receiving obesity and/or nutritional counseling (as
      defined by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code) changed pre- and post-policy across all
      insurers in a cohort of patients with diabetes and at high risk for diabetes. We hypothesize
      that individual patients are more likely to receive counseling following coverage
      implementation. Further, we hypothesize that patients who receive a greater number of
      face-to-face visits will have greater weight loss compared to those who receive fewer visits.

      Aim 2: Compare patient weight loss and diabetes-related outcomes among those who receive
      obesity screening and counseling to those who do not, following implementation of preventive
      service coverage. We will examine post-policy impact of obesity screening and counseling in a
      cohort of patients with diabetes and at high risk for diabetes. Specific outcomes to be
      examined include weight loss, diabetes incidence, and diabetes outcomes (including hemoglobin
      A1c, controlled blood pressure, use of a statin medication). Further, we will determine
      patient characteristics, including demographics (age, race/ethnicity, rurality), and practice
      characteristics, including provider type, and their impact on receiving/providing obesity
      screening and counseling. Understanding patient and practice characteristics most likely to
      engage in obesity counseling can identify best practices and inform how to increase
      engagement by both patients and providers.

        Data will be collected through the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a
        partnership of six academic health systems (Penn State Hershey Medical Center, University
        of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Temple Health System, Johns Hopkins Health System, University
        of Utah and Geisinger Health System) creating an electronic health record (EHR)-based data
