  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: It is essential to understand how to prevent and treat the epidemic of
      depression. Several studies have reported the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the urban
      population in China, but there is a lack of information regarding intervention for depression
      in rural left behind old elderly people.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (MBAT)
      Intervention on reducing depressive symptoms in rural left behind elderly people.

      Methods: 80 rural left behind elderly people who had a Geriatric Depression Scale(GDS) score
      between 11 and 25 will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention (n=40) and
      control group(n=40). The intervention group will be received both MBAT and treatment-as-usual
      for 8 weeks while the control group received treatment-as-usual. Both groups will be assessed
      with the GDS, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) at
      baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3 months post-intervention.

      Significance: This is the first time BA psychotherapy will be used in China.The current study
      will develop an intention model based on the traditional BA and CBT. The recurrence and
      seriousness of depression symptoms may be reduced by the intervention program. We hope that
      MBAT in clients will provide a direction for the management of mental health in rural
      left-behind elders..

    <description>Depression symptoms will be measured using the validated Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale. The scale consists of 30 questions, used to screen for depressive symptoms in community-dwelling elderly to evaluate the effect of reminiscence on depressive symptoms.Questions ask elderly participants to describe feelings over the past week and responses are &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. Its ease of use makes it suitable for community studies. Scores from 0 to 10 are regarded as normal, 11-20 as mild depression, 21-25 as moderate depression, and 26-30 as severe depression. The internal consistency reliability of the scale was 0.89 and test-retest reliability was 0.85; criterion related validity was 0.95, and parallel validity using the center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was 0.96 in Chinese participants (Wang,1999).</description>

    <description>The modified model will be provided weekly to four groups for intervention, each group including about 10 participants with 1 facilitator for a period of 8 weeks after the baseline survey and general introduction. Each of the 8-week sessions will last for 2 hours. Groups 1 to 4 will have sessions on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays respectively; four groups will meet on the same day of the week for all 8 weeks. The scheduling and timing of intervention provide consistency of scheduling for participants.</description>

    <description>For the control group, participants will receive regular physical examinations and education by village doctors weekly during the 8 week intervention.The weekly visits for every old people whose age above 65 by country doctors are not arranged by our study, it is the country doctors‟ routine work by government health policy. This study was permitted by the local community health center, the director with specific responsibility will inform all country doctors to support our study.</description>
