  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized
      world. Abnormalities in the coagulation system, causing a hypercoagulable state, are a known
      risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis. The contact activation system is part of the
      coagulation system and consists of four proteins: coagulation factor XII (FXII), FXI,
      prekallikrein and high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK). Clinical studies indicate an
      important role for the contact activation system on the risk of arterial thrombosis.
      Furthermore, there is substantial evidence from mouse studies that FXII and FXI participate
      in the formation and stability of thrombi. In vitro studies show that collagen, present in
      the vascular wall, is able to activate FXII and hereby stimulate thrombin formation and
      potentiate the formation of platelet-fibrin thrombi and FXIIa is able to change the structure
      of fibrin clots by binding to fibrin(ogen) and by generation of additional thrombin. However,
      the contact system also participates in the process of fibrinolysis, which degrades thrombi.

      The investigators would like to investigate the contribution of the contact activation system
      to the formation of thrombi. The formation of a thrombus within the vascular bed is the main
      cause for occlusion of an artery or vein, which can lead to an infarct such as a heart
      attack. Due to the other functions of the contact system it is important to fully understand
      how the contact system contributes to thrombus formation, before it can be used as a target
      in the treatment of arterial thrombosis. The aim of this study is to determine the
      contribution of the proteins of the contact system, mainly FXII and FXI, in the platelet
      mediated formation and degradation of thrombi. This will be studied in flow models
      (perfusion-flow model and Chandler loop), in a static model (ROTEM®) and using thrombin
      generation assay.
