      The purpose of this study has 2 aims:

      Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting and retaining adults at high risk of
      colorectal cancer to a physical activity intervention trial. Investigators hypothesize that
      it will be possible to recruit and retain this patient population to a physical activity
      intervention trial.

      Aim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of collecting, processing, storing stool samples and
      analyzing the gut microbiome data. Investigators hypothesize that all of these steps are
      feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. and
      is the third most common cancer in men and women. CRC risk factors include genetic
      predisposition, host factors and modifiable lifestyle behaviors (e.g., diet, physical
      activity, obesity). There are very limited data on the differences in the gut microbiota
      among populations at different levels of CRC risk, as well as the effects of behavioral
      interventions to alter the gut microbiome.
