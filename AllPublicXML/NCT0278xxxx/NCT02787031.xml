  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use health administrative data to examine the variation of anesthesia
      type for hip fracture surgery, as well as sources of variation and predictors of variation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the sources of variance in utilization of neuraxial anesthesia the investigators
      will use multilevel multivariable modeling strategies. This will allow identification of
      sources of variation (hospital, vs physician, vs patient characteristics), as well as
      identification of independent predictors of neuraxial use at each of these three levels.

      The investigators will also evaluate the independent association of hospital level variation
      in neuraxial use on our outcomes of interest using multilevel multivariable regression.
