  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing vocal cord surgery (phonosurgery) are often prescribed voice rest
      postoperatively. However, no clinical trials have ever been conducted to ascertain the
      efficacy of using voice rest and its impact on functional voice outcomes. The purpose of this
      randomized-clinical trial is to determine if the prescription of voice rest has an impact on
      voice outcomes following phonosurgery.

      The study will seek to determine if a 7-day period of absolute voice rest alters
      voice-related quality of life following phonosurgery
