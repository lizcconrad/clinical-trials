  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of recurrent HCC is urgent and several treatments have been developed .Repeat
      hepatectomy is considered to be the first choice for recurrent HCC.

      Unfortunately, repeated open hepatectomy can be performed only in a small proportion of
      patients due to inadequate liver function reserve, widespread recurrence or high
      invasiveness. Given that recurrent tumors are usually detected at small size during follow-up
      after initial surgery, radiofreqency ablation (RFA), which is less invasive, may be locally
      curative and causes minimal damage to liver function reserve,has been widely used. However,
      the re-recurrence rate after RFA is more than 50%,and the recurrence-free survival is less
      than 20%. Recently, satisfactory short- and long-term oncological outcomes have been reported
      for laparoscopic surgery (LS) for the treatment for primary HCC with cirrhosis. Some single
      center pilot studies reported that LS may, compared with open surgery, improve the prognosis
      of HCC with less blood loss and shorter hospital stay. LS was initially considered not
      suitable for recurrent HCC due to postoperative adhesions that might make laparoscopic
      surgical procedure more difficult and less safe. With improvement in technique and
      experience, recent studies showed that LS for recurrent HCC in cirrhotic patients is a safe
      and feasible procedure with good short-term outcomes. However, thus far, no study has been
      performed to evaluate the long-term oncological outcomes of LS for recurrent HCC, and compare
      those results to that for RFA. To clarify these issues, a multicenter retrospective
      comparative study by using propensity score matching method that included a large consecutive
      series of patients with recurrent HCC within Milan criteria, who underwent LS or RFA, was
      performed.

    <description>For LS,the patient was usually placed in the lithotomy position. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained at a pressure between 12 and 14 mmHg.Intra-operative ultrasonography was performed routinely. Large bile duct branches or vessels were clipped before division and minor hemostasis was carried out using bipolar diathermy. Large hepatic vein branches were divided by endovascular staplers. The Pringle maneuver was not used. Wedge resection, segmentectomy or subsegmentectomy was performed. The surgeon aimed to achieve a 1.0-cm safety margin during the liver resection.</description>

    <description>For LS, the patient was usually placed in the lithotomy position. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained at a pressure between 12 and 14 mmHg. Three to 4 working ports sized between 5 mm and 12 mm were used . Intra-operative ultrasonography was performed routinely. Parenchymal transection was performed using a Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA, Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA). Large bile duct branches or vessels were clipped before division and minor hemostasis was carried out using bipolar diathermy. Large hepatic vein branches were divided by endovascular staplers. A 1.0-cm safety margin was planed to get during the liver resection.</description>

    <description>RFA was performed according to the Guidelines of Radiofrequency Ablation Therapy for Liver Cancer: Chinese Expert Consensus Statement issued by the Chinese Society of Liver Cancer and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology RFA was performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. RFA was performed by using a commercially available Cool-tipTM RFA system (Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA), or a RF 2000 system (Radio-Therapeutics Mountain View, CA). Grounding was achieved by attaching 2 pads to the patient's back or legs.</description>
