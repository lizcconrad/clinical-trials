  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate effectiveness and safety of the
      NeuroForm Atlas stent system for use in patients requiring stent assisted intracranial
      aneurysm treatment.

      The study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm post market follow-up
      registry designed to demonstrate the potential treatment of intracranial, saccular aneurysms
      with the Next Generation Neuroform Stent System. The study will evaluate the permanent
      morbidity and mortality rate within the 12 to 16 months following the procedure. The study
      will evaluate as well the percent occlusion of the treated target lesion on angiography in
      the absence of retreatment, or parent artery stenosis at the target location at 12 to 16
      months. Subjects with documented saccular aneurysms arising from a parent artery may
      potentially benefit from stent assisted coiling, provided they meet the other eligibility
      criteria.

        Registration of patients who are willing to participate in this ATLAS PMCF registry and
        assuming they meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and provided written informed
        consent should be recorded prior to implantation of the Neuroform Atlas Stent to ensure
        data capture on all enrolled and treated patients in this post-market evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has an intracranial aneurysm for which an endovascular treatment requiring
             stent assisted intracranial aneurysm coiling has been decided by the site investigator

          2. Patient or legal representative is willing and able to provide written informed
             consent

          3. Patient is willing able to comply with scheduled visits and examinations per protocol
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient that is younger than 18 years old at the time of entry into the study

          2. Patient with mRS &gt; 3

          3. Patient has a saccular ruptured aneurysm &lt; 3 months

          4. Patient has a fusiform aneurysm

          5. Treatment of several aneurysms during the same procedure, except adjacent aneurysms
             treated with the same stent

          6. Planned treatment of other aneurysm in the same vascular territory within the study
             time period

          7. Patient with severe vasospasm that does not respond to pharmacological therapy

          8. Aneurysm associated with an arteriovenous malformation, or any other lesion that could
             lead to hemorrhagic complications

          9. Pregnant woman or child feeding

         10. Any condition which will not allow the patient to comply with the necessary follow-up
             for this study (medical condition, patient leaving abroad)

         11. Patient with confirmed allergy to nickel titanium (Nitinol)

         12. Patient in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is contraindicate

         13. Patient for whom angiography and other examinations show that access to the target
             cerebral aneurysm by the stent may be impossible because of anatomical features

         14. Patient for whom angiography and MRA/MRI is contraindicated

         15. Patient with target aneurysm previously treated with a stent -
