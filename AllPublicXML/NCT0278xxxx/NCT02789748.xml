  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at quantifying the performance of kinesthetic stimulation to reduce the
      burden of obstructive sleep apneas and hypopneas.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe sleep apnea patients will undergo two polysomnographies (PSG), one with kinesthetic
      stimulation triggered on the detection of apneas and hypopneas (treated night ) and the other
      without kinesthetic stimulation (non-treated night ). Comparison of apnea and hypopnea
      indices (AHI) and of oxygen saturation between the treated and non-treated night will be
      taken as indicators to quantify the performance of this potential new therapy.

          -  Patient with severe obstructive apnea syndrome diagnosed on polysomnography or
             polygraphy performed less than 6 months ago with (AHI &gt; 30/h and 80% of obstructive
             events) and (ODI 4% &gt; 20 or time with SaO2 below 90% &gt; 5%).

          -  Patient free from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment or any other
             SAS treatment for at least 3 months
