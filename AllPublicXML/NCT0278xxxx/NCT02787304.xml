    <measure>Number of Subjects Achieving Binary Response on Liver Histology Between Volixibat (SHP626) and Placebo at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Binary response indicating (yes/no) whether a subject responded at week 48 with a reduction of at least 2 points, without worsening of fibrosis, from baseline nonalcoholic fatty Liver disease (NAFLD) activity Score (NAS). The NAS grades NAFLD on liver biopsy based on the individual scoring of steatosis, inflammation and ballooning. The NAS is assessed on a scale of 0 to 8 with higher scores indicating more severe disease and lower scores indicating less severe disease. NAS is obtained by adding steatosis(assessed on a scale of 0 to 3), inflammation (assessed on a scale of 0 to 3) and ballooning (assessed on a scale of 0 to 2).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 48 on Liver Histology</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change in liver histology will be measured by the individual NAS components (ballooning, inflammation, steatosis). The NAS grades NAFLD on liver biopsy based on the individual scoring of steatosis, inflammation and ballooning.

NAS is obtained by adding steatosis (assessed on a scale of 0 to 3), inflammation (assessed on a scale of 0 to 3) and ballooning (assessed on a scale of 0 to 2).</description>
