  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Predictive biomarkers are needed to identify those patients with higher risk of recurrence
      after surgery for colon cancer with curative intent. Our main objective is to determine a
      metabolite profile in blood plasma from patients operated from colorectal cancer that can be
      associated with the oncologic outcome and be validated as predictive biomarkers in future
      studies. A secondary objective is to study the glycolytic metabolism of colon cancer cell
      lines treated with plasma samples from the same patients. In particular, to validate the
      increased utilization of lactate by tumor cells as a metabolic substrate using postoperative
      human samples.

      Patients with colorectal cancer that have undergone surgical resection will be included.
      Plasma samples will be obtained before surgery and the 4th day and the 3rd, 6th, 12th, and
      18th months after surgery. Metabolic profiles in plasma samples will be determined using a
      kit that allows the quantification of 180 metabolites by mass spectrometry.

      A clinical follow up will be maintained for at least 2 years to identify tumor recurrences.

      Up to 30-40% of patients operated from colorectal cancer display tumor recurrence. Predictive
      biomarkers are needed to identify those patients with higher risk of recurrence. Our main
      objective is to determine a metabolite profile in blood plasma from patients operated from
      colorectal cancer that can be associated with the oncologic outcome and be validated as
      prognostic biomarkers in future studies. A secondary objective is to study the glycolytic
      metabolism of colon cancer cell lines treated with plasma samples from the same patients. In
      particular, to validate the increased utilization of lactate by tumor cells as a metabolic
      substrate using postoperative human samples, as it was previously observed by us in vitro
      using an inflammatory environment in conditions of hypoxia and lack of glucose. Patients with
      colorectal cancer that have undergone surgical resection will be included. Plasma samples
      will be obtained before surgery and the 4th day and the 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 18th months after
      surgery. Metabolic profiles in plasma samples will be determined using a kit that allows the
      quantification of 180 metabolites by mass spectrometry. Cellular assays will be performed on
      the SW620 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines. Cells will be treated with plasma samples and
      the concentration of lactate and other metabolites will be analyzed in the medium
      supernatants. A clinical follow up will be maintained for at least 2 years to identify tumor
      recurrences.
