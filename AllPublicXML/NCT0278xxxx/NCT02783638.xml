    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of Pregabalin controlled release formulation
      after multiple dosing as compared to Pregabalin immediate release formulation and the food
      effect of high fat diet after single dosing in healthy male volunteers.

      Cohort 1 study is to assess the PK of Pregabalin controlled release formulation as compared
      to Pregabalin immediate release formulation. Cohort 1 subjects will be admitted to the clinic
      at Day 1. All subjects will receive multiple dosing for three days of YHD1119 or Pregabalin
      IR and will remain in the clinic until completion of all assessment on Day 19 including
      collection of PK sample. The treatment periods were separated by a washout period (10-17
      days).

      Cohort 2 study is to assess the food effect of high fat diet after single dosing. Cohort 2
      subjects will be admitted to the clinic at Day -1. All subjects will receive a single dose of
      YHD1119 and will remain in the clinic until completion of all assessment on Day 9 including
      collection of PK sample. The treatment periods were separated by a washout period (7-14
      days).
