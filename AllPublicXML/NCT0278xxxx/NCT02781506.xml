          -  Must have received at least one prior anti-angiogenic therapy in the advanced or
             metastatic setting. Prior cytokine therapy (eg, IL-2, IFN-α), vaccine therapy, or

             targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways.

          -  Previous treatment with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted agents (see above)
             are allowed provided that: Chemotherapy/Major surgery was administered &gt; 14 days
             before the start Nivolumab; Minor surgery, radiation, or any targeted agents were
             administered &gt; 7 days before the start of Nivolumab
