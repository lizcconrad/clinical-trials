  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine can prolong the duration of local anesthetics, but the effect of perineural
      dexmedetomidine on the potency of ropivacaine for brachial plexus blocks in pediatric
      patients has not been investigated. This study was designed to determine the effect of
      perineural dexmedetomidine on ropivacaine for brachial plexus blocks in pediatric patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      150 children scheduled for arm and forearm surgery underwent supraclavicle brachial plexus
      blocks with ropivacaine guided by ultrasound visualisation were randomly assigned to one of
      the five groups: Group A (perineural ropivacaine), Group B (ropivacaine plus 0.5 mcg/kg
      dexmedetomidine), Group C (ropivacaine plus 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine), Group D (ropivacaine
      plus 1.5mcg/kg dexmedetomidine) and Group E (ropivacaine plus 2 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine). The
      primary endpoint was the minimum local anesthetic concentration (MLAC), which was determined
      using the Dixon up-and-down method. The secondary endpoints were the duration of analgesia
      and sedation

    <description>For each patient, the target concentration of perineural ropivacaine was determined using the modified Dixon's up-and-down method starting with 0.20% in each group, varied with 0.1% as a step size. Increasing or decreasing the target concentration of perineural ropivacaine was determined by the response of the previous child in the same group. The response of each child was observed for 60 s after the skin incision and evaluated as 'successful' or 'unsuccessful.' 'Unsuccessful' was recorded when skin incision caused motor responses or change in hemodynamic parameters (heart rate and mean blood pressure) more than 20% of the preincision values. If the response was determined to be unsuccessful, the concentration of perineural ropivacaine given to the next patient would be increased by 0.1%. If it was successful, the concentration of caudal levobupivacaine given to the next patient would be decreased by 0.1%</description>

    <measure>Postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 hours after brachial plexus blocks</time_frame>
    <description>The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale or FLACC scale is a measurement used to assess pain for children between the ages of 2 months and 7 years or individuals that are unable to communicate their pain.
The scale is scored in a range of 0-10 with 0 representing no pain, 1-3 representing mild uncomfortable, 4-6 representing moderate pain, 7-10 representing high-level pain or/and uncomfort. The FLACC scale was evaluated at 6 and 12 hours postoperatively, and scale of â‰¥4 points was regarded as an inadequate analgesia and was managed with 10 mg/kg of ibuprofen by mouth every 6 h as required</description>

    <time_frame>up to 12 hours after brachial plexus blocks</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation status was evaluated by a attending anesthesiologists with a 6-point sedation scale, which was modified from the Modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAA/S). The MOAA/S scale was evaluated at 6 and 12 hours postoperatively

    <description>Children scheduled for arm and forearm surgery underwent supraclavicle brachial plexus blocks with ropivacaine and dexmedetomidine guided by ultrasound visualisation were randomly assigned five groups: Group A (perineural ropivacaine), Group B (ropivacaine plus 0.5 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine), Group C (ropivacaine plus 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine), Group D (ropivacaine plus 1.5mcg/kg dexmedetomidine) and Group E (ropivacaine plus 2 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine). In each group, children received a certain concentration of ropivacaine which adjusted by the &quot;Dixon up-and-down method for supraclavicle brachial plexus. The first child received 0.2% ropivacaine , and the concentration of ropivacaine varied by 0.1% according to the up-and-down method. The primary endpoint was the minimum local anesthetic concentration (MLAC).</description>
