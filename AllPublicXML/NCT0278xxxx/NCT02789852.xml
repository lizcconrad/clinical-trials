      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of using a night orthosis for II and III or fingers
      of the dominant hand in women diagnosed with symptomatic osteoarthritis compared to a control
      group.

      Methods: Through a randomized controlled clinical trial with blind assessment and follow-up
      of six months. Fifty-Two participants were randomized into two groups: group orthosis and
      control, and made a night orthosis II and or III fingers, thermoplastic will be used as a
      treatment for participants orthosis group. The participants underwent four evaluations at
      time 0, 45 days, 90 days and 180 days after its inclusion in the study. The variables studied
      were: the visual analog scale of pain, grip and pinch strength, questionnaires Cochin and
      Australian/Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index and functional Pick-up test.
