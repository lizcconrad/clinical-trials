      This clinical study will collect fresh samples and perform laboratory testing on fresh and
      archived samples as described in the protocol.

      The Idylla console, instrument, and Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel cartridge constitute the
      Idylla respiratory diagnostic system. The IFV-RSV Panel is an in vitro PCR-based molecular
      diagnostic assay for the simultaneous qualitative detection of nucleic acids for Influenza A
      (including H1, 2009 H1N1, H275Y mutation of 2009 H1N1, H3), Influenza B, and Respiratory
      Syncytial Virus (RSV) (A and B) on nasal swab (NS) direct to cartridge or nasopharyngeal
      swabs (NP) in viral transport media (VTM) in adults, adolescents, and children.

      This clinical study will collect data in support of regulatory submission and the indications
      for use of the IFV-RSV panel and the Idylla diagnostic system. This protocol will demonstrate
      that the results of this assay, in conjunction with clinical information, may be used as an
      aid in the diagnosis of infection with Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV in persons having
      both a high and low risk for respiratory viral infection.

      During this study, participating sites will collect fresh samples, conduct a Reproducibility
      Study and test the fresh and previously collected frozen samples from individuals presenting
      with signs/symptoms of influenza like illness (ILI) and respiratory virus in accordance to
      the sample collection described in this protocol.

        All patients who present with ILI and/or signs/symptoms of RSV Infection who have met all
        the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are considered eligible to participate in
        the sample collection phase of this study. Specimens may be collected from subjects in
        either an inpatient or outpatient setting. An outpatient setting includes facilities such
        as emergency rooms associated with hospitals, large decentralized hospital/commercial labs,
        urgent cares and/or physician practices currently undertaking diagnostic testing. An
        inpatient setting is defined as a hospital where patients are admitted (does not include
        the emergency room associated with the hospital as this will be considered &quot;outpatient&quot;
        setting). Patient populations from the United States will be evaluated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Onset of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and/or Signs/Symptoms of RSV Infection was &gt; 5
             days prior to subject screening (Refer the definitions for detailed descriptions of
