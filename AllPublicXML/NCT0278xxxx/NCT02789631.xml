  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several factors have been associated with neck pain. Controversy exists regarding the degree
      of association between some of these factors and neck pain. Information regarding the degree
      of association of each factor to neck pain is needed for effective prevention and appropriate
      treatment strategies. The aim of this study is to investigate the association among
      musculoskeletal, sensorimotor factors and functional disability and occurrence of chronic
      nonspecific neck pain.
