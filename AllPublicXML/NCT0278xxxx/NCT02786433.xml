      Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of
      dopaminergic neurons that can cause some mobility limitations and it has association with
      quality of life (QOL) in patients with PD. Virtual reality (VR) has been used to treat of
      these patients Objective: Evaluate the functional capacity and QOL of individuals with PD
      using VR with X-Box Kinect®. Methods: Were selected 20 individuals classified as stages 1-3,
      aged 50-75 years. They were divided by lot into two groups (control and experimental) with
      ten patients in each. The group (CG) treated with exercises (conventional therapy) during
      five-week, with two sessions per week lasting 60 minutes, while the experimental group (EG)
      spent half the time with conventional physical therapy and other half of time in virtual
      rehabilitation (VR). Subjects were evaluated before and after treatment using the following
      scales: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire .

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - Evaluates disease progression</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Through the UPDRS disease progression was evaluated. Composed of 42 items, divided into four parts: mental activity, behavior and mood ; activities of daily living, motor operation and complications of drug therapy. For this study we evaluated the items : activities of daily living and motor examination on . The score for each item ranges from 0 to 4, and the maximum value indicates greater involvement by the disease and the minimum normality.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) - evaluates quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is a method that evaluates the quality of life (QOL) in patients with PD through a questionnaire self-explanatory and easy to understand. There are 39 items divided into eight categories: mobility; activities of daily living; emotional well-being; social difficulties of PD; social support; cognition; communication and bodily discomfort. The score ranges from 0 (no problem) to 100 (maximum problem), or a low score indicates a better perception of quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group only underwent conventional physiotherapy. Conventional therapy includes stretching and strengthening exercises with cane aid, leggings , elastic band and overball for upper and lower limbs , in addition to gait and balance training.
The intervention for the control group was applied for five weeks with sessions of 60 minutes twice a week</description>

    <description>The subjects in the experimental group underwent conventional physiotherapy (The same applied in the control group) associated with virtual reality , performed with the console X -Box Kinect® of Microsoft. Durante the achievement of the virtual reality practice, Kinect and Kinect games Adventures® Dance® demanded the anterior movements players -posterior and lateral , as well as jumps and squats to get rid of the game obstacles. They Kinect Dance® game were all required movements of the previous game more dance . The intervention lasted five weeks , with two weekly sessions lasting 30 minutes to conventional therapy and 30 minutes to virtual reality.</description>
