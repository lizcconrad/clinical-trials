      Metformin is known to increase 18F-FDG uptake in subjects using metformin in retrospective
      trials.

      In this study the researchers aim to investigate the influence of metformin (500 mg 1/day) on
      temperature in the colon, glucose uptake in the colon and energy expenditure in healthy lean
      (BMI &lt; 24kg/m2) or obese subjects (BMI&gt;28kg/m2). The investigators will measure 18F-FDG
      uptake in the colon, temperature in the colon, insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure
      before after using metformin.

      Obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) are health problems with a tremendous impact. Many
      attempts have been made to combat obesity and DM2, however, a breakthrough therapy is still
      lacking.

      Obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure.
      18F-fluorodeoxy-d-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT)
      pinpoint areas with high glucose turnover. Physiological 18F-FDG accumulation is frequently
      observed in the colon. Therefore, the colon might play an important role in increasing energy
      expenditure by consuming calories. However, the possibility of the colon as an energy
      dissipating tissue has not yet been explored. The colon could become an interesting new
      target of research to find a method to combat obesity.

      Metformin is one of the few drugs in the treatment of DM2 that is associated with moderate
      weight loss. Interestingly, patients using metformin show an increased 18F-FDG-uptake in the
      colon. Whether this higher uptake of glucose also cause an increase in core temperature
      and/or an increase in energy expenditure is not known. The cause for this increase in glucose
      uptake in the colon by metformin use is unknown. Also, it is unknown whether this increase in
      glucose uptake results in an increased energy expenditure and/or an increase in core body
      temperature.

      Objective: In this study the researchers aim to investigate the influence of metformin (500
      mg 1/day) on temperature in the colon, glucose uptake in the colon and energy expenditure in
      healthy lean (BMI &lt; 24kg/m2) or obese subjects (BMI&gt;28kg/m2). The investigators will measure
      18F-FDG uptake in the colon, temperature in the colon, insulin sensitivity and energy
      expenditure before after using metformin.
