  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether valproic acid in combination with fear
      memory reactivation is useful to enhance treatment stability of exposure therapy for specific
      phobia.

      -  There will be one screening visit (visit 1), one intervention visit (visit 2) and one
           follow-up visit (90 days after visit 2) (visit 3).

        -  On visit 2 all participants will undergo 30 min exposure therapy in virtual reality with
           pre-defined spider situations.

        -  Duration for an individual participant will be at most 15 weeks depending on the time
           passing between screening (visit 1) and intervention visit (visit 2).

        -  Change in phobic fear to baseline (visit 1) will be assessed on 90 day follow-up (visit
           3).

        -  Documentation of all study relevant source data of every study participant will be done
           by completing the study specific electronic case report forms (eCRF, SoSci Survey) and
           study specific case report forms on paper (Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and
           concomitant medication). Data in the eCRF can be validated for completeness and
           discrepancies automatically. An audit trail system maintains a record of initial entries
           and changes (reasons for changes, time and date of changes, user identification of entry
           and changes).

        -  Quality insurance will be done by an external site monitoring (including study progress,
           accuracy and completeness of eCRF, fulfillment of protocol requirements, applicable
           local authority regulations and investigator's obligations).

        -  Monitoring includes 100% of safety parameters, primary endpoints, informed consent
           documents and the Trial Master File on the Initiation Visit and on Close Out.

        -  Standard Operating Procedures to address study activities such as patient recruitment,
           informed consent, study interventions, data collection, data management, data analysis,
           and reporting for adverse events exist.
