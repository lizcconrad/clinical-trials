  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest compression, a key component of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), has a major role
      for survival of cardiac arrest patients. According to 2015 American heart association (AHA)
      guideline, rescuers provide high quality CPR to adult cardiac arrest patients including 5 to
      6 cm depth and 100 to 120 beat per minute rate chest compression.

      However, in CPR situation, chest compression depth and rate vary according to provider's
      muscle strength. In other words, the individual difference of the degree of physical activity
      will make the different result for CPR. So, the investigators hypothesize that the core
      muscles activation using physical fitness improves the quality of chest compression and the
      quality of CPR, eventually.

    <description>The subjects consist of 25 medical school students and interns had experienced in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) education.
2 instructors, they had physical therapy (PT) certificate, take an exam for subject's muscle strength of each muscle. After that time, subjects take a rest for 10 minutes. Researchers educate to subjects for high quality CPR including 5 to 6cm compression depth, 100 to 120 beat per minute (bpm) rate, complete chest recoil. Subjects perform chest compression to manikin with skill reporting system during 4min under guidance of 110 bpm metronome sound (first chest compression). Researchers record subject's chest compression depth and rate in 1st chest compression.</description>

    <description>The subjects consist of 25 medical school students and interns had experienced in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) education.
After 1st chest compression, subjects take a rest during an hour and carry out PT. PT consist of 30 second plank for 3 sets, 12 times bridge for 3 sets and 20 times leg extension for 3 sets. Subjects take a rest during 30 seconds between sets, 1 minute every 3 sets.
After PT completion, subjects take a rest during 10 minutes, and then perform 2nd chest compression in the same way of 1st chest compression. Researchers record subject's chest compression depth and rate in 2nd chest compression.</description>
