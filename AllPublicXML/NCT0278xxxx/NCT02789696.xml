  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome in patients with acromegaly is about 70%. It seems that
      comorbidities of arterial hypertension or type 2 diabetes are more severe in patients with
      acromegaly and sleep apnea syndrome. Besides sleep apnea syndrome associated to acromegaly
      gives rise to few symptoms, that explains it is under diagnosed. The mechanisms of the
      association are based on maxillofacial modifications linked to acromegaly, a thickening of
      soft tissues with deposits of glyco-aminoglycanes but probably also because of the associated
      obesity, of the potential existence of a goiter and a muscular dystrophy of the dilatative
      muscles of the pharynx.

      At present, no study clearly documented prevalence of acromegaly in a diagnostic consultation
      for sleep apnea syndrome.

      60 investigators will participate to this study. They will be chosen among those
      participating to the sleep observatory of the federation of pneumology (www.osfp.fr).

      All participating pneumologists would have to fill in the questionnaire (co-morbidities,
      concomitant treatments, biological analysis) directly online and also clinical signs and
      symptoms of acromegaly. A blood test for the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) dosage will
      be systematically prescribed to the patient. Pneumologists will have to include all
      consecutive patients presenting with sleep apnea syndrome suspicion.

      According to first IGF-1 results, patients may have to do a second blood test in a referenced
      laboratory to confirm the dosage.
