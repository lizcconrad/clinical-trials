    <description>This study is a multi-center open-label study to assess the tolerability of oral administration of SyB C-1101 twice daily from Day 1 to Day 21 in combination with subcutaneous administration or intravenous drip infusion of azacitidine once daily at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (body surface) for 7 days during the period between Day 8 and Day 16, and to estimate the recommended dose (RD) of C-1101.
SyB C-1101 will be administered at a daily dose of 560 mg or 840 mg in each of the 2 cohorts for a treatment period of 1 cycle for 28 days, including 21 days for SyB C-1101 treatment followed by 7 days of follow-up.</description>
