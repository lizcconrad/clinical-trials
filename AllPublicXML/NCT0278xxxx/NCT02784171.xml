    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab is a new type of drug for mesothelioma (immunotherapy). Laboratory tests show
      that this drug works by helping improve the body's immune response to help fight cancer.
      Pembrolizumab may help the immune system to recognize cancer cells and slow down the growth
      and/or spreading of cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug, pembrolizumab has on this
      type of cancer and if it can offer better results than standard pemetrexed and platinum-based
      chemotherapy alone. This study will also look at side effects and how the treatments impact
      quality of life

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignant pleural mesothelioma. Patients
             must be eligible to receive standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin and
             have no contraindications to standard chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have unresectable advanced and/or metastatic disease, incurable by
             standard therapies.

          -  All patients must have a tumour block from their primary or metastatic tumour
             available and consent to release the block/recently cut slides for correlative
             analyses (See Section 11.0) and the centre/pathologist must have agreed to the
             submission of the specimen(s).

          -  Presence of radiologically documented disease. At least one site of disease must be
             unidimensionally measurable as follows:

               -  CT scan (with slice thickness of ≤ 5 mm): ≥ 10 mm --&gt; longest diameter

               -  Physical exam (using calipers): ≥ 10 mm

               -  Lymph nodes by CT scan ≥ 15 mm --&gt; measured in short axis

          -  All radiology studies must be performed within 21 days prior to registration
             (exception: within 28 days if negative).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

        Previous Therapy

        Cytotoxic Chemotherapy:

          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy for any stage of
             advanced/metastatic disease.

          -  Patients who received previous (neo)adjuvant cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy
             must have received the last dose of chemotherapy at least 12 months before
             registration.

        Other Anti-Cancer Therapy:

          -  Patients may not have received targeted small molecule therapy, immunotherapies and
             viral therapies, biologic therapies and angiogenesis inhibitors for
             advanced/metastatic disease, or any prior immunotherapy for any stage of disease.

        Radiation:

          -  Patients may have had prior radiation therapy. A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed
             between the end of radiotherapy and registration onto the study. Radiation must have
             involved &lt; 30% of functioning bone marrow and there must be measurable disease outside
             the previously irradiated area (patients whose sole site of disease is in a previously
             irradiated area are ineligible UNLESS there is evidence of progression, or new lesions
             have been documented, in the irradiated field). (Exceptions may be made however, for
             low dose, palliative radiotherapy - please call the CCTG at 613-533-6430 PRIOR to
             registration if questions arise about the interpretation of this criterion). Patients
             must have recovered from any acute toxic effects from radiation prior to registration.

        Previous Surgery:

          -  Previous major surgery is permitted provided that it has been at least 28 days prior
             to patient registration and that wound healing has occurred.

          -  Lab Requirements:

               -  Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)

               -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 x ULN or Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and
             regulatory requirements.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment, response assessment and follow-up. Patients
             registered on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre.

          -  In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days
             of patient randomization.

          -  Women/men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use two highly effective
             contraceptive methods during the study and for six months after discontinuation.

          -  Patient must be able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the quality of
             life questionnaires.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy (at doses
             more than 10 mg prednisone or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive
             therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 3 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Must not have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study
             therapy.

          -  Patients with known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or
             carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may
             participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for
             at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic
             symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain
             metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.
             This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless
             of clinical stability.

          -  Patients who have experienced untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions
             and/or have symptomatic cardiac dysfunction (unstable angina, congestive heart
             failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year or cardiac ventricular
             arrhythmias requiring medication, history of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular
             conduction defects). Patients with a significant cardiac history, even if controlled,
             should have a LVEF ≥ 50%.

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies requiring concurrent anticancer therapy.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to pembrolizumab or any of the other chemotherapy agents.

          -  Patients receiving concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy or other
             investigational anti-cancer agents.

          -  Patients with serious illness or medical condition that would not permit the patient
             to be managed according to the protocol including, but not limited to:

               -  History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which would impair the
                  ability to obtain consent or limit compliance with study requirements.

               -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy; (including any patient known to have
                  active hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [note:
                  testing in asymptomatic patients is not required] or tuberculosis).

               -  Known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

               -  Any other medical conditions that might be aggravated by treatment.

               -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          -  Patients with evidence of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. (N.B.: All women of childbearing potential must have a
