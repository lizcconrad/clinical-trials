      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) in
      chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients to that in biliary disease patients, to determine whether
      CP patients in early clinical stage have a higher PEP incidence, and to identify the
      predictive and protective factors for PEP in chronic pancreatitis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP group) and biliary disease (BD group) in
      Changhai Hospital from January 2011 to May 2015 were conducted. Difference of PEP incidences
      between BD group and CP group, as well as between M-ANNHEIM subcategories were calculated by
      chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The predictive and protective factors for PEP were
      investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis.
