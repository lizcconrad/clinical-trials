  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the biliary ducts
      in the liver resulting in destruction and fibrosis. PSC is associated with increased serum
      levels of hyaluronan (HA), an extracellular matrix polymer known to drive inflammation in
      multiple other tissues and disease models. Inhibition of HA synthesis with oral hymecromone
      has been shown to prevent progression of autoimmunity in several animal models. This is a
      prospective, open-label, single-center, pilot safety study of hymecromone in adults 18 years
      of age or older diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis without evidence of hepatic
      fibrosis. Participants will be treated for 6 months with study drug. Safety and biomarkers of
      response will be monitored during therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis confirmed by liver biopsy and/or imaging
             study (MRI cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)

          -  Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and Alkaline phosphatase &gt;1.5 times the upper limit
             of normal

          -  If history of endoscopically confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, currently stable
             based on Harvey-Bradshaw index â‰¤ 2, normal inflammatory markers (ESR, C-reactive
             protein, and fecal calprotectin) and stable non-excluded medical therapy for at least
             6 months.

          -  Not currently taking vancomycin for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients on

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently receiving biologic therapies (i.e. infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, etc.)
             or steroid medications for inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Known allergy to hymecromone

          -  Established hepatic or biliary fibrosis

          -  Cholangiocarcinoma

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Physician concern that participant may not adhere to the study protocol, based on
             prior behavior
