      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenvatinib mesylate when given
      together with paclitaxel in treating patients with endometrial, ovarian, fallopian tube, or
      primary peritoneal cancer that has come back or grown. Lenvatinib mesylate may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking a protein needed for cell growth and may block the growth
      of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving lenvatinib
      mesylate and paclitaxel together may work better in treating patients with endometrial,
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of combination lenvatinib mesylate
      (lenvatinib) and weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent endometrial, epithelial
      ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of combination lenvatinib and weekly paclitaxel
      in patients with recurrent endometrial, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian
      tube carcinoma.

      II. To explore the objective antitumor activity (complete and partial response) of
      combination lenvatinib and weekly paclitaxel as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      III. To measure the progression free survival. IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
      combination paclitaxel and lenvatinib.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose -escalation study of lenvatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      lenvatinib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 3 months for 3 years.
