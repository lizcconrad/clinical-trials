      Background:

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. MS lesions can
      appear on the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans in many ways. Sometimes they light up
      from the outer edge and fill inward. This is called ring enhancement. Researchers think this
      type of lesion may not heal as well as others. Corticosteroids are the standard treatment to
      reduce symptoms of MS relapse. But there is no standard treatment for people with enhancing
      MS lesions without signs of MS relapse. Researchers want to see if a short-term high-dose
      course of corticosteroids helps heal those lesions.

      Objective:

      To study the effects of short-term high-dose corticosteroids on ring-enhancing MS.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 25 and older who:

        -  Have MS and a rim-enhancing lesion on a prior brain MRI

        -  Are enrolled in another NINDS protocol

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under another protocol

      Participants will be randomly assigned to get either no treatment or 3 days of treatment with
      a corticosteroid.

      Participants will have:

        -  1 baseline visit

        -  3 dosing visits over 3 days if assigned to get treatment. Participants will get
           methylprednisolone by IV each day. They will get medicine to protect their stomach.

        -  1 visit each month for 7 months

      Visits include medical history and physical exam. Participants will have blood and urine
      tests. Participants will also have neurological exams and MRIs. Participants lie on a table
      that slides into a cylinder. They are in the scanner 1.5-2 hours. They get a dye through a
      catheter: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.

      Objectives. The primary aim of this pilot study is to assess the effects of short-term,
      high-dose corticosteroid administration on the 12-week evolution of multiple sclerosis
      lesions with centripetal enhancement pattern on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in
      particular with respect to the development of a hypointense rim on 7-tesla phase images. In
      our prior work, the phase rim has been associated with persistent deleterious inflammation
      with poor repair and ongoing neurodegeneration within lesions.

      Study population. Up to 30 multiple sclerosis patients with asymptomatic contrast-enhancing
      lesions will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to either 3 days of
      corticosteroids (intravenous methylprednisolone a 1000 mg/day or oral prednisone at
      1250mg/day) or to no treatment.

      Design. Patients will undergo serial brain MRIs with gadolinium-based contrast agent on both
      3- and 7-tesla scanners over an approximate 25-week period. 3-tesla scans will be obtained at
      baseline and week 25. 7-tesla scans will be obtained at baseline and at weeks 13 and 25.
      Participants with one or more centripetal/rim-enhancing lesions at the baseline scan will be
      randomized and followed. Clinical evaluation and blood testing will be performed at baseline
      and weeks 13 and 25.

      Outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is the presence or absence, on the week-13
      7-tesla scan, of a hypointense phase rim in each of the lesions followed over time. Secondary
      outcome measures include the presence or absence of a hypointense phase rim at week 25, as
      well as the lesion volume and intralesional median R1 relaxation rate at weeks 13 and 25.
      From 3-tesla scans, we will measure the change in normalized intralesional proton
      density-weighted and T1-weighted signal, as well as the R1 relaxation rate, between baseline
      and week 25. We will also assess for the presence or absence of a hypointense phase at 3T.
      Additional exploratory outcome measures, including clinical and immunological assessments,
      will also be collected.
