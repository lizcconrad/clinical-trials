  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled parallel group clinical
      study. Following a screening period of up to 28 days, eligible subjects will be randomized to
      receive adjunct treatment to oral LD/DDI (Dopa Decarboxylase Inhibitor) with continuous
      subcutaneous infusion of ND0612 or matching placebo for 16 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group clinical study
      will be conducted in 150 subjects with idiopathic PD who are experiencing motor complications
      despite optimized anti-PD therapy.

      The study will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of continuous SC infusion
      (16 weeks) of ND0612 compared with placebo infusion. The treatment period will be comprised
      of a 4-week adjustment period during which time the ND0612 infusion dose will remain constant
      and the oral LD/DDI dose can be decreased or increased back up to the Baseline levels. All
      other anti-PD treatments must remain constant. During the maintenance period (Weeks 5 to 16)
      all anti-PD medication including the ND0612/placebo should remain constant.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female PD subjects of any race aged 30-80 years

          2. PD diagnosis consistent with the UK Brain Bank Criteria.

          3. Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale in &quot;ON&quot; state â‰¤3

          4. Subjects must experience motor fluctuations and experience an average of at least 2
             hours daily in the &quot;OFF&quot; state

          5. Taking at least 4 doses/day of IR LD/DDI (or at least 3 doses/day of Rytary) and
             taking, or having taken therapeutic doses of at least 2 other classes of anti-PD
             medications.

          6. Subjects must be on stable doses of all their anti-PD medications for at least 28 days
             before Baseline (Day 1).

          7. Subject and/or study partner must demonstrate ability to keep accurate diary entries
             of PD symptoms (&quot;ON-OFF&quot; diaries) with at least 75% concordance with the study rater
             by the end of the diary training session at the end of the screening period.

          8. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &gt;26.

          9. Female subjects must be surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             tubal ligation), postmenopausal (defined as cessation of menses for at least 1 year),
             or willing to practice a highly effective method of contraception.

          2. Psychosis or hallucinations in past 6 months.

             condition or laboratory abnormalities which, in the opinion of the Investigator or the
             EAC, represents a safety risk, makes the subject unsuitable for study entry or
             potentially unable to complete all aspects of the study.

          4. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities.

          5. Renal or liver dysfunction that may alter drug metabolism including Screening visit
             serum levels of creatinine &gt;1.3 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin &gt;2.5 mg/dL.

             Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at the Screening visit

          7. Any malignancy in the 5 years prior to randomization excluding basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ that have been successfully treated

          8. Use of prohibited medications as per protocol

             procedures), Duodopa/Duopa, or continuous dopaminergic or apomorphine infusion.
