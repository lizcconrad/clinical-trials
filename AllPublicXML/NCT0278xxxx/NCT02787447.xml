  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators postulated that the exploitation of the pro-immunogenic effects of
      radiotherapy with thymosin might result in abscopal responses among patients with metastatic
      cancer. The research is designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated
      with hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with thymosin alpha 1. An exploratory biomarker
      analysis in blood and tumor samples is also planned.
