    <textblock>
      This study will find the highest acceptable treatment dose of cord blood, culture expanded
      natural killer (NK) cells, a kind of immune cell, in patients with relapsed and/or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia.

      The NK cells will be given with chemotherapy and Recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2) to
      help the NK cells expand in the body. The safety of this treatment will be studied and
      researchers want to learn if NK cells will help in treating the AML.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated
      dose of PNK-007 in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The
      secondary objective is to explore the potential clinical efficacy by day 42.

      Treatment plan includes conditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. PNK-007 will
      administered IV followed by a total of six Recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2)
      injections to support the NK cells in the body.

      Subjects will be followed for up to 24 months.

             study.

          4. Subject has a body weight exceeding 120kg.

          5. Subject has aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or
             alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening.

          6. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening

             myeloid leukemia (AML), or excised and cured non-melanoma skin cancer, or cervical
             carcinoma in situ that was surgically ablated more than 5 years prior to PNK-007
             infusion.

         17. Subject has a history of severe asthma and is presently on chronic medications or has
             a history of other symptomatic pulmonary disease.

         18. Untreated chronic infection or treatment of any infection with systemic antibiotics
             within 2 weeks prior to dosing with PNK-007.

         19. Subject has any other organ dysfunction (CTCAE Version 4.03 Grade 3) that will
             interfere with the administration of the therapy according to this protocol.
