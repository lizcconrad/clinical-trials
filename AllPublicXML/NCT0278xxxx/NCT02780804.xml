    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat in treating pediatric
      patients with solid tumors that have come back or have not responded to treatment. Entinostat
      may block some of the enzymes needed for cell division and it may help to kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of entinostat
      administered as a single-agent, once weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid
      tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of entinostat administered as a single agent, once
      weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of entinostat in children with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of entinostat within the confines of a
      phase 1 study.

      II. To assess change in histone H3 and H4 acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) as a marker of the biologic activity of entinostat.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
