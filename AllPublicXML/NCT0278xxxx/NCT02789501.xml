  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter infections and dysfunctions are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      haemodialysis patients. According to the US Renal Data System, infection is the second
      leading cause of death in dialysis patients and the leading cause of catheter removal and
      morbidity in patients with end-stage renal disease.

      There is evidence that catheter lock solutions containing taurolidine reduce the risk of
      catheter related infections and improve catheter patency. Lock solutions have a local, but no
      systemic effect. In this study a taurolidine based lock regimen (TauroLock™-Hep500,
      Tauropharm, Waldbüttelbrunn, Germany, 2x/week and TauroLock™-U25.000, Tauropharm,
      Waldbüttelbrunn, Germany, 1x/ week) will be compared to 4% citrate (CitraFlow™ 4%, MedXL,
      Montreal, Canada, 3x/week) as standard lock solution.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate if a TauroLock™ based regimen to lock tunneled
      haemodialysis catheters has reducing effects on catheter related blood stream infections and
      catheter dysfunctions.

Parameters to assess catheter dysfunctions numerically are:
blood flow during dialysis - inadequate blood flow is defined as blood flow &lt; 200ml/min or &gt;30% less than the average of the previous 10 dialysis sessions
