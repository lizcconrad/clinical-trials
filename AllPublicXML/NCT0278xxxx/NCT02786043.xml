      The main objective is to evaluate the effect of Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride on
      clinical pharmacokinetic characteristics and its effect of clinical pharmacokinetic
      characteristics and safety on healthy Chinese subjects to provide a basis for market
      authorization registration

      This is a single group subject, open-label, self-controlled, 3 periods, multi-doses
      administration trial. 12 Healthy Chinese volunteers satisfying inclusion criteria were
      enrolled with equal number of male and female. Each subject goes through a 7-day Run-in
      period to eliminate the remaining L-carnitine like substance in the food to ensure the
      baseline level of endougenous L-Carnitien is stable；In period III, during the first 4
      days，all healthy subjects take oral Propionyl-L-Carnitine 1g twice daily; on day 5, all
      healthy subjects take oral Propionyl-L-Carnitine 1g during fasting.
