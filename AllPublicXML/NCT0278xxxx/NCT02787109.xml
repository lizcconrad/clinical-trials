      The present trial is a phase I first in human, double blind, parallel and placebo controlled
      trial of SSI's adjuvanted chlamydia vaccine CTH522: CTH522-CAF01 (CAF01 is an adjuvant
      system) and CTH522-Al(OH)3. The trial will be conducted at Imperial College Research site in
      the United Kingdom.

      Subjects are randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment groups in a ratio of
      3:3:1.

      This trial consisted of 10 visits and 5 telephonic interviews

             of the trial or any of the immunisation visits in this trial

          9. Is currently receiving treatment with immunosuppressive agents e.g. oral, inhaled,
             nasal or injected corticosteroids. (Topical steroids are allowed, unless applied to

         10. Is using an intrauterine device

         11. Has a condition which in the opinion of the investigator is not suitable for
