  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancies worldwide and the second
      leading cause of cancer-related death. Surgical resection is still the main radical approach
      for HCC, but the recurrence rate after hepatectomy is very high, which hampers the further
      improvement of prognosis of HCC patients. The conventional risk factors of recurrence
      including: huge tumor, multiple lesions, vessels invasion and tumor rupture. Recently, the
      microvessels invasion (MVI) has been recognized a novel risk factor of recurrence after
      hepatectomy. The investigators' previous study showed that the recurrence rate is more than
      50% for the patients with &gt;5cm solitary tumor and MVI. The MVI was confirmed as the only
      independent risk factor for the overall and disease-free survival of HCC patients in multiple
      variables analysis. It is important to reduce the recurrence and prolong the survival of
      patients after hepatectomy with effective adjuvant therapy. TACE has been utilized as an
      adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy, but its significance is still unknown. Then, the
      investigators design the current prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect
      of adjuvant TACE to reduce the recurrence in HCC patients at high risk (&gt;5cm solitary tumor
      and MVI) after resection, compared to vigilant follow-up.

      The patients with solitary tumor more than 5cm and microvessels invasion after radical
      hepatectomy were randomized to receive adjuvant TACEï¼ˆ1~2 cycles, 4~6 weeks) or follow-up. The
      main endpoint: overall survival (OS), disease-free survival(DFS), and safety were compared
      between this two groups.
