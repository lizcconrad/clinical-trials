  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the combination of BP1001 and LDAC
      provides greater efficacy (Complete Remission [CR], Complete Remission with incomplete
      hematologic recovery [CRi], Complete Remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) than
      LDAC alone (by historical comparison) in participants with AML that cannot or elect not to be
      treated with more intensive chemotherapy. Safety, pharmacokinetics, overall survival, time to
      response, and duration of response will also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Grb2 gene has been mapped to the human chromosome region 17q22-qter, a region that is
      duplicated in leukemias and solid tumors, which may result in an increased copy number of the
      Grb2 gene product. As Grb2 is important for the transformation of murine hematopoietic cells,
      and the proliferation of human leukemia cells that express high levels of oncogenic tyrosine
      kinases, inhibition of Grb2 may have a significant impact on the natural history of
      leukemias. The study drug (BP1001) may be able to inhibit the cells from making Grb-2.
      Researchers hope that without this protein, the leukemia cells will die.

      Low-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) (LDAC) has been used in a variety of schedules in several Phase
      II trials in AML showing responses that include complete remission of disease. It is
      generally well tolerated and can be given in an outpatient or home care setting. Researchers
      hope that the combination of BP1001 and LDAC will result in greater response rates and
      duration of response in participants with AML that cannot or elect not to be treated with
      more intensive chemotherapy.

      This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, study of BP1001 in combination with LDAC in participants
      with previously untreated AML who are not otherwise eligible for standard or high-intensity
      chemotherapy regimens or who have elected a low-intensity regimen.

      This trial will utilize a single arm, open label, two-stage design to assess the safety
      profile, PK, PD, and efficacy of 60 mg/m2 of BP1001 in combination with LDAC compared to
      historical response rates documented for LDAC alone.

      Approximately 54 evaluable participants will receive the combination of BP1001 and LDAC.

             practice adequate methods of contraception during the study and for 30 days after the
             last dose of study drug or LDAC

          3. Males must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study and for
             at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug or LDAC
