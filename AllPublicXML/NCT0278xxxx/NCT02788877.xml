    <textblock>
      Efficacy of Treat-and-extend regimen (TER) using aflibercept in diabetic macular edema (DME)
      will be evaluated.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of aflibercept for diabetic macular edema was demonstrated in the phase III, VIVID
      and VISTA studies. In these studies, aflibercept was injected using the fixed dosing regimen
      that an intravitreal injection was performed 5 times every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks.
      Although the efficacy was comparable to that of ranibizumab injected every 4 weeks,
      continuous visits and treatments account for quite a burden. TER is regarded as a alternative
      regimen that may reduce visit and treatment numbers for age-related macular degeneration. TER
      is a variable dosing regimen that an injection interval is adjusted based on the treatment
      response. The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy of TER using aflibercept for DME, by
      assessing changes of visual acuity at 104 weeks compared to baseline.

    <description>Aflibercept 2mg is injected into the vitreous cavity. An injection is given every 4 weeks five times and then the Treat-and-Extend process begins. If 1mm central subfield macular thickness (CSMT) improved (10% or more reduction) compared to the previous visit, the next treatment will be performed at the same interval. If CSMT is maintained (less than 10% changes), the next interval will be extended by two weeks (up to 12 weeks). If CSMT is worsened (10% or more increase), the next interval will be shortened by two weeks (minimum 4 weeks). If CSMT is stable two times at 12 weeks-interval, the injection will be deferred, and the next visit will be 8 weeks later. These process will be continued for 2 years.</description>
