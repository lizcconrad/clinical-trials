  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of severe obesity on physical activity,
      sedentary behavior and cardiometabolic risk factors during childhood and adolescence and
      whether these associations are modified by race. Additionally, the study will investigate the
      contributions of (total, regional, and depot-specific) fat accumulation on changes in
      physical activity, sedentary behavior, and cardiometabolic risk factors during childhood and
      adolescence.

      The proposed study will establish a prospective pediatric cohort to identify intervention
      targets based on the location, timing, barriers, and facilitators of current physical
      activity and sedentary behavior in a child's day. The project will be a prospective
      examination of 340 African American and White girls and boys aged 10 to 16 years, including
      50% who are classified as severely obese. State-of-the-art technology will be used including
      accelerometry to quantify physical activity, magnetic resonance imaging to quantify fat
      accumulation, and geographic position system and ecological momentary assessment to identify
      environmental and socio-emotional barriers and facilitators. In further detail, this study
      will examine the following objectives:

      Objective 1: Determine the effect of severe obesity on physical activity, sedentary behavior,
      and cardiometabolic risk factors during childhood and adolescence and whether these
      associations are modified by race.

      Objective 2: Investigate the contribution of (total, regional, and depot-specific) fat
      accumulation on changes in physical activity, sedentary behavior, and cardiometabolic risk
      factors during childhood and adolescence.

      Objective 3: Determine barriers and facilitators of physical activity that are related to
      obesity, including environmental and socio-emotional factors.

    <measure>Objective 1 Primary Outcome: Change in minutes of sedentary behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 0 and Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity and sedentary behavior will be measured by a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+, Actigraph of Ft. Walton Beach, FL). The participant will be instructed to wear the accelerometer on an elasticized belt, on the left mid-axillary line. The Actigraph is one of the most common accelerometers used for scientific purposes. Participants will be encouraged to wear the accelerometer 24-hours per day for at least 7-days (plus an initial familiarization day and the morning of the final day), including 2 weekend days. Participants will also complete a Lifestyle survey to collect information including diet and physical activity habits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective 2 Primary Outcome: Relationship between total fat accumulation and change in sedentary behavior.</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 0 and Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be determined by DXA and MRI. With DXA, total body fat and trunk fat will be measured by whole-body DXA using a GE iDXA scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) to quantify total and regional body fat (including trunk fat). MRI - Visceral fat, i.e. visceral adipose tissue, will be measured by water-fat shifting MRI using the General Electric Discovery 750w 3.0 Tesla (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). IDEAL-IQ imaging technique will be used to generate water-only, fat-only, in-phase, and out-of-phase echoes in a single acquisition with a 20-second breath-hold. Sedentary behavior will be measured by a a triaxial accelerometer as described in outcome 1. Participants will also complete a Lifestyle survey to collect information including physical activity habits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective 3 Primary Outcome: Relationship between BMIz and the environmental (or socio-emotional) factors.</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 0 and Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>BMIz will be calculated based on the participant's age, height, and weight using the CDC 2000 growth charts. To identify where physical activity occurs, children will wear the QStarz BT Q1000XT data logger for 7 days concurrent with the ActiGraph GT3X+. In regards to the environmental factors, parents of participants will complete the Neighborhood Impact on Kids (NIK) survey, and participants will complete a neighborhood perceptions survey. In regards to socio-emotional factors, participants will complete the Body Image Assessment for Preadolescents, the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, the Health-Related Quality of Life, the Personal Experiences Checklist related to stress, and the Food Craving Inventory. Further, participants will record negative and positive affect during a 7-day period by responding to prompts on a mobile phone-based app, using ecological momentary assessment.</description>

        The study aims to identify and recruit 340 boys and girls aged 10 to 16 years. The sample
        will be screened on the telephone in attempt to achieve a comparable sex and race
        distribution. An oversample will be taken for severely obese youth so they comprise
        approximately 50% of the sample (with the other 50% being distributed among normal weight,
        overweight, and obese status).
