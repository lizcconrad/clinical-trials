      effect of bacterial vaccines in patients with inflammation diseases of bronchopulmonary
      system. Objectives of the study: assessment of microbiocenosis mucous membranes of the upper
      respiratory tract in patients with bronchopulmonary pathology before and after use of
      bacterial vaccines. Identification of mayor lymphocytes subpopulations, proinflammatory
      cytokines, inflammatory markers in patients in the dynamics of the vaccination process. Study
      the profile of humoral immune response in patients under different schemes of vaccination.
      Detection of levels of autoantibodies against tissue antigens in the sera of vaccinated
      patients with inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. Assessment of the clinic and
      functional status bronchopulmonary system in the immunized patients. Development of
      methodical recommendations / study guides for the improvement of therapy in patients with

             -  the number of courses of antibiotic therapy a year prior to vaccination and during
                the year after immunization

             -  the number of hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchopulmonary
                disease during the year prior to vaccination and during the year after
                immunization.

           Under chronic bronchopulmonary pathology were understood to be two types of diseases:
           COPD and bronchial asthma.

           Under the exacerbation of chronic bronchopulmonary pathology refers to the increased
           symptoms of dyspnea, cough, sputum, emergence or strengthening of wheezing and whistling
           in the chest, feeling of compression in the chest, requiring treatment and modification
           of therapy, and are confirming information in the initial documentation of patients.

           Under the number of courses of antibacterial drugs refers to the number of courses of
           antibiotics during the year prior to vaccination and during the year after vaccination
           due to exacerbation of chronic bronchopulmonary diseases, and also for any other reasons
           not associated with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology. This information also was
           confirmed by the presence of primary records in documentation of patients.

           Under hospitalization refers to the admission of the subject for treatment in a hospital
           for chronic bronchopulmonary disease, both in routine and emergency indications.
           Confirmation of hospitalization served as the medical history of the disease, or the
           entry in the medical card of the examinee. In the course of the work gathered
           information about all the hospitalizations the year before and the year after
           vaccination.

       10. Method of estimating quality of life associated with health For the measurement of
           indicators of quality of life associated with health in COPD patients prior to
           vaccination and during the year after vaccination was used a sociological research
           method with the use of the SAT test (COPD Assessment Test). The value of the test from 0
           to 10 points indicates no significant influence of COPD on the patient's life, from 11
           to 20 points - a moderate impact of COPD on the patient's life, from 21 to 30 points -
           the strong effect of COPD on the patient's life, with the result of 31 points and above
           COPD exerts an extremely strong influence on the life of the patient.

      Assessment of the quality of life of patients with bronchial asthma was carried out in
      dynamics with the use of the questionnaire ACQ-5 (Asthma Control Questionnaire). Total score
      ACQ-5 is calculated as the arithmetic mean of 5 responses: &lt;0,5-0,75 - good control of
      asthma, 0,75-1,5 - partial control of asthma, &gt;1.5 to uncontrolled asthma.

      Reviewed the following dissertation materials:

        1. Extracts from medical histories (outpatient cards) - 219.

        2. Data of patient clinical examination (protocols of patient questioning and examination,
           clinical diagnoses, questionnaire results).

      The author has carried out a pilot, prospective, non-randomized, one-center,
      non-placebo-controlled study that enrolled a total of 219 patients with chronic
      bronchopulmonary pathology who have been followed up for 4 years. The study was conducted at
      a specialist consulting and diagnostic clinical center of the State-Funded Educational
      Institution of Higher Professional Education &quot;Samara State Medical University&quot; of the
      Ministry of Healthcare of Russia in collaboration with the Federal State-Funded Research
      Institute &quot;Moscow Scientific Research Institute of Vaccines and Sera named after I.I.
      Mechnikov&quot;.

      The investigations were those commonly used in clinical trials and included physical
      examination, laboratory, immunological and microbiological investigations, assessment of
      functional tests and health-related quality of life parameters in dynamics including a
      short-term (one-year) and long-term (four-year) follow-up in adult patients with chronic
      bronchopulmonary pathology (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma)
      against the backdrop of using different pneumococcal vaccination regimens.

      Statistical analysis was carried out using the StatPlus 2009 Professional 5.8.4 applied
      software package and appropriate statistical methods. Study results presented in the
      dissertation fully match the data in primary medical records and comply with the
      international system of units (SI). The correctness of all parameters are confirmed by
      corresponding entries in the primary documents.

      The author was personally involved in all steps of this study and analysis of results. The
      statistical significance and authenticity of primary source materials raises no doubt. The
      results of statistical analysis fully agree with the data presented in tables illustrating
      the dissertation.

      All results presented in the dissertation and abstract have been published in scientific
      papers and meeting abstracts. The author was personally involved in studying clinical,
      microbiological and immunological effects of vaccination against pneumococcal infection in
      patients with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology and the effect of different vaccination
      regimens on the dynamics of functional test parameters and the short- and long-term quality
      of life outcomes. He also developed a scientifically sound regimen for using the pneumococcal
      vaccines in patients with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology. The presence of a complete set
      of primary documents and sufficient statistical analysis of study results allows us to
      conclude that the data obtained are correct and conclusions and recommendations justified.

      No violations of requirements of the Higher Attestation Commission (HAC) of the Ministry of
      Education and Science of Russia applicable to primary documents have been found.

      The thesis advisory panel came to the conclusion that the completeness and quality of
      submitted materials is in conformance with the topic and content of the dissertation by A.D.
      Protasov &quot;Systemic approach to vaccine prophylaxis and vaccine therapy of pneumococcal
      infection in patients with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology&quot; (14.03.09 - &quot;clinical
