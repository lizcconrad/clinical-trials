  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the distribution of peripheral T-cell lymphocyte
      (PTCL) subtypes by re-analysis and re-classification of samples according to the 2008 World
      Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms.

      This study is a retrospective, non-interventional and, post-authorization observational study
      of other designs (PAS-OD).

      This multicenter trial will be conducted in Spain. Retrospective review of medical records
      and initial tumor biopsies of participants diagnosed with PTCL in the period of 6 years
      between 01/01/2008 and 31/12/2013 will be performed. Initial tumor biopsies and histological
      preparations, filed and previously anonymized, will be sent to the central laboratory for
      assessment.
