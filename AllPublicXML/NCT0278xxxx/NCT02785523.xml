  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase III double-blind randomized clinical trial on the effects of ganoderma spore lipids
      to the immunological response in patients with G.I. Cancers. The trial is randomized,
      double-blind. Cancer patients are diagnosed based on pathology or cell biology. Patients are
      randomized into 2 groups: both groups receive chemotherapy. Either group receives ganoderma
      spore lipids or placebo capsules 600mg three times a day (TID) in addition to the
      chemotherapy. Clinical evaluation includes chemotherapy drug toxicities, life quality
      improvement. Blood biochemistry tests mainly include malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide
      dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1b, interleukin (IL)-6, cell flow cytometry on Th1, Th2,
      Th17, Treg cytokines, as well as serum cortisol, estradiol (female), progesterone (female),
      testosterone (male), etc.
