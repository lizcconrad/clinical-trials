    <textblock>
      This study uses a prospective non-randomized, non-controlled design. Five-hundred (500)
      subjects having previously received a peripheral intravenous therapy will be enrolled into a
      single treatment group. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and
      improved energy levels following treatment with a low-light source integrated into an
      existing peripheral intravascular catheter. The absence of a control group is based on the
      following reason:This is a pilot investigation to establish a baseline understanding of the
      safety, feasibility, and cursory utility of polychromatic light emitting diodes integrated
      into an existing 20-gauge 1.0 inch intravenous catheter to improve self-reported overall
      subject energy levels.

      This study uses a prospective non-randomized, non-controlled design. Five-hundred (500)
      subjects having previously received a peripheral intravenous therapy will be enrolled into a
      single treatment group. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and
      cursory utility of a low-light source integrated into an existing peripheral intravenous
      catheter. The absence of a control group is based on the following reason: This is a pilot
      investigation to establish a baseline understanding of the safety, feasibility, and cursory
      utility of polychromatic light emitting diodes integrated into an existing 20-gauge 1.0 inch
      peripheral intravascular catheter to improve self-reported overall subject energy levels
      based on the change in Epworth Sleepiness scores.

      Peripheral intravascular therapy has been used for decades as an effective therapy to
      maintain proper hydration and electrolyte levels, and has been deemed a non-significant
      medical procedure. Peripheral intravascular therapy can be infused with various molecular
      agents such as supplements (Vitamin B12) for the purpose of improving energy levels and
      overall quality of life. However, the use of normal saline as a standard alone helps improve
      hydration and cell function. Low-energy light therapy has been established as an alternative
      treatment for a myriad of medical conditions. Light-based therapy stimulates photoreceptors
      found within cells and can improve overall cellular bioenergetics. The concurrent
      administration of low-light therapy and peripheral intravascular normal saline therapy may
      serve as a viable therapy for the treatment for improvement in subject quality of life and
      energy levels Accordingly, this study is designed to assess the safety, feasibility, and
      cursory improvement in self-reported energy levels following intervention of low-light
      therapy integrated into a standard peripheral intravascular catheter.

    <description>The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. It provides a measure of a person's general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life. It has become the world standard method for making this assessment.
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale will be used to evaluate subject energy levels at both baseline and post-procedure administration phase. Subjects will rate, on a 4-point scale (0 - 3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in 8 different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily lives, although not necessarily every day. It evaluates what the chances are that they would doze off whenever they were in each situation.</description>

    <description>Polychromatic light emitting diode system is a non-significant risk device that administers low-dose light generated by a light emitting diode. Small adapter attaches directly to a standard 20-gauge catheter that threads a small fiber optic through the distal end of the catheter. The optic terminates at the distal end of the catheter. Polychromatic light is emitted to illuminate the catheter and site of catheter entrance. Concurrently, normal saline flows through the optic adapter and through into the 20-gauge catheter.</description>
