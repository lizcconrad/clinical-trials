    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety/tolerability of the 2 different vaccine
      regimens of priming with trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV and boosting with trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV and
      Clade C gp140 plus adjuvant or priming with tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV and boosting with
      Ad26.Mos4.HIV and Clade C glycoprotein (gp)140 plus adjuvant. Immune responses of the
      different vaccine schedules will be assessed.

          -  Are negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at screening

          -  Is healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, electrocardiogram
             (ECG), and vital signs measurement performed at screening

          -  Are willing/able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the
             protocol and study procedures

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test (beta human chorionic gonadotropin [beta hCG]) at the Screening visit, and a
             negative urine pregnancy test pre-dose on Day 1

          -  Are assessed by the clinic staff as being at low risk for HIV infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has chronic hepatitis B (measured by hepatitis B surface antigen test) or active
             hepatitis C (measured by hepatitis C virus [HCV] Ab test; if positive, HCV ribonucleic
             acid [RNA] PCR test will be used to confirm active versus past HCV infection), active
             syphilis infection, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas . Active syphilis documented
             by serology unless positive serology is due to past treated infection

          -  Has had a thyroidectomy or active thyroid disease requiring medication during the last
             12 months (not excluded: a stable thyroid supplementation)

          -  Has had major psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse problems during the past 12
             months (including hospitalization or periods of work disability) that in the opinion
             of the investigator would preclude participation

          -  Has been in receipt of any licensed vaccine within 14 days prior to the first dose of
             study vaccine/placebo, plans to receive within 14 days after the first study
             vaccination, or plans to receive within 14 days before or after the second, third or
             fourth vaccination

          -  Is a recipient of a prophylactic or therapeutic HIV vaccine candidate at any time, or
             a recipient of other experimental vaccine(s) within the last 12 months prior to the
             Day 1 visit (Vaccination 1). For participants who received an experimental vaccine
             (except HIV vaccine) more than 12 months prior to the Day 1 visit (Vaccination 1),
             documentation of the identity of the experimental vaccine must be provided to the
             sponsor, who will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis
