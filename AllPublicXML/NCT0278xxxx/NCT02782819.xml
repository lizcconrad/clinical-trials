    <textblock>
      Fluid resuscitation is the most effective treatment of shock. Isotonic crystalloid solution
      is the current recommended initial fluid resuscitation. However, this kind of fluid has high
      volume of distribution and may require large volume administration before achieve therapeutic
      goal of shock reversal. There are rising concern about the delay in shock reversal and
      adverse consequences of large amount volume of fluid therapy. Colloid fluid have been used as
      the alternate fluid resuscitation, aiming to limit the volume of fluid resuscitation and
      promote shock reversal. Whether colloid infusion can improve shock reversal rate and decrease
      complication associated with fluid resuscitation, had inconclusive information.

      the alternate fluid resuscitation, aiming to limit the volume of fluid resuscitation and
      promote shock reversal. Data from a recent randomized controlled study showed the improve
      long term survival among shock patients whose resuscitated with colloid solution. There were
      evidence about the increase incidence of acute kidney injury among critically ill patients
      who received hydroxyethyl starch, a previously worldwide used colloid solution. For septic
      shock, the leading cause of shock in current situation, resuscitation with albumin may
      associated with better outcome, while increasing mortality had been reported among the
      patient who received hydroxyethyl starch. Whether colloid infusion can improve shock reversal
      rate and decrease complication associated with fluid resuscitation, had inconclusive
      information.
