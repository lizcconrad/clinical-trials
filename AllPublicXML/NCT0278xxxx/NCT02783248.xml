      The aim of this study is to validate prospectively the predictive score of late results about
      a diverse population recruited in France and to evaluate the contribution in predicting the
      outcome of the PMC scanner to study the mitral calcium score and the location of the
      calcifications.

      This is a multicenter prospective observational study conducted in French medico-surgical
      sites.

      The Percutaneous Mitral Commissurotomy (PMC) is the standard treatment for Mitral stenosis
      (MS) in patients with rheumatic favorable characteristics. In Western countries the MS
      reaches older patients with less favorable characteristics, including the presence of mitral
      calcifications. Calcifications are a factor of poor outcome of the PMC. The scanner appears
      as a useful examination for their study but is not carried out systematically. The prediction
      of late results of the PMC is particularly important in patients with non-ideal
      characteristics which form a particularly heterogeneous population. A score of late results
      of the PMC on the wider western series was recently released but has not to date received
      external validation. In this score, prediction results was multifactorial, with a
      consideration of paramount clinical factors, but also a prognostic significance of mitral
      calcifications.

      The validation of predictive score of late results of the PMC, with the analysis of
      calcifications, would better select patients who may best benefit from PMC and those for
      which the surgical management is preferred.

      The aim of this study is to validate an external sample predictive score of the event-free
      survival in patients who have had a good immediate result of the PMC.

      This study, purely observational, does not create any special procedure outside the patient's
      usual care.

    <description>No specific protocol intervention occurs. All the cares are made as done usually.
Patients who may be included are all consecutive patients who agreed to participate in the study and having a PMC in a French medical-surgical centers that perform more than 5 year PMC.
All patients undergoing echocardiography with the realization of the score Wilkins and Cormier.
Will then be included to validate the result of late score that patients who had a good immediate result of the PMC defined by: mitral valve area ≥ 1.5 cm² and IM ≤ 2/4. Patients with a poor immediate result of the PMC will not be monitored as part of the study but their data will be collected for the description of the population and analysis of immediate results.
Patients in the study will receive an annual monitoring as recommended, independently of the study.</description>
