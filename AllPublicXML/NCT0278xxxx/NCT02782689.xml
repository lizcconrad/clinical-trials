      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the 2-layer
      compression system Kit Biflex® with regard of the 4-layer compression system PROFORE® in the
      treatment of venous leg ulcers in terms of complete healing at 16 weeks.

      This trial is a multicentre, randomized, comparative, open label clinical study conducted in
      vascular medicine centres in France, with 2 parallel groups of 100 patients each. The study
      will be conducted in patients suffering from venous leg ulcer (stage C6 of the CEAP
      classification for chronic venous disorders).

      The patients will be randomised at the inclusion: they will receive with either Kit Biflex®
      or the reference device (Profore®) for maximum 16 weeks (or until full healing).

      Investigator assessments are planned every 4 weeks +/- 3 days, for 16 weeks.
