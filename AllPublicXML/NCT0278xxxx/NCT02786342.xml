      Sorafenib represents the standard care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However,
      molecular predictors of sorafenib efficacy have not yet been identified.

      The primary aim of the study is to validate the prognostic or predictive role of eNOS,Ang2,
      HIF-1, VEGF and VEGFR polymorphisms in relation to clinical outcome (progression-free
      survival, PFS) of HCC patients treated with sorafenib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor acting on vascular endothelial growth factor receptors
      (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) involved in tumor cell
      proliferation and tumor angiogenesis.

      Angiogenesis is a cascade of linked and sequential steps ultimately leading to tumour
      neovascularisation. Preclinical data suggested that significant HCC growth is dependent on
      angiogenesis, and an increase in tumour dimension may induce vascular endothelial cell
      proliferation.

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-driven pathway has been demonstrated to play a
      major role in tumour angiogenesis. In fact, VEGF as a potent permeability factor promotes
      cell migration during invasion and as an endothelial growth factor stimulates endothelial
      cell proliferation, inducing the budding of new blood vessels around the growing tumour
      masses .

      Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) genes have also been
      correlated to tumour neoangiogenesis through different biological mechanisms.

      In the ALICE-1 study HCC patients receiving sorafenib were tested for VEGF-A, VEGF-C and
      VEGFR-1,2,3 SNPs. At univariate analysis VEGF-A alleles C of rs25648, T of rs833061, C of
      rs699947, C of rs2010963, VEGF-C alleles T of rs4604006, G of rs664393, VEGFR-2 alleles C of
      rs2071559, C of rs2305948 were significant predictors of PFS and overall survival (OS). At
      multivariate analysis rs2010963, rs4604006 and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage
      resulted to be independent factors influencing PFS and OS.

      In the ALICE-2 study SNPs of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) were statistically
      significant for PFS and OS. The extended analysis of VEGF and VEGFR SNPs confirms the results
      of ALICE-1 study. The presence of GG genotype of rs12434438 (HIF-1α) select a population with
      a particularly poor outcome independently from the clinical effect of the two VEGF SNPs (PFS:
      2.6 months, p&lt;0,0001; OS: 6.6 months, p&lt;0,0001).

      In ePHAS study a training cohort of 41 HCC patients and a validation cohort of 87 patients
      receiving sorafenib was analyzed. At univariate analysis, patients homozygous for an
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) haplotype (HT1: T-4b at eNOS-786/eNOS VNTR) had a
      lower median PFS (2.6 vs. 5.8 months, p &lt;0.0001) and OS (3.2 vs.14.6 months, p = 0.024) than
      those with other haplotypes. These data were confirmed in the validation set in which
      patients homozygous for HT1 had a lower median PFS (2.0 vs. 6.7 months, p &lt;0.0001) and OS
      (6.4 vs.18.0 months, p &lt; 0.0001).

      On the basis of these premises this prospective study aims at validating the potential role
      of eNOS, VEGF, VEGFR, HIF-1 and Ang2 polymorphisms in patients with HCC treated with
      sorafenib.
