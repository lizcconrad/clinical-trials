      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate response to NERD treatment between patients with normal endomicroscopy findings
      compared with patients with abnormal endomicroscopy findings.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate the role of probe based endomicroscopy in the diagnosis of NERD by evaluating
      dilated intercellular spaces, evaluation of IPCL, and quantification of fluorescein leak.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate response to non-erosive reflux disease (NERD)
      treatment between patients with normal endomicroscopy findings compared with patients with
      abnormal endomicroscopy findings. The researchers will compare two different drug regimens
      for the NERD subjects to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing NERD-related symptoms. In
      addition, the researchers will be testing the function and effectiveness of the confocal
      endomicroscopy procedure to be used during the study. Researchers will be continuing to
      assess the status, symptoms, and any changes associated with the symptoms subjects are
      experiencing.

      The confocal endomicroscopy procedure utilizes a powerful microscope that is used during an
      endoscopy. An endoscopy is a procedure that allows us to scope/view the inside of the
      esophagus and stomach using a camera in precise detail.

      An endoscopy procedure and measurements of acid in the esophagus have been used to determine
      if the investigators think acid is causing the symptoms. Traditionally, acid blocking
      medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs such as Esomeprazole, Lansoprazole,
      Omeprazole, and Pantoprazole), or medications such as Sucralfate have been used to treat the
      symptoms of NERD.

      The medical community believes that these symptoms are due to increased spaces between the
      cells that make up the esophagus. They can directly see those spaces using the confocal
      endomicroscopy.

      Patients are asked to participate in this study if they are 18 years of age or older and have
      typical symptoms for patients diagnosed with NERD that have not responded to the first
      attempted medication.

    <description>A 3 minute video recording of microscopic images starting with the injection of the fluorescein will be captured during the time of endoscopy. The goal is also to see if the time to seeing fluorescein in the intracellular spaces correlates with a diagnosis of NERD. Time, measured in seconds, to first visualization of intrapapillary loops and intercellular gaps and fluorescein leak will be obtained and assess by trained endoscopists.</description>
