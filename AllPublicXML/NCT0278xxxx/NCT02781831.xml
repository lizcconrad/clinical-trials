  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigation of the clinical feasibility and efficacy of a newly developed robot-assisted
      gait training system for stroke survivors. It is anticipated that robot-assisted gait
      rehabilitation in combination with standard hospital based rehabilitation will achieve
      significantly better gait outcomes than standard hospital based rehabilitation alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of permanent disability in most developed countries world wide
      with one-third of the surviving patients from stroke fail to regain independent walking
      ability. Robot-assisted gait rehabilitation that is able to deliver high intensity and
      consistent repeatability in a safe and controlled environment are gaining traction and
      advocators for its inclusion as part of the routine post-stroke rehabilitation program.
      However, despite the recent technological advances in the development and design of better
      robotics, the exact benefit of the robot-assisted therapy over traditional rehabilitation
      remain sparse and unclear. It is therefore the aim of the proposed project to fulfil this
      important gap in our clinical knowledge by comparatively investigate the clinical feasibility
      and efficacy of a recently developed HIWIN Robotic Gait Training System (MRG-P100) against
      the traditional rehabilitation program with an emphasis on the determination of functional
      recovery and the appropriate gait adaptation of such robotic system for stroke survivors.
