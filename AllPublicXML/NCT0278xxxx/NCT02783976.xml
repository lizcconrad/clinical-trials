    <textblock>
      This study will collect and evaluate information on the safety and efficacy of Sovaldi-based
      regimens in routine clinical practice in Mexico. The primary objective of this study is to
      assess the rates of serious adverse events/reactions (SAEs/SADRs) and adverse
      events/reactions (AEs/ADRs) in adult participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection treated with Sovaldi in routine clinical practice.
