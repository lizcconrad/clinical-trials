  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether the drug mexiletine will be
      effective in lowering motor neuron electrical activity in the brains and nerves in the arms
      of people with ALS. The investigators will also determine if there are any signs that the
      drug may slow down the progression of ALS and reduce muscle cramps and muscle twitching. This
      will be determined through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and threshold tracking
      nerve conduction studies (TTNCS). In this trial, the participants will be taking either
      300mg/day of mexiletine, 600mg/day of mexiletine, or placebo (non-active study drug).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily motor
      neurons, for which treatment designed to slow or arrest progression remains lacking.
      Mexiletine is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker that has been FDA-approved for decades
      for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and more recently to treat neuropathic pain in
      diabetic polyneuropathy. Mexiletine has been shown also to be protective of neurons following
      spinal cord, head injury, and cerebral ischemia, largely by blocking excitotoxicity. Based on
      previous studies, mexiletine appears to penetrate into the central nervous system at
      concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Recent unpublished studies in the
      laboratory of Dr. Robert Brown at the University of Massachusetts have also demonstrated that
      mexiletine ingestion in mice genetically engineered to express high levels of mutant
      cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgene prolongs survival in these
      animals. As mexiletine already has FDA-approval as an anti-arrhythmic agent, much is known
      about the pharmacology and safety of this drug in non-ALS patients. We anticipate that by
      excluding subjects with a known history of cardiac disease and with the known neuroprotectant
      properties of this medication, mexiletine is a good choice for further study in an ALS
      clinical trial.
