  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the study team will investigate the validity and role of nasal dilator strips
      (NDS), a novel method to determine the site of nasal valve compromise (NVC), in the
      pre-operative evaluation. The method involves placing the strip sequentially at the upper and
      lower lateral cartilage and recording the location of the optimal airway based on patient's
      subjective symptoms.

      Investigators seek to assess surgical outcomes in participants undergoing rhinoplasty based
      on pre-operative NDS classification. The Nasal Obstruction and Septoplasty Effectiveness
      (NOSE) instrument will be used to evaluate subjective symptoms of nasal obstruction, before
      and after the operation and comparing these scores.The results will help determine the
      effectiveness and predictive value of NDS in isolating the site of NVC.

      Additional study aims are to determine the specificity and predictive value of nasal dilator
      strips in determining the location of obstruction in patients with nasal valve compromise,
      and to assess the role of nasal dilator strips in supplementing or replacing current
      approaches for pre-operative evaluation of nasal valve compromise.

      The target population for this study is patients at the Emory Aesthetics Center who are
      undergoing functional rhinoplasty for nasal valve compromise and obstruction.
