  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the efficacy of stimulation on over all pain relief
      as reported in an initial cohort of 6 patients treated with the Freedom High Frequency Spinal
      Cord Stimulator (SCS) System for low back and/or leg pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, short-term study for a maximum duration of 12 weeks in which 6
      patients will receive a Freedom SCS System. Subjects will have chronic, intractable pain of
      the trunk and/or lower limbs refractory to standard medical treatment; including unilateral
      or bilateral pain. Stimulators will be placed in the epidural space and over exiting nerve
      roots at vertebrae levels:

      A. Bilateral T9-T10 epidural; B. Bilateral L1-L4 epidural. All Patients will be treated below
      perception threshold with High Frequency settings (10.000 Hz, 30 μs).

    <description>The primary outcome is defined as the percentage of subjects who respond (50% average or more pain relief for back and leg pain) to SCS therapy at the end of 12 weeks post-implant of the system as compared to baseline with no increase in medication. The primary outcome will be measured with the VAS (100 mm line).</description>

        1. Inclusion Criteria:

             A. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age at time of informed consent;

             B. Subjects have been diagnosed with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or
             lower limbs with a VAS &gt; 5cm (on a 10-cm scale);

             C. Subject diagnosis with chronic pain refractory to conventional medical management
             for at least 6 months prior to enrollment;

             D. Based on the medical opinion of the Principal Investigator, there is no evidence of
             anatomic abnormalities that could jeopardize the placement of the device or pose a
             hazard to the subject;

             E. Subject is willing to undergo surgical implant procedure, attend visits as
             scheduled, and comply with the study requirements;

             F. Based on the opinion of the Principal Investigator, subject is willing and able to
             operate the patient programmer, recharging equipment, diary and has the ability to
             undergo study assessments and provide accurate responses;

             G. Based on the opinion of the implanter, subject is a good surgical candidate for the
             implant procedure;

             H. Subject is male or non-pregnant female;

             I. Subject is deemed to be neuro-psycho-socially appropriate for implantation
             therapies based of the assessment of the investigator, using face-to-face encounters
             and the psychological testing described in the measures;

             J. Patient is capable of giving informed consent;

             K. Patient lives within reasonable distance from the study site (circumference of 75
             km).

          2. Exclusion Criteria:

        A. Obvious mechanical instability related to pain (diagnosed by imaging taken within the
        past 6 months);

        B. Malignancies;

        C. Subject has post-herpetic neuralgia (shingles);

        D. Subject has an active systemic infection or is immune-compromised.

        E. Based on the medical opinion of the Principal Investigator the subject has other
        psychological conditions (e.g., psychosis, suicidal ideation, borderline personality
        disorder, somatization, narcissism), other health conditions (e.g., substance abuse,
        another chronic condition requiring the regular use of opioid medication), or other legal
        concerns that would preclude his/her enrollment in the study or potentially confound the
        results of the study;

        F. Subject is currently enrolled in or plans to enroll in any concurrent drug and/or device
        study while participating in this study;

        G. Insulin-dependent diabetic who is not controlled through diet and/or medication;

        H. Bleeding complications or coagulopathy issues;

        I. Pregnant/lactating or not using adequate birth control;

        J. A life expectancy of less than one year;

        K. Any active implanted device whether turned off or on;
