  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a relatively frequent eye disease in younger
      patients. It is characterized by serous detachment of the neurosensory retina with or without
      serous detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which can cause vision drop, image
      distortion, loss of color and contrast vision. Although nonfoveal focal leakage can be
      treated with traditional laser photocoagulation, but it has the side effects of causing RPE
      atrophy, scotoma, or secondary CNV. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another effective treatment
      but it's more than most families can afford to pay because of the high cost, what's more, it
      is accompanied with side-effects, such as choroidal ischemia, retinal pigmental epithelium
      (RPE) atrophy and RPE rip.

      To date there is no international consensus on the optimal treatment of CSC Many
      retrospective studies suggest that micropulse laser (MPL) therapy may also be effective
      without obvious complications in this disease.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of micropulse laser (MPL) on acute
      central serous chorioretinopathy compared with the traditional laser coagulation.

      The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial about 577nm micropulse laser versus
      traditional laser coagulation therapy on acute central serous chorioretinopathy. The primary
      outcome measures is the proportion of eyes with complete absorption of subretinal fluid 3
      months after treatment.
