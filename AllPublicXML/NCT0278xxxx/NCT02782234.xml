      Contract management is a new management mode.

      To help patients achieve fluid balance through contract management, that is:

        1. edema, congestive heart failure and other similar symptoms begin to reduce to disappear;

        2. Blood pressure control in normal range, that is 90-140/60-90mmHg, or the target value
           prescribed by the doctors；

        3. Fluid intake and output keep in balance;

        4. No imbalance symptoms turn out, such as edema, congestive heart failure, etc.

      Contract management is a new management mode, it stipulate and constraint various
      relationship by various duties, institutions and regulations.

      To help patients achieve fluid balance through contract management, that is:

        1. edema, congestive heart failure and other similar symptoms begin to reduce to disappear;

        2. Blood pressure control in normal range, that is 90-140/60-90mmHg, or the target value
           prescribed by the doctors；

        3. Fluid intake and output keep in balance;

        4. No imbalance symptoms turn out, such as edema, congestive heart failure, etc.

      In addition to help keeping the fluid balance through contract balance, but also:

        1. Improve compliance;

        2. Improve the patients' cognition of fluid balance;

        3. Improve the ability of self-management of fluid balance.

    <description>In accordance with the contract content, researchers and participants should manage and maintain the liquid balance of the participants. Signed doctors and nurses should undergo the follow-up phone or family visit on time, instruct them proper healthy training, and provided necessary information data. By telephone, SMS, wechat, remind and urge the participants to take the lifestyle and behavior regulate in the contract. Participants should supervise and manage the fluid unbalance (Edema, hypertension, heart failure, and fluid imbalance of intake and output etc.), and feedback the Management and supervision to researchers according to contract.</description>
