  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemoptysis is a common problem in India due to high incidence of tuberculosis and also due to
      post tubercular sequale. Hemoptysis is usually managed conservatively in mild to moderate
      cases and cases of massive hemoptysis are managed with more definitive treatment options like
      vessel embolization (bronchial/pulmonary artery) and surgery as a last option. Tranexamic
      acid is a antifibrinolytic used in many surgeries and trauma patients to control bleeding and
      it has been shown effective and safe. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      tranexamic acid in patients with hemoptysis in controlling bleeding.
