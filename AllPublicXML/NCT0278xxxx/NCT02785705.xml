  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 component of oral poliovirus vaccine is slated for global withdrawal through a switch
      from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) to bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) for
      preventing paralytic polio caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2. We aimed
      to assess immunogenicity and safety profile of six vaccination schedules with different
      sequential doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), tOPV, or bOPV.

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial was conducted in China in 2015. After informed consent was
      obtained from a parent or legally acceptable representative, healthy newborn babies were
      randomly allocated to one of six groups: cIPV-bOPV-bOPV, cIPV-tOPV-tOPV, cIPV-cIPV-bOPV,
      cIPV-cIPV-tOPV, cIPV-cIPV-cIPV, and tOPV-tOPV-tOPV. The key eligibility criteria were:
      full-term birth (37-42 weeks of gestation), birthweight ≥2·5 kg, no obvious medical disorders
      and no polio vaccination. Infants received following three doses sequentially with 4- 6 weeks
      interval after collecting blood sample: cIPV-bOPV-bOPV, cIPV-tOPV-tOPV, cIPV-cIPV-bOPV,
      cIPV-cIPV-tOPV, cIPV-cIPV-cIPV, and tOPV-tOPV-tOPV; and will be proactively followed up for
      observing adverse events after the first dose and 30 days after all doses. Antibodies of type
      1, 2, and 3 poliovirus were tested 30 days after the third dose. The primary study objective
      was to investigate immunogenicity and safety profile of different vaccine schedules,
      evaluated by seroconversion, seroprotection and antibody titre against poliovirus types 1, 2,
      and 3 in the per-protocol population.
