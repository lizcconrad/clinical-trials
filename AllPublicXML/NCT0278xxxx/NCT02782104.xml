      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intranasal esketamine
      in participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (the researchers and participants know the treatment the participant is
      receiving) long-term extension study. The study will consist of 2 open-label Phases: 4-week
      Induction phase (if applicable) and Open-Label Optimization/Maintenance phase (variable).
      Participants will enter the study Induction Phase from ESKETINTRD3001 (NCT02417064),
      ESKETINTRD3002 (NCT02418585), ESKETINTRD3003 (NCT02493868), ESKETINTRD3005 (NCT02422186) and
      ESKETINTRD3006 (US sites only). Participants will enter the study Open-Label
      Optimization/Maintenance phase from ESKETINTRD3001 (NCT02417064), ESKETINTRD3002
      (NCT02418585), ESKETINTRD3003 (NCT02493868) (if appropriate at week 16) or ESKETINTRD3006 (US
      sites only). In the Open-Label Induction Phase, participants will self-administer
      flexibly-dosed intranasal esketamine. During first 4 weeks in Optimization/Maintenance Phase
      responder participants from the induction phase of study 54135419TRD3008, will continue on
      the same dose of intranasal esketamine from the induction phase and have a weekly intranasal
      treatment session frequency. Participants entering the optimization/maintenance phase from
      study ESKETINTRD3005 will also have a weekly intranasal treatment session frequency. However,
      as the ESKETINTRD3005 intranasal study medication is blinded at the time of entry into the
      current study, the dose of intranasal esketamine will be administered as outlined in
      protocol. Participants entering the optimization/maintenance phase from study ESKETINTRD3003
      (Direct Entry) or ESKETINTRD3004 who were ongoing in the Optimization, Maintenance, or
      Optimization/Maintenance phase, respectively, will have the option to have their current
      intranasal dosing frequency adjusted at the time of entry into 54135419TRD3008 study and
      should remain on the selected frequency from week 1 to week 4. A one-time dose change will be
      permitted at study entry. After 4 weeks, intranasal esketamine treatment sessions will be
      individualized to either once weekly or once every other week at the fixed 2-week interval
      (based on clinical global impression - severity [CGI-S] performed at that visit), and every 4
      weeks for subjects dosed at the 4 week interval. Participants safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <time_frame>From the start of Induction Phase to End of Optimization/Maintenance Phase (approximately 5 years 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a brief, generic health-related quality of life assessment (HRQOL) that can also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and as overall health using a &quot;thermometer&quot; visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health). Lower scores indicate worsening. EQ-5D scores include EQ-5D valuation index score (a weighted scoring of the 5 dimension scores with a possible range from 0 to 1) and EQ5D descriptive system scores (five scores reflecting each of the 5 EQ-5D health dimensions ranging from 0 [no limitation] to 4 [incapacity]).</description>

    <description>EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS) is a 20 centimeter (cm) vertical VAS with scores ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (perfect health. A higher score indicates an improvement in health in the Health Status Index. The EuroQol-5 is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead.</description>

    <description>The QLDS is a disease specific PRO designed to assess health related quality of life in patients with Major Depressive Disorder. The instrument has a recall period of &quot;at the moment&quot;, contains 34-items with &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; response options and takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. The score range is from 0 (good quality of life) to 34 (very poor quality of life).</description>
