      Background:

      Advanced urothelial cancer has no cure. But only a few chemotherapy drugs have been tested
      for it. The Co-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) model predicts if cells respond to treatment.
      It may also help determine which drugs fight urothelial cancer based on the characteristics
      of a tumor. Researchers want to test if this model can choose the best therapy for advanced
      urothelial cancer within 3 weeks and how tumors respond to the next best therapy.

      Objective:

      To test if the COXEN model can choose the best therapy for advanced urothelial cancer within
      3 weeks.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older whose urothelial cancer has spread after at least 1 line of
      chemotherapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood and urine tests, and
      tumor scans.

      Participants will provide a tumor sample from a previous surgery and a new biopsy. A needle
      will remove a small piece of tumor.

      Participants will repeat screening tests, plus have an EKG and scan. For the scan, they will
      get an injection of radioactive drug. They will lie in a machine that takes pictures.

      Participants will take the drugs assigned by the COXEN model. They will have visits every 2 3
      weeks. These will include blood and urine tests.

      Participants will have tumor scans every 8 9 weeks.

      Participants may have another biopsy.

      Participants will take the drugs until they can t tolerate the side effects or their cancer
      worsens. They may be assigned to a second COXEN therapy.

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 5 weeks after their last drug dose.

      Participants will be contacted by phone every few months until death.

      Background:

        -  Patients presenting de novo with metastatic bladder cancer, or developing visceral
           metastatic disease after local treatment, are incurable with currently available
           therapeutic modalities.

        -  Only a small number of chemotherapeutic agents have been tested and very few have some
           single agent activity in the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. However most
           (&gt;100) FDA approved anticancer agents have yet to be tested in this disease.

        -  Novel approaches to the development of genomic predictors of chemosensitivity that do
           not require clinical trials for their identification are urgently needed in order to
           identify agents that are clinically effective when either repurposed or discovered de
           novo specifically for urothelial carcinoma. Such repurposing of an FDA approved
           anticancer agent in order to advance therapy from one cancer to another would require
           only minimal clinical development, saving billions of dollars and reducing the time
           required to reach routine clinical practice.

        -  Our established extramural-intramural NCI collaboration pulls together significant
           expertise in biomarker development and clinical trial design in bladder cancer. The
           innovation of this group lies not only in the novel scientific approaches i.e.
           CoeXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) under investigation, but also in the successful
           creation of a cohesive multi-institutional research collaboration dedicated to improved
           clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients.

        -  COXEN uses molecular profiles as a Rosetta Stone for translating drug sensitivities of
           one set of cancers into predictions for another completely independent set of cell lines
           or human tumors. The COXEN methodology has been scrutinized and deemed methodologically
           sound by peer review. The ability of COXEN to predict drug effectiveness in patients a
           priori, from purely in vitro assays, is unique as no other tool currently either in
           practice or in development provides similar results.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the feasibility of using the Co-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) model in
      making a real-time treatment decision (within 3 weeks) in patients with advanced urothelial
      carcinoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic, progressive
           urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis.

        -  Patients must have progressive metastatic disease defined as new or progressive lesions
           on cross-sectional imaging.

        -  Patients must have at least:

             -  One measurable site of disease (according to RECIST criteria)

             -  Or, appearance of one new bone lesion

        -  Patients must have been previously treated, as defined by treatment with at least one
           prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen or agent. Patients may have received any number of
           prior cytotoxic agents.

        -  Archival tumor tissue must be available for enrollment.

        -  Tumor amenable to biopsy will be mandatory for this study.

        -  18 years of age or older

        -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%)

      Design:

        -  This will be a pilot single-arm, open-label study using the COXEN score to select the
           best next therapy from a list of 75 FDA approved anti-neoplastic drugs, in patients with
           metastatic bladder cancer who have progressed despite treatment with cytotoxic
           chemotherapy. Combinations of the listed agents may also be utilized provided that phase
           1 data are available.

        -  The COXEN algorithm requires a multi-step process (pathology, tissue processing, mRNA
           profiling, bioinformatics, etc.) and is potentially labor intensive and time intensive.

        -  Given the disease state of patients eligible for this protocol, using this algorithm to
           select a treatment would only be a worthwhile process to undertake if it can be
           demonstrated that a very high fraction of patients are likely to obtain the benefit from
           the procedure.

             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is

             her treating physician immediately.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy may be eligible if there
             are no pharmacokinetic interactions with the agents used on the study, stable on CART
             therapy and CD4 is &gt;200 and viral load is undetectable.

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The patient has received cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic
             chemotherapy) within 3 weeks or biologic agents (e.g., cytokines or antibodies) within
             4 weeks prior to study enrolllment.

          -  Patients who are receiving any investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
             Patients with brain metastases that are stable after more than or equal to 1 year
             after primary surgery or radiation will not be excluded.

          -  The subject has not recovered to baseline or CTCAE less than or equalto Grade 1 from
             toxicity due to all prior therapies except alopecia and other non-clinically
             significant AEs.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients who are Hepatitis B or C positive.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents used in the study have
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with these agents. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used
             in this study.
