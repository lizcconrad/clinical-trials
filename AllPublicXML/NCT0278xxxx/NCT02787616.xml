  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea is a common disease characterized by inflammation and vascular abnormalities of the
      facial skin and ocular surface. The exact pathogenesis of papulopustular rosacea is not well
      understood and current methods to treat this disease are often unsatisfactory. The purpose of
      this study is to develop gene expression profiles of papulopustular rosacea compared to those
      of normal skin. The investigators hope to better understand the abnormal gene functions that
      might contribute to this condition. This understanding may lead to the development of
      additional and better treatments for rosacea.

        Eligibility Criteria for Rosacea Group:

        Inclusion criteria for rosacea participants:

          1. Clinical signs and symptoms of rosacea (papulopustular or erythrotelangiectatic
             subtypes) present at enrollment as determined by the investigator

          2. All four grandparents of European descent

          3. Fitzpatrick skin type I or II

          4. Age 18 years or older

        Exclusion criteria for rosacea participants:

          1. Unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent

             malar erythema from lupus erythematosus)

          3. Acne vulgaris

          4. Unable or unwilling to provide peripheral blood sample (a few teaspoons)

          5. Inability for investigator to verify rosacea diagnosis on clinical examination due to
             rosacea treatment(s) leading to complete lack of signs and symptoms (such prior laser
             treatments, systemic tetracycline usage, etc.)

          6. Use of topical prescription medications or procedures to the face within one month of

          2. No clinical signs or symptoms of rosacea

          3. No family history of rosacea

          4. All four grandparents of European descent

             enrollment

          6. Skin conditions that might interfere with interpretation of procedure results (at the
             discretion of the investigator)
