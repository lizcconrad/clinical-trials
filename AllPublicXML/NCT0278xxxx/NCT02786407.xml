    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Botulinus Toxin Type A for Injection (HengLi®) in
      patients with overactive bladder (OAB) . Approximately 216 subjects will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive intradetrusor injection of Botulinus Toxin Type A
      for Injection (HengLi®) 100 U or placebo. The study contains two parts: core double-blinded
      phase and extension phase. In the core double-blinded phase, eligible subjects must attend
      three study visits posttreatment 12 weeks. During the extension phase, subjects must also
      attend three study visits (12 weeks). The primary efficacy variables is the change from
      baseline in the daily average frequency of micturition at week 6 after the first treatment.A
      3-day paper bladder diary will be used before each study visits (screening period, the second
      week, the sixth week, the twelfth week, the fourteenth week, the eighteenth week and the
      twenty fourth week ) to collect all OAB symptoms (episodes of urgency, incontinence,
      micturition and nocturia) and volume per voidSafety parameters will also be measured,
      including adverse events, vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) and clinical laboratory
      tests (haematology, serum chemistry and urinanalysis).

      Eligible patients will be randomized on day 1 to receive double-blind treatment with
      Botulinus Toxin Type A for Injection (HengLi®) 100U or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. A total of 216
      subjects will be randomized into this study. Followup visits will occur at day 0, week 6 and
      12, and week 14, 18 and 24 thereafter until study exit at week 24 unless re-treatment was
      necessary. The primary efficacy variables is the change from baseline in the daily average
      frequency of micturition at week 6. After a screening period of 1 week, all eligible patients
      will be randomized to receive a single intramuscular treatment with Botulinus Toxin Type A
      for Injection (HengLi®) or placebo at day 0 (visit 0).
