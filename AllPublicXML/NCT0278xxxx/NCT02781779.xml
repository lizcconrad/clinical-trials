  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how effective each of the two dressings, Silverlon® and
      AQUACEL® AG, are in preventing post cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) procedure
      wound infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, 2-arm randomized, non-blinded study. A total of 100
      participants will be assigned to the Silverlon arm and 100 to the AQUACEL AG arm.

      The number of procedures to implant CIED has risen in recent years. With this rise has also
      brought a rise in post-procedure infections. Infections will happen and there is a continued
      need to improve all aspects of the surgery and post-operative care. Wound coverage with
      appropriate dressings is one aspect that needs to be studied in CIED implant patients.
      Silverlon and AQUACEL AG are two options of dressings available for these patients. This
      study will look to see if one of the two is a better option for post-operative CIED implant
      patients.
