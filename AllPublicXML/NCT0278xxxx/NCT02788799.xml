  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Along with symptoms of chest pain, the presence of ST segment elevations on ECG is the
      criterion usually used in practice to identify patients with acute coronary artery occlusion
      and is essential for the direct and acute referral of patients for primary PCI. However, ECG
      does not always reflect changes in the posterior wall of the heart, often equivalent to the
      left circumflex coronary artery's (LCX) supply area, resulting in an underrepresentation of
      LCX as culprit artery in STEMI populations. There is a general concern that some patients
      with genuine acute occlusion of LCX may present without ST segment elevation and be denied
      reperfusion therapy, resulting in larger infarction and worse outcome.

      The aim of this trial is to implement record of posterior ECG leads (V7, V8 and V9) in
      addition to the standard 12-lead ECG in the pre-hospital setting and to evaluate the clinical
      impact of this implementation: In comparison to a control cohort of STEMI patients diagnosed
      with a pre-hospital standard 12-lead ECG prior study start, the investigators hypothesize
      that introducing V7-V9 leads as a clinical routine in the pre-hospital setting will identify
      patients with STEMI involving LCX and with a non-diagnostic standard 12-lead ECG.

        The intervention group will contain STEMI patients referred directly from the pre-hospital
        setting to PCI-center for primary PCI during study periode. In these patients, both
        standard 12-lead ECG and ECG with V7-V9 leads will be recorded and tele-transmitted to the
        PCI-center.
