  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Design: Single center, double-blind, sham-controlled trial that will randomize symptomatic
      patients with a coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) to CTO percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) or a sham procedure. All patients will receive optimal medical therapy.

      Treatment:CTO PCI, as per standard clinical practice.

      Control: Patients randomized to sham-procedure will undergo only bilateral arterial access,
      without angiography or PCI being performed.

      Secondary Endpoints: (1) Greater improvement in SAQ-7 Summary scores during the entire
      duration of follow-up (6 months) using a repeated measures analysis (2) Greater improvement
      in individual components of patients' health status (3) Greater improvement in exercise
      capacity (4) Similar incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), both peri-procedural
      and long-term
