  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized comparison of laparoscopic No. 14v lymph node dissection in advanced
      lower third gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the short-term, long-term and
      oncological outcomes. The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy,
      postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
