  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate a computer-based intervention titled &quot;Trauma-informed
      Personalized Scripts&quot; (TIPS). The goal of this intervention is to improve patient-provider
      communication about sensitive topics such as intimate partner violence (IPV) and reproductive
      coercion (RC). The main aim of this study is to pilot test TIPS in family planning clinics
      using a randomized study design to compare the basic version of TIPS (a computer-based
      assessment with provider scripts only) to an enhanced TIPS containing a tailored brief
      intervention for patients along with provider scripts. The investigators plan to recruit 240
      female patients ages 16-29 for this study.

    <description>Patients receive brief psycho-educational messages on a tablet computer following completion of questionnaire about personal experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV), sexual assault (SA), and reproductive coercion (RC). These messages are tailored to each patient and are based on their responses to specific items. The messages serve as prompts to encourage the patient to continue the discussion about various topics (healthy relationships, birth control methods, harm reduction) with their provider during their clinic visit. Simultaneously, providers receive a print out with a series of scripts tailored to the patient's responses to introduce healthy relationships education, brief counseling, and harm reduction.</description>
