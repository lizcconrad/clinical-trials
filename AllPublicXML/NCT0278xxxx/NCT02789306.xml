  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the field of periodontics, periodontal support therapy has proven to be essential in
      preventing the incidence or recurrence of periodontal diseases. The protocol is designed
      according to the risk profile of a patient. For example, in the presence of the history of
      periodontal therapy, subgingival microbiota containing large numbers of spirochetes and
      mobile rods can recolonize pockets 4-8 weeks after scaling. Similarly, routine maintenance of
      dental implants has been recommended to prudently avoid peri-implant inflammation, Indeed,
      the understanding of the nature of the tissue around the implant and its pattern of disease
      would be important to consider, even surpassing importance. Recently, a systematic review by
      our group has identified the importance of maintenance therapy around implants because it can
      help prevent about 3 times patient-level frequency peri-implantitis.

      Henceforth, our primary goal was to study the influence in a cross-sectional study of the
      frequency of peri-implantitis patients according to their post-implant placement and
      corresponding prosthesis visits supportive peri-implant maintenance. As such, it will be
      shown:

        1. What are the local and systemic factors affecting the appearance of peri-implantitis

        2. The ideal frequency of supportive peri-implant maintenance in patients who do not
           develop peri-implant disease

        3. What is the population of patients who come to supportive peri-implant maintenance after
           placement of dental implants

      Cross-sectional analysis that will include consecutive patients with dental implants (&gt; 250)
      with at least 36 months depending upon placement of the prosthesis. a cross-sectional study
      calling patients to whom implants have placed them in two private practices (CICOM, Badajoz
      and Nart Clinica Dental, Barcelona, Spain) in the last 36 month to conduct clinical and
      radiographic study was performed. This procedure is justified because of the high frequency
      of peri-implant disease (30%) and since there is no predictable and effective treatment, only
      prevention can improve the success rate and functionality.

      - Clinical examination

      A previously examiner (AN) calibrated perform all clinical measurements. The following
      clinical parameters were measured at six sites per implant (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal,
      distolingual, lingual and mesiolingual):

        1. Presence of plaque is recorded as 0 (no) or 1 (presence)

        2. Degree of gingival redness recorded as 0 (no) or 1 (presence)

        3. Depth bag measured from the gingival margin to the base of the bag in mm;

        4. clinical attachment level (CAL) by the number of exposed threads measured

        5. Bleeding on probing (BOP) recorded as 0 (no) or 1 (presence)

        6. Discharge is recorded as 0 (no) or 1 (presence)

        7. keratinized gingiva (mm)

             -  Radiographic parameters A previously calibrated examiner perform radiographic
                measurement from the neck of the implant in the mesial and distal aspect of the
                implants using a digitized periapical. The software used for measurements will be
                ImageJ (approved by the American National Institute for Research - 'NIH')

Presence of periodontal disease in remaining teeth (determined by attachment level, probing depth, radiographic bone loss and presence of bleeding and / or discharge). By severity it will be stratified into 3 groups according to the 2015 American Academy of Periodontology (AAP):
Mild: Probing depth 3-5mm; bone loss &lt;15%
Moderate: Probing depth: 5-7mm; 15-30% bone loss
Severe: Probing depth:&gt; 7 mm; bone loss&gt; 30%
By location it will be stratified into two groups:
Generalized:&gt; 30%
Localized: &lt;30%
5. Diabetes (Yes / No - blood glucose level mg / dl) 6. History of periodontal disease (Yes / No) 7. Time from implant placement (always&gt; 6months after restoration) 8. Location of the implant
