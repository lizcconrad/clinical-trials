  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, GSK3326595, is an inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)
      that potently inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in animal models. This first time in
      human (FTIH), open-label, dose escalation study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of GSK3326595 in subjects with
      advanced or recurrent solid tumors, as well as clinical activity in subjects with a subset of
      solid tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is an open-label, repeat-dose, multicenter,
      2-part study to establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      based on safety and tolerability and preliminary clinical efficacy of orally-administered
      GSK3326595. Part 1 is a dose-escalation phase to identify the MTD/RP2D based on the safety,
      PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of GSK3326595. This Part will be
      conducted in adult subjects with relapsed and/or refractory solid tumors. It is estimated
      that up to 50 subjects will be enrolled into the dose escalation cohort of the study,
      including up to 38 subjects to identify the MTD and approximately 12 subjects in the
      PK/PD/metabolite/biomarker expansion cohort(s). Disease-specific expansion cohorts (Part 2)
      are planned to further explore clinical activity of GSK3326595 in subjects with selected
      solid tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. It is estimated that up to 150 subjects will be
      enrolled in the disease-specific expansion cohorts of the study. The duration of study will
      depend on recruitment rates and the timing of subjects' duration on study (withdrawal rates
      due to toxicity or progression), with an approximate duration of 2 years.

          -  Reproductive criteria: 1. A male subject with female partner of child bearing
             potential must agree to use one of the methods of contraception for the duration
             specified in protocol. 2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not
             pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test),
             not nursing, and at least one of the following conditions apply: Reproductive
             potential: subject must agree to follow one of the options and the duration specified
             in protocol; Non-reproductive potential defined as i) Pre-menopausal females with one

             spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile or females over 60 years
             of age. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in
             doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignancy attributed to prior solid organ transplant

          -  Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord
             compression. Subjects previously treated for these conditions that have had stable
             central nervous system (CNS) disease (verified with consecutive imaging studies) for
             &gt;1 month , are asymptomatic and off corticosteroids, or are on stable dose of
             corticosteroids for at least 1 month prior to study Day 1 are permitted. Stability of
             brain metastases must be confirmed with imaging. Subject treated with gamma knife
             therapy can be enrolled 2 weeks post-procedure as long as there are no post-procedure
             complications/they are stable. This criterion does not apply to subjects with GBM
             cohort. In Part 1, subjects with GBM may enroll provided that they are on a stable to
             decreasing dose of corticosteroids for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of
             GSK3326595. In Part 2, subjects with GBM may enroll irrespective of steroid dose.

          -  Recent prior therapy, defined as 1. Any non-monoclonal anti-cancer therapy within 14
             days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of GSK3326595. Any
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 42 days prior to the first dose of GSK3326595.
             Prior therapy with biologic agents (including monoclonal antibodies) is permitted so
             long as 28 days have elapsed since therapy and all therapy-related AEs have resolved
             to =&lt; Grade 1, 2. Any radiotherapy within 14 days or major surgery within 28 days
             prior to the first dose of GSK3326595. For subjects in the GBM cohort, subjects must
             have completed radiation therapy at least 28 days prior to the first dose of
             GSK3326595. 3. Anti-androgen therapies for prostate cancer, such as bicalutamide, must
             be stopped 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Second-line hormone therapies such as
             enzalutamide or abiraterone should be stopped 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Subjects
             with prostate cancer should remain on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH)
             agonists or antagonists. Subjects with prostate cancer may also remain on low-dose
             prednisone or prednisolone [up to 10 milligram (mg)/day] and still be eligible for
             this study.

          -  History of a second malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cell cancer within the
             last three years. Subjects with second malignancies that were indolent, in situ or
             definitively treated may be enrolled even if less than three years have elapsed since
             treatment. Consult the GSK Medical Monitor if second malignancies meet the
             requirements specified above.

          -  Current use of a prohibited medication or planned use of any forbidden medications
             during treatment with GSK3326595.

             respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiac disease, or clinically significant bleeding
             episodes). Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical (aside from malignancy),
             psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subject's safety,
             obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures, in the opinion of
             the Investigator.

          -  Any clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities that may alter
             absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach and/or
             bowels.

          -  History of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive HIV test
             result at screening.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.
             Subjects with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be
             enrolled only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR) is obtained.

          -  Any of the following cardiac abnormalities: 1. History of acute coronary syndromes
             (including myocardial infarction and unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or
             stenting within the past 6 months prior to first dose of study drug. 2. Presence of a
             cardiac pacemaker, 3. Baseline Corrected QT (Fridericia's formula) interval (QTcF)
             &gt;=450 millisecond (msec), 4. Uncontrolled arrhythmias. Subjects with rate-controlled
             atrial fibrillation for &gt;1 month prior to first dose of study drugs may be eligible.
             5. Class II, III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) functional classification system.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
