  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether it is feasible to teach cancer patients undergoing
      chemotherapy to self-administer daily moxibustion to reduce chemotherapy side effects.
      Moxibustion is a therapy used in traditional Chinese medicine that uses heat.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy drugs are used to treat cancer cells. However, they can also affect bone marrow
      and reduce the ability to make certain types of blood cells. Low white blood cell counts can
      leave patients vulnerable to infection. Low red blood cell counts can lead to anaemia and
      feelings of fatigue and weakness. Low platelet counts can lead to bruising and bleeding.
      Blood counts are therefore monitored. If they fall too low, the dose of chemotherapy may be
      reduced or the time between doses extended. This may affect survival as well as quality of
      life.

      Research studies in China and the West suggest that moxibustion applied by a practitioner can
      improve blood counts and immunity, and reduce side effects of chemotherapy. Moxibustion (also
      called moxa) is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that uses heat to stimulate
      acupuncture points. This heat comes from a smouldering herb called mugwort, that is rolled
      into a cigar shape to gently warm the point. Many patients regard this as a pleasant,
      relaxing experience.

      The researchers will teach patients to self-administer moxa to an acupuncture point just
      below the knee. This is a feasibility study to see if patients are willing and able to
      self-administer moxa daily throughout chemotherapy. Patients will keep a moxa diary to record
      their activity. The researchers will also use a questionnaire to assess whether patients see
      themselves as active managers of their health. This may help the researchers to screen
      suitable patients in future studies.

      The researchers will also monitor blood counts, any delays or dose reductions to the
      chemotherapy, and any chemotherapy side effects. Participants will complete quality of life
      questionnaires at intervals during and after their chemotherapy.

      If results are favourable, they will be used to design a randomised controlled trial
      comparing daily moxibustion with a &quot;no treatment&quot; control arm.

    <time_frame>21 days after last chemotherapy cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of teaching cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in the National Health Service (NHS) to self-administer daily indirect moxibustion to St 36 Zusanli, according to a protocol that begins ideally 7 to 10 days prior to the first chemotherapy cycle and continues until 21 days after the final chemotherapy cycle. Participants will complete a Daily Moxa Diary to record their adherence to the daily protocol. They will be asked also to log any days they miss, and give reasons why.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood counts, specifically white blood cells, neutrophils, haemoglobin, and platelets</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout chemotherapy, on 1st day of each cycle, according to chemotherapy schedule. This is usually fortnightly for colorectal (Days 1, 15, 19, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99) and 3-weekly for breast and gynaecologic cancers (Days 1, 22, 43, 64, 85, 106)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood counts will be collected from the participants' medical notes to monitor incidents of neutropenia, anaemia, or thrombocytopenia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Variation to planned chemotherapy schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout chemotherapy, on 1st day of each cycle, according to chemotherapy schedule. This is usually fortnightly for colorectal (Days 1, 15, 19, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99) and 3-weekly for breast and gynaecologic cancers (Days 1, 22, 43, 64, 85, 106)</time_frame>
    <description>Any delays in chemotherapy schedule and the reasons why will be collected from the participants' medical records</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chemotherapy related toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout chemotherapy, on 1st day of each cycle, according to chemotherapy schedule. This is usually fortnightly for colorectal (Days 1, 15, 19, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99) and 3-weekly for breast and gynaecologic cancers (Days 1, 22, 43, 64, 85, 106)</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be collected from the participants' medical records, specifically the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which is the standard form used in the Chemotherapy Suite to record information about any toxicities experienced by the patient resulting from chemotherapy (such as fatigue, vomiting, etc)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health related quality of life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, cycles 2, 3, and 6 (or final cycle), and one month after final cycle: typically Days 15, 29, 71, 127 for colorectal; Days 22, 43, 106, 134 for breast and gynaecological cancers</time_frame>
    <description>The study will seek to identify changes in quality of life, to help with hypothesis generation for future studies. Validated questionnaires from the Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy (FACT) will be used, including:
FACT-G: a 27 item compilation of general questions covering physical, social/family, emotional and functional wellbeing; FACT-N: a 19-item neutropenia subscale designed to capture symptoms and impact on HRQOL related to neutropenia; FACT-An - a 20-item questionnaire assessing fatigue and anaemia-related concerns in people with cancer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient self-management</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, cycle 3, and one month after final cycle: typically Days 29 and 127 for colorectal; Days 43 and 134 for breast and gynaecological cancers</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with a high level of activation are likely to engage in positive health behaviours and participate in managing their health conditions more effectively. The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) will be used to explore whether it is possible to identify patients who will be most likely to follow a daily healthcare regimen.</description>

    <measure>Safety assessed by all incidents including allergies, burns, and other accidents</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, spanning 16 to 28 weeks depending on chemotherapy regimen</time_frame>
