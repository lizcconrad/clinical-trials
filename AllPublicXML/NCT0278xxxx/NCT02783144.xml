      Dexamethasone Added to Levobupivacaine in Ultrasound-guided Tranversus Abdominis Plain Block
      Increased the Duration of Postoperative Analgesia After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.

    <textblock>
      In the ultrasound-guided TAP-Block with Dexamethasone group, dexamethasone is added to
      Levobupivacaine in Ultrasound-guided Tranversus Abdominis Plain Block after Laparoscopic
      Cholecystectomy. In the ultrasound-guided TAP-Block with saline group, saline is added to
      Levobupivacaine in Ultrasound-guided Tranversus Abdominis Plain Block , after Laparoscopic
      Cholecystectomy. In the ultrasound-guided TAP-Block with intravenously dexamethasone group,
      dexamethasone is intravenously injected , after Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy. After surgery
      the extension of postoperative analgesia, incident and rest pain were evaluate in each group.
