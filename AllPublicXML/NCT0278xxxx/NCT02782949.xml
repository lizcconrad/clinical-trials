    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well curcumin works in preventing gastric cancer
      in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and/or gastric intestinal metaplasia. Curcumin is
      an antioxidant compound found in plants that may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the change in gastric mucosal interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) cytokine level,
      quantified by Luminex assay technology, after a 6-month intervention in participants randomly
      assigned to the curcumin (Meriva [curcuminoids]) versus placebo arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of Meriva versus placebo. II. To compare changes
      in Histology Gastric Score (HGS) from baseline to 6 months for Meriva versus placebo.

      III. To compare changes in additional gastric mucosal cytokine/chemokine levels (interleukin
      8 [IL-8], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFalpha], and inducible protein 10 [IP-10];
      quantified by Luminex assay).

      IV. To compare changes in gastric mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage as assessed by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), of the biomarkers 8‐hydroxy‐2'-deoxyguanosine (8‐OHdG) and
      phosphorylated subtype of histone H2A (H2AX).

      V. To explore associations between proinflammatory cytokine genotype status (IL-1beta, IL-8,
      and TNFalpha single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]; characterized at baseline) and the above
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 180 days in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 180 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and 7 months.
