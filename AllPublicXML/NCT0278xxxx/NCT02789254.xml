    <description>For evaluation of the status of the immune system, B, T, and NK cells will be measured frequently throughout the study (immune status). The percentage and absolute numbers as well as the absolute and percent changes from baseline of NK cells will be evaluated (determination of absolute NK cell numbers). If feasible, CD16 and CD69 expression on NK cells will be evaluated at baseline and after antibody exposition (NK cell activation). Pending sample availability, endogenous antibody titers (e.g., tetanus titers) will be measured from remaining PK back-up samples in order to gain information about the influence of FLYSYN treatment on normal plasma cells and immunity.</description>

             upper normal serum level; heart failure NYHA III/IV; severe obstructive or restrictive
             ventilation disorder)
