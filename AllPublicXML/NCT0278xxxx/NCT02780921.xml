  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative chemotherapy is the gold standard treatment in the resectable and advanced
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The efficacy of this strategy has been demonstrated in two
      randomized studies (1,2). It reduces tumour size before surgery, treats micrometastases and
      evaluates chemosensitivity. Disease free and overall survival rates were significantly
      improved with perioperative chemotherapy compared to surgery alone. However, the limitation
      of these studies is that among all patients requiring chemotherapy, almost 70% of patients
      will not have the complete sequence. This sequence is defined by the administration of 2 to 4
      cycles before and 2 to 4 cycles after the surgery, according to the protocol. The major cause
      of absence or impossibility of realization of postoperative chemotherapy was the presence of
      postoperative complication, postoperative serious asthenia and impaired nutritional and
      physical status (1,2). Poor physical condition assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing,
      reflecting a reduced physiological reserve, is predictive of postoperative complications
      (3,4). A physical training, even during a short period and on a various population, is
      beneficial in improving physical condition, cardiopulmonary function and muscular mass of the
      patient (5-8). A prehabilitation over a 6 week period between surgical consultation and
      surgery decreases postoperative morbidity and the hospital stay in cardiovascular surgery but
      no study has ever been performed in the gastric or oesophageal cancer (7,9).

      Prehabilitation revolves around three axes: 1) a physical training based on initial
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (VO2peak, anaerobic threshold (AT) and 6-min walk test
      (6MWT)), 3 times by week, supervised by a physical therapist 2) a nutritional care to ensure
      the compliance of the nutrition program and adapt the nutritional management based on protein
      and energy needs and on the level of spontaneous oral intake and 2) a psychological treatment
      by a psychologist to reduce preoperative anxiety. To our knowledge, no study ever focused on
      the gastroesophageal cancer. The benefit of prehabilitation in this cancer may be
      particularly important because 1) this surgery is associated with a high postoperative
      morbidity (40%, especially respiratory) and mortality (5%) 2) the physical and nutritional
      status of these patients is often precarious (cancer cachexia, gastroesophageal obstruction),
      and 3) the need to preoperative chemotherapy declines physical reserves and is associated
      with a lengthening of the time between consultation and surgery of more than 3 months (10).
      Also, the investigators hypothesize that with a physical training, a personalized nutritional
      support and a psychologist management may decrease postoperative complications, increase
      postoperative nutritional status and so, would allow for more patients to receive their full
      cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma,
      the effect of prehabilitation compared to conventional care, the percentage of patients
      reaching the complete oncological treatment decided in a multidisciplinary tumour board.

      Interventions After the first visit with his surgeon, the patient will be presented at the
      multidisciplinary tumour board to validate the inclusion criteria and to schedule the number
      of cycles of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy. After this step, a second consultation with
      the surgeon will allow to verify all inclusion and exclusion criteria and perform the
      randomization. For the two groups, an initial (before chemotherapy) and final (one week
      before the surgery) evaluation will be performed. The evaluation includes cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing (VO2peak, AT and 6MWT), nutritional evaluation (albumin), bioelectric
      impedance analysis, evaluation of physical activity and ingesta, evaluation of the level of
      depressive symptoms and anxiety with the HADS questionnaire and the quality of life (5Q-FD
      questionnaire).

      Prehab group Exercise intervention: The total-body exercise will consist of up to 1 hour of
      supervised exercise for at least 3 days per week, for a total of 18 cycles, alternating
      between aerobic and resistance training. Exercise intensity will be prescribed based on the
      rate of the 6MWT, AT and VO2peak. The participant will exercise in the presence of the
      kinesiologist who will provide corrective feedback if necessary.

      Nutrition intervention: Initially, a nutritionist will perform a medical and biological
      examination of the nutritional status to provide individualized care to each patient.
      Individual protein requirements will be calculated as 1.2 g of protein per kilogram of body
      weight (adjusted body weight was used for obese patients), as per European Society for
      Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines, regarding surgical patients (12).
      Patients will be asked to consume the protein supplement within one hour of their exercise
      regimen to capitalize on postexercise muscle protein synthesis (13). Then, a dietician will
      assess the compliance of the nutritional support at each cycle of chemotherapy and will
      adjust it if necessary. After the preoperative chemotherapy, a second evaluation by a
      nutritionist will be performed.

      Psychologist intervention: Patients will receive up to a one hour visit with a trained
      psychologist who will provide techniques aiming to reducing anxiety, such as relaxation
      exercises based on imagery and visualization, together with breathing exercises. Each patient
      will practice these exercises with the psychologist initially and at each cycle of
      chemotherapy and at home two to three times per week. The psychologist also provides
      suggestions on how to enhance and reinforce patients' motivation to comply with the exercise
      and nutritional aspects of the intervention.

      Control group:

      The control group will be treated according to conventional care; will not receive any
      specific intervention before surgery except nutritional support and physiotherapy at the
      surgeon's discretion.
