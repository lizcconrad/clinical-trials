  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test feasibility for the delivery and perceptions of a
      lifestyle model for middle-aged and older adults by involving participants in its
      development. The goal of the program is to reduce sedentary behaviour, increase physical
      activity, and increase strength and balance. An optional walking program will be run in
      parallel to emphasize the importance of moving more. Participants will be asked to fill out
      questionnaires on course delivery, content and effect throughout the program and 2-3 recorded
      interviews throughout the study. We will collect measurements of physical performance before
      and after the program.

      This study aims to describe the delivery of a lifestyle model for older adults. Return to
      Everyday Activities in the Community and Home (REACH) is a health promotion program aimed at
      middle-aged and older adults. The goal of REACH is to reduce sedentary behaviour, increase
      physical activity, and increase strength and balance. The REACH program is comprised of six
      sessions which include evidence-based education, behaviour change theory, and activity
      instruction. REACH also teaches goal setting techniques, mindfulness, and encourages active
      community engagement. In this study we are running the REACH program for women aged 55 and
      older alongside a supplementary optional walking program run by SportMedBC. We will gather
      pre- and post-intervention measures of program perceptions, delivery psychological variables
      and physical performance outcomes. We will also collect participant feedback about course
      delivery, content and effect throughout the program. This study will allow us to describe the
      delivery strategies of REACH and involve the participants in the development of the REACH
      program. The optional walking program will emphasize the importance of increasing daily
      physical activity.

    <description>This study will run twice a week over 8 weeks with 6 REACH sessions 8 optional walking program sessions. The optional walking program will be run by SportMedBC and may consist of one or more educational sessions (e.g., nutrition). Each REACH session introduces new topics, strength and balance activities and home practices which progressively build on each other. We will ask participants to provide feedback after each session, and in two to three 30 minutes recorded interviews (in-person or over the telephone) at the end of the study.</description>
