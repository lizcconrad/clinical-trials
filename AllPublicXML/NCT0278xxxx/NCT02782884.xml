      Patients undergoing approximately 10 common outpatient general surgical operations will be
      given a narcotic prescription for a specified number of pills.

      Inpatients who are about to be discharged after surgery or trauma will be given narcotic
      prescriptions for a specified number of pills. Patients will be given a patient report form
      which they will use to record the number of pills they take each day and their daily pain
      score on a scale of 0-10.
