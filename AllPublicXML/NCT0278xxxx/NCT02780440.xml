  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to

        1. Examine the feasibility of a home Mirror therapy (MT) program in the NYC metropolitan
           area;

        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of home MT versus traditional home exercise program; and

        3. Evaluate the superiority of unimanual or bimanual MT intervention protocols for chronic
           stroke subjects with moderate hand deficits. Subjects from occupational therapy at the
           Ambulatory Care Center of NYU Langone Center with a diagnosis of cerebral vascular
           accident (CVA) or stroke will be divided into three (3) groups:

             -  Control Group subjects will participate in standard occupational therapy
                rehabilitation protocol plus a traditional home based exercise program.

             -  Experimental group 1 subjects will participate in standard rehabilitation protocol
                plus unimanual home based mirror therapy program

             -  Experimental group 2 subjects will participate in standard rehabilitation protocol
                plus bimanual home based mirror therapy program.

          -  Cognitively be able to consent to participation in research study

          -  Moderate/severe deficits as per the Fugl-Meyer assessment score from 10-50 and the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Complex medical problems, that would render the subject unable to participate in an

          -  History of pre-existing neurological or psychiatric diseases, orthopedic conditions of
             the upper limbs, or peripheral nerve injuries that render the subject unable to sit or
             to move either upper limb

          -  Hearing and vision impairments which may impede subjects participation in the home
             program

          -  Perceptual deficits such as apraxia, neglect, or agnosias as per clinical evaluation
             which may impede subjects participation in the home program

          -  Botox injection in affected arm/hand within 3 months
