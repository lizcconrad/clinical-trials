  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality rate is increased in patients with epilepsy, and especially among patients with
      drug-resistant epilepsy. This increased mortality is mainly related to the risk of SUDEP
      whose incidence is between 3.5 and 9 per 1,000 for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The
      term SUDEP refers to a sudden death occurring in a patient with epilepsy in whom anamnestic
      and post-mortem evidence does not identify a particular cause. Experimental and clinical data
      strongly suggest that most of SUDEP result from a postictal respiratory dysfunction
      progressing to terminal apnea. Due to the major role of serotonin in regulating breathing
      rhythms and data in animal models of epilepsy, it is envisaged that an alteration of
      serotonergic systems of the brainstem and limbic regions may play a central role in the
      occurrence of SUDEP. The objective of this work is to look for abnormalities of the
      serotonergic transmission within regulatory regions of respiratory and autonomic functions in
      brain samples prospectively collected in patients died from SUDEP.
