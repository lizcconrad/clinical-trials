      The research project is a pilot study to assess the effects of a multi-component intervention
      in increasing physical activity among persons with depression. Individuals meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the 12-week intervention. Intervention
      components will include self-monitoring, Active Living counseling, and facility access. Blood
      samples will be collected at baseline. Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample
      collection will also occur at 2 time points during the intervention (Weeks 7 and 13). Changes
      in physical activity will be assessed using Fitbits to measure weekly minutes of
      moderate/vigorous activity.

    <description>Self-monitoring: Subjects will be provided with a commercially available activity monitor (i.e., Fitbit) and instructed to wear the device daily.
Active Living counseling: The Active Living counseling program will consists of 12 weekly group educational sessions, facilitated by project interventionists. These sessions will involve discussion of topics related to increasing physical activity, including: identifying and overcoming barriers, setting goals, social support, and time management.
Facility Access: Subjects will have access to the exercise lab in the UT Southwestern Depression Center consisting of equipment for aerobic exercise (treadmills, stationary bikes, etc.).</description>
