    <textblock>
      Histological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important prognostic factor
      affecting patient survival. It has been divided into four grades from I to IV on the basis of
      histological differentiation. Grade I is the best differentiated consisting of small tumor
      cells arranged in thin trabeculae. Cells with higher grade are larger and less differentiated
      with hyperchromatic nuclei and loss of trabecular pattern.

      Ultrasound is an imaging modality frequently used to evaluate liver tumors because of its
      convenience, real-time, less expensive and no radiation exposure. However, ultrasonographic
      evaluation by conventional B-mode image is semi quantitative and subjective. It still cannot
      replace liver biopsy for the evaluation of HCC.

      This study is aimed to quantify the image characters of B-mode image and the scatterer
      properties using Nakagami distribution. Nakagami parameter is a general model to describe the
      distribution of scatterers. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that Nakagami parameter
      may also reflect the histological changes in different grades of HCC.

      In this study, the resected HCC tumor samples will be collected from the participants who are
      going to receive surgical resection, and the tumor US images and Nakagami values will be
      obtained via the single-element ultrasound system. The correlation between the ultrasound
      backscatter parameter and the differentiation grade will be analyzed.
