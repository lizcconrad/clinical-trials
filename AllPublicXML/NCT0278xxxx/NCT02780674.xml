  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MEDI7734 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to and causes temporary depletion of
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a type of white blood cell. The objectives of this study
      are to evaluate the safety, drug levels, and pDC levels in subjects who are given a single
      injection of MEDI7734 or a placebo.

      The study will be conducted in subjects with at least one of the five following autoimmune
      diseases: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, or
      systemic sclerosis.

      After a screening period, subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose
      of MEDI7734 or matching placebo, administered as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.
      After that, subjects will be evaluated periodically at the study site over at least the next
      85 days.
