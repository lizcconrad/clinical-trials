    <textblock>
      At a esophagal pH-monitoring will the classic 24-hour measurement be extended to 48 hours.
      During the first 24 hours are the measurements without medication. After 24 hours the
      treatment will be started with Gaviscon and will the next 24 hours the measurements under the
      medication happen. Normally is the medication required after the measurements. With this
      study the investigators will have multiple measurement points to compare.

      This is an interventional, with questionnaires. 25 participants will be included.

      Parents and children must be willing to have the esophagal pH-monitoring for 48 hours instead
      of 24 hours.

      The restrictions are (like any other esophagal pH-monitoring) :

      Do not detach the probe, no bath or shower, no bouncy castle, no swimming pool, ....

      Give your child time to get used to the probe. Give your child no carbonated beverages, limit
      sweets, avoid chewing gum!

      Not study specific procedures : there will be placed a probe for the oesophagal pH-monitoring
      and this will be checked on children's radiology.

      study specific procedures : questionnaires at specific times : Before start : SF 36 Every 6
      hours during 48hours : FLACC Satisfaction scale at the start, after 1 day and after 2 days

      Flowchart time 0: obtaining ICF, signed by both parents, placing of probe, explanation of
      questionnaires, completing SF36 and satisfaction scale time 6: FLACC time 12: FLACC time 18:
      FLACC time 24: FLACC, satisfaction scale, reading out pH monitoring from the first 24 hours,
      then starting of Gaviscon in function of the result. The Gaviscon is supplied by the service,
      at no cost to the patient time 30: FLACC time 36: FLACC time 42: FLACC time 48: FLACC,
      satisfaction scale, remove pH monitoring

      Calculation of the number of participants :

      since there is never such a study was carried out, we started this pilot study. An analysis
      will be carried out after 15 patients.

      Analysis of the results :

      the results of the first and second 24 hour data will be compared (automatically by computer
      analysis).
