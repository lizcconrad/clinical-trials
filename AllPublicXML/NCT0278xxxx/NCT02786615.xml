  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the disproportionate representation of men who have sex with men (MSM)
      in the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) pandemic
      in Kazakhstan, a country that has seen some of the largest growth in new HIV infections since
      the turn of the century. Using a stepped wedge trial across 4 cities in Kazakhstan, the
      proposed study will test a strategic and innovative social network-based intervention for MSM
      who use drugs in Kazakhstan as a strategy to increase their numbers in the HIV continuum of
      care as well as services that address issues that co-occur with HIV, including drug abuse,
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection, and other sexually transmitted infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is designed to utilize MSM as experts and leverage social network processes
      to increase the number of MSM in Kazakhstan to be engaged in the HIV continuum of care. The
      unit of randomization will be a city, with the timing of roll-out of the social network-based
      intervention in each of the study's cities—Almaty, Astana, Pavlodar, and Shymkent—under
      experimental control. Receipt/delivery of an intervention to enrolled participants will
      depend on whether the city is in the intervention delivery phase or not. If a participant is
      in a city during a time period where the intervention is not being delivered then for that
      time period, the participant is in the control condition. If the participant is in a city
      during a time period where the intervention is being delivered then the participant (in fact,
      all participants in that city) will be considered assigned to the intervention group at that
      time. In theory, all participants will have the opportunity to experience and receive the
      intervention. Some participants will be enrolled after the intervention has been rolled out
      in the city in which they reside; thus, they will only experience the intervention condition
      and not the control condition.
