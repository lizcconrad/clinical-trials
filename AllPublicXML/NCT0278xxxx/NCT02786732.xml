      The study is up to 5 years. If you qualify, you will be randomized into 1 of 4 groups. Two
      groups will get brodalumab(1 group will get 210milligrams of brodalumab at each dose and the
      other group will get 140 milligrams of brodalumab at each dose), one group will get
      ustekinumab, and one group will get placebo.
