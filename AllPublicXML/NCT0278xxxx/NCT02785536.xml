  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US
      primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share
      of smokers in African American and lower socioeconomic (SES) groups. Unlike many other health
      risk behaviors, tobacco-related health disparities are increasing despite a large treatment
      network of free telephone and in-person counseling services, perhaps due to significant
      disparities in treatment outcomes. The goal of this project is to revise the standard
      treatment for tobacco dependence to address key factors associated with treatment outcome
      disparities and more fully meet the needs of lower SES and African American smokers thereby
      reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes, halting the
      alarming increase in tobacco-related health disparities, and reducing a leading cause of
      racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US.

      This study will be conducted in five phases. Each phase utilizes the results from the
      previous phase. Each phase is also associated with at least one specific aim.

      Phase One (Aim One): Complete a revised version of a standard, widely utilized,
      multi-component, cognitive-behavior treatment manual for tobacco dependence to include
      commonly utilized, cognitive-behavioral interventions that specifically address the key
      factors associated with treatment outcome disparities.

      Phase Two (Aim Two): Using the PEN-3 Model,1-3 target and tailor RITCh_1 to address the needs
      of smokers who are of lower SES as well as smokers who are minority, particularly African
      American. In this preparatory activity, the research team will tailor and target RITCh_1
      using this well-accepted theoretical model and produce the second draft of the revised
      treatment, called RITCh_2. Human subjects are not involved with this phase of the research.
      No data will be collected.

      Phase Three (Aim Three): Pilot test RITCh_2 with three treatment groups (5-10 participants
      per group) to assess understandability and acceptability and to ensure that it can be
      delivered in the same 60-minute per session time frame as the standard treatment. This is a
      qualitative study in which the investigators will pilot test RITCh_2 with 21 participants who
      will be consented as pilot study participants. See Pilot Study Informed Consent Form. Contact
      and demographic information will be collected from participants, but not baseline and outcome
      assessments. Participant feedback will be provided in a group format and will not be linked
      to identifying information. The research team will incorporate participant feedback into a
      third draft of the revised treatment, RITCh_3.

      Phase Four (Aim Four): Compare the effects of SES on treatment outcomes in a
      socioeconomically and racially diverse group of participants treated with RITCh_3 and the
      standard treatment. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (n=253)
      comparing the efficacy of RITCh_3 to the standard treatment. Investigators will use a
      randomized treatment design and two methods for assessing abstinence (latency to relapse and
      six-month point prevalence abstinence rates) to compare the effects of SES and treatment
      condition on treatment outcomes. Investigators expect RITCh_3 to demonstrate fewer treatment
      outcome disparities than standard treatment.

      Phase Five (Aim Five): Compare the effects of RITCH_3 and standard treatment on each of the
      key factors associated with treatment outcome disparities (see Aim One and Table 1). Using
      analysis of covariance and logistic regression as appropriate, investigators will analyze the
      effects of treatment condition on each of the key factors (see Table 1). The investigators
      expect participants treated with RITCh_3 to demonstrate more improvement on each of the key
      factors than participants treated with standard treatment.

    <description>The standard treatment was a well-established, manual-driven, multicomponent CBT for tobacco dependence that has been delivered in multiple modalities (i.e., group, individual, and telephone), used in numerous studies, and considered intensive, comprehensive, and consistent with the Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline.</description>

    <description>The RITCh treatment is an adaptation of the standard treatment which proactively addresses the needs and experiences of a diverse group of lower SES smokers as well as ensures that the treatment is culturally congruent and experientially resonant for African Americans while maintaining the same amount of treatment contact (i.e., six one-hour sessions).</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>RITCh Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>The RITCh treatment increased the emphasis on stress management, negative affect management and utilized language and activities to foster an internal locus of control. Activities were added to address impulsive decision-making, develop home smoking policies, increase the positive valance of treatment, and address barriers to use of the nicotine patches. The treatment materials were also tailored with numerous examples relevant to lower SES groups and African Americans. For example: stress management components specifically address financial stress, discrimination, and micro-aggressions; treatment utilization components include reinforcing the value of individual contributions to the group, structured positive feedback among group members at every session, sending &quot;missed you&quot; post cards signed by all group members to participants who miss a treatment session, specifically addressing myths about nicotine patch use, and practicing the application of nicotine patches together.</description>

    <description>The components of the standard treatment include education and activities in which participants gain an understanding of the biopsychosocial underpinnings of tobacco dependence and the cue-urge-response cycle of smoking. Interventions include self-monitoring, guided scheduled rate reduction, treatment goal setting, medication education, stress management, cognitive and behavioral strategies for managing cravings and cues, problem-solving, conflict management, enhancing social support, relapse prevention, and cigarette refusal training. A participant workbook was provided that corresponded to the activities in the treatment sessions.</description>
