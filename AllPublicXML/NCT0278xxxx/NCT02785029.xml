  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-arm clinical multicenter study intends to measure normal structural
      parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, and the
      macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is conducted in
      African-American descent volunteers. The main goal of the study is to provide the range of
      these structural parameters in normal eyes.

      This prospective, single-arm clinical multicenter study intends to measure normal structural
      parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, and the
      macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is conducted in
      African-American descent volunteers. The main goal of the study is to provide the range of
      these structural parameters in normal eyes. The study will include at least 240 normal
      volunteers; up to 10 study sites will recruit subjects. Overall an approximately equal age
      distribution from 18 to 90 years and an approximately equal number of females and males will
      be enrolled (approximately 40-60% females in each age group). All subjects will undergo
      Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination, disc photography and
      visual field testing in one single visit, if possible. Repeated perimetry or Spectralis scans
      may be performed at a second visit within 30 days of the initial visit. All examinations
      performed on the subjects are non-significant risk procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, give consent, and to follow
             instructions.

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Age ≥18 to 90.

          -  Healthy eye without prior intraocular surgery (except cataract surgery and Laser in
             Situ Keratomileusis) and without clinically significant vitreal, retinal or choroidal
             diseases, clinically significant diabetic retinopathy (subject may have diabetes), or
             disease of the optic nerve. Small drusen are acceptable in older subjects.

          -  Black or African-American decent (self-reported)

          -  Negative history of glaucoma (not including family history)

          -  Intraocular pressure ≤21mmHg.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity ≥20/40.

          -  Refraction between +6 and -6 diopters and astigmatism ≤ 2 diopters.

          -  Axial length ≤ 26.0 mm (by optical biometry)

          -  Normal visual field with Glaucoma Hemifield Test and Mean Deviation within normal
             limits or not abnormal visual field by judgment of the ophthalmologist / optometrist

          -  Clinically normal appearance of the optic disc, with normal appearing neuroretinal rim
             with respect to color and shape. The optic disc is examined ophthalmoscopically and by
             evaluation of stereo photographs.

          -  If both eyes are eligible, both eyes enter the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vulnerable subjects (as defined in ISO 14155 GCP) with the exception of employees of
             the site, and, if applicable, students of the respective university. Staff that is
             listed on the delegation form are excluded from participation.

          -  Subjects unable to read or write

          -  Unreliable visual field. The reliability indices should be used as guide as well as
             the perimetrist's notes.

          -  Unusable disc stereo photos.

          -  Inability to undergo the tests.

          -  Insufficient quality of Spectralis OCT images (this is not determined until after
             Spectralis OCT examination, and is an unusual circumstance).

        Minimum requirements are:

          -  Retina completely included in image frame,

          -  Quality Score ≥ 20 in the stored ART mean images, and

          -  For ONH-R scan: Center position error ≤ 100 μm.
