    <textblock>
      S09A is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study
      examining the efficacy and safety of a Sucraid (sacrosidase) Oral Solution in comparison to a
      placebo in 150-200 subjects with chronic diarrhea possibly attributable to sucrase
      deficiency.
