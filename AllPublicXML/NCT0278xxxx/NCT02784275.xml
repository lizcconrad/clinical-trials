  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cyclo-Z for the treatment of subjects with obese type 2
      diabetes.

      The study will consist of 3 phases:

        -  Screening phase (2 weeks)

        -  Treatment phase (12 weeks)

        -  Follow-up phase (2 weeks)

      Following a 2-week screening period, subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria
      will be randomly assigned into one of the following treatment arms:

        -  Dose A: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 3 mg CHP - 16 subjects

        -  Dose B: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 9 mg CHP - 16 subjects

        -  Dose C: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 15 mg CHP - 16 subjects

        -  Dose D: Placebo - 16 subjects

      The assigned dose will be orally administered to subjects once a day before bedtime for 12
      consecutive weeks. After the randomization at Week 0 (Visit 2), subjects will visit their
      respective trial sites at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 (Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).
