  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, observational, single center study in which subjects
      that have surgically-correctable Stress Urinary Incontinence undergo a suburethral sling
      operative procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will collect preoperative urologic testing, medical history, and subject quality of
      life patient questionnaires. Intraoperative procedural data will be collected.

      Postoperative complications, urologic, testing, and subject questionnaires will be collected
      at intervals. The anatomic position of the device will be characterize by introital
      ultrasound testing.

    <description>Patients are classified as cured if the postoperative cough test (see Outcome 4 below) is negative and the degree of subjective suffering (see Outcome 2 below) improves to over 90% (VAS score of 0 or 1). Criteria for improvement are involuntary loss of only a few drops of urine during straining and an improvement of the degree of suffering to over 75% (VAS score of 2 or 3). All other patients are classified as therapeutic failures (even if they show marked improvement of one of the parameters compared with their preoperative status).</description>
