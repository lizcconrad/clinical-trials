          -  Have a life expectancy of ≥3 months.

          -  Have resolution, except where otherwise stated in the inclusion criteria, of all
             clinically significant toxic effects of prior systemic cancer therapy, surgery, or
             radiotherapy to Grade ≤1 by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with an EGFR monoclonal antibody (except for past treatment for
             squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck or metastatic colorectal cancer).

          -  Previous treatment with osimertinib or third generation EGFR TKIs.

          -  Participants with symptomatic or growing brain metastases less than 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

             requiring treatment with steroid prior to study enrollment, or any evidence of
             clinically active ILD.

          -  Have a significant bleeding disorder or vasculitis or had a Grade ≥3 bleeding episode
             within 12 weeks prior to enrollment. Participants with a history of gross hemoptysis

                  anagrelide).

          -  Have radiologically documented evidence of major blood vessel invasion or encasement
             by cancer.

             radiation within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Have abnormal cardiac findings.

          -  Have undergone chest irradiation within 2 weeks prior to study drug administration,
