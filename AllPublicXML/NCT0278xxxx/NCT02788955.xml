    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to test the efficacy of diets of different amounts of protein and
      calories for patients with cancer. We hypothesize that nutritional deficits play a
      significant role in muscle loss and that nutritional therapy is an important first step in
      reversing or preventing muscle loss and maintaining/improving physical function, tolerance to
      treatment and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) is a common issue among cancer patients and adequate
      nutrient intake is pivotal to maintain muscle mass. Yet, optimal amounts of protein are
      undefined for preventing or treating sarcopenia in people with cancer as most methodological
      approaches to assess protein requirements are expensive, burdensome and unfeasible for this
      population. This study's overarching goal is to investigate the efficacy of diets of
      different protein content on: 1) muscle mass maintenance (primary endpoint); and 2)
      improvements on physical function in cancer patients capable of oral nutrition support.
      Additional study measurements include: energy metabolism (including total body), body
      composition using multi-compartment models, blood biomarkers, tolerance to treatment, quality
      of life and overall prognosis.

      In a randomized controlled trial approach, we will employ high protein feeding (2 g/kg/d,
      n=18) versus a standard recommendation (1 g/kg/d, n=18) in patients with newly diagnosed
      colorectal cancer for 12 weeks. Prescribed energy intakes will be framed by the amount of
      calories to meet energy needs and to support protein synthesis, but prevent fat mass gain.
      Carbohydrate, fat and protein intake will be adjusted throughout the intervention to achieve
      the desired rate and amount of energy and protein intake. An oral protein powder supplement
      made from high-quality whey protein, as well as portions of pre-cooked meat will be provided
      to the participants to help increase their protein intake as needed. A multivitamin will be
      given to all participants throughout the study. Participants will receive weekly calls from
      the study coordinator to ensure adherence to the dietary intervention.
