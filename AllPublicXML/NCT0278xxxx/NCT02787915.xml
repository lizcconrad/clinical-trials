      This trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of autologous type-1 polarized
      dendritic cell vaccines (patients' autologous DC1s loaded with multiple antigens CTL epitope
      peptide complexes), after radical resection for patients with stage III-IV renal cell
      carcinoma. Autologous cytotoxic of T lymphocytes (CTL) induced by type-1 polarized dendritic
      cells (DC1) loaded with MAGE-3/MAGE-4/survivin/ her2 /COX-2 CTL epitope peptides .

      All participants judged to have RCC and considered able to conduct apheresis. Immunotherapy
      regimen will include subcutaneous injection (3million cells) DC1 vaccines and intravenous
      infusion CTL cells. On day 0,participants conduct apheresis for 50-60ml. PBMCs were separated
      from paiticipants by density gradient centrifugation. The adherent cells were initiated into
      DC followed by the particular combination of cytokines to promote DC type-1 polarization. On
      day 6, the synthetic CTL epitope peptides were added into the culture for autologous DCs for
      another 24h. Then one half of DC1s were resuspended in 1ml normal saline for clinical
      multi-point injection near lymph nodes. The remaining half were cocultured with autologous T
      cells for another 7 days to induce antigen-specific CTL cells. The applied TAAs included
      MAGE-3/ MAGE-4/ survivin/ her2 /ect. On day 14, after quality inspection qualified, CTL cells
      were harvested and resuspended in 100ml normal saline and 2% autologous plasma for clinical
      intravenous infusion, once a day for 3 days. In order to avoid overlap between experimental
      immunotherapy and potential adjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy may start at least 2 weeks
      after completion of the cycle of immunotherapy. The 2nd cycle of immunotherapy may start at
      least 4weeks after the completion of chemotherapy.
