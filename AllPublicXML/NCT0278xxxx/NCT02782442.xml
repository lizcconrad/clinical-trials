    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use remote methods and scalable interactive neurotechnology
      to generate important data on the potential for remote targeted cognitive treatment in people
      with schizophrenia. The investigators will perform a double-blind randomized control trial in
      120 participants with schizophrenia, comparing: 1) An evidence-based structured program of 40
      hours of on-line auditory and social cognitive training (exercises over 12 weeks (-3.5 hours
      per week), delivered with an innovative digital application which provides users with a
      motivation coach to set personalized goals and with secure social networking for peer
      support, Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME) ; vs.2) A
      control condition of free-choice on-line cognitive exercises, encouraged at 3.5 hours per
      week over 12 weeks, delivered with a standard commercial goal-setting app, &quot;Daily Goals&quot;.

      A double-blind randomized control trial in schizophrenia, comparing: 1) The treatment
      condition-- 40 hours of cognitive training over 12 weeks (~3.5 hours per week) in a
      structured program of 10 hours of social cognition exercises followed by 30 hours of auditory
      processing exercises, combined with the Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational
      Enhancement (PRIME) coaching app; or 2) The active control condition-- free-choice access to
      a broad range of cognitive exercises across various domains, encouraged at 3.5 hours per week
      over 12 weeks, combined with the commercial Daily Goals app. The investigators will recruit
      204 schizophrenia subjects to be stratified by age (18-40, 40-60) and education (&lt;14 years,
      &gt;14 years) and randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. Subjects and assessors will be
      blind to group assignment. The investigators will perform both per protocol and
      intent-to-treat analyses.
