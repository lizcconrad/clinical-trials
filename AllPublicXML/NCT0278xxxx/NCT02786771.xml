      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Spire and Muse on stress
      management. The study will be implemented as a 2-arm randomized controlled pilot study to
      assess the effect of either device on stress management from the end of baseline to closeout.

      Both Muse and Spire are recent technologies that could improve our understanding of stress
      management and enhance quality of healthcare. The goal of this study is to evaluate if Spire
      and Muse help individuals self-manage stress. Spire has been designed as a discrete clip-on
      tracker that monitors changes in respiration rate. With the companion app, this device
      displays breathing rates in real time and alerts the user through push notification in times
      of tension. Studies show that controlled breathing reduces stress. On the other hand, Muse is
      a headset device that uses EEG (electroencephalogram) sensors that measures electric brain
      frequencies. Muse guides the user in a form of simplified meditation by giving feedback in
      real time (i.e. calm, neutral, active) and audio clues to improve concentration. Previous
      studies have shown that engaging in meditation has the potential to reduce anxiety and
      stress.

    <measure>Difference in Perceived Stress and Stress Resilience From Enrollment to Closeout</measure>
    <time_frame>total of 8 weeks (2 weeks of baseline + 6 weeks of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The change of perceived stress and stress resilience within and between Group 1 and 2 from enrollment to closeout.
The change of perceived stress is measured by the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (a validated psychological instrument of 14 items), each each rated on a 5 point scale(0-4) for measuring the respondent's perception of stress in the past month.The PSS-14 ranges from 0 to a high score of 56, with a higher score indicating more stress (worse outcome).
The change of stress resilience is measured by the Connor-Davidson Stress Resilience Scale (25 items). It evaluates different aspects of stress coping ability that seeks to understand how well respondents would be able to buffer adverse conditions and cope with stress, each rated on a 5 point scale (0-4). The CD-RISC ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing better stress resilience (a better outcome).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a Spire device with user-feedback switched off within 4 days of enrollment in the study (shipped within 2 business days after they finish enrollment survey). Participants will be given 4 days, after enrollment, to set up their device before the 2 weeks of baseline. The 2 week baseline will start 4 days after enrollment. After two weeks of baseline with user-feedback off (and a 3 day transition period), participants will turn on the user-feedback for the Spire device which would provide a relaxation aid for the participant for the 6 remaining weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will also receive Spire device to assess two weeks of baseline stress levels (with user-feedback off). Participants will be given 4 days, after enrollment, to set up their device before the 2 weeks of baseline. The 2 week baseline will start 4 days after enrollment. After these two weeks, participants will continue to use the Spire device with user feedback off for the remaining 6 weeks while they use the Muse device to manage stress through meditation. They will receive the Muse device 3 days before the end of baseline period with set up instructions and will utilize the three last days of baseline to set up their Muse device, Meditation will begin at the end of baseline (week three) and will continue for the remaining 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Difference in Perceived Stress and Stress Resilience From Enrollment to Closeout</title>
        <description>The change of perceived stress and stress resilience within and between Group 1 and 2 from enrollment to closeout.
The change of perceived stress is measured by the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (a validated psychological instrument of 14 items), each each rated on a 5 point scale(0-4) for measuring the respondent’s perception of stress in the past month.The PSS-14 ranges from 0 to a high score of 56, with a higher score indicating more stress (worse outcome).
The change of stress resilience is measured by the Connor-Davidson Stress Resilience Scale (25 items). It evaluates different aspects of stress coping ability that seeks to understand how well respondents would be able to buffer adverse conditions and cope with stress, each rated on a 5 point scale (0-4). The CD-RISC ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing better stress resilience (a better outcome).</description>

            <description>Participants will receive a Spire device with user-feedback switched off within 4 days of enrollment in the study (shipped within 2 business days after they finish enrollment survey). Participants will be given 4 days, after enrollment, to set up their device before the 2 weeks of baseline. The 2 week baseline will start 4 days after enrollment. After two weeks of baseline with user-feedback off (and a 3 day transition period), participants will turn on the user-feedback for the Spire device which would provide a relaxation aid for the participant for the 6 remaining weeks.

            <description>Participants in this group will also receive Spire device to assess two weeks of baseline stress levels (with user-feedback off). Participants will be given 4 days, after enrollment, to set up their device before the 2 weeks of baseline. The 2 week baseline will start 4 days after enrollment. After these two weeks, participants will continue to use the Spire device with user feedback off for the remaining 6 weeks while they use the Muse device to manage stress through meditation. They will receive the Muse device 3 days before the end of baseline period with set up instructions and will utilize the three last days of baseline to set up their Muse device, Meditation will begin at the end of baseline (week three) and will continue for the remaining 6 weeks.

          <description>Participants will receive a Spire device with user-feedback switched off within 4 days of enrollment in the study (shipped within 2 business days after they finish enrollment survey). Participants will be given 4 days, after enrollment, to set up their device before the 2 weeks of baseline. The 2 week baseline will start 4 days after enrollment. After two weeks of baseline with user-feedback off (and a 3 day transition period), participants will turn on the user-feedback for the Spire device which would provide a relaxation aid for the participant for the 6 remaining weeks.

          <title>Group 2</title>
          <description>Participants in this group will also receive Spire device to assess two weeks of baseline stress levels (with user-feedback off). Participants will be given 4 days, after enrollment, to set up their device before the 2 weeks of baseline. The 2 week baseline will start 4 days after enrollment. After these two weeks, participants will continue to use the Spire device with user feedback off for the remaining 6 weeks while they use the Muse device to manage stress through meditation. They will receive the Muse device 3 days before the end of baseline period with set up instructions and will utilize the three last days of baseline to set up their Muse device, Meditation will begin at the end of baseline (week three) and will continue for the remaining 6 weeks.
