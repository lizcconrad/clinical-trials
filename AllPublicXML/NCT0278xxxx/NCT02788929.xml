  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Design: Single center, prospective, randomized study that will compare activity levels in
      patients who complete cardiac rehabilitation after clinically indicated percutaneous coronary
      intervention with and without use of the wrist-worn Fitbit Charge HR device and mobile
      platform application.

      Primary Endpoint: The average number of steps taken per day will serve as the main marker of
      daily physical activity.

      Control: Patients who do not receive the device (Fitbit Charge HR).

      Secondary Endpoints: (1) change in daily energy expenditure (2) change in number of activity
      and sedentary bouts (3) change in sleep efficiency (4) change in weekly time of
      moderate/vigorous physical activity (5) change in quality of life (6) change in indicators of
      depression (7) change in medication adherence(8) change in HDL and LDL cholesterol (9) change
      in BMI and waist circumference (10) change in resting heart rate and blood pressure (11)
      change in exercise stress test performance (timeframe for all: baseline - 12 weeks)
