  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An exploratory, feasibility and proof-of-concept study to evaluate the capability of a rectal
      probe scintigraphy device (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent
      (ProstaScintÂ®; as a surrogate marker for prostate cancer) in patients who have undergone a
      radical prostatectomy for their disease, patients with multiple negative prostate biopsies
      and patients with known primary prostate cancer. Developed by Hybridyne Imaging Technologies,
      Inc. ProxiScanTM is a small cadmium zinc telluride (CST)-based compact gamma camera. It is
      the same size as a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS), currently used for prostate biopsy
      guidance. Men with multiple positive biopsies will be considered controls. Prostate cancer
      sextant biopsy histology results will be correlated with ProxiScanTM, TRUS, MRI and SPECT/CT.
      The investigators hypothesize that it will be safe and feasible to utilize a rectal probe
      scintigraphy (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific ProstaScintÂ®, thus identifying and
      localizing the tumour sites within the prostate and surrounding areas.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Group 1: Rising PSA (biochemical failure) following radical prostatectomy. Group 2: Rising
        PSA (&gt;10ng/ml) and/or abnormal digital rectal exam suspicious for prostate cancer.
        Previously negative prostate biopsies.

        Group 3: Scheduled biopsy for known PCa (patient on AS). At least 1 previously positive
        prostate biopsy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment
        into the study:

          -  Sufficient time period to complete the imaging protocol and 7 to 9 day safety
             follow-up assessment without therapeutic intervention.

          -  Patient is judged by the Investigator to have the initiative and means to provide
             written consent and be compliant with the protocol and be able and commits to make the
             required study visits.

          -  Ambulatory with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (see appendix section).

          -  Patient is between 35 and 75 years of age.

             treatment, biologic treatment and/or local ablative treatment for cancer within the
             interval of study participation.

          -  Patients with pacemakers, neurostimulators, and foreign metal bodies will be excluded

             anti-coagulation, no rectum, etc.)

          -  Clinical evidence of prostatitis, or other benign prostate gland abnormality, that
             would explain elevated PSA and/or (digital rectal exam) DRE findings.

          -  Active malignancy or therapy for malignancy within 6 months, other than basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Patient received a radiopharmaceutical which was within 5 physical half-lives at the
