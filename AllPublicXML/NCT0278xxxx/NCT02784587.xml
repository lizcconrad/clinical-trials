  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based upon Northern New England Cardiovascular Study Group data, the rate of post operative
      atrial fibrillation (POAF) requiring treatment following coronary artery bypass grafting
      (CABG) at Maine Medical Center (MMC) is currently 30%. Nationally, POAF occurs in up to 40%
      of patients post CABG, 50% of patients after valve surgery, 64% of patients post mitral valve
      and CABG and 49% after aortic valve replacement. Atrial fibrillation worsens a patient's
      hemodynamic status and increases the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF), embolic events
      and longer ICU stays leading to increased patient morbidity and strain on financial
      resources. In the U.S., POAF carries a higher risk of stroke (37% OR 2.0 in-hospital
      mortality (OR = 1.7), worsened survival (74% versus 87%), and an additional 4.9 days and
      $10,000-$11,500 in hospital stay costs.

      Atrial fibrillation requires both an initiation trigger and favorable environment for
      maintenance and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems play important roles in
      this regard. Unfortunately, the precise mechanisms of POAF are still being investigated. This
      postoperative complication has persisted in spite of efforts to mitigate it pharmacologically
      with beta blockers and amiodarone, an experience shared by most other cardiac surgery
      centers.

      The stellate ganglion is formed by the fusion of the inferior cervical sympathetic ganglion
      and first thoracic sympathetic ganglion. By modulating the sympathetic component of the
      autonomic nervous system, stellate ganglion stimulation has been shown to facilitate
      induction of atrial fibrillation while ablation may reduce or prevent episodes. Human studies
      have further supported this model.

      Preliminary studies of perioperative stellate ganglion block (SGB) in cardiac surgery suggest
      that this technique may reduce or prevent episodes of POAF requiring treatment. The
      investigator's ultimate goal is to determine whether SGB reduces the incidence of POAF in
      specific cardiac surgery populations at MMC. First, however, the investigator proposes to
      test the hypothesis that SGB, performed perioperatively by cardiac anesthesiologists in a
      population of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, is both safe and clinically feasible.

    <textblock>
      Patients at MMC undergoing transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TA TAVR)
      routinely receive a paravertebral block for analgesia. This has the added benefit of
      providing a unilateral sympathectomy which may be analogous to a stellate ganglion block,
      albeit via a different technique. In a recent retrospective chart review, TA TAVR block
      patients showed a decreased rate of new onset POAF. Furthermore, when studying whether
      pre-emptive stellate ganglion block increases the patency of radial artery grafts in coronary
      bypass surgery, researchers found a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.048) in atrial
      fibrillation and the use of anti-arrhythmic agents. Unfortunately, this was a secondary
      outcome in a small patient population and, while suggestive, the study was not sufficiently
      powered to draw a definitive conclusion. Importantly, however, they reported no complications
      related to the block in the fifty patients who received an intervention. Lastly, an
      additional study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of stellate ganglion mapping and
      ablation during CABG while also suggesting a clinically significant effect on POAF, but used
      a permanent, technically complex and time intensive procedure.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that perioperative SGB in cardiac surgery is clinically
      efficient and efficacious. To address this, the investigator will:

        1. Recruit 49 patients to undergo perioperative SGB during prior to cardiac surgery (CABG,
           CABG/Aortic Valve Replacement, Aortic Valve Replacement).

        2. Monitor the safety of SGB using post procedure surface ultrasound of the neck and active
           solicitation on Post-op Day (POD) 0 and 1 for identified complications, in addition to
           routine clinical monitoring.

        3. Assess clinical feasibility of SGB by measuring procedural efficacy and efficiency:

             1. Efficacy will be measured using post procedure hand temperature; success is
                indicated by an increase greater than 1 degree Celsius.

             2. Efficiency will be measured as the time to complete the block and the time added to
                the standard anesthesia induction sequence, as a proportion of total time in the
                operating room.

      Significance: If the investigator is able to demonstrate that perioperative SGB in cardiac
      surgery is safe and clinically feasible, the next step will be to design a study to
      investigate the effect of SGB on POAF incidence (and thereby its attendant morbidity,
      mortality and costs) in this clinical population.

    <description>After induction of general anesthesia, patients will receive a stellate ganglion block using a standard and well described paratracheal technique, which typically requires about 3 minutes to perform. The patient's head will be extended and a 4-5-cm, 22-gauge needle inserted at the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle just below the level of the cricoid cartilage at the level of the transverse process of C6 (Chassaignac's tubercle) or C7 (3-5 cm above the clavicle). The non-operative hand will retract the muscle together with the carotid sheath prior to needle insertion. After advancing to the transverse process the needle will be withdrawn 2-3 mm prior to injection. A negative aspiration test will be performed in two planes before a 1-ml test dose is used to exclude unintentional intravascular injection (vertebral or subclavian arteries) or subarachnoid injection into the dural sleeve.4 A total of 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected.</description>
