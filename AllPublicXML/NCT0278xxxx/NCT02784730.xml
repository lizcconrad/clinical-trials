  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) and port-a-cath (PAC) are the most commonly
      medical devices used for the administration of chemotherapy.

      Placement of these devices via central venous access is sometimes responsible for
      complications.

      The incidence of these complications is correlated with the device holding time.

      A strategy of iterative PICC placement could significantly reduce these complications.
