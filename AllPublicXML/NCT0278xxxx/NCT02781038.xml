  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who smoke and suffer from fractures are worse off than those who do not smoke.
      Orthopaedic patients represent a group that can benefit from physician contributions to
      smoking cessation, and a special opportunity to cue this can begin with the orthopaedic
      surgeon in the acute setting. However, the best way to appropriately counsel these patients
      and assess the impact as a teachable moment remains undetermined.

      If the patient self-identifies as a smoker, the investigators will consent and randomize to
      receive the intervention or not. Either way, all will receive a baseline attitude survey. The
      patient will be given a series of questions that target the areas of interest noted in the
      model. At some point in their hospitalization, preferably at least one day later and no
      greater than one week later, the patients will be given the teaching intervention (or not),
      and receive another attitude survey. After discharge, the patients will be expected in
      orthopaedic follow up clinic. At that time they will receive another attitude survey. If
      unable to deliver at that time, they will be contacted by phone or sought at their second
      clinic follow up.
