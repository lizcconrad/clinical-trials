  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized parallel group trial designed to evaluate the impact of implementing
      geriatrician-prescribed interventions based on the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA),
      on the ability to deliver adequate chemotherapy treatment, as measured by relative dose
      intensity (RDI).

    <textblock>
      This randomized parallel group trial is designed to evaluate the impact of implementing
      geriatrician-prescribed interventions, on the ability to deliver adequate chemotherapy
      treatment, as measured by RDI of at least 85%, in a cohort of vulnerable [≥1 deficit
      identified at CGA and/or ≥1 comorbidity Grade 3-4 as defined by Cumulative Illness Rating
      Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G)] elderly cancer patients with early stage or advanced solid
      organ malignancies.

      Patients will be randomized using a 2:1 allocation to Arm A: routine oncological care plus
      geriatric intervention or Arm B: routine oncological care

    <description>Relative dose intensity (RDI) is defined as the ratio (in percentage) of the total administered dose of chemotherapy to the standard dose of the same chemotherapy regimen, as defined by the treating centre. RDI will be calculated as the total dose delivered from the first day of cycle 1 of chemotherapy until completion of the planned chemotherapy (average of 6 months for early, 3 months for metastatic disease), or until date of relapse or death or discontinuation from any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
