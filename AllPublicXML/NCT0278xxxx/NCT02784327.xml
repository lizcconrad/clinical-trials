    <textblock>
      PRF110 is new extended release oily solution formulation of ropivacaine that is intended for
      local infiltration into surgical wounds. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety
      and early efficacy of PRF110 in bunionectomy surgery, to measure the pharmacokinetic profile
      of PRF110 over 72 hours and evaluate the duration of analgesia witnessed in the surgical
      setting.

      PRF110 is new extended release oily solution formulation of ropivacaine that is intended for
      local infiltration into surgical wounds. The formulation is designed to slowly release the
      ropivacaine over 36-72 hours. By providing local analgesia over a long time span, the need
      for systemic analgesics is expected to be reduced. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the safety and early efficacy of PRF110 in bunionectomy surgery, to measure the
      pharmacokinetic profile of PRF110 over 72 hours and evaluate the duration of analgesia
      witnessed in the surgical setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures;

          2. Able to communicate clearly with the Investigators and study staff;

          3. Males and females aged between 18 - 85 years of age;

          4. Scheduled for elective primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery
             (osteotomy and internal fixation) with no collateral procedures;

          5. Females must be physically incapable of childbearing potential (postmenopausal for
             more than at least 2 years or surgically sterile) or practicing an acceptable method
             of contraception (hormonal, barrier with spermicide, intrauterine device, vasectomized
             partner, or abstinence). Subjects using hormonal birth control must have received at
             least 1 cycle of treatment prior to study drug administration. At Baseline, all
             females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and not be
             breast feeding;

          6. Negative urine drug screen for drugs of abuse at Screening and on Day 1 prior to
             surgery; a positive drug screen result may be permitted if the subject has been on a
             stable dose of an allowed medication for &gt;30 days (antipsychotics, antiepileptics,
             sedatives, hypnotics, antianxiety agents, or antidepressants);

          6. Has a known or suspected history of diagnosed alcohol, opiate or other substance abuse
