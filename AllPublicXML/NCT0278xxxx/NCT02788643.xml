  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collagens are proteins present in all tissues. Besides their structural role, recent data
      showed that they were able to regulate many cellular functions. Many interactions occur
      between extracellular matrix macromolecules, especially collagen, and various cell types.
      These interactions can be controlled by peptides derived extracellular matrix macromolecules,
      called matrikines. Previous work from the investigators laboratory and others have shown that
      several C-terminal domain (NC1 domains) from basement membrane-associated collagens could
      regulate many cellular activities.

      Lung is an organ particularly abundant in basement membranes. It is likely that various lung
      diseases may affect metabolism of basement membrane associated collagens. To the
      investigators knowledge, no study has focused on the expression of collagen XIX α1 chain and
      collagen IV chains α3 and α4 chains in lung and studied possible variations of expression in
      various pathophysiological situations.

      The aim of this study are to:

        -  Study the presence of collagen IV and XIX (or fragments) in different types of sampling
           such as bronchoalveolar lavage, pulmonary aspiration and bronchial biopsies

        -  Evaluate quantitative variations of expression of these collagen in different pulmonary
           diseases, especially chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathy, infectious pneumonia,
           pneumonitis or lung cancer.

      Experimental Design: Cross-sectional study, with prospective inclusions, single center.

      Investigations:

        -  Realization of bronchoscopy according to the indications (with or without
           bronchoalveolar lavage with or without bronchial biopsy, participation in research that
           do not modify patient's care)

        -  samples are sent to the laboratory, centrifuged and stored at -80°C until they were
           assessed.

        -  samples were used to specific analysis in this study:

        -  Study of qualitative expression of collagen IV and XIX by Reverse transcription
           polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blot

        -  Study of quantitative variations of these collagens by ELISA

      Statistical analysis planification:

        -  description of the data (mean and standard deviation),

        -  comparison of different groups (non-pathological vs pulmonary disease) by Student's t
           test, Wilcoxon, Chi2 or Fisher test.

      Expected results and prospects:

      The investigators should be able to demonstrate the presence of collagen IV and/or collagen
      XIX or different fragments in biological samples. The investigators would then be able to
      show variation in expression of these collagens according to different pathological
      situations. In the longer term, the objective is to validate these collagens as a markers of
      pulmonary pathologies or as therapeutic agents.
