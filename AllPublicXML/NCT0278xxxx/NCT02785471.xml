  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a comprehensive, male-oriented, online screening and
      referral (Screening for Mental Health; SMH) and male-oriented online information and referral
      intervention program (Man Therapy; MT) to improve mental health and wellbeing with a focus on
      prevention of suicide and help-seeking behaviors among middle-aged men. The online programs
      will be offered together to maximize the effect on reducing suicide behavior and increasing
      mental health help-seeking behaviors for men. If successful in decreasing suicide behavior
      and ideation and increasing suicide help-seeking behavior, this intervention could be scaled
      up to contribute to a reduction in suicide behaviors and deaths across the country.
