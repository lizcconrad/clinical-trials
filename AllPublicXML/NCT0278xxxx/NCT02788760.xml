  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most fractures of the cervical spine are considered stable and treated with a rigid cervical
      collar. However no studies have to date been published addressing the length of treatment.
      There seems to be a significant dissimilarity between hospitals within and between countries
      with the length of collar treatment varying from 6 to 12 weeks. At the neurosurgical
      department at Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål the standard length of treatment for a stable
      cervical fracture is 12 weeks. This study seeks to establish whether 6 weeks of collar
      treatment for a specific subtype of stable fractures in the cervical spine is sufficient.

      The investigators will include 150 patients with a stable cervical fractures of vertebra
      C3-C7 with a Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Severity (SLIC) Score 1-3 and randomize them in
      to two similar groups. One group will be treated with a cervical collar for 6 weeks and the
      other group will be treated for 12 weeks. There will be a clinical check up and a CT scan at
      1, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after the initial injury. The investigators will compare the results
      between the two groups when it comes to fracture healing (CT based), level of function, pain
      and the length of sick leave with a total of 6 months of follow up.
