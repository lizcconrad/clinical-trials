      The purpose of this study is: (1) to examine the effectiveness of reconsolidation blockade as
      a treatment for trauma-related disorders, (2) to evaluate the feasibility of implementing
      this new treatment on a large scale in a short delay. This clinical trial as been set up in
      response to the Paris attacks to increase treatment capacity of the AP-HP (Assistance
      Publique des Hopitaux de Paris) hospital network.. Reconsolidation blockade will be compared
      to treatment as usual (TAU), on symptoms reduction after 6 weeks of treatment. In order to
      measure effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, socioeconomic measures, quality of life and
      social functioning outcomes will be measured pre- and post-treatment as well as 3 and 12
      months after study enrollment.

    <textblock>
      The November 13th Paris attacks were the most violent and devastating events to occur in
      France since World War II. A large number of persons are likely to develop PTSD or
      trauma-related disorders, especially victims directly involved, their families, as well as
      the the first responders. In this context, there is an urgent need to enhance treatment
      resources. Psychotherapy is known to be effective but it is costly, and require qualified
      professionals. Pharmacotherapy (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,SSRIs) is also
      considered effective. However, side effects often lead patients to abandon their treatment.
      An alternative evidence-based intervention is the use of the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol
      used to interfere with the reconsolidation of a recalled traumatic memory, so as to reduce
      its strength over time. This clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of reconsolidation blockade compared to treatment as usual. The study
      involves four assessments: pre- and post-treatment and 13 weeks and 1 year follow up. The
      outcome measures include: PTSD symptoms, socioeconomic variables, quality of life and social
      functioning measures. The investigators hypothesize that all patients will improve. However,
      patients receiving reconsolidation blockade will recover faster than treatment as usual.
      Finally, investigators hypothesize that reconsolidation blockade will be well accepted both
      by the professionals and the patients.
