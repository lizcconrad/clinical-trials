  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common disorder, occurring worldwide in both males and females in all age
      groups1. The prevalence is higher in females and the incidence peaks between 30 and 65 years.
      It is currently the most frequent musculoskeletal cause of functional disability and it has a
      major socio-economic impact on today's society. Although a small percentage of persons with
      low back pain can be diagnosed with a specific underlying cause, almost 90% of persons with
      low back pain present with symptoms of nonspecific origin. A part of these symptoms are only
      of short duration, but 23% of all people will develop nonspecific chronic low back pain
      (NSCLBP).

      Exercise therapy (ET) is currently an important component in the treatment of NSCLBP.
      Previous studies analysed the effects of various modes of exercise therapy, such as motor
      control therapy, core stability training and aerobic conditioning training. However, therapy
      outcomes can be low, and guidelines in favour of using a specific program are contradictory.
      It thus still remains unclear which therapy modality is best suited. Furthermore, no
      recommendations are available about optimal training intensities during rehabilitation of
      persons with NSCLBP.

      Since as well aerobic as muscular deconditioning are apparent in persons with chronic low
      back pain and improvements in overall physical fitness can affect therapy outcomes in this
      population, ET specifically focussing on physical fitness can be advocated for NSCLBP
      rehabilitation. High Intensity Training (HIT), has been promoted as an effective and
      efficient training method for improving physical fitness and health related parameters in
      healthy persons. Also, HIT resulted in successful reconditioning and improvement of
      functional and disease related outcomes in persons with other chronic diseases such as
      multiple sclerosis, heart failure, COPD and cardiometabolic diseases. Although some studies
      showed promising results for the effect of HIT on low back pain such as high intensity
      isolated, evidence is still scarce and study results are unclear because of methodological
      shortcomings.To evaluate HIT for the rehabilitation of persons with NSCLBP, a therapy program
      was developed consisting of high intensity interval cardio and high load whole body strength
      training.

      The aim of this pilot study is 1) to evaluate the feasibility of a HIT program for the
      rehabilitation of persons with NSCLBP, and 2) to evaluate the effects of a HIT program on
      disease related outcomes and physical fitness compared to a conventional rehabilitation
      program in persons with NSCLBP.
