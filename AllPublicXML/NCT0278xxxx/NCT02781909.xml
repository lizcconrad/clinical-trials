  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel approaches to improve TB treatment outcomes (to reduce morbidity, mortality, and the
      duration of TB treatment) and to treat XDR-TB cases are urgently required. Host-Directed
      therapies (especially repurposed drugs such as Non-Steroid AntiInflammatory Drugs NSAIDS)
      could be useful in this context, and therefore its the appropriateness and potential effect
      of this approach needs to be evaluated in humans. Investigators do propose a prospective,
      randomized, pilot study to estimate the potential efficacy and safety of using adjunctive
      ibuprofen for the treatment of XDR tuberculosis.
