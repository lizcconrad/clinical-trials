  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this experiment is to assess the impact of parabolic flight on (1)
      spatial memory and orientation, (2) the changes in brain structure and function, and
      particularly the hippocampal formation, and (3) biochemical markers of stress and
      neuroplasticity.

      A preliminary study will be performed with the aims (1) to test during weightlessness
      hardware used to administer visuo-spatial testing and (2) to determine the optimal body
      posture for testing under microgravity conditions (i.e. body posture for which change in
      visuo-spatial testing induced by weightlessness is maximal).

      The main criteria are:

        -  Structural and functional changes of brain evaluated by fMRI;

        -  Cognitive performance, and specifically spatial cognition using a series computer-based
           tasks.

        -  Key neurotrophins determined in venous blood samples The criteria used in the
           preliminary experiment is visuo-spatial performance evaluated with a computer-based test
           assessing spatial cognition.

      The investigators hypothesize that hippocampal structure and function, and particularly the
      dentate gyrus, will be altered after parabolic flight compared to ground based controls.
      Specifically, the 3 tested hypotheses are:

        -  Parabolic flight induces changes in hippocampal structure;

        -  Weightlessness induces changes in cognitive performance, and specifically spatial
           cognition;

        -  There is a correlation between changes in hippocampal structure and changes in
           visuo-spatial memory performance.

        -  There is a correlation between changes in hippocampal structure and changes in key
           neurotrophins.

      The hypothesis tested during the preliminary experiment is that body posture affects the
      changes in spatial cognition performance.

    <description>MRI testing will be performed using a 3T MRI facility in Bordeaux close to Novespace (CHU Pellegrin).
Spatial cognition will be assessed using a battery of in-house virtual paradigms General cognitive performance testing will include a wide range of cognitive functions, and particularly executive control using the Cognition Battery Mental status will be assessed on a tablet computer using a visual analogue scale Vigilant attention will be determined using the 3-min Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) Blood samples (5 mL per collection) will be collected prior to neuroimaging by venepuncture</description>
