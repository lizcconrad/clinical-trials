  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive ACLF (Acute on Chronic Liver failure) patients presenting to the institute of
      liver and biliary sciences, irrespective of the etiology , who have survived the acute phase
      (i.e. 90 days of onset of the acute on chronic liver failure) and who are willing to
      participate in the study would be enrolled. After performing baseline biochemical tests,
      patients will undergo transjugular liver biopsy (TJLB), HVPG (Hepatic Venous Pressure
      Gradient), Circulating CD34 cells, Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (Histopathological and
      immunohistochemical examination will be done).
