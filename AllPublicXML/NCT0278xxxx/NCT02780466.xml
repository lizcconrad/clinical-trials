  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is common in intensive care and its mortality remains high. While new treatments
      have not improved survival, optimization of known and widely used techniques has allowed
      reduction in mortality. Thus improving care given to patients starts with making better use
      of existing resuscitation techniques. Among these practices, mechanical ventilation is
      widespread in the management of patients with septic shock. In large studies published in
      recent years in Europe and North America, 40 to 85% of patients receive invasive mechanical
      ventilation. It therefore appears that a significant proportion of patients are never
      intubated during treatment and management of their septic shock. There is no specific
      recommendation from critical care societies concerning mechanical ventilation in the
      treatment of septic shock. Apart from indisputable situations such as impaired consciousness
      or acute respiratoire distress, the decision whether to ventilate mechanically or not is left
      to the discretion of the physician.

      The aim of this study is to analyze intubation practice in septic shock patients and its
      impact on 28-day survival.

      This multicentric and observational study will be conducted in 30 French ICUs.
