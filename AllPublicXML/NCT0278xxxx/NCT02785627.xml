      The ANTELOPE trial is a longitudinal observational clinical study of changes in bone density,
      structure and strength over 12 months in men receiving treatment for prostate cancer. Three
      groups (n = 30 per group) will be compared, with bone assessments at baseline and 12 months.
      Allowing for a 18 month recruitment period, 12 months follow-up and data analysis, the total
      study length will be 3 years. The groups comprise:

      Group A - Men with prostate cancer starting ADT

      Group B - Men with newly diagnosed hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer, about to
      start (or have started within the past 3 months) ADT and who will undergo chemotherapy with
      docetaxel and prednisolone

      Group C - Age-matched men without prostate cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the commonest non-skin cancer in men, with more than 40,000 new cases
      diagnosed in the UK each year. Development of prostate cancer depends upon testosterone (the
      male hormone), and medications that block testosterone (eg Androgen Deprivation Therapy, ADT)
      can help men to survive for many years. Men with metastatic prostate cancer are also treated
      with ADT, but recent evidence has demonstrated that there are survival benefits when
      chemotherapy given as well as ADT. Many patients now receive chemotherapy as first line
      treatment along with ADT in the context of newly diagnosed metastatic disease.

      However, blocking testosterone causes bone loss which may lead to osteoporosis and increases
      the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Such fractures cause pain, loss of mobility and
      independence, and one in three men who have a hip fracture will die within one year. The
      osteoporosis caused by prostate cancer treatments may differ from other forms; the limited
      available data suggest that it may affect the wrist more than other bones (most other forms
      affect the spine and hip the most). We need to better understand the pattern of osteoporosis
      in these men, so that we can offer the most effective treatment to protect their bones and
      ensure that they stay as well as possible as they live with their cancer treatment

      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of prostate cancer treatment on bone health.
      Comprehensive bone assessment at baseline and 12 months will include different bone scans
      (DXA whole body, Xtreme CT of radius and HR CT T12 vertebra), biochemical markers of bone
      turnover, anthropometric measurements, and assessment of grip strength and muscle strength
      and function.

          -  Scheduled to commence ADT (but must have baseline assessments carried out within 4
             weeks of commencement of ADT). Those starting ADT are expecting to have a duration of
             treatment of 12 months or more.

          -  No prior systemic therapy for advanced prostate cancer (not receiving concurrent
             anti-neoplastic therapy, besides ADT or an anti-androgens), participants may have

        Group B

          -  Men with newly diagnosed hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer who have
             commenced ADT and who have been referred for chemotherapy

          -  Bone metastases will be allowed provided not in the radius (DXA measurement will
             attempt to image sites with no/minimal bone metastases)

          -  Men who have received palliative radiotherapy for known bone metastases prior to or
             during the study may be included, but the site of radiotherapy must be accurately
             recorded and attempts will be made to avoid such sites in subsequent DXA measurement.

          -  Men with bone pain due to known bone metastases may receive necessary analgaesia,
             including opiates, as needed on study

          -  Participants in group B will be allowed to continue oral corticosteroids, provided
             that the dose does not exceed 2mg dexamethasone or 10 mg prednisolone daily. Men in
             this group may also receive additional steroids as prophylaxis during chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known metabolic bone disease or other diseases (other than prostate cancer) known to
             affect bone metabolism including: hyperthyroidism, primary hyperparathyroidism,

                  cancer, superficial bladder cancer (if in doubt please discuss with trial team).

               -  Fracture or orthopaedic surgery within the last 12 months

               -  Arthritis, orthopaedic surgery or other abnormality of the radius, spine or hip
                  which would prevent accurate acquisition of study measurements.

               -  Current or prior (within one month) participation in any other clinical trial
                  involving a medicinal product, except STAMPEDE for men in group B. For other
