  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational follow-up study observing the
      effectiveness of high density spinal cord stimulation in patients with failed back surgery
      syndrome patients with back and leg pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DISCOVER will measure the effectiveness of high-density spinal cord stimulation for treatment
      of chronic back and leg pain. Identification of clinical effective parameters concerning
      location of active electrodes, frequency, pulse duration, amplitude and battery consumption
      are, besides safety, the major outcome parameters of this study.
