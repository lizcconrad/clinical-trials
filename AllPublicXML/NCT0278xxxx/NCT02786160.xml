  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study in obese
      children. A total of 75 obese children in the age 5 to 10 years, enrolled in a childhood
      obesity treatment program, will be included. The participating children will be randomised
      into one of three groups consuming either HMO (two groups) or placebo (one group).

      The primary objective of the study is to establish the effects of HMOs on the faecal
      microbiota in children. Secondary objectives are to evaluate safety of HMO supplementation in
      children and the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms (tolerance), bowel habits, metabolic
      profile and body composition in obese children.
