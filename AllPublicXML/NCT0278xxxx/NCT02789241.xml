    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate 4-dose levels of CCRE Lot 94332B1 (0.6, 1.0, 2.0,
      and 4.0 ng/kg). This study is known as, an &quot;endotoxin challenge.&quot; Thousands of healthy
      subjects worldwide over the last 20 years have participated in endotoxin challenge studies as
      part of clinical research and clinical drug development programs. This study will only test
      the safety and tolerability of CCRE Lot 94332B1.

      Normal healthy subjects will be recruited and consented for the study. Following completion
      of the study, the bio-marker samples will be sent to Dr. Anthony Suffredini a collaborator
      and Deputy Chief &amp; Senior Investigator Department of Critical Care Medicine at the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH). All samples will be de-identified and analyzed at the NIH; the
      results of which will be reviewed by both Drs. Suffredini and Noveck. Statistical analysis
      will be performed at the NIH by the Department of Statistics from which manuscripts will be
      written for publication.

             or &lt;60 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the median of
             the three systolic and the median of the three diastolic BP values should be used to

             bpm, the HR should be repeated two more times and the median of the three HR values
             should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. If the median value is &lt;50 bpm,

          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating HR &lt; 50 bpm, QTc &gt;450 or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at
             screening of check-in. If the heart rate or QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120
             msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the median of the three QTc values
             should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. If the median value for any of
             these parameters is outside the limit specified, the subject is excluded.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements, especially those
             with anti-inflammatory properties (e.g. fish oil, turmeric, etc.) within 7 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to receiving endotoxin. Limited use of
             non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis. Use of any
             steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) within 7 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) of admission of each period is specifically
             prohibited due to potential confounding effects on the study PD endpoints

          -  History of frequent headaches (&gt;2 per month) or migraines or headaches from an absence
             of caffeine from coffee, tea, chocolate, or other caffeine-related substances

          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  Women who are of non-childbearing potential must be:

               1. Surgically sterile (removal of both ovaries and/ or uterus at least 12 months
                  prior to dosing).

               2. Naturally postmenopausal (spontaneous cessation of menses) for at least 24
                  consecutive months prior to dosing on Day -1 and with an FSH level at screening
                  of ≥ 40 mIU/mL.

               3. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
                  screening and negative urine pregnancy at check-in, and must agree to avoid
                  pregnancy during study. Pregnancy is tested at screening, during check-in, and at
                  any given time if deemed necessary by the PI or designate. During the study,
                  women of child-bearing potential must use two acceptable methods of contraception
                  at the same time. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) documented
                  surgical sterilization (such as a hysterectomy), (2) barrier methods (such as a
                  condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or the use of a condom with a
                  spermicide and (3) hormonal contraception (combination oral contraceptives,
                  transdermal patch, injectables, implantables or vaginal ring) or (4) an
                  intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). Abstinence is not an
                  acceptable form of contraception in this study.

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the

             malaise, cough, cold, and/or headache which are suggestive of an occult infection
             (viral, bacterial, etc.).

          -  The subject has donated more than 250 mL of blood within 30 days of Day 1 or has
