  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to address the MedEvac foundation priority of
      educational techniques and technologies and improve Helicopter Emergency Medical Services
      (HEMS) safety by determining if overall sleep quality and intra-shift fatigue of HEMS
      clinicians can be improved with real-time assessment and intervention.

      Aim 1: To determine the short-term impact of an enhanced SleepTrackTXT intervention on HEMS
      clinician fatigue reported in real-time during and at the end of shift work.

      Aim 2: To determine the long-term impact of the SleepTrackTXT intervention on sleep quality
      and sleep health indicators including hours of sleep and recovery between shift work.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine short term impact by examining self-reported fatigue captured
      at the start, during, and end of scheduled shifts.

      The investigators will determine longer-term impact on sleep quality by comparing scores on
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) taken at baseline and then again at 4 months.

    <description>Participants will receive text-message based assessment during shift work (intra-shift) and between shifts (inter-shift). Participants in the experimental group that report high levels of fatigue, sleepiness, or difficulty with concentration during shift work (intra-shift) will receive tailored text-messages promoting adoption of behaviors that can improve alertness. Participants will also receive a summary of their sleep debt once a week and suggestions for paying back sleep debt. Participants will also have access to a graphic summary of their sleep hours over previous 30-days.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the non-intervention group/arm will receive text-message based assessment during shift work (intra-shift) and between shifts (inter-shift). The inter-shift assessments will query the participant about his/her sleep hours, fatigue, sleepiness, and difficulty with concentration. No intervention messages sent to this group/arm.</description>
