  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eight adolescent and young adult subjects with type 1 diabetes, age 16−24 years, will be
      recruited for this study on the basis of informed consent. Participants will be invited to
      attend the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on
      two occasions. On each occasion participants will arrive at the unit at 9am having controlled
      their diabetes with short acting insulin for 24 hours and they will remain in the unit until
      8am the next morning. During the day, between 9am and 6pm participants will remain fasting
      and their blood glucose levels will be controlled by intravenous insulin, the dose being
      determined by 15−30 minute blood glucose estimations. At 1800hr on visit 1 the subjects will
      be asked to ingest an evening meal enriched by a cold isotope glucose tracer (non
      radioactive). The variable insulin infusion will be adjusted to allow for the meal in order
      to achieve good glycaemic control after the meal until 0200hr. From then until 0800hr in the
      morning the study team will again adjust the infusion rates to maintain normal glycemia until
      the participants are ready to go home on their normal insulin regimen. On the second visit
      the protocol will be identical until 1800hr when instead of giving the meal variable amounts
      of glucose will be infused to ensure the glucose levels are identical to those observed on
      visit 1. After 0200hr the study will be effectively finished but the study team will continue
      to vary the insulin infusion to keep blood glucose levels normal until the subjects can go
      home on their normal insulin regime at 8am.

      In order to achieve sufficient information to make all the calculations needed other cold
      isotope glucose tracers will be infused during the study period. These safe non radioactive
      isotope tracers will enable us to assess glucose being produced by the body, its distribution
      and utilization. Throughout both study periods the subjects will be monitored very closely by
      a Clinical Research Fellow, assisted by a Research Nurse, in order to avoid any risk of low
      blood glucose levels.

          -  The subject has type 1 diabetes, as defined by WHO for at least 6 months or is
             confirmed C-peptide negative

          -  The subject will have been on insulin pump or MDI therapy for at least 6 months

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2

          -  Non-type 1 diabetes mellitus including those secondary to chronic disease

          -  Any other physical or psychological disease likely to interfere with the normal
             conduct of the study and interpretation of the study results

          -  Current treatment with drugs known to interfere with glucose metabolism such as
             systemic corticosteroids, non-selective beta-blockers and MAO inhibitors
