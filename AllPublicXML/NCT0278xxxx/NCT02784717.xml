      This non-interventional field study will investigate rivaroxaban under clinical practice
      conditions for stroke prevention and for prevention of non-CNS systemic embolism in patients
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in China.

      3000 patients will be provided with free drug.It is planned to have an interim analysis(IA)
      when 3000 patients are enrolled (cut off day is the 3000th patient completed at least 3
      months follow-up visit). To end or continue enrolling patients will be decided based on the
      IA result and the evaluation comments from CFDA.

a fall in haemoglobin of ≥2 g/dL, or
a transfusion of ≥2 units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, or
occurrence at a critical site (intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra articular, intra-muscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal), or

    <description>If the patients switch from or interruption of rivaroxaban treatment, patients or physicians will be asked by several questions about the reasons of the switch and interruption, and collected in CRF. The reasons will be described by frequency distributions.
Reason choice as below:
1. Patient choice 2. Insufficient therapeutic effect 3. Adverse event 4. Surgery 5. Dentistry 6. Renal function change</description>
