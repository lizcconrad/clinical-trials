    <textblock>
      Subjects with pterygium and associated dry eye symptoms (DES) are randomized into an active
      cohort (receiving ocular administration of Dipyridamole) or placebo cohort (ocular
      administration of vehicle). Monthly follow up is conducted for 12 months. Testing conducted
      at follow up will assess dry eye / pterygium symptoms and endpoints and review the efficacy
      of the intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the changes in dry eye parameters via a change in tear secretion rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the tear secretion rate will be defined by successful change in parameters of ONE of the following testing methods compared to baseline:
Fluorescein - Improvement of one of the quadrants sufficient to change the severity rating
TBUT (Tear Breakup time) - Decreased by at least 1 second
Tear meniscus test - Increase of at least 0.2mm</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the changes in dry eye parameters via reduction in dry eye symptomology.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction in dry eye symptomology will be defined as ONE of the following relative to baseline, determined by subject feedback
An improvement in questionnaire scores
Specified improvement in blurred vision grading
Specified improvement in tearing grading
Specified improvement in itch / foreign body (grittiness) sensation grading.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>A minimum significant reversion of pterygia relative to baseline or cessation of growth of pterygium</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Minimum significant reversion will be defined as a decrease in vascularisation, or a measurable decrease from baseline of OCT (Ocular Coherence Tomography) measured parameters (height or width).</description>
