  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is a common complaint of Veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Because
      there is clinical evidence that sleep quality influences pain, fatigue, mood, cognition, and
      daily functioning, this study will investigate whether a type of behavioral sleep treatment
      called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) can help Gulf War Veterans with GWI.
      CBTi is a multicomponent treatment where patients learn about sleep and factors affecting
      sleep as well as how to alter habits that may impair or even prevent sleep. The investigators
      hypothesize that helping Gulf War Veterans learn how to achieve better sleep with CBTi may
      also help to alleviate their other non-sleep symptoms of GWI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is common among Veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Moreover, untreated insomnia
      is associated with significant medical and psychiatric morbidity. Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is a multicomponent treatment that seeks not only to teach
      patients about sleep and factors affecting sleep (e.g., circadian rhythm, age, social and
      work schedule) but the therapist will also to work with the patient toward minimizing
      unwanted arousal at bedtime and altering sleep habits to increase sleep propensity and
      regularity.

      Because many Veterans with GWI suffer from a profound loss of physical and functional status
      that may prevent them from participating in treatments that require regular clinic visits,
      the proposed study will deliver CBTi by telephone to extend this effective form of behavioral
      sleep medicine to Veterans who have chronic illnesses and disabilities and/or who live in
      rural areas with limited access to trained CBTi providers. Recent studies suggest that
      telephone-delivered CBTi is as effective as CBTi delivered in-person.

      The proposed trial will examine the efficacy of telephone-delivered CBTi for alleviating
      sleep and non-sleep GWI symptoms in a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Veterans who have
      GWI and persistent insomnia disorder will be randomized to a group that will receive CBTi
      right away or to a group that will receive treatment-as-usual (i.e., the control group).
      Veterans randomized to the control group will have the option of receiving
      telephone-delivered CBTi upon completion of post-treatment assessments. The primary outcomes
      will be effect sizes base on within-group comparisons of pre-to-post-treatment change and
      maintenance of treatment effects at 6 months in the CBTi group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the last month. The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The internal consistency of the ISI was found to be excellent (Cronbach's = 0.74) and has been validated with both sleep diary and polysomnography. This outcome will be measured at 6 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a self-report measure that provides a subjective assessment of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sedative-hypnotics, and daytime energy. This index is widely used and has been validated by polysomnography. This outcome will be measured at 6 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gulf War Illness Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Due to its novelty, complexity, and variability, no single measure of severity addresses all possible presentations of Gulf War Illness (GWI). Therefore, we will use the symptom portion of the Kansas Gulf War Military History and Health Questionnaire, which includes 32 questions about fatigue/sleep problems, somatic pain, skin abnormalities, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and neurologic/cognitive/mood symptoms, based on the Kansas GWI and CDC CMI case definition. The investigators will make the following modifications for the proposed study: (1) the 2 questions about sleep difficulties will be excluded. Thus, the investigators will query GWI symptoms with 30 questions. (2) To assess current GWI symptoms, we ask participants about the absence, presence, and severity of the symptoms over the past 2 weeks instead of over the past 6-months. This outcome will be measured at 6 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>
