      We want to compare the effect of lignocaine 2 % gel, Naproxen sodium and their combination on
      the pain control during extracorporial shock wave lithotripsy for renal stones.

    <textblock>
      Introduction of ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) has revolutionized the treatment
      of urolithiasis due to its noninvasive in nature, cost effectiveness, reduced hospitalization
      time and less morbidity1, 2.Impact of shock waves cause pain in most of the patient requiring
      analgesia or sedation. It is important to make patient pain free to get the maximum possible
      stone free rates3, 4. Opioids are used most commonly for pain relief in ESWL but with side
      effects requiring patient monitoring and delayed hospital stay3, 4. NSAIDS also showed
      promising results regarding pain control in ESWL without side effects of opoids1, 5. Local
      analgesia gels have controversial role in relieving pain in ESWL 1, 6. There are yet no
      guidelines for pain relief during ESWL1, 4. We intend to compare the effect of local
      analgesia gel, oral NSAIDS and their combination on pain during lithotripsy.
