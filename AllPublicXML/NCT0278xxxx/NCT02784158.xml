    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide brigatinib for those patients with locally advanced
      and/or metastatic patients with ALK+ NSCLC on an expanded access basis due to their inability
      to meet eligibility criteria for on-going recruiting trials, inability to participate in
      other clinical trials (e.g., poor performance status, lack of geographic proximity), or
      because other medical interventions are not considered appropriate or acceptable.

    <description>Brigatinib will be administered orally to eligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC who are resistant or intolerant to a prior ALK inhibitor at a dose of 180 mg QD with a 7 day lead-in at 90 mg QD, continuously, with or without food.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC

             procedure.

          2. Resistant to or intolerant of at least 1 prior ALK TKI.

          3. Recovered from toxicities related to prior anticancer therapy to NCI CTCAE, v4.0)
             grade ≤2.

          4. Are a male or female patient ≥18 years old.

          5. Have adequate organ and hematologic function, as defined by the study protocol.

          6. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2.

          7. Have normal QT interval on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation, defined as QT
             interval corrected (Fridericia) (QTcF) of ≤450 ms in males or ≤470 ms in females.

          8. For female patients of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be
             documented prior to enrollment (&lt;7 days prior to the first dose).

          9. Female and male patients who are fertile must agree to use a highly effective form of
             contraception as defined by the study protocol.

         10. Must provide a signed and dated informed consent indicating that the patient has been
             informed of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the potential risks, and is
             willingly participating.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Received an ALK TKI within 10 days prior to the first dose of brigatinib.

          2. Received cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or radiation within 14 days,
             except stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic body radiosurgery.

          3. Received prior brigatinib therapy.

          4. Received monoclonal antibodies within 30 days of the first dose of brigatinib.

          5. Had major surgery within 30 days of the first dose of brigatinib.

          6. Have current spinal cord compression.

          7. Have significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease within 6 months prior
             to first dose, as defined by the study protocol.

          8. Have a history or the presence of pulmonary interstitial disease, drug-related
             pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis.

          9. Have a known or suspected hypersensitivity to brigatinib or its excipients.

         10. Have any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             compromise patient safety.

         11. Are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         12. Are eligible for and have reasonable access to participate in another ongoing
             brigatinib clinical study.
