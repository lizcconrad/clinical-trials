      Investigators will determine whether treatment stratification by neck dissection, to more
      accurately pathologically stage patients, minimizing the number of treatment modalities in
      patients with low risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, can improve quality of life.

      Investigators will determine whether treatment stratification by neck dissection, to more
      accurately pathologically stage patients, minimizing the number of treatment modalities in
      patients with low risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, can improve quality of life.

      After enrollment, all patients will undergo neck dissection and primary site biopsy.
      Pathology will be reviewed and patients will be stratified into one of three treatment

        1. Patients with a single lymph node that measures less than six centimeters, have no
           extracapsular extension in the lymph node, and have no perineural or perivascular
           invasion of the primary biopsy will undergo transoral surgery of the primary site.

        2. Patients who have 2 positive nodes with no extracapsular extension, or have perineural
           or perivascular invasion of the primary biopsy will undergo radiation.

        3. Patients who have extracapsular extension in any number of lymph nodes or in those
           patients in whom negative margins are unable to be obtained after the completion of
           transoral surgery will undergo chemoradiation.

      After completion of therapy (surgical, radiation, or combined modality) patients will be
      followed closely on an outpatient basis including regular exams, quality of life
      questionnaires, and interval surveillance imaging as clinically indicated. Swallowing
      function will also be addressed by videofluoroscopy one year after completion of therapy.
      Blood/plasma and oral rinses for correlative studies will be collected at 3-month intervals
      during 3 years of follow up.
