  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past several decades, a new science of subjective well-being has produced insights
      into the factors that make people happy—from cultivating strong relationships to pursuing the
      right goals. Drawing on these empirical findings, the investigators created a comprehensive
      12-week intervention program, ENHANCE: Enduring Happiness and Continued Self-Enhancement. The
      investigators multimodal program is designed to teach people essential skills in order to
      produce sustainable changes in behavior and, as a result, long-lasting increases in
      happiness. To test the effectiveness of ENHANCE, the investigators designed a six-month
      randomized clinical trial. Participants will be assigned to an active treatment group or a
      waiting group control. They will complete baseline assessments, and follow-up assessment at
      three and six months after the start of the intervention. These assessments will contain
      measures of subjective well-being and objective measures of health, as well as a variety of
      psychological mediators (e.g., psychological needs) and moderators (e.g. personality). The
      investigators will thus be able to explore not only whether ENHANCE works to improve
      well-being, but also why and how ENHANCE works.

    <description>ENHANCE (Enduring Happiness and Continued Self-Enhancement) is a 12-week program that includes an introductory session, 10 weekly sessions focusing on different happiness principles, and a final session focusing on integrating aspects of the program and continuing to practice these principles moving forward. Through completing this program, participants will gain an education on a wide-range of happiness principles and an arsenal of strategies for developing happiness boosting habits and skills.</description>

    <description>ENHANCE is a skill-based intervention to teach people a wide variety of strategies that have been shown to boost happiness. Each session of ENHANCE follows a similar format targeted to address three central goals. First, in each session, participants will complete an active learning module designed to educate participants about one of the ten overarching topics featured in this program (e.g., goals, close relationships). Next, participants will engage in activities that put these principles into practice. Finally, this program is designed to encourage a skill-building mindset by helping participants develop habits to integrate these principles into maintained activity in their daily lives moving forward.</description>
