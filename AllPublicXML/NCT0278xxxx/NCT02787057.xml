  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-peritoneal administration of antibiotics covering both gram-positive and gram-negative
      organisms was recommended as first-line regimen for the management of peritoneal dialysis
      related peritonitis. Oral administration of quinolones can also achieve effective serum
      concentrations, and is more convenient and economical. We conducted a pilot randomized
      controlled study to compare the effects on peritonitis cure and relapsing rates between oral
      moxifloxacin plus IP vancomycin and conventional IP vancomycin plus ceftazidime.

    <textblock>
      To compare the effects on peritonitis cure and relapsing rates between oral moxifloxacin plus
      IP vancomycin and conventional IP vancomycin plus ceftazidime, eligible PD patients were
      randomly assigned to study group (IP vancomycin 1g every 5 days combined with oral
      moxifloxacin 400mg QD) and control group (IP vancomycin 1g every 5 days combined with IP
      ceftazidime 1g QD). Patients were followed for 3 months after the completion of the treatment
      period. Primary endpoint is complete cure, secondary endpoint are primary response and
      primary or secondary treatment failure.
