      A phase 1b/2a study evaluating the combination of MM-151 + nal-IRI + 5-FU + Leucovorin in
      RAS/RAF wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

      Part 1: Patients will be enrolled to determine the maximum tolerated dose, safety and
      tolerability of MM-151 + nal-IRI + 5-FU + LV in patients with mCRC that are RAS/RAF
      wild-type.

      Part 2: Patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose of MM-151 in combination with
      nal-IRI + 5-FU + LV to characterize initial efficacy in conjunction with levels of irinotecan
      and SN-38 measured in tissue.
