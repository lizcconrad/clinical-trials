  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This method development study will be a two treatment arm, randomized, cross over study in a
      population with edentulous upper arch restored with a maxillary complete denture. The lower
      may be a partial or full edentulous mandibular arch that may be restored with a stable
      complete, partial or implant supported denture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, 2 treatment periods, examiner-blind, randomized, 7 day crossover
      study in adult participants with a complete maxillary denture. This is a method development
      study to investigate the changes in the level of denture plaque, microbial counts, microbial
      composition and stain on the maxillary dentures after daily denture cleanser use versus
      dentures that are cleaned weekly.

    <description>Participants will be instructed to soak upper arch dentures in the evening in cup of very warm water (150 millilitre [ml]) with 1 denture cleansing tablet from Day 0 to Day 7 for 15 minutes (mins). Brush dentures for 30 seconds using the solution, rinse under running water for 10 seconds. Cleaning of upper arch dentures in the morning is not permitted. Lower arch dentures will be cleaned using the participant's normal oral hygiene procedures in the morning and evening. If the participants will have lower removable partial or complete dentures, the soaking of these dentures will be done in a separate cup from the cup provided for soaking the upper denture.</description>

             history or upon oral examination; Absence of any condition that could affect the
             participant's safety or wellbeing or their ability to understand and follow study
             procedures and requirements.

          -  Maxillary Arch: Completely edentulous maxillary arch restored with a conventional full
             acrylic based upper complete denture.

          -  Mandibular Arch: Dentate, partial or full edentulous mandibular arch. Partial or full
             edentulous arch may be restored with a stable complete, partial or implant supported
             denture. (Mandibular dentures are not used for assessments or measures).

          -  Maxillary dentures must be considered to be moderately well-fitting at the screening
             visit. (Kapur Index, Olshan Modification: retention score &gt;2, stability score &gt;2).

          -  Maxillary dentures must be considered to be well-made based on design and construction
             criteria specified in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are breast-feeding, are known to be pregnant or who are intending to become

             related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients.

          -  Previous participation in this study or in another clinical study (including cosmetic
             studies) or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit.

          -  Current or relevant history of any serious, severe or unstable physical or psychiatric
             illness or any other medical condition (e.g. Diabetes Mellitus) that would make the

             participant or undermines the data validity.

          -  Implanted with a cardiac pacemaker.

          -  Daily doses of medication (example Antibiotics, Inhaled steroids etc.) that might
             interfere with ability to perform the study according to protocol or might affect the

          -  Any clinically significant or relevant oral abnormality that, in the opinion of the
