  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder. The
      most effective treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP therapy
      has been shown to significantly reduce subjective sleepiness and blood pressure in patients
      with symptomatic OSA. Its effectiveness tends to depend on its nightly usage and a commonly
      held view is that CPAP should be used for at least 4h/night. However, previous studies have
      estimated that a considerable proportion of CPAP users fail to achieve this. In addition,
      there is inadequate evidence to support this apparent threshold effect and so it is unclear
      whether such patients actually benefit from treatment or whether they could be withdrawn from
      CPAP, thus substantially reducing health care costs, or encouraged to increase their nightly
      usage of CPAP.

      The aim of the proposed project is to study the effect of CPAP withdrawal on subjective
      sleepiness in OSA patients using CPAP for less than 4h/night on average. We hypothesize that
      two-week CPAP withdrawal in patients with 3-4h/night use will lead to a return of OSA-related
      symptoms. This trial will better establish the minimum level of CPAP adherence which could
      generally be regarded as effective in reducing OSA-related symptoms.
