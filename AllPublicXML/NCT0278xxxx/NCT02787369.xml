    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called ACY-1215 in combination with ibrutinib or
      idelalisib as a possible treatment for Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocyic Leukemia
      (CLL).

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. The investigators are studying the
      combination of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors with ricolinostat, in order to
      try to enhance both the initial remission and to help improve the response in those who
      relapse after a first inhibitor and are receiving a second.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ACY-1215 as a treatment for
      any disease. ACY-1215 or ricolinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, specifically HDAC6.
      The FDA has approved idelalisib as well as ibrutinib as treatment options for Relapsed or
      Refractory Chronic Lymphocyic Leukemia (CLL).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have confirmed CLL/SLL relapsed after at least one prior therapy and
             currently in need of treatment by IWCLL 2008 criteria

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)

          -  For the ibrutinib arm only: participants must not currently require ongoing
             anticoagulation for any reason, or have had any major bleeding events within 6 months
             of enrollment

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000 K/μL and platelet count &gt; 30,000 K/μL
                  independent of transfusion support.

               -  total bilirubin &lt; 2X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless
                  predominantly indirect and therefore likely due to hemolysis or Gilbert's
                  syndrome

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3X institutional upper limit of normal for ibrutinib arm;
                  within normal limits on the idelalisib arm

               -  creatinine &lt; 2X ULN

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, including at least one of the following: an
             absolute B cell count &gt; 5000/uL, OR lymphadenopathy with at least one lymph node &gt; 2
             cm in long axis, OR palpable splenomegaly, OR cytopenias (Hb &lt; 11 g/dL or platelets &lt;
             100K) together with bone marrow infiltration

          -  The effects of the drugs studied in this research protocol on the developing human
             fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after
             completion of treatment administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 2 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Prior therapy with an HDAC inhibitor.

          -  Participants with a history of poor tolerance to either ibrutinib or idelalisib should
             not be enrolled on the arm containing that drug, but may be enrolled to the other arm.
             Must agree not to share study medication with another person.

          -  Participants requiring any medications or substances that are strong inducers or
             inhibitors of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Those who may discontinue these medications are
             eligible after a 7 day washout period. . Mild or moderate inducers or inhibitors of
             CYP3A4 are permitted but moderate inhibitors will require dose reduction of ibrutinib
             (see section 5.5).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ACY-1215, as well as both
             ibrutinib and idelalisib, have unknown effects on a developing fetus or newborn.
             Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this research
             protocol.

          -  HIV-positive participants on CYP3A4 modulating antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ACY-1215, ibrutinib or
             idelalisib. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Participants who require active chemotherapy for another cancer. Those requiring
             hormonal therapy or radiation therapy may be considered for enrollment on a case by
             case basis.

          -  Corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value &gt; 480 msec at screening;
             family or personal history of long QTc syndrome or ventricular arrhythmias including
             ventricular bigeminy at screening; previous history of drug-induced QTc prolongation
             or the need for treatment with medications known or suspected of producing prolonged
             QTc intervals on ECG.

          -  Positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, or core antibody; and known or
             suspected active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, for the idelalisib arm. On the
             ibrutinib arm, patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen may be appropriately
             treated and enrolled on this study as long as their HBV DNA / viral load is
             undetectable. Patients positive for hepB core antibody and negative for surface
             antigen are eligible for the ibrutinib arm, as are patients with hepatitis C.

          -  Subjects requiring anticoagulation with warfarin or vitamin K antagonists are excluded
             from the ibrutinib arm. If previously on these drugs and switched, INR must be normal
             for 7 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Subjects enrolling on the ibrutinib arm must not have had major surgery within 14
             days, or minor surgery within 7 days.

          -  Participant must be able to swallow pills.
