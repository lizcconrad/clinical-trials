  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inducing a systematic perturbation forces on the hand during arm reaching movement may
      improve adaptation. Error-augmentation (EA) training is relatively new concept in motor
      learning intended to promote the adaptation process. In this study participants will practice
      one session of training on 3D robotic device. Healthy volunteers will be randomly divided
      into two groups: study and control. The study group will carry out the training session with
      EA forces. The control group will carry out the same procedure with null force field. Outcome
      measure are the average size of trajectory error from the straight line and level of exertion
      (borg scale).

    <textblock>
      A single process involved in motor learning is adaptation. Hand reaching movement has been
      extensively used to evaluate the concept of motor adaptation. By inducing a systematic
      perturbation on the hand, it is possible to examine the implicit motor response on the
      trajectory of the hand. Error-augmentation (EA) training is relatively new concept in motor
      learning intended to promote the adaptation process. Applying these perturbating forces on
      the hand shift the hand trajectory form the straight line to a curve like shape. Making
      repetitive movement under the same conditions will results in a gradual correction of this
      faulty movement trajectory toward the straight line, e.g. motor adaptation.

      Participants: Healthy volunteers, aged 20-50, males and females. The participants will be
      randomly assigned into two groups: study or control group.

      Procedure: One practice session of 25 minutes on 3D robotic device. The study group will
      carry out the session with EA forces. The control group will carry out the same training
      without the EA forces.

      Outcome Measures: Size of trajectory error from the straight line, level of exertion.
