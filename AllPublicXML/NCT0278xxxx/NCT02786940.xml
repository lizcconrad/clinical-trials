    <textblock>
      2-3% of emergency department (ED) syncope patients suffer arrhythmia/death within 30-days of
      disposition (either as inpatient or at home) and the investigators recently developed the
      Canadian Syncope Arrhythmia Risk Score (CSARS) to predict these outcomes. Currently, only
      holter monitoring is used and is applied a few days later. New and innovative remote
      (out-of-hospital) external cardiac monitoring technology has made prolonged monitoring
      possible with live automatic and patient triggered cardiac rhythm transmission to a central
      monitoring station.

      Objective: To conduct a multicenter two-arm open label RCT among higher-risk (CSARS score≥3)
      ED syncope patients discharged home for comparing the diagnostic yield (detection of serious
      arrhythmias that required treatment or exclusion of arrhythmia) at the end of 15-days between
      a 15-day event monitor (intervention) and usual care (48-hour holter with patients seeking
      care after 48-hours based on symptoms) at 10 Canadian EDs.

      Methods: Cardiophone (live monitor) will be used for the intervention arm and the Mobile
      Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) device will be used for the control arm and both devices applied
      prior to ED discharge. MCT will function as a holter for first 48-hours and then as an event
      recorder (days 3-15) for arrhythmia surveillance. After written informed consent, patients
      will be randomized 1:1 with allocation concealed by web-based randomization and stratified
      based on the total CSARS scores. All patients will be linked to a study cardiologist and will
      have follow-up after 15-days. If serious arrhythmias are detected by Cardiophone, the patient
      will be transported to ED and for non-serious arrhythmias, an interim report sent to the
      study cardiologist for follow-up. All monitoring reports will be sent to the cardiologist
      within 24-hours of completion. Data collection: patient demographics, medical history, score
      predictors, device data (failure, false alarms, duration worn), patient symptoms and comfort.
      Primary outcome will be diagnostic yield at 15-days in the two study arms and primary
      analysis will compare the diagnostic yield by intention to treat principle controlling for
      the stratification factor. Sample Size: 300 patients per arm (600 total) to detect a 10%
      difference in diagnostic yield between the arms.

      Impact: Our study will increase early identification of patients with serious underlying
      arrhythmia by combining the CSARS risk tool with innovative remote monitoring technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syncope is sudden transient loss of consciousness followed by spontaneous complete recovery;
      it is a very common problem and can be a precursor to sudden death. This study will increase
      the early identification of patients with serious underlying arrhythmia by combining our
      Canadian Syncope Arrhythmia Risk Score (CSARS) with innovative remote (out-of-hospital)
      monitoring technology. Approximately 2-3% of ED syncope patients will suffer arrhythmia or
      die from unknown cause within 30-days of ED disposition (in-patient or outside the hospital).
      It is the concern for occult arrhythmia and its associated mortality that leads to prolonged
      cardiac monitoring in the ED, observation units or by hospitalization; and wide variations in
      investigations and hospitalization. New and innovative technology has made remote monitoring
      feasible for prolonged periods (15-30 days), and is reliable. This technology allows
      arrhythmias to be transmitted live to a central monitoring station automatically based on the
      device algorithm or by the touch of a button when patients are symptomatic. However, lack of
      tools to identify those at risk has limited the use of this new technology to improve patient
      outcomes. The CSARS tool, developed to predict the 30-day risk of arrhythmia/death showed
      that higher-risk (score ≥3) patients have a 17.2% observed risk arrhythmia/death within 15
      days. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the diagnostic yield of
      15-day event monitor to 48-hour holter monitor (usual care) among higher-risk syncope
      patients discharged home at 10 Canadian EDs.

      Context: Currently, only holter monitoring (records all cardiac beats) for 1-2 days is used
      and prolonged monitoring devices are not used for arrhythmia detection. The majority of
      syncope patients are not monitored when symptomatic. Arrhythmias are detected only if evident
      when patients seek care. The investigators recently completed a multicenter prospective
      syncope study and developed the Canadian Syncope Arrhythmia Risk Score (CSARS). Our results
      show that most serious conditions are identified within the first few hours in ED among the
      low and moderate-risk patients while for higher-risk patients the risk of arrhythmia remains
      high up to 15 days indicating the need for prolonged monitoring.

      Previous studies and Rationale: A small randomized study with the old technology that
      required patient activation for arrhythmia capture found higher diagnostic yield than holter;
      but the utility was limited due to patients' inability to activate the device after symptoms.
      Two small studies of unselected syncope patients, one prospective (n=48) and another registry
      analysis (n=92) found a diagnostic yield 30 - 38% with prolonged monitoring for 7-33 days.
      The diagnostic yield of holter is 1-20% based on the risk of enrolled patients. The role of
      prolonged cardiac monitoring among ED syncope patients has not been well studied. Only holter
      monitoring is being currently used, but inconsistently and is applied a few days later. With
      the technological advances, the investigators hypothesize that 15-day monitoring will lead to
      higher diagnostic yield than holter and plan to apply the devices before disposition for
      high-risk patients discharged home.

      Objectives: The objective is to compare the diagnostic yield (detection of serious
      arrhythmias that required treatment or caused death, or exclusion of arrhythmia by
      symptom-rhythm correlation) at the end of 15-days between a 15-day external cardiac event
      monitor (intervention) and usual care (48-hour holter monitor with patients seeking medical
      care after 48-hours based on symptoms) among high-risk ED syncope patients discharged home.

      Design and Setting: The study will be a multicenter two-arm, open label RCT conducted at 10
      EDs Patient Recruitment: Consecutive patients who fulfill inclusion and do not meet any
      exclusion criteria will be approached for recruitment at the participating EDs and enrolled
      after informed written consent.

      Randomization: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive a 15-day event
      monitor Cardiophone or a 48-hour holter monitoring with the MCT device. Patients will be
      stratified based on the total CSARS score: 3-4; 5-6; and 7-8 and allocated using randomly
      permuted blocks of varying lengths. Allocations will be computer-generated by an independent
      statistician and concealed by having research staff log on to a password-protected Electronic
      Data Capture (EDC) System located within the coordinating center website.

      Intervention: Enrolled patients will receive all outpatient investigations except monitoring
      as per the discharging physician. Based on their allocation, patients will receive either
      Cardiophone or the MCT device prior to discharge home.

      Data Collection: Patient demographics, medical history, CSARS predictors, results of physical
      examination and investigations, and patient disposition will be collected. The following
      device data will be obtained from the central monitoring station: quality of recordings,
      device failure (rhythm not captured during death or when symptomatic), false alarms due to
      artefacts, times of patient activation of cardiophone device due to symptoms, any rhythm
      abnormalities detected during the symptoms, and monitoring reports for patients in both arms.
      Patients will complete a questionnaire during the follow-up visit regarding any serious
      conditions suffered, their comfort and how secure they felt because of the cardiac
      monitoring.

      Post-ED Care of Study Patients: All patients enrolled in the study will be linked to a local
      cardiology group for any urgent and end of study follow-up. Patients will be advised to keep
      a diary of symptoms during the 15-day monitoring period. Patients in the cardiophone arm will
      have the option of transmitting the rhythm when symptomatic and symptom-rhythm correlation
      will be reported. Patients will be advised to return the devices and the symptom diary to the
      local cardiology clinic the next business day after the 15-day monitoring period. All
      monitoring reports will be completed by the central monitoring station within 24-hours and
      sent to the study cardiologist. In the intervention (cardiophone) arm: 1) If serious
      arrhythmias are detected, then the central monitoring station will contact the patient or the
      family member and advise them to call 911 for the patient to be transported to the ED; 2) If
      other arrhythmias are identified, the central monitoring station will provide an interim
      report to the study cardiologist providing care. The study cardiologist will decide the need
      for urgent follow-up and time-frame within which such follow-up should occur. For patients in
      the control arm with MCT device, the central monitoring station will provide reports for
      48-hour holter monitoring and event monitoring for days 3 to 15 the next day after completion
      of the monitoring period (days 3 and 16 respectively). Patients in the control arm will be
      clearly advised that the monitoring is not live and they should seek care for symptoms as
      usual. All patients will be monitored for the entire 15-days regardless of early arrhythmias
      detected and will have end of study follow-up with cardiology to discuss the monitoring
      results and plan further management as deemed appropriate.

      Duration of Participation and Withdrawal: Patients will be part of the study until the
      follow-up with the study cardiologist after the 15-day monitoring period within 1 - 2 weeks
      of monitoring completion. Patients will be free to withdraw from the study at any time
      without providing any reason and without any penalty or loss of benefits they are entitled
      and the number of withdrawals will be monitored. However, as these monitoring devices will
      serve to allay fear of arrhythmia or death among patients, the investigators expect very few
      withdrawals. There will be no restrictions on medications or procedures during the study
      period.

      Data Analysis: The primary analysis will be by intent-to-treat and will compare the
      diagnostic yield (arrhythmia detection or exclusion) at the end of 15-days using data from
      15-day monitoring in the intervention arm and the 48-hour holter monitoring followed by
      arrhythmia detection or exclusion when patients seek care based on their symptoms (not based
      on the 13-day event recordings by the MCT device). Secondary analysis will include a
      per-protocol analysis. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used for the primary outcome,
      controlling for the stratification factor (CSARS score). The effect of the intervention will
      be expressed as a risk difference with 95% confidence interval. Secondary analysis will
      include multivariable logistic regression to control for potential confounders or imbalances
      between patients in the study arms. Descriptive statistics for baseline characteristics, all
      outcomes, device performance including failure and patient centered measures (adherence,
      comfort and safety feeling). Additional analysis will include comparison of arrhythmias
      detected that did not require treatment between the groups. There will no interim analyses
      for efficacy performed, but the investigators will monitor trial safety as detailed in the
      Data Safety Monitoring Board section.

      Sample Size: Our sample size is 300 patients per arm (600 total) determined to yield 80%
      power to detect an absolute difference of 10% in diagnostic yield between the study arms
      using a chi-squared test at the 5% level of significance assuming a control arm event rate of
      17% and accounting for 5% attrition. A difference of 10% is feasible based on previous
      studies which have reported an 18% increase in diagnostic yield with prolonged monitoring.

      Data Safety Monitoring Board: This independent committee will be comprised of one emergency
      physician, one cardiologist and a biostatistician from outside the participating sites. This
      board will be responsible for safeguarding the interests and safety of trial participants by
      reviewing adverse events including deaths every 6 months during the study period.

      Anticipated Contributions: Our study will be the first to combine risk-stratification and
      innovative technology to decrease morbidity and mortality, and improve healthcare efficiency.
      This study will create new knowledge regarding the role of prolonged live monitoring among
      high-risk syncope patients and application of device prior to ED discharge. As the monitoring
      is live, timely management of potentially life threatening arrhythmias is possible and can be
      applied to syncope patients not at risk for ventricular arrhythmia and hospitalized solely
      for cardiac monitoring. This will represent a paradigm shift as patients can now be monitored
      at home at a very low cost decreasing ED and hospital crowding. These devices will alleviate
      fears of occult arrhythmia and death and will improve patient outcomes.
