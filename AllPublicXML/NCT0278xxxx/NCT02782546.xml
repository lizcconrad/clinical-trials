  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a standard phase 2 study powered to demonstrate improvement in the 100 day leukemia
      free survival to 30% from &lt;10% expected with the use of reduced intensity haplo-HCT in this
      extremely high-risk patient cohort (based on the institutional experience using
      non-myeloablative / reduced intensity conditioning in a similar patient cohort).

      A formal safety evaluation will be done after every 6th patient enrolled and the trial will
      be stopped if noted to have unusually higher engraftment failure (acute GVHD rates (&gt;60% any
      grades or &gt;30% grade III/IV or ≥ 50% severe cGVHD) or engraftment failure rates (≥15%).

    <description>Standard of care reduced intensity preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and single dose total body irradiation (TBI) on Day -1
Graft cell infusion on Day 0
Post-transplant cyclophosphamide on Days +3 and +4
GvHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will start on Day +5. MMF will continue till Day +35 and tacrolimus till Day +180 in the absence of GvHD
G-CSF will start on Day +7 and will continue until neutrophil engraftment as per institutional guidelines
The cytokine-induced memory like natural killer (CIML NK) cells will be infused on Day +7 without a filter or pump, slowly by gravity over at least 15 minutes.
ALT-803 will start approximately 4 hours after the CIML NK cell infusion. ALT-803 will be administered subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mcg/kg subcutaneously from Day +7 (on the day of CIML NK cell infusion), Day +12, Day +17, and Day +22 for a total of 4 doses.</description>

    <description>Donors will receive 10mg/kg-BW of subcutaneous G-CSF from Day -5 till Day -1 and then undergo 20L apheresis per institutional guidelines.
Two consecutive days for collection are allowed in case of the target CD34+ cell dose being less than the target 4 x106/kg-bw from the first day of collection.
On Day +6 (one day before the planned CIML NK cell infusion), peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected by a single standard 20-L apheresis over 4-5 hours from the same haploidentical related donor that provided the HCT graft.</description>
