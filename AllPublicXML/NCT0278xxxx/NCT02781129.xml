  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify brain activity associated with good memory in subjects
      with a chronically implanted RNS® device and to study the effects of therapeutic stimulation
      for epilepsy on memory. This will be accomplished through analysis of ECoG data collected
      during memory encoding for short and long-term free recall as well as during navigation
      tasks.
