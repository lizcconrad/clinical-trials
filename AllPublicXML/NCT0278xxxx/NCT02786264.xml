      This study proposes to perform a descriptive analysis and pilot observational study looking
      at the types and quantity of anesthetic agents used and their associations with outcomes
      among patients scheduled to receive transfemoral aortic valve replacements (TAVR) at Yale New
      Haven Hospital (YNHH).

      This study proposes to perform a descriptive analysis and pilot observational study looking
      at the types and quantity of anesthetic agents used and their associations with outcomes
      among patients scheduled to receive TAVR at YNHH.

      Hypothesis 1: TAVR surgery done under monitored anesthesia care are performed using some
      combination of the following anesthetics: dexmedetomidine, propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam.

      Hypothesis 2: Age-adjusted dosing of these agents will be insufficient to account for extreme
      age after controlling for preoperative comorbid status.

      Hypothesis 3: The rate of conversion to general anesthesia will be unrelated to the type of
      conscious sedation used.

      Hypothesis 4: ICU length of stay, delirium, hospital length of stay, and length of hospital
      stay will be shorter for patients who were sedated using dexmedetomidine vs those without.

      Research Plan: The research will be done via chart review and analysis of data already
      contained in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group databases at Yale. The possible
      risks are primarily the risk to privacy that is inherent in any retrospective chart review.
      The benefit may be to suggest areas of future study to improve sedation practices for TAVR at
      Yale and elsewhere. Information recorded will include demographic and preoperative medical
      assessment from prior to the TAVR, the anesthetic record, and the post-operative course of
      recovery for patients undergoing TAVR. These data will include age, gender, comorbidities,
      laboratory values, vital signs, and the results of imaging studies as well as other records
      potentially related to the above hospitalization.
