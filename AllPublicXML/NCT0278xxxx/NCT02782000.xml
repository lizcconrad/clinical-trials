  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the number of aged people increasing and the lifespan lengthen, dementia is becoming a
      great public challenge in China. Early recognition of dementia is crucial to improve the
      prognosis of dementia patients and decrease the society disease burden. It is a pity that the
      early recognition rate of dementia is less than 7% in China. Most of the aged people live in
      the community and general practitioners (GP) in community provide health service much more
      frequently than other medical workers. It is suggested that GPs should be the best one to
      screen dementia in its early period. However, most of GPs have not receive any training about
      dementia early recognition in China. It is imperative and meaningful to provide training to
      GPs for improve GPs' knowledge and skills about dementia early recognition. How to train GPs
      for early recognizing dementia and how about the training effect? Which training model may be
      better? We did not find consistent conclusion about these questions in China. This study aims
      to set up an effective and convenient model to training GPs in dementia early recognition. A
      total of 152 GPs in Beijing will be enrolled and be randomly divided into two groups. One
      group will firstly have lessons about dementia early recognition and then receive
      face-to-face supervision and key messages by Wechat about dementia early recognition once a
      month in the following 6 months. Another group will firstly have lessons about dementia early
      recognition and then receive face-to-face supervision and key messages by Wechat about
      dementia early recognition once a month in the following 3 months. The score of knowledge and
      attitude about dementia early recognition, the accuracy of analyzing dementia cases, the
      usage of dementia screening scales and the referral rate of dementia will be evaluated at
      different time point respectively. This study will provide evidence for training GPs
      effectively in dementia early recognition in the future and will promote dementia early
      recognition in community.
