    <textblock>
      The study is a parallel-group single blinded randomized controlled trial, examining the
      effect of exercise on physical function in older women with osteoporosis and a history of
      vertebral fracture. The participants will randomly be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the
      intervention group and the control group. The intervention will follow newly developed
      exercise recommendations for people with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures, which states
      the balance- and strength exercises should be performed at least twice a week. The
      intervention is a group exercise session circuit program lasting for 12 weeks. The
      participants will be tested at baseline, and followed up at 3 months and 6 months.
