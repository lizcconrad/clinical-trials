  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will explore barriers to improving self-efficacy, or the ability to feel in
      control of their disease, and medication adherence with text messaging through surveys and
      interviews with adolescents and adults with SCD cared for at the Vanderbilt Meharry Center of
      Excellence (VMCE) in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The investigators will identify preferences
      to improve and sustain adherence to daily medication through selection of
      investigator-proposed or patient-generated text messaging strategies. Finally, the
      investigators will fill in the literature gaps by describing barriers to self-efficacy and
      medication adherence among adults with SCD as well as adolescents with SCD who are
      transitioning to adult care.
