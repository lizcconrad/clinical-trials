      survivors of breast, colon, lung, prostate and gynecologic cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two validated interventions for the treatment of
      insomnia in cancer survivors of breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer. Moreover, it will
      provide an opportunity to assess the efficacy of both of these interventions in a group
      setting in patients of varied ethnic backgrounds including African-Americans, Latinos and
      Caucasians. The results of this study will help clinicians provide future interventions
      specific to cancer type and ethnicity in order to better serve the needs of our cancer
      survivors and improve their quality of life.
