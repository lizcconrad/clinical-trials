             Global Assessment score of 3 or 4. (The face, scalp, palms, soles, axillae and
             intertriginous areas are to be excluded in this assessment, if psoriasis is present.)

             psoriasis, as determined by the investigator.

          -  Presents with psoriasis that was treated with prescription medication and failed to

             of the treatment areas, as determined by the investigator.
