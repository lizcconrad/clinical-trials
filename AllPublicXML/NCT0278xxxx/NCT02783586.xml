  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main advantage of Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB) compared to Transversus Abdominalis
      Plane Block (TAPB) is the impact on visceral pain due to the spread of the local anaesthetic
      agent to the paravertebral space. It may produce extensive analgesia and better pain control.

      Previews studies shoved the effectiveness of TAPB in kidney transplantation procedure (KTX)
      by reducing opioids requirements during and after the operation. QLB was not evaluating in
      KTX procedure yet, but it reduced postoperative morphine requirement after cesarean section
      under spinal anaesthesia.

      The aim of this prospective, randomised controlled, multicenter, clinical study is to compare
      the perioperative analgesic efficacy of QLB and TAPB in patients who had KTX under balanced
      (general and regional) anaesthesia.

      After Bioethical Committee of Medical University of Warsaw approval, informed written consent
      will be obtained from all patients.

      A sample size of 104 patients was calculated to obtain at list 25% reduction of fentanyl
      usage in QLBII group with 0,05% significance and power of 0,8. Consenting patients, scheduled
      to KTX procedure under general anaesthesia will be randomly assigned (1:1) according to the
      computer -generated randomization list with permuted blocks (block sizes: 20, 20, 24, 40) to
      receive 20ml of 0,25% Bupivacaine with epinephrine ipsilaterally to the operation side in
      QLBII or TAPB after the general anaesthesia induction and before the surgery starts. All the
      blocks will be performed in the supine patients position, under ultrasound guidance for both
      techniques. The correct spread of injectate will be confirmed with ultrasound.
