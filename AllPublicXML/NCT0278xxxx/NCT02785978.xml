  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-QuantiPark is a pilot study to evaluate the reliability and responsiveness of ActiMyo
      measured activity in PD patients. The purpose of the study is to provide validation of the
      ActiMyo, an innovative home-recording device enabling use in clinical trials and as an
      innovative tool for PD patient care.
