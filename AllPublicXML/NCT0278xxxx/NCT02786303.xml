    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and the follow-up of neuroendocrine tumors can be difficult to assess,
      especially in the detection of metastasis as they can grow in different organs such as liver,
      lungs, bones or lymph nodes. Nowadays, the diagnosis is made with two main imaging techniques
      which are the thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT-scan and a scintigraphic method (Octreoscan and
      sometimes a TEP-scan). The use of a whole-body MRI is more and more often used for the
      detection and evaluation of tumors and metastases; therefore, it could be used for
      neuroendocrine tumors. The MRI would allow to replace the two imaging techniques and to avoid
      the use of irradiation but also to have a better detection of metastases. This purpose of the
      study was to evaluate this statement by assessing the consistency between the routine
      techniques and the MRI and finally to update the recommendation if the study is positive.

      The main metastatic sites of neuroendocrine tumors can be the liver, the bones, the lungs and
      lymph nodes. According to the French recommendations (&quot; Thesaurus national de cancérologie
      digestive &quot;), the initial assessment includes a thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT-scan and a
      scintigraphic method (Octreoscan and TEP-scan if Octreoscan negative). The aim is to detect
      metastases and tumoral progression to offer the appropriate treatment, such as surgery. Due
      to its high contrast resolution, its absence of irradiation, and diffusion sequences, the MRI
      is more and more used to detect tumor progression. The recent literature shows better results
      with the diffusion sequences than the T2-weighted sequences and, potentially, than the
      contrast-enhanced sequences to detect liver metastasis. The whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI
      seems promising for the staging and the following of some cancers. Only two publications have
      evaluated the diagnostic value of diffusion sequences to detect pancreatic neuroendocrine
      tumors and liver metastasis. Yet, no publication has assessed the diagnostic value of
      whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI in the patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
