    <textblock>
      In an observational study, the energy consumption of stroke individuals during performing the
      structured, progressive task-oriented exercise program for walking rehabilitation will be
      measured in order to confirm the intensity demand in the range of moderate to vigorous.

      Community reintegration is often significantly affected in the majority of stroke
      individuals. To fulfill the requirements of a proper home exercise program in walking
      rehabilitation for stroke victims, investigators structured the task-oriented exercise
      program with minimal supervision. This exercise program is structured with challenging
      walking-related activities based on motor learning principle and Gentile's progression of the
      motor task. The strengthening and balance components, aerobic conditioning and walking
      adaptability are composed of an exercise program to optimize walking ability. There are sixty
      minutes last ten exercises in each three progression steps of this exercise program. For the
      training effect to occur, each step of exercise program is designed by increasing demand of
      intensity in the range from moderate to vigorous. To confirming progressive energy demand,
      the purpose of this study is to investigate the intensity demand of three steps task-
      oriented home exercise program on walking competency in individual post stroke.
