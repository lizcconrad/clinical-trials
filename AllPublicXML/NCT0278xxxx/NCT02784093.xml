  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal impaction (FI) is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal tract obstruction, and it is
      the result of chronic or severe constipation and most commonly found in the elderly
      population. Gastrografin is a water soluble contrast mediate that could act as an osmotic
      laxative. It has been shown to confer a therapeutic beneﬁt in adhesive small bowel
      obstruction (SBO). The investigators speculate that gastrografin administrated orally may be
      more effective than enema in the treatment of fecal impaction induced intestinal obstruction.
