  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational biomarker study including patients with non-metastatic,
      soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) for whom neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered as the best option
      by the multidisciplinary sarcoma team of one of the participating centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even when retrospective statistical identification for a biomarker has been achieved, the
      ultimate proof of its usefulness in the clinic still requires prospective evidence. Our
      prospective study aims to validate the prognosis value of the CINSARC signature in a
      prospective way. Moreover, the neoadjuvant setting is an ideal one to identify molecular
      predictive factors of sensitivity to chemotherapy by correlating tumor response with genetic
      profile of STS. Moreover, molecular profiling of treatment-refractory tumor cells may reveal
      alterations that are associated with drug resistance, metastatic recurrence and disease
      progression. The identifications of such factors in the neoadjuvant setting may help to
      improve the management of STS patients in the adjuvant and metastatic settings

    <description>Procedure/Surgery: Newly obtained biopsy if applicable and Blood samples collection.
For each patient:
Frozen and paraffin embedded tumor material (archival or new biopsy) will be obtained for genetic profiling
Blood samples will be obtained for genetic profiling and assessment of markers.
The classification as CINSARC will be performed for each patient. Patients should be treated by neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Chemotherapy regimen must contain at least doxorubicin (dose range: 60 -75 mg/m²) and ifosfamide (dose range: 2.5-3g/m²) to be delivered on a 21-days cycle basis up to 6 cycles prior surgery. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion, patients will be treated by surgery followed or not by radiotherapy.
All patients should be managed according to the usual medical practices.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed soft-tissue sarcoma by central review, except if the

             biopsy of the tumour for research purpose,

          3. Non-metastatic disease, for which the use of chemotherapy to &quot;downstage&quot; the sarcoma
             prior to surgery, is assumed to result in better local tumor control by the
