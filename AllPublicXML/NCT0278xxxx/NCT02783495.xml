      This pilot trial of this iPad-based intervention in glioma patients at University of
      California, San Francisco (UCSF) will establish feasibility and preliminary efficacy data to
      support a funding application for a larger clinical trial. Twenty patients with stable
      low-grade gliomas will complete a computerized battery of standardized neurocognitive tests
      and quality of life assessments at baseline. Subjects will complete the intervention at home
      over 3 months. Neuro-cognitive testing will be repeated 3 and 9 months after baseline.
      Subjects will also complete a post-intervention questionnaire on the usefulness,
      attractiveness, difficulty and burden of the intervention. Clinical data will be collected at
      the time of each assessment. This will include diagnostic and treatment history, magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI data), tumor genomics and immunohistochemistry.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 70.

          -  This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to
             measure differences between them. Males and females will be recruited with no

             therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.

          -  Patients must be receiving MRI scans at UCSF

          -  Patients must be clinically stable and off treatment (e.g. radiation or chemotherapy)
             for ≥ 6 months

          -  Patients must be ≥ 6 months from craniotomy

          -  Patients must have subjective complaints of cognitive deficits.

          -  Patients must have adequate seizure control and be on a stable, or decreasing, dose of
             anti-epileptics

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not have home access to the Internet.

          -  Patients who, based on the physician's opinion, are unable to participate in
             neurocognitive testing and/or neurocognitive rehab secondary to significant neurologic
             deficit
