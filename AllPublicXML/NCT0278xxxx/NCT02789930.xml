  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective single center study is to investigate if a developed program
      is more accurate than the anesthesia tape (&quot;Anästhesie-Lineal&quot;). For this study 1000 patients
      are required to collect anonymized data (length, weight, age, anesthesia material used during
      anesthesia) for achieving a power of 80% during statistical analysis. The main hypothesis ist
      that the program has a better accuracy than the anesthesia tape (&quot;Anästhesie-Lineal&quot;).

      This prospective single center study is performed at the university children's Hospital
      zurich. Patients planned for surgery in general anesthesia with intubation, aged 0 to 16
      years and with a body length suitable for the emergency tapes can be included in this study.
      Patient and parental information is performed during the pre-anesthetic visit. After written
      consent the patient will be included. Patient ́s length and weight will be measures earliest
      one day before data collection. Data collection during anesthesia has no influence on the
      daily anesthesia routine and has no impact on patient safety and anaesthesia. Patient's data
      is made anonymous for further inspection. Data is documented in Microsoft Excel and
      statistical analysis calculated with SPSS. 1000 patients are needed for a power of 80%.
      Primary outcome parameter is length based weight estimation, secondary outcome parameters are
      length based age estimation and the correctness of recommended anesthesia material
      (endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask, oropharyngeal mask and face mask). Both tools (program
      and anesthesia tape [&quot;Anästhesie-Lineal&quot;]) will be compared with each other regarding primary
      and secondary outcome parameters.
