  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an analysis using the French national health insurance database, six months
      after the beginning of NOAC launch in the NVAF indication.

      The aim is to compare the one-year, two-year and three-year benefit-risk (major bleeding,
      arterial thrombotic events, myocardial infarction (MI), death) between patients starting a
      NOAC and patients starting a VKA for NVAF in 2013
