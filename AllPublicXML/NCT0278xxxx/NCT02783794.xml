  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether BP-C1 is effective in the treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer patients who had previously received at least three lines of
      chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BP-C1, solution for injections 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients
      with metastatic breast cancer with palliative intent. Active substance of the product, which
      is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent developed for intramuscular administration,
      is cis-coordinated complexes of platinum(II) with the polymer of benzene polycarboxylic acids
      derived from lignin (CDBPA). The product is a complex between cis-diammineplatinum(II)
      derived core and an amphiphilic polymer, containing a composition of benzene polycarboxylic
      acids. The amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a product with clear
      and significantly altered and improved properties compared to other platinum analogues, e.g.
      cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

      BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin),
      additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer patients:

        -  injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions;

        -  can be administered at home by a nurse or a patient;

        -  has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  demonstrates efficacy comparable to cisplatin and much higher than carboplatin
           (in-vitro; in-vivo data);

        -  exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase IIb study.
      The eligible patients will be allocated (1:1) to either BP-C1 arm or Placebo arm and treated
      once daily for 32 days. The patients allocated to Placebo arm will cross over to BP-C1
      treatment for 32 days when progression of the cancer will be documented and latest after
      32-day treatment with Placebo. After 32-day treatment with BP-C1 the patients will be invited
      to participate in the study BMC2011-02 to continue BP-C1 treatment.

    <measure>Change (%) in the sum of diameters of target lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 32 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Diameter of target lesions will be measured by computer tomography (CT) with contrasting using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of target lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 32 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of target lesions per each patient will be evaluated by CT with contrasting. Change in number of target lesions from baseline to Day 32 of treatment will be presented in shift tables.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment response</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 32 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>In accordance with RECIST v1.1 the treatment response will be classified as 'complete response', 'partial response', 'stable disease' or 'progressive disease':
Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): at least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum might also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions will also be considered progression.
Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
