  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a most common genetic metabolic disease characterized by low platelet
      number, liver and spleen enlargement and various forms of bone diseases including low bone
      mineral density leading to brittle bones. Various treatment options are now available for
      this disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the prevalence of Gaucher disease in
      patients with low bone mineral density as observed by DEXA scan, which is a form of X-Ray of
      the bone.

      Gaucher disease is a potential secondary cause of low bone mineral density and it is
      prevalent among patients with low BMD. This cross sectional design study will measure point
      prevalence of Gaucher disease in patients with low bone mineral density (BMD).

        The study will be conducted in a cross-sectional design measuring point prevalence of
        Gaucher disease in patients with low bone mineral density. Low BMD is defined as T-Score
        &lt;-1.0. In addition, prevalence stratified by age, gender, and menopausal status will be
        determined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt; or equal to18 years and able to provide written consent.

          -  Patients who have had a bone density test demonstrating T-score &lt;-1.0 on a DEXA scan
             within the past year or those who are prospectively referred for DEXA scan and who are
             later identified by their physician to have a DEXA T-score &lt; -1.0.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject unable to read and sign consent form.

          -  Terminally ill subjects or subjects with serious co-morbidities (malignancy), which
             would limit the ability of the patient to participate in the study.

          -  Subjects with the following disorders or exposures

          -  Underlying skeletal dysplasia

          -  An endocrinologic/metabolic disease known to cause bone demineralization: including
             parathyroid dysfunction, hyperthyroidism, Cushing syndrome, hypogonadism,
             panhypopituitarism

          -  Cystic Fibrosis

          -  Exposure to medications that are known to cause low BMD including chemotherapy within
             past 2 years, chronic corticosteroid or phenytoin use within past 2 years

          -  Radiation exposure within the past 5 years

          -  Vitamin D deficiency is not an exclusion criteria as this is highly prevalent in the
             adult population under investigation as well as in patients with Gaucher disease. (9,
             10)

          -  Subjects previously diagnosed with Gaucher Disease
