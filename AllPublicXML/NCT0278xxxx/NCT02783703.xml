      The study team will investigate the racial differences in the metabolic and clinical
      responses to Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) between African American and Caucasian American
      subjects with Metabolic Syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese African Americans (AA) with metabolic syndrome (MS) are known to have more
      hyperinsulinemia (HI) and insulin resistance (IR) than Caucasian Americans (CA). Racial
      disparities in type 2 diabetes (T2D) outcomes adversely affect AA. Medium chain triglycerides
      (MCT) are a safe and effective treatment for IR and MS but are not widely used. The
      investigators' main aims are to determine the effects of MCT on insulin secretion and
      clearance, insulin sensitivity, beta cell function, and the disposition index using the
      frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) and Bergman's minimal model
      analysis. The study team will investigate the racial differences in the metabolic and
      clinical responses to MCT between AA and CA subjects with MS. The investigators aim to enroll
      20 obese subjects (10 AA, 10 CA) with MS in an isocaloric study in which participants will
      receive MCT supplementation daily for 6 weeks while maintaining stable weight. Insulin
      secretion dynamics and insulin sensitivity will be assessed before and after the intervention
      by FSIVGTT. The investigators hope to show that MCT can effectively reduce HI and IR in CA
      and AA. These pilot data will provide the basis for a NIH grant submission to further
      investigate the treatment of MS with MCT in a mixed racial population.
