  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HDQ 200 is an interventional multicenter study. This is a before-and-after design in which
      the patient is his own control. The main objective of the study is to determine the
      percentage of success of a procedure of daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow. All
      patients treated with conventional hemodialysis, for at least 3 months and clinically stable,
      can be included in the study. Their 3 months data prior to inclusion is collected
      retrospectively. These 3 months of conventional hemodialysis are the reference period.
      Patients are then treated with daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow for 3 months. During
      this 3 months period, the same data as during the period of conventional hemodialysis are
      collected prospectively.

    <description>Definition of success: if during the period of daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow, the patient maintains the absolute value of their pre-dialysis serum creatinine (mid-week dialysis) below the upper limit of the confidence interval established during the 3 months prior to inclusion on 7 values: measurements every 2 weeks for 3 months (retrospective data) and inclusion measurement included (Day 0).
Daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow will be considered as a failure if pre-dialysis serum creatinine values exceed twice successively the upper limit of the confidence interval established for the patient.</description>
