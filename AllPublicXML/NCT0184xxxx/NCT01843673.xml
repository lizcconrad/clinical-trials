    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies image-guided adaptive radiotherapy in detecting tumors during
      treatment in patients with head and neck cancer. Image-guided adaptive radiotherapy uses high
      quality imaging technology to detect the tumor and normal organs during treatment. It is not
      yet known which imaging technique provides the best image for guidance during treatment with
      radiation therapy. Comparing results of imaging procedures done before, during, and after
      radiotherapy may help doctors plan the best treatment.

      I. To conduct a clinical imaging study utilizing three novel in-room imaging systems: Oblique
      Brainlab ExacTrac images, Orthogonal Varian kilovoltage (kV) On-board Imaging (OBI) image,
      and Varian cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging to assess their performance in
      reducing inter- and intrafractional setup errors, relative to weekly megavoltage (MV)
      electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images, using both bony landmarks and soft tissue
      changes for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy
      (RT).

      II. To assess the accuracy of CBCT imaging for measuring systematic soft tissue changes in
      the head and neck (HN) area relative to conventional high resolution contrast enhanced
      fan-beam computed tomography (CT) (FBCT) as a standard.

      III. To assess the systematic and random soft tissue motion errors using daily CBCT imaging
      relative to bony-landmark alignment to evaluate the benefit of soft tissue imaging during
      radiotherapy.

      IV. To quantify soft tissue changes during an entire course of radiotherapy (e.g. tumor
      shrinkage) using daily CBCT imaging.

      V. To determine the feasibility of using measured set up and soft-tissue motion uncertainties
      in conjunction with volume changes observed on serial CBCT images, for offline adaptive
      replanning of HNC patients using available planning tools.

      VI. To quantify the benefits of adaptive image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) in HN patients in
      terms of target coverage and normal tissue avoidance.

      VII. To determine the feasibility of mounting a phase I/II trial to assess the clinical
      benefits of image-guided adaptive radiotherapy (IGART) in terms of acute and late toxicities
      and tumor control.

      VIII. To build a HNC patient database for future validation of IGART processes using
      deformable image registration and Virtual Clinical Trials (VCTs).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo FBCT once before treatment and once weekly for a total of 6-7 scans, dual
      CBCT up to 5 times weekly for a total of 33-35 scans, 2-dimensional (2-D) x-ray with Varian
      kV OBI 5 times weekly for a total of 33-35 scans, 2-D x-ray with Brain Lab ExacTrac 5 times
      weekly for a total of 33-35 scans, 2-D x-ray with Varian MV OBI once weekly for a total of
      6-7 scans, and EPID imaging up to 5 times weekly for a total of 33-35 scans while undergoing
      IGART.

    <description>The automated patient setup procedure varies between 'OBI', 'CBCT' or 'Exactrac' imaging technologies. Each procedure gives two shifts: 'vertical' and 'lateral'. In the absence of a gold standard, our goal is to compare the shifts recommended by each pair of automated patient setup procedures. Average and Std deviation of vertical and lateral motion from the three systems were computed. P value, 1.00, refers to the test of difference of each system with OBI being more than 2 mm. Pairwise comparison for each direction between each pair of technologies were done using a t test to check if the difference in the recommended shift is more than 2 mm. The reported mean value represents the shift from planned treatment position averaged over all daily treatment setups. A negative mean vertical value indicates the patient was consistently set up posterior to plan; a negative mean lateral value indicates a set up consistently right of plan.</description>

        <title>Differences of Calculated Set up Errors of 2 mm Between the Different Imaging Technologies</title>
        <description>The automated patient setup procedure varies between 'OBI', 'CBCT' or 'Exactrac' imaging technologies. Each procedure gives two shifts: 'vertical' and 'lateral'. In the absence of a gold standard, our goal is to compare the shifts recommended by each pair of automated patient setup procedures. Average and Std deviation of vertical and lateral motion from the three systems were computed. P value, 1.00, refers to the test of difference of each system with OBI being more than 2 mm. Pairwise comparison for each direction between each pair of technologies were done using a t test to check if the difference in the recommended shift is more than 2 mm. The reported mean value represents the shift from planned treatment position averaged over all daily treatment setups. A negative mean vertical value indicates the patient was consistently set up posterior to plan; a negative mean lateral value indicates a set up consistently right of plan.</description>
        <time_frame>up to 7 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Ten evaluable head and neck patients treated with external beam radiation therapy received 19 to 32 fractions with all three imaging techniques. The mean daily shift of these 19 to 32 fractions were recorded for each technique. Statistical significance is determined based on 5% level of significance.</population>
