  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will be conducted in
      the first affiliated hospital of Sun yat-sen university in Guangzhou, China. Patients aged
      18-65 (ASA I-II) undergoing elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery with general anesthesia
      will be involved in this study. According to previous studies and our pilot trial, estimated
      120 patients will be involved in this study. All eligible patients will be randomly assigned
      to two groups. In group P, patients will receive parecoxib 40mg intravenously 30min before
      intubation, 8h and 20h after the surgery,respectively. In Group C, patients will receive
      normal saline at the same time points. The shoulder pressure pain thresholds will be measured
      with a pressure algometer by an independent doctor blinding to medication and grouping at the
      day before surgery, 24h and 48h after surgery. Moreover, the intensity of shoulder pain and
      side effects will be evaluated by another independent doctor at 24h and 48h after surgery. At
      the end of the observation, the intensity of the maximal shoulder pain will be assessed.

    <description>The patients are asked to rate the severity of shoulder pain via a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from no pain (0) to worst possible pain (10) by another independent doctor.</description>
