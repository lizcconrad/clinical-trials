  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol is to assess the overall response rate (complete response and partial response)
      of treatment with non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg / m² in combination
      with dexamethasone in immunocompetent adult patients with primary brain lymphoma large B-cell
      refractory or relapsed after first-line treatment MTXHD and high-dose cytarabine, excluding
      strict eye lymphomas.

      This is a Phase II, open, prospective, multicenter, non-comparative with direct individual
      benefit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with cerebral lymphoma B cell refractory or relapsed within 12 months after
             first-line chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate (1.5 g / m²) and high dose
             cytarabine (2g / m²) and / or radiotherapy or autologous, or patient with an
             indication against these treatments.

        Refractory disease is defined by the absence of objective response to treatment or relapse
        within 3 months of it. A relapse is defined as disease progression after obtaining a
        complete or partial response.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Performance Index less than 4

          -  Adequate hepatic function: ALT / AST and bilirubin less than the upper limit of the
             normal laboratory

          -  Adequate renal function: creatinine clearance greater than 60 ml / min

          -  adequate cardiac function measured by ejection fraction of the left ventricle&gt; 50% by
             echocardiography

          -  Informed consent signed

          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with immunosuppression from any cause (HIV, history of transplantation,
             immunosuppressive treatments ...)

          -  Prior treatment MYOCET ® or other anthracycline

          -  Active infection

          -  Surgery large (more than 3 days hospitalization) within 28 days before enrollment in
             the study, except for a diagnostic neurosurgical

          -  Hypersensitivity to any component of the treatment

          -  Contraindications to the administration of MYOCET ® and / or dexamethasone
