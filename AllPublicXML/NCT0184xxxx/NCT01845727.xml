  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study encompasses a two-step approach. The first aiming to determine the safety
      of Topical 3% Amphotericin B Cream when applied three or two times per day for 4 weeks in
      subjects with un-complicated Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) whilst the second focusing in
      having and indication of the efficacy of the two above mentioned regimens of Topical 3%
      Amphotericin B Cream

      For the first step, 30 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive direct observed
      treatment (DOT) with Topical 3% Amphotericin B Cream applied either three or two times per
      day for 4 weeks. Enrolment will be temporarily halted until all 30 subjects (15 in each
      group) have been enrolled and completed the 28 day treatment course. An interim analysis of
      all safety (Adverse Events, including local reactions and lab parameters) and
      pharmacokinetics collected on subjects who were randomized will be performed by data safety
      monitoring board. If no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the study drug are
      identified on the first 30 subjects by the end of the treatment course, 50 additional
      subjects will be randomly allocated to receive Topical 3% Amphotericin B Cream either three
      or two times per day for 28 days

      Subjects will have a follow-up visit at the end of therapy, on Day 45± 5 days, Day 63± 5 days
      and on Days 90± 14 days and on Day 180, minus 14d, plus 4 weeks to assess efficacy, as
      measured by the number of subjects who fulfil the cure criteria: 100% re-epithelialization of
      the lesion(s) by Day 90 and no relapse by Day 180. All subjects will be followed up to Day
      180 for final analysis of efficacy.
