      The purpose of this study is to implement a substudy in approximately 120 rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) subjects to compare the steady-state serum trough concentration (Cminss), Cmax
      and area under the curve (AUC) during the dosing interval (TAU) of subcutaneous (SC)
      Abatacept injection of 125 mg via the autoinjector and via the BD Hypak™ Physiolis prefilled
      syringe.

        -  Efficacy: measure of an intervention's influence on a disease or health condition

        -  Safety/Efficacy

        -  Pharmacokinetics: the action of a drug in the body over a period of time including the

    <description>Abatacept SC was self-administered with a prefilled syringe every 7 days for the first 4 weeks until Day 29; Blood samples for PK were taken pre-dose (0 hour) on Days 29 and 113. Serum concentrations of abatacept were analyzed using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Steady-state trough observed concentration in serum (Cminss) was measured in micrograms/milliliter (μg/mL). Adjusted geometric mean and 90% confidence interval (CI) are presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 29 and 113</time_frame>
    <description>Serum samples for immunogenicity were evaluated for presence of anti-abatacept antibodies using a validated bridging ECL on Day 29 and Day 113. The ECL assay differentiated between 2 antibody specificities: the immunoglobulin (Ig) G and/or junction region and cytotoxic leukocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and possibly Ig. A positive immunogenicity response relative to baseline was defined as: A missing baseline immunogenicity measurement and a positive analytical laboratory reported immunogenicity response post-baseline; A negative baseline immunogenicity response and a positive analytical laboratory reported immunogenicity response post-baseline; A positive baseline immunogenicity response and a positive analytical laboratory reported immunogenicity response post-baseline that has a titer value strictly greater than the baseline titer value.</description>

        <description>Abatacept SC was self-administered with a BD Hypak™ Physiolis prefilled syringe every 7 days for the first 4 weeks of the substudy until Day 29; Blood samples for PK were taken on Days 1 and 22 at 0 hour (predose), Day 24 at 48 hour (h) post dose, Day 25 at 72 h post dose, Day 26 at 96 h post dose and Day 29 at 0 h (predose). On substudy Day 29, participants were switched from the prefilled syringe to the autoinjector. Participants continued to self-administer abatacept with the autoinjector every 7 days following Day 29 for the remaining 3 months of the substudy; Blood samples for PK were taken on Day 106 at 0 h (predose), Day 108 at 48 h post dose, Day 109 at 72 h post dose, Day 110 at 96 h post dose and at Day 113 0h (predose).

        <description>Serum samples for immunogenicity were evaluated for presence of anti-abatacept antibodies using a validated bridging ECL on Day 29 and Day 113. The ECL assay differentiated between 2 antibody specificities: the immunoglobulin (Ig) G and/or junction region and cytotoxic leukocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and possibly Ig. A positive immunogenicity response relative to baseline was defined as: A missing baseline immunogenicity measurement and a positive analytical laboratory reported immunogenicity response post-baseline; A negative baseline immunogenicity response and a positive analytical laboratory reported immunogenicity response post-baseline; A positive baseline immunogenicity response and a positive analytical laboratory reported immunogenicity response post-baseline that has a titer value strictly greater than the baseline titer value.</description>
