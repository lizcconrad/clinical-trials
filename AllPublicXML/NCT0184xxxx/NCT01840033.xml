  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is the reference treatment for anatomic or fonctionnal
      chronic intestinal failure. Nutritionnal catheter must follow two rules: low infection rate
      and be able to preserve the permeability of the central vein. Today, in europeen guidelines,
      two types of central devices are recommended: tunnelled central catheter with cuff and
      implanted ports. However, their insertion is not without risk. Since many years, we have seen
      a new generation of catheter - peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line)- which have
      many advantage over other central catheter. ESPEN guidelines accept the use of PICC line in
      short and moderate-term for HPN, but no prospective study have look for long-term used in
      HPN.

      The objective of our study is to evaluate in a prospective randomised monocenter study the
      no-inferiority of PICC line to tunnelled central catheter with cuff for serious catheter
      related-complications such as infection and thrombophlebitis for patient on HPN over 1 month
      of duration. The secondary objectives are to: evaluate the number of patients with at least
      one serious complications related in 1000 days of used, the rate of minors and majors
      complications, number of catheter inserted, the satisfaction of patients and doctors.

      The study is held in CHU Nice and will be proposed to hospitalized patients who will need
      HPN. After consent, patients will be randomized to receive PICC Line (group A) of nutritional
      central catheter with cuff (group B). Echography of vessels will be held at the beginning, 3
      months and 12 months. Follow-up will be conduct at regular interval (month 0-1-3-6-9-12). The
      duration of follow-up will be of 12 months and the global duration of the study will be 36
      months. One major complication will conduct to withdrawal of the study. There will be 55
      patients in each group.
