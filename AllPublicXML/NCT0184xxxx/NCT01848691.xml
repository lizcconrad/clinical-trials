  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have Sickle Cell Anemia (HbSS) produce red blood cells with shorter lifespans.
      These red blood cells breakdown faster, and this is called hemolysis. When red blood cells
      breakdown, a tiny amount of Carbon Monoxide (CO) is released into the blood and is eliminated
      in exhaled breath. This research study will use a device called CoSense™, which will measure
      Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels in breath. The purpose of the study is to see how well the device
      measures the CO levels that an individual breathes out.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects diagnosed with homozygous sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) have red blood cells with a
      decreased lifespan, which leads to an increase in the rate of heme turnover. Carbon monoxide
      (CO) is a by-product of heme oxidation and is excreted in exhaled breath. The concentration
      of CO in end-tidal breath can be measured and used to indicate the rate of heme oxidation,
      bilirubin production and the presence of hemolysis. The objective of this study is to
      characterize the performance of CoSense™ in children with or without sickle cell anemia. This
      is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, proof of concept study to characterize the
      ability of CoSense™ to assess ETCO levels in subjects with a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia
      (Hb SS). Up to 40 children (5-14 years old), of which 20 participants will have a diagnosis
      of Hb SS, will be enrolled. Each participant will have two breath samples collected
      non-invasively, one immediately after the other. It takes approximately 120 seconds to
      collect the each breath sample. This study and investigational device are a non-significant
      risk to the patient. The nasal cannula is made of a biocompatibility-tested polyvinyl
      chloride (PVC) material with a soft open-end, and will be gently placed adjacent to one of
      the nostrils and partially inserted by approximately 5 mm. The objective of this study will
      be assessed through reproducibility of ETCO measurements and comparison of ETCO levels
      between children diagnosed with Hb SS and healthy children. The study would help in the
      development of a portable CO measurement device which has potential health applications in
      monitoring diseases with altered bilirubin metabolism.
