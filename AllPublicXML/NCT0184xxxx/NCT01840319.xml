      The goal of this retrospective observational study is to collect only status survival data 30
      days after the last dose of treatment of patients included in the initial protocol WYETH
      3074A1-4448 / B1811030. The purpose is to estimate the survival status, 30 days after the
      last intake of tigecycline to patients hospitalized in ICU and treated by tigecycline.

    <description>Survival analysis was calculated using Kaplan-Meier Method. The survival status of participants from the initial study database were collected for survival analysis, if participants did not have the data in the database, the participating clinician requested the vital status information from the center for epidemiology and population health research (CESP). The deceased participants' data were collected and the informed consent form was sent to surviving participants. The existing and the collected survival data were then merged and updated. A survival analysis was performed including a variable treatment period plus 30 follow-up days. The maximum treatment duration observed in the initial study was 78 days. Percentage of participants who were alive at 30 days after last dose (corresponding to Day 108 after first dose of tigecycline) of tigecycline were reported.</description>
