    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of using Tysabri on changes in the
      brain using MRI and on disease progression in patients with relapsing-remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis over 5 years.

      This is a prospective, observational, single-blinded, longitudinal study of natalizumab
      effect on brain atrophy development and disability progression in multiple sclerosis patients
      over 5 years, which will evaluate originally treated patients with natalizumab who
      participated in a prospective 1- and 2-year VWMTR study. (Zivadinov et al., 2011b) All
      subjects will be assessed at 5-year follow-up with the same clinical examinations and will
      obtain 1.5T MRI examination on the same scanner that did not undergo any upgrade changes in
      the period of 5 years.
