  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In western countries, melanoma represents a major mistake of public health by its frequency,
      lethality and the increasing of incidence. Surgery can cure melanoma diagnosed very early. In
      other cases, it exists a risk of recurrence of lymph node and visceral. At the stage of
      visceral metastases, the prognosis of melanoma is catastrophic, with a median survival of 6
      months. Indeed, the reference chemotherapy by dacarbazine induces a very limited response
      rate of 10-20%, the ipilimumab which has been authorized in the second intention, has a
      response rate of 10%, and other available treatments don't have a superior efficiency.
      Metformin is an oral antidiabetic of biguanides family which acts by inducing the activation
      of AMPK, a molecule which is inactivated in many cancers including the melanoma. In agreement
      with these data, several preclinical studies suggested that metformin has antineoplastic
      activity. In the case of melanoma, a study published recently has showed that metformin
      inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro and we confirmed for our part these results
      in our laboratory (INSERM U895).

    <description>The primary evaluation criteria is the response rate (response rate, RR) defined by the ratio between the total number of patients with a complete response (complete response, CR) or partial (partial response, PR) and the total number of patients in the study. Partial or complete responses will be defined by RECIST 1.1 (15) criteria :
Complete response: disappearance of all targets lesions
Partial response: decrease of at least 30% of the sum of the biggest diameters of each target lesion All others patients, including those for who the response couldn't be measured, will be considered non-responders.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the overall survival, the survival without progress (PFS), the tolerance, and the quality of life.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 times</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined by the duration (number of days) between the start of treatment (J1) and the date of death from anything.
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined by the duration (number of days) between the start of treatment (J1) and the observation of a progression or death. Tumor progression is defined by an increase of at least 20% of the sum of the biggest diameters of each target lesion.
The duration of the response is determined by the time (in days) between the date (visit) which is recorded a response to the treatment (complete or partial) and the date (visit) which is recorded an increase or the date of death.
To evaluate the quality of life, a questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 (16), validated in French, will be completed by the patient at visits V1 (J1), V3 (M2), V5 (M4) and V7 (M6) (Annex X).</description>

    <description>The chosen posology is 2540 mg/day of metformin-base so 3 tablets/day of Glucophage ® 1000.
Patients should take 3 tablets/day at the rate of 1tablet in morning, noon and evening to favor the absorbtion and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal intolerance. In case of missed dose, patients will be allowed to take 2 tablets on the next grip. The drug will be presented in its officinale form of Glucophage ® 1000 with specifications indicated in the Vidal dictionary. It will be provided each month, to patient, 3 boxes of 30 tablets of Glucophage ® 1000. The patient will be asked to rate each day, on a calendar, the number of tablets of Glucophage ® 1000 effectively taken. It will also ask to the patient to bring back used boxes of Glucophage ® 1000 to count any tablets not taken.</description>
