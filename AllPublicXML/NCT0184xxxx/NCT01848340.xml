    <textblock>
      This will be a two-part study in healthy adults. Part A is a phase 1, non-randomized, open
      label, single-dose, single-centre mass balance study utilizing a radiolabeled dose to
      investigate the recovery, excretion, and pharmacokinetics of oral GSK1265744 in a cohort of 6
      healthy adult male subjects. Subjects will undergo a pre-study screening visit within 30 days
      of the first dose and those who successfully pass pre-study assessments and meet eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled into the study to receive the equivalent of a 30 mg dose of
      GSK1265744 as an oral solution, containing approximately 70 microcuries (mcg Ci) [0.96
      millisieverts (mSv)] of radioactivity under fasted conditions. Blood, urine and fecal samples
      will be collected for a maximum of 504 hours (21 days) following study drug administration.
      In Part B, approximately 10 healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the
      single-dose safety, tolerability and PK of supratherapeutic dose of GSK1265744 150 mg
      compared with placebo. Each subject will receive a single dose of GSK1265744 150 mg or
      placebo on Day 1 under fasting conditions in the morning. Blood, urine and fecal samples will
      be collected for 336 hours (14 days) following dosing.
