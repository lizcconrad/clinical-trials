  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to further understand these three observations - (1) that the time period
      surrounding childbirth accelerates recovery from pain after injury (2) that this likely
      reflects dampened facilitating mechanisms and exaggerated inhibitory mechanisms, and (3) that
      stress may interfere with this protection. In this study the investigators will compare women
      within 2 weeks of delivery to age matched controls and anticipate that pain inhibition is
      increased after delivery, pain facilitation is decreased, and that there is a relationship
      between these pain responses and the degree of pre-existing stress.

    <textblock>
      Nearly half of the world's population experiences labor and delivery processes which are
      associated with microscopic or gross tissue injury to the mother. Since this experience is
      widespread and occurs relatively early in life, the psychosocial, medical, and financial
      consequences of chronic pain following childbirth could be enormous. Surprisingly, previous
      studies with long term follow up of new mothers have included pain as a secondary measure and
      / or have focused on prevalence of pain without determining whether pain predated delivery or
      even pregnancy itself. The investigators recently performed a long term follow up study of
      over 1,200 women, and noted that pain which began during the childbirth itself was
      surprisingly rare in comparison to other physical injuries. Additionally, two central factors
      hypothesized to confer risk of chronic pain after other injuries including surgery,
      pre-dating chronic pain and degree of tissue and nerve injury, contributed minimally to the
      acute and sub-acute pain after childbirth. These two observations, low incidence of chronic
      pain and minimal effect of degree of tissue injury and history of chronic pain on sub-acute
      pain, point towards a potential protective effect of pregnancy or delivery on the response to
      physical injury.

    <measure>Area of hyperalgesia will be the primary outcome measure</measure>
    <time_frame>40 minutes post capsaicin application</time_frame>
    <description>Hyperalgesia and allodynia on the skin of the forearm will be established by heating the forearm with a 4 cm2 Peltier controlled thermode (TSAÂ®) to 45 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes. The investigators will then apply topical capsaicin (0.075% cream, Bioglan Pharmaceuticals) under an occlusive dressing at the same site as the thermal probe for 30 minutes. 40 minutes after removal of the capsaicin cream the site will be heated to 40 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes (rekindling) following the end of capsaicin application. The investigators will test skin sensations with the filament and cotton wisp after this heating.</description>

    <measure>Percent reduction in degree of pain to the 49 degrees Celsius stimulus during the time the foot is immersed in the cold water</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Conditioned pain modulation will be induced by placing a foot in a container of circulating water maintained at 10 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds. Thirty seconds after the foot is placed into container of circulating water, the stimulus response to heat on the contralateral forearm will be measured using a 49 degrees Celsius stimulus for 5 seconds. The foot will then be withdrawn and warmed with warm blankets. The stimulus response to heat stimuli on the arm will be measured 5 and 15 min thereafter.</description>
