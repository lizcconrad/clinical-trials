  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy(DN)is a major microvascular complication of diabetes.Renal injury may be
      presented with the characteristics of albuminuria, and its main pathological change is
      glomerular sclerosis. However, both glomerular lesions such as glomerulosclerosis, glomerular
      basement membrane thickness and tubulointerstitial fibrosis have been found in both type 1
      and type 2 diabetic patients with normal urinary albumin excretion rate, moreover the tubular
      injury may be the primary pathological change in diabetic renal injury not only the secondary
      change brought on by glomerular injury. Thus, if overt urinary albumin exists in T2DM
      patients, the tubular injury may be severe already. An index which is predominant, sensitive
      and convenient to be measured should be purposed.It is predicted that insufficient renal
      1-alpha hydroxylase may play a critical role in diabetic nephropathy. Then the investigators
      present the presumption that the activity of renal 1-alpha hydroxylase could reflect the
      degrees of tubulointerstitial injury, using serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level as an index.

      Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast to evaluate glycosylated hemoglobin
      A1c（HbA1c）, hemoglobin (Hb), serum albumin (ALB), serum creatinine (SCR), serum urea nitrogen
      (BUN), uric acid (UA), serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphate (P), serum alanine transferase
      (ALT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Urine albumin, calcium and phosphate of 24
      hour were also evaluated.
