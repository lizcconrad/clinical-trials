    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of performing prophylactic McCall
      culdoplasty at the time of total laparoscopic hysterectomy. The investigators will also be
      measuring pelvic support (using POP-Q) and sexual function before and at different time
      points (up to 12 months) postoperatively.

      The investigators hypothesize that women undergoing the McCall culdoplasty will not have
      different immediate surgical outcomes (operative time, etc) and may have better pelvic
      support and sexual function in the future.

    <description>The primary aim of the study is to generate feasibility data for performing a powered randomized trial on prophylactic modified McCall's culdoplasty during benign total laparoscopic hysterectomy. As such, we will measure operative time with the hypothesis that the intervention does not add significant additional effort. We will also collect information regarding patient willingness to participate as well as intra- and post-operative complication data.</description>

    <intervention_name>McCall culdoplasty</intervention_name>
    <description>The modified McCall Culdoplasty procedure is a relatively simple procedure that is performed after removal of the uterus and cervix from the apex of the vagina wherein the angles of the vagina are attached to their respective uterosacral ligament and the cul-de-sac is surgically obliterated for support postoperatively. This is done with a single 0-vicryl suture. There will be no additional interventions applied during the hysterectomy aside from the McCall culdoplasty.</description>
