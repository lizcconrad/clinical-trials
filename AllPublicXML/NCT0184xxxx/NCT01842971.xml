    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is evaluate the feasibility of early two-stage hepatectomy in patients
      with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, each year around 36,000 new cases of colorectal cancers are registered responsible
      in 16,000 deaths because of liver metastasis.

      In case of bilobar metastasis, classic two-stage hepatectomy with portal embolization could
      be performed.

      An alternative to the classic surgery, early two stage hepatectomy, could be proposed to
      simplify the patient's management and to improve the resectability.
