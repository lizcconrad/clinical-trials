    <description>The intervention will comprise four weekly meetings in small groups (4-6 participants) in addition to an individual follow-up home visit two to three weeks after the last senior meeting.The main purpose of the senior meetings is to give information and facilitate discussion of the ageing process and provide tools and suggest strategies to enable the clients to solve the various problems that may arise at home in order to remain living at home in a safe and secure way. The information will also include what the municipality provides in the form of local meeting places, activities run by local associations, physical training for seniors, walking groups, possibilities of offering or accepting help on a voluntary basis. Furthermore, they will be informed about help and support available in their city district. Identification of risks for, and advice on, how to prevent falls will also be included.</description>

    <intervention_name>Senior meetings</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention will be led by professionals such as a registered occupational therapist, a nurse, a physical therapist, and a social worker. The intervention will comprise four weekly meetings in small groups (4-6 participants) in addition to an individual follow-up home visit two to three weeks after the last senior meeting. To use groups involve the possibility of peer education where participants in a person-centeredness perspective are seen as experts on their own situation and learn from each other. The relationship between the personnel and the participants in the senior meetings can be described as a partnership. Respect for the participant and his/her values, and that the participant gets an opportunity to maintain and develop their own power over their own everyday activities will be essential in the meeting.</description>
