  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methadone is effective for heroin addiction, but many methadone patients continue to use
      cocaine. High magnitude and long-duration voucher-based abstinence reinforcement, in which
      participants receive vouchers exchangeable for goods and services contingent on providing
      drug-free biological samples, is one of the most effective treatments for drug addiction and
      can maintain cocaine abstinence over extended periods of time. Our research on a model
      Therapeutic Workplace has shown that employment-based abstinence reinforcement, in which
      participants must provide drug-free urine samples to access the workplace and maintain
      maximum pay, can maintain cocaine abstinence and reduce drug-related HIV risk behaviors over
      extended time periods. Our next challenge is to disseminate employment-based reinforcement
      for the treatment of drug addiction. The investigators propose to develop, manualize, and
      pilot test a community-friendly Therapeutic Workplace intervention that can be implemented
      widely throughout the US and elsewhere. Methadone patients who use injection or crack cocaine
      during methadone treatment will be invited to participate (N = 58) and randomly assigned to
      one of two groups: Usual Care (control) group or Community Therapeutic Workplace group. As in
      our prior implementations of the Therapeutic Workplace intervention, Community Therapeutic
      Workplace participants will enroll in Phase 1 to initiate drug abstinence and acquire job
      skills. Participants who initiate abstinence and acquire job skills in Phase 1 will be hired
      into community workplaces with collaborating employers in Phase 2. During Phase 2,
      employment-based abstinence reinforcement contingencies will be implemented using procedures
      for workplace drug and alcohol testing overseen by the US Department of Transportation. Using
      this system, a national provider of Drug-Free Workplace Services will arrange random drug
      testing and employment-based abstinence reinforcement contingencies in which employees will
      be required to remain drug-free to maintain employment. The investigators hypothesize that
      participants in the Community Therapeutic Workplace group will provide more drug-free
      samples, and engage in fewer HIV-risk behaviors than participants in the Usual Care group.
      The study will provide vital information on the acceptability of the intervention to
      participants and employers, and provide preliminary data on the effectiveness of the
      investigators procedures to maintain abstinence and promote employment.

    <description>Abstinence from alcohol and drugs in the standard Department of Transportation 5 (cocaine, opiates, marijuana, PCP, and amphetamines) drug panel (Y/N) at each assessment.

For risky HIV sex behaviors, the outcome measure will be always practicing safe sex in the past 30 days (Y/N), defined as abstaining from sex or 100% use of condoms during vaginal or anal sex.</description>
