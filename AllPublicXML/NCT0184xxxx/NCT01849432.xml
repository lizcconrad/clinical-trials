  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A diverse body of research has implicated the amygdalo-cortical circuitry in the
      pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. For example, one model of PTSD posits exaggerated
      amygdala responsivity to threat-related stimuli as well as deficient top-down modulation of
      amygdala responses by specific cortical regions, including the pregenual anterior cingulate
      cortex, subcallosal cortex, and hippocampus.

      The investigators propose to investigate the pathophysiology of several specific anxiety
      disorders, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Panic Disorder (PD), and Specific
      Phobia(SP), by using cognitive activation paradigms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
      probe the function and structure of implicated amygdalo-cortical circuitry.

      All candidates for this project will undergo a comprehensive clinical assessment by an
      investigator trained to administer these instruments. At the MGH fMRI Center in Charlestown
      or at the Neuroimaging Center at McLean Hospital in Belmont, MA; each subject will undergo a
      single MRI session lasting approximately 2 hours. After the scanning session, subjects may be
      asked to make judgments about the facial expressions or the words that were presented.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 - 65 years of age

          -  Right-handed (Edinburgh Inventory - Oldfield 1971)

          -  SCID diagnosis consistent with group designation:

        Current PTSD (PTSD group; none current or past (NC and TENC group); Current SP (must be to
        small animal phobia, SP group); Current PD (PD group)

          -  To be matched for age, gender, and years of education, as well as self-identified
             race/ethnicity.

          -  For female subjects, stage of menstrual cycle will be ascertained by history (see
             appendix), and dates of fMRI acquisition will be scheduled to prevent systematic
             differences between groups with respect to this variable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neurologic or medical condition that would interfere with study procedures or confound
             results, ascertained by history.

          -  History of seizure or significant head trauma (i.e., extended loss of consciousness,
             neurological sequelae, or known structural brain lesion)

          -  History of exclusionary Axis I psychiatric diagnosis (other than as specified); i.e.,
             history of substance use disorder, psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, tic disorder,
             or eating disorder. Note that comorbid current major depressive disorder will be
             allowed in up to one half of each study group. This will enable inclusion of this
             common comorbidity, but also enable a definitive assessment of whether or not the
             presence of this comorbid diagnosis is driving any observed significant between group
             differences.

          -  Use of psychotropic medication within 4 weeks prior to study (within 6 weeks for
             fluoxetine, or other long-lived compounds; within one year for neuroleptics).

          -  Pregnancy (to be ruled out by urine ÃŸ-HCG).

          -  Metallic implants or devices contraindicating magnetic resonance imaging.
