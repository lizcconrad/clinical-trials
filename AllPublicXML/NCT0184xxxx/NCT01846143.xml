    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what effects (good and bad) experimental phosphopeptide
      vaccines plus a tetanus peptide and other substances called polyICLC and Montanide ISA-51
      have on people with melanoma. The investigators will also look at whether the experimental
      reagents cause any changes in the immune system.

The vaccines will be administered in two treatment cycles. During cycle one, three vaccines will be administered over a 3-week period on days 1, 8, and 15. During cycle two, three vaccines will be administered over a 9-week period on days 36, 57, 78. Participants will be vaccinated with 100 mcg each of the phosphopeptides and 200 mcg of the tetanus peptide (Peptide-tet). The peptides will be administered subcutaneously (0.5 ml) and intradermally (0.5 ml) in Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant at six separate vaccine sites in a minimum of two separate extremities.
Poly ICLC: PolyICLC will be administered by a separate 0.5 ml injection (0.25 ml subcutaneously and 0.25 ml intradermally), immediately after, and directly into the precise site where the peptide emulsion was given. We will administer 1 mg per vaccine.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histologically or cytologically proven high-risk or advanced solid malignancies including
        melanoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or non small-cell lung cancer
        (NSCLC) that meets one of the following criteria:

        Melanoma:

        For Arms A and B: Stage IIIB-IV melanoma rendered clinically free of disease by surgery,
        other therapy, or spontaneous remission For Arm C: Stage IIA-IV melanoma rendered
        clinically free of disease by surgery, other therapy, or spontaneous remission For all
        Arms: Stage III or IV melanoma with disease, for patients who have failed other approved
        therapies, are not candidates for approved therapies, or refuse other approved therapies.

        Staging will be based on the 7th edition AJCC staging system for melanoma and other
        cancers. Staging of mucosal melanomas will be based on the following system modified from
        the cutaneous melanoma staging system: IIA: 2.01- 4mm primary, or stage IIB: &gt; 4mm primary,
        lymph node metastases = stage III, distant metastases = stage IV.

        Breast cancer:

        Metastatic stage IV or unresectable breast cancer on endocrine therapy or on no other
        systemic therapy who have had at least one prior therapy for their metastatic disease.
        Patients who are metastatic, but with no measurable disease are eligible. Participation in
        this study should not preclude the delivery of any approved and appropriate anti-cancer
        therapies, but they are not to be delivered concurrent with this trial, except that
        patients may participate while taking endocrine-only therapy (eg: aromatase inhibitors or
        tamoxifen or Lupron). Patients may also participate during pre-planned chemotherapy
        holidays.

        Patients after resection for stage IIIA to IV breast cancer (any ER, PR, or Her2 status)
        after surgery, radiation therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or HER2 targeted therapy.

        For Arm C only: Stage I-II, high risk patients with either triple negative breast cancer or
        HER2 positive disease are also eligible if the tumor is larger than 1 cm. Vaccine will be
        offered after surgery, radiation therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy (if indicated)

        Colorectal cancer:

        Metastatic (advanced) colorectal cancer that has failed at least 2 prior chemotherapy
        regimens, including 5-FU, ironotecan, and oxaliplatin.

        High-risk resected metastatic colorectal cancer after resection of liver metastases and
        after approved agents are administered. For patients after surgical resection of liver
        metastases,

        Eligibility to Arms A and B will be limited to those with at least 3 of the following risk
        factors: node-positive primary, disease-free interval less than 1 year, more than 1 liver
        metastasis, size of largest liver metastasis greater than 5 cm, and serum CEA greater than
        200 ng/ml.

        Eligibility to Arm C will be limited to those with at least 1 of the 5 risk factors listed
        above.

        Ovarian cancer:

        Ovarian or fallopian tube cancer that is recurrent or treatment refractory with no
        remaining alternative, approved therapy options with a reasonable possibility of clinical
        response.

        Non small-cell lung cancer:

        Patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer who have stable disease or clinical
        response (CR/PR) after treatment with chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy.

        Patients may have had prior therapy for this cancer in the adjuvant setting and may have
        had 1-4 prior systemic therapies for advanced cancer.

        Patients may have had multiple primary melanomas.

        Patients with less than or equal to 5 brain metastases may be eligible as long as the
        following 3 criteria are true:

          1. The brain metastases have been completely removed by surgery or have been treated
             completely by stereotactic radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiotherapy, such as gamma
             knife, can be used up to 1 week prior to study entry.

          2. There has been no evident growth of any brain metastasis since treatment.

          3. No metastasis greater than 2 cm at the time of protocol entry

        Patients with greater than 5 brain metastases may be eligible if the above 3 criteria are
        met and if at least one year has elapsed since the last treatment.

        All participants must have:

        ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix 3) Ability and willingness to give informed
        consent

        Patients must have at least one intact axillary and/or inguinal lymph node basin. A patient
        with a prior lymph node biopsy may be a candidate if lymphoscintigraphy demonstrates intact
        drainage to a node in that basin. A lymphoscintigram may be performed during screening to
        ensure that there is drainage to a regional node from a planned vaccine site. If the
        lymphoscintigram is performed and a sentinel lymph node is not located, the patient will be
        ineligible for this study if no other vaccine sites are available.

        Laboratory parameters as follows: The following laboratory parameters will be required for
        all participants. If a lab value appears to be an error or a result of a transient or
        treatable condition, the investigator will use his/her clinical judgment to decide if the
        test may be repeated. The requirements for inclusion are as follows:

          -  HLA-A2+

          -  ANC &gt; 1000/mm3

          -  Total lymphocyte count &gt; 500/mm3. If this value is low on initial test after prior
             cytotoxic therapy, the test may be repeated as the patient recovers further from that
             therapy.

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3

          -  Hgb ≥ 9 g/dL

          -  HGBA1C &lt; 7%

          -  Hepatic:

        AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN) Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase
        ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          -  Renal Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  Serology (within 6 months of study entry) HIV negative Hepatitis C negative

          -  LDH up to 2 x ULN

        Participants must be 18 years or older at study entry.

        Patients who have recurred or progressed either after or during administration of a cancer
        vaccine may be eligible to enroll 12 weeks following their last vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients who have had brain metastases unless they meet the criteria outlined in the
        inclusion criteria section of the protocol.

        Patients who are currently receiving systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, or other
        experimental therapy, or who have received this therapy within the preceding 4 weeks. Gamma
        knife or stereotactic radiosurgery may be administered within the prior 4 weeks, but must
        not be administered less than one week prior to study enrollment. Patients who are
        currently receiving nitrosoureas or who have received this therapy within the preceding 6
        weeks.

        Patients will not be eligible if there is clinically detectable malignancy deemed likely by
        the investigator to require intervention during the first 12 weeks of the study that would
        require premature discontinuation. Examples for such circumstances may include untreated
        bone metastases at risk for fracture, and rapidly progressive low volume disease.

        Patients with known or suspected allergies to any component of the vaccine.

        Patients receiving the following medications at study entry or within the preceding 4 weeks
        are excluded:

          1. Agents with putative immunomodulating activity (with the exception of non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory agents and topical steroids (see section 4.2.5(3)).

          2. Allergy desensitization injections.

          3. Systemic corticosteroids, administered parenterally or orally inhaled steroids (e.g.
             Advair®, Flovent®, Azmacort®) are not permitted. Topical corticosteroids are
             acceptable, including steroids with very low solubility administered nasally for local
             effects only (e.g. Nasonex®).

        phosphopeptides included in this protocol.

        Pregnancy or the possibility of becoming pregnant during vaccine administration. Female
        patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urinary or serum
        beta-HCG) prior to administration of the first vaccine dose. Males and females must agree,
        in the consent form, to use effective birth control methods during the course of
        vaccination. The methods are specified in the consent form and include the following:
        Norplant, IUD, Dep-Provera, Birth Control Pills, Birth Control Patch, and Sterilization.
        The following may be used if combined with other birth control methods: Condoms, Jellies or
        foam, Diaphragm, Rhythm, Withdrawal, Sponge, or Cervical cap.

        Women must also not be breast feeding.

        Patients in whom there is a medical contraindication or potential problem in complying with
        the requirements of the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.

        Patients classified according to the New York Heart Association classification as having
        Class III or IV heart disease (Appendix 4).

        Patients with a body weight &lt; 110 lbs because of the amount and frequency with which blood
        will be drawn

        Participants must not have known inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract
        (oropharynx, esophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, rectum, or anus) or the respiratory
        tract (airway and lungs) of autoimmune, infectious, or other cause. Examples may include
        but are not limited to, gastritis, C. difficile colitis, radiation proctitis, bronchitis.
        Patients may have had such conditions in the past if they have recovered completely at
        least 3 months prior, and are not expected to have relapses of the condition.

        Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or
        immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement. Participants
        with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also excluded. The
        following will not be exclusionary:

        The presence of laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease (e.g. positive ANA titer) without
        associated symptoms Clinical evidence of vitiligo Other forms of depigmenting illness Mild
        arthritis requiring NSAID medications or no medical therapy Non small-cell lung cancers
        expressing EGFR or ALK mutations, or with neuroendocrine features.
