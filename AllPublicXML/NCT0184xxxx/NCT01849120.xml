  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonates and infants that have cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for
      congenital heart disease are at great risk for experiencing life-threatening low cardiac
      output syndrome (LCOS) in the first 24 hours after surgery. The poor perfusion and inadequate
      oxygen delivery that occurs may result in multiple organ failure and death. It is LCOS that
      is responsible for the majority of early postoperative deaths in this population of neonates
      and infants. Improved pediatric probes placed in peripheral locations using near infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) may permit continuous monitoring of venous saturations reflecting overall
      perfusion and oxygen balance in the tissues. Following parental or guardian consent, 30
      neonates and infants scheduled to undergo surgery for congenital heart disease will be
      enrolled. At the end of surgery, four EQUANOX Advance 8004CB probes will be placed on the
      flank, lower extremities and the forehead. Continuous NIRS saturations will be monitored and
      stored for analysis. Point of care (POC) lactates will be obtained after admission to the
      intensive care unit (ICU) every 2 hours for the first 24 hours postoperatively, then once at
      48 hours. The association between NIRS oxygen saturation and POC lactate values will be
      assessed using mixed linear models taking into account the repeated measures design.
      Exploratory analyses will be performed to assess whether NIRS oxygen saturation is associated
      with outcomes such as days in ICU, adverse events and mortality.

      The ability to use noninvasive, continuous monitoring for overall perfusion and cardiac
      output will allow better and earlier therapy for neonates and infants following cardiac
      surgery.
