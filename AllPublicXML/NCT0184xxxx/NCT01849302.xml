  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decades, changes in the diet and lifestyle have led to overall energy imbalance
      becoming commonplace and the emergence of an obesity epidemic with more than 1.6 billion
      adults being overweight.

      Consumption of foods that can affect appetite by increasing satiety could regulate the total
      energy intake and thus body weight. There is data suggesting that the macronutrient
      composition of the foods and especially protein content may have a potent role on satiety.
      However, it is difficult to pinpoint the optimum quantity needed to observe significant
      effects of protein on satiety.

      The research project is dedicated to identify which food components [proteins, carbohydrates
      (CHO), fats] and the optimized protein quantity needed to accelerate satiation, suppress
      appetite and extend satiety until hunger appears again.

      It is hypothesized that the consumption of protein-enriched meals will induce a reduction in
      hunger through the impact on gut hormones and peptides that are closely related to the
      short-term regulation of food intake.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in perceived appetite and satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 30 min for 270 min after each of the seven beverages which are served at least one week apart (7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The appetite profile is assessed using validated Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) ratings (i.e hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective food consumption). The Questionnaires are performed electronically in personal laptops using the Adaptive Visual Analogue Scales (AVAS) software.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ad libitum energy intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Energy intake is assessed 210 min after the 7 test beverages, which are served one week apart.</time_frame>
    <description>Energy intake is assessed by ad libitum hot pasta meal provided 210 min after the test beverages, which are given as breakfast. Subjects are instructed to eat only until they feel comfortable satisfied and are given 25min to consume the meal. The total energy consumed is monitored</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in the postprandial concentration of satiety hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 6 points in time over the morning of each of the 7 test days, which are separated by 1 week (7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples (2 ml) are collected at 0 min (fasted blood sample), 30, 60, 90, 150 and 205 min (i.e. total of 6 samples) over the morning on each test day (separated by 1 week) to quantify the plasma concentrations of circulating appetite regulating hormones. Protease inhibitors are added to the samples to reduce protein degradation. All samples are centrifuged at 4 C for 10 min at 2000 g after collection and are separated and stored in cryogenic vials at -80 C.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hedonic ratings and palatability of the test beverages and meals</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed immediately after consumption of the 7 test beverages and pasta meal (7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The palatability and hedonic ratings are assessed using validated Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) ratings (i.e appearance, taste, overall palatability). The Questionnaires are performed electronically in personal laptops using the Adaptive Visual Analogue Scales (AVAS) software.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in the postprandial concentration of glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 7 points in time over the morning of each of the 7 test days, which are separated by 1 week (7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Capillary blood samples are collected by finger-prick at 0 min (fasted blood sample), 30, 45, 60, 90, 150 and 205 min (i.e. total of 7 samples) over the morning on each test day (separated by 1 week) to quantify the glucose concentration using HemoCue Glucose System.</description>
