    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different ways of helping first-time hearing-aid
      users get the most out of their hearing aids and determine if one method is better than the
      other. One method provides the patient with routine information regarding the care and use of
      hearing aids the other method uses tools to address patient-specific barriers against and
      motivators for hearing-aid use.

    <measure>Difference in Hours of Hearing Aid Use Between Pre-intervention and Post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected pre-intervention and again at post-intervention appointment occurring between four and six weeks after the intervention date</time_frame>
    <description>Hearing aid use was measured by the number of hours of use recorded in the hearing-aid software. This was measured on up to four occasions: Visit #1 to #3 (pre-intervention), and Visit #4 (post-intervention). Average daily hours of hearing aid use was documented at each time point, so that the Visit #4 observation is a measure of the average daily use between the start of intervention (Visit #3) and visit #4. Data logger results were averaged between the left and right hearing aids at each time point and across all three pre-intervention time points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference Between Pre-intervention and Post-intervention Total Score on International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected twice once at pre-intervention visit and once at a post-intervention visit occurring four to six weeks following the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The total score from the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA; Cox et al., 2000) was used to assess overall hearing-aid outcome. This measure consists of seven items assessing (1) daily hearing-aid use, (2) benefit, (3) residual activity limitation, (4) satisfaction, (5) residual participation restriction, (6) impact (of hearing impairment) on others, and (7) quality of Life. Responses to each question range from 1 (poorest) to 5 (best), for a total score range from 7 points to 35 points. The reported measurement was the change in total score from pre-intervention to post-intervention, with a maximum possible change of 28 points.</description>

             Service (ASPS) with two hearing aids which have datalogging capabilities

          -  be independent in their completion of activities in daily living, as determined by

          <title>Difference in Hours of Hearing Aid Use Between Pre-intervention and Post-intervention</title>
          <description>Hearing aid use was measured by the number of hours of use recorded in the hearing-aid software. This was measured on up to four occasions: Visit #1 to #3 (pre-intervention), and Visit #4 (post-intervention). Average daily hours of hearing aid use was documented at each time point, so that the Visit #4 observation is a measure of the average daily use between the start of intervention (Visit #3) and visit #4. Data logger results were averaged between the left and right hearing aids at each time point and across all three pre-intervention time points.</description>
          <population>Standard-of-care group: one subject withdrew prior to the collection of outcome measures and one subject did not give valid data log measurement. These subjects are not included.
Treatment: Three subjects did not give valid outcome data log measurement and one did not give a valid baseline measure. These subjects are not included.</population>

        <title>Difference Between Pre-intervention and Post-intervention Total Score on International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids</title>
        <description>The total score from the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA; Cox et al., 2000) was used to assess overall hearing-aid outcome. This measure consists of seven items assessing (1) daily hearing-aid use, (2) benefit, (3) residual activity limitation, (4) satisfaction, (5) residual participation restriction, (6) impact (of hearing impairment) on others, and (7) quality of Life. Responses to each question range from 1 (poorest) to 5 (best), for a total score range from 7 points to 35 points. The reported measurement was the change in total score from pre-intervention to post-intervention, with a maximum possible change of 28 points.</description>
        <time_frame>Collected twice once at pre-intervention visit and once at a post-intervention visit occurring four to six weeks following the intervention</time_frame>
        <population>In the standard-of-care group, one subject withdrew from the study prior to the collection of outcome measures. In the treatment group, one subject did not answer one of the questions on the baseline questionnaire, thereby preventing calculation of a total score. This subject's data is therefore not included in the analysis.</population>
