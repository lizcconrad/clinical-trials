  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the overall survival in patients with previously
      untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus OGX-427 or
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus placebo.

    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreatic cancer usually present with inoperable disease and systemic therapy
      becomes the primary form of treatment. The combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel
      represents an appropriate front-line standard of care for patients with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. However, poor outcomes with this disease warrant exploration of novel drugs with
      unique mechanisms of action. Preclinical evidence suggests that OGX-427 has shown promising
      activity in pancreatic cancer. In this trial, we will compare the overall survival of
      patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer using OGX-427 with either
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or a placebo with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.

    <description>The time (in months) that patients are progression-free, assessed from date of randomization to date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. Progression is defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum while on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study), or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>

    <description>Objective response rate defined as the percent of patients having a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR=complete disappearance of all target lesions. PR=decrease in baseline of 30% or more of the diameter(s) of all target lesions.</description>
