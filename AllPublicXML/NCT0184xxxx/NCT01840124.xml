  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ULTRA study is a single-arm trial of 100 premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine
      fibroids who undergo treatment with the Acessa device. The Acessa device is a new FDA
      approved minimally invasive treatment for uterine fibroids that uses radiofrequency energy to
      destroy fibroid tissue. The fibroids then shrink and symptoms are significantly improved. The
      radiofrequency energy is delivered to the fibroids during an outpatient surgical procedure.
      There is minimal blood loss and pain and women return to the usual activities 5-9 days after
      the Acessa procedure.

      The investigators will evaluate changes in fibroid-related symptoms from before the Acessa
      treatment to 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after Acessa treatment. The investigators
      will also assess operative outcomes including procedure duration, complications, blood loss,
      post-operative pain, and the time to return to usual activities. The investigators will
      determine long-term efficacy of Acessa by evaluating the rate of re-treatment for symptomatic
      fibroids after the Acessa procedure.

      Study participants will be recruited at 5 sites within the UC Fibroid Network: UC Davis, UC
      Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, and UC San Francisco. UC San Francisco will serve as
      the Coordinating Center for the trial with oversight of all scientific and administrative
      aspects of the study. All study data will be stored securely in a HIPAA compliant, secure
      database monitored by the UC San Francisco Coordinating Center. A data safety and monitoring
      board will oversee participant safety and protection.

    <intervention_name>Radiofrequency ablation of fibroids</intervention_name>
    <description>The Acessa device delivers radiofrequency energy to uterine fibroids to destroy fibroid tissue. The patient undergoes a standard laparoscopy of the pelvis. A laparoscopic ultrasound is performed to identify the precise size and location of the fibroids. The Acessa radiofrequency probe is then placed into the fibroid and the radiofrequency energy is delivered. The fibroid tissue is destroyed and the fibroid shrinks down in size to decrease fibroid-related symptoms.</description>
