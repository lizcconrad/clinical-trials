    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) of Treatment and Placebo at 4 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>SPID was calculated as the weighted sum of Pain (Headache) intensity differences at 4 hours post dose. The time-intervals used were 0-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-90, 90-120, 120-180, 180-240 minutes. The range of SPID at 4 hours post dose was from -12 to 4&quot;. PID was calculated as difference of pain intensity (PI) at baseline (prior to the first dose) with PI at a given time point. PI was assessed on a 4-point scale (0-no headache, 1-mild headache, 2-moderate headache, 3-severe headache).</description>

    <description>SPID was calculated as the weighted sum of Pain (Headache) intensity differences at 1, 2 and 3 hours post dose.
The time-intervals used were 0-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60 minutes for SPID at 1 hour post dose. The range of SPID at 1 hour post dose was from -3 to 1. The time-intervals used were 0-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-90, 90-120 minutes for SPID at 2 hours post dose . The range of SPID at 2 hours post dose was from -6 to 2. The time-intervals used were 0-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-90, 90-120, 120-180 minutes for SPID at 3 hours post dose. The range of SPID at 3 hours post dose was from -9 to 3. PID was calculated as difference of pain intensity (PI) at baseline (prior to the first dose) with PI at a given time point. PI was assessed on a 4-point scale (0-no headache, 1-mild headache, 2-moderate headache, 3-severe headache).</description>

    <time_frame>From (Baseline) 0 to 1, from 0 to 2, from 0 to 3 and from 0 to 4 hour post dose</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR was calculated as the weighted sum of pain relief scores (PRS) at each time point. PRS was assessed on a 5-point scale (0-no relief, 1-a little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, and 4-complete relief). The range for TOTPAR for different time points were as follows: from 0 to 4 for TOTPAR at 1 hour post dose, from 0 to 8 for TOTPAR at 2 hours post dose, from 0 to 12 for TOTPAR at 3 hours post dose, and from 0 to 16 for TOTPAR at 4 hours post dose.</description>

    <time_frame>From (Baseline) 0 to 1 hour, 0 to 2 hours, 0 to 3 hours and 0 to 4 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID was measured as sum of TOTPAR and SPID. SPID and TOTPAR were calculated as weighted sums of PID and PRS at each measurement time point, respectively. PID at each time point was calculated as difference of PI at baseline (prior to the first dose) with PI at a given time point. PI was assessed on a 4-point scale (0-no headache, 1-mild headache, 2-moderate headache, 3-severe headache). PRS was assessed on a 5-point scale (0-no relief, 1-a little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, and 4-complete relief). The range of SPRID for different time points were as follow: from-3 to 5 for SPRID at 1 hour post dose, from -6 to 10 for SPRID at 2 hours post dose, from -9 to 15 for SPRID at 3 hours post dose, and from -12 to 20 for SPRID at 4 hours post dose.</description>

    <description>The participant assessed headache relief of each treated qualifying headache at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes post treatment on a 5-point scale (0-no relief, 1-a little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, and 4-complete relief). higher headache relief score indicates better outcome.</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) of Treatment and Placebo at 4 Hours</title>
        <description>SPID was calculated as the weighted sum of Pain (Headache) intensity differences at 4 hours post dose. The time-intervals used were 0-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-90, 90-120, 120-180, 180-240 minutes. The range of SPID at 4 hours post dose was from -12 to 4&quot;. PID was calculated as difference of pain intensity (PI) at baseline (prior to the first dose) with PI at a given time point. PI was assessed on a 4-point scale (0-no headache, 1-mild headache, 2-moderate headache, 3-severe headache).</description>

        <title>Area Under the Time-Response Curve for Change in Headache Intensity and Headache Relief (SPRID)</title>
        <description>SPRID was measured as sum of TOTPAR and SPID. SPID and TOTPAR were calculated as weighted sums of PID and PRS at each measurement time point, respectively. PID at each time point was calculated as difference of PI at baseline (prior to the first dose) with PI at a given time point. PI was assessed on a 4-point scale (0-no headache, 1-mild headache, 2-moderate headache, 3-severe headache). PRS was assessed on a 5-point scale (0-no relief, 1-a little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, and 4-complete relief). The range of SPRID for different time points were as follow: from-3 to 5 for SPRID at 1 hour post dose, from -6 to 10 for SPRID at 2 hours post dose, from -9 to 15 for SPRID at 3 hours post dose, and from -12 to 20 for SPRID at 4 hours post dose.</description>

          <title>Area Under the Time-Response Curve for Change in Headache Intensity and Headache Relief (SPRID)</title>
          <description>SPRID was measured as sum of TOTPAR and SPID. SPID and TOTPAR were calculated as weighted sums of PID and PRS at each measurement time point, respectively. PID at each time point was calculated as difference of PI at baseline (prior to the first dose) with PI at a given time point. PI was assessed on a 4-point scale (0-no headache, 1-mild headache, 2-moderate headache, 3-severe headache). PRS was assessed on a 5-point scale (0-no relief, 1-a little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, and 4-complete relief). The range of SPRID for different time points were as follow: from-3 to 5 for SPRID at 1 hour post dose, from -6 to 10 for SPRID at 2 hours post dose, from -9 to 15 for SPRID at 3 hours post dose, and from -12 to 20 for SPRID at 4 hours post dose.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing.

    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Enrollment into the trial was terminated after randomization of 62% of the plan resulting in a significant reduction in study power. The originally planned inferential statistics (p-values) were therefore not presented in tables summarizing results.</limitations_and_caveats>
