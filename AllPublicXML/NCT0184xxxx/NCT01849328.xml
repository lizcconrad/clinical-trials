    <textblock>
      Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in human breath are captured and analyzed by the
      Spectrosense EVA system, which is combination of a gas chromatography (GC) and software
      algorithm. The objective is to obtain a set or sets of VOC bio-markers that will provide the
      best discrimination between Breast Cancer sick population and healthy population. The gold
      standard for identifying sick/healthy population is biopsy proven breast cancer.
