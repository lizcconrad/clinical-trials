  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopause is associated with weight gain, but the reasons why are not clear. In this study,
      the investigators will determine if reducing estrogen levels causes a decrease in the ability
      of the body to produce heat. If so, this would suggest this is one way that menopause may
      cause weight gain.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the female sex hormone estrogen, on
      metabolism, thermoregulation and energy expenditure. Weight and fat gain increase after the
      menopause, but reasons for this are not clear. Loss of estrogen may cause changes in how
      women regulate metabolism and thermoregulation, possibly leading to weight gain.
      Specifically, this study will determine how loss of estrogen affects facultative
      thermogenesis. Loosely defined, facultative thermogenesis represents heat production that is
      turned on when needed. For example, when body core temperature falls below a certain
      threshold, a shivering response is invoked in skeletal muscle to increase heat production
      and, thus, energy expenditure. However, exposure over several hours to mild cold temperatures
      that do not trigger shivering (16-20‚Å∞ C) also induces an increase in energy expenditure
      (cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis). Although several different tissues may contribute
      to this response, the recent identification of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in
      humans has promoted an interest in how BAT is activated in humans and its potential role in
      regulating energy balance and body weight. The investigators will measure BAT activity using
      PET/CT scans pre and post three months of estrogen suppression.
