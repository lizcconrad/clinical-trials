  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCB)
      that leads to progressive accumulation of glucocerebroside within macrophages and subsequent
      tissue and organ damage; typically of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and brain. Type 1
      Gaucher disease affects an estimated 30,000 persons worldwide and is the most common. Type 1
      Gaucher disease does not involve the central nervous system. Patients with Type 2 Gaucher
      disease present with acute neurological deterioration, which leads to early death. Those with
      Type 3 disease typically display a more sub-acute neurological course, with later onset and
      slower progression.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of every other week
      (EOW) dosing of velaglucerase alfa in Japanese patients with Gaucher disease who completed
      study HGT-GCB-087 and elected to continue treatment with velaglucerase alfa.

      Velaglucerase alfa has been developed and approved as an enzyme replacement therapy for Type
      1 Gaucher disease.

      Gaucher disease is an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCB)
      that leads to progressive accumulation of glucocerebroside within macrophages and subsequent
      tissue and organ damage; typically of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and brain.

      Gaucher disease has been designated in the list of Specified Rare and Intractable Diseases by
      Specified Disease Treatment Research Program of Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW)
      as one of &quot;lysosomal storage diseases&quot; since 2001. Gaucher disease is also designated in the
      Medical Aid Program for Specified Categories of Chronic Pediatric Diseases.

      The prevalence of mutations and the phenotype of patients with Gaucher disease in Japan
      differs from that in non-Japanese populations. Some patients with type 1 Gaucher disease in
      Japan have more severe and progressive disease compared to non-Japanese patients and the
      disease is characterized by an earlier onset of symptoms.

      Velaglucerase alfa, a highly-purified form of the naturally occurring enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase, has been developed as an enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease
      for the symptoms (anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and bone
      manifestation).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of every other week
      (EOW) dosing of velaglucerase alfa in Japanese patients with Gaucher disease who completed
      study HGT-GCB-087 and elected to continue treatment with velaglucerase alfa.

    <description>An AE was any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in any phase of a clinical study, whether or not considered related to investigational product. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. An infusion-related AE was defined as an AE that started either during or within 12 hours after the start of the infusion and that was judged as possibly or probably related to investigational product.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Week 103: Z Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 103</time_frame>
    <description>BMD was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for lumbar spine and femurs. To ensure standardization and allow for comparisons of BMD, results were converted to standardized Z-scores (matched for age and gender). Z-scores express the BMD as the number of standard deviations (SDs) above or below the average BMD of a healthy participant of the same age and gender. Statistical analysis plan only required summarization if greater than (&gt;) 50 percent (%) of participants had evaluable data. Week 51 of Study HGT-GCB-087 (NCT01614574) was considered as baseline for this endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Week 103: T-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 103</time_frame>
    <description>BMD was measured by DXA for lumbar spine and femurs. To ensure standardization and allow for comparisons of BMD, results were converted to standardized T-scores; normal values were used from databases from Hologic based on standard criteria. T-scores are the number of SDs above or below the average for a young adult at peak BMD. Statistical analysis plan only required summarization if &gt;50% of participants had evaluable data. Week 51 of Study HGT-GCB-087 (NCT01614574) was considered as baseline for this endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bone Marrow Burden (BMB) Score at Week 103</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 103</time_frame>
    <description>BMB Score was measured using MRI, range from 0 (no abnormalities) to 8 points (severe disease) for the lumbar spine and from 0 (no abnormalities) to 8 points (severe disease) for the femurs. The total score was calculated as the sum of scores for femur and lumbar spine regions which ranged from 0-16 points. A higher BMB score signified more severe bone marrow involvement. Week 51 of Study HGT-GCB-087 (NCT01614574) was considered as baseline for this endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Growth Velocity at Week 101 : Height Z-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 101</time_frame>
    <description>The Z-score, or Standard Deviation Score, is a measure of number of SDs above or below the average BMD of a healthy participant of the same age and gender. World Health Organization 2007 growth reference data were used for Z-score calculation. Statistical analysis plan only required summarization if &gt;50% of participants had evaluable data. Week 51 of Study HGT-GCB-087 (NCT01614574) was considered as baseline for this endpoint.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 103</time_frame>
    <description>Skeletal age was measured via radiography (X-ray) of the left hand and wrist by the method of Greulich and Pyle. The Z-score, or Standard Deviation Score, is a measure of number of SDs above or below the average BMD of a healthy participant of the same age and gender. Statistical analysis plan only required summarization if &gt;50% of participants had evaluable data. Week 51 of Study HGT-GCB-087 (NCT01614574) was considered as baseline for this endpoint.</description>

        <description>An AE was any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in any phase of a clinical study, whether or not considered related to investigational product. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. An infusion-related AE was defined as an AE that started either during or within 12 hours after the start of the infusion and that was judged as possibly or probably related to investigational product.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Week 103: Z Score</title>
        <description>BMD was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for lumbar spine and femurs. To ensure standardization and allow for comparisons of BMD, results were converted to standardized Z-scores (matched for age and gender). Z-scores express the BMD as the number of standard deviations (SDs) above or below the average BMD of a healthy participant of the same age and gender. Statistical analysis plan only required summarization if greater than (&gt;) 50 percent (%) of participants had evaluable data. Week 51 of Study HGT-GCB-087 (NCT01614574) was considered as baseline for this endpoint.</description>
