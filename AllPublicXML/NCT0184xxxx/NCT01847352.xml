  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On exposure to hypoxia (low oxygen) the normal response is for pulmonary arterial systolic
      blood pressure (PASP, blood pressure through the lungs) to increase. We have previously shown
      that raising iron by giving an infusion of iron into a vein reduces this pressure rise and
      that lowering iron by giving a drug that binds iron, magnifies this response. This is
      potentially a clinically important observation since iron-deficient people may be at
      increased risk of pulmonary hypertension if exposed transiently or permanently to hypoxia due
      to lung disease or residence at high altitude; furthermore if this were true then intravenous
      iron could be an important treatment in this patient group in the event of hypoxic exposure.
      The observed effects of iron on PASP are likely to be because iron levels affect oxygen
      sensing. Low iron levels make the body behave as if exposed to low oxygen by inhibiting the
      breakdown of the family of oxygen-sensing transcription factors, 'hypoxia inducible factor'
      or HIF. This includes one of the body's normal responses to low oxygen levels - raising blood
      pressure through the lungs.

      This study will answer the question (1) do iron-deficient volunteers have a greater rise in
      PASP with hypoxia than those who are iron-replete, and (2) does giving intravenous iron cause
      a greater reduction in the rise in PASP in those who are iron-deficient than iron-replete?
      The purpose of this study is not to test the safety or clinical efficacy of iron which is
      already known.
