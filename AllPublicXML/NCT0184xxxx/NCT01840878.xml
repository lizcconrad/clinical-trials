  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy of actigraph measured sleep compared
      to the golden standard (polysomnography) during Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Our
      hypothesis is the actigraph is accurate for sleep-monitoring for this group of patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The actigraph has been proven to measured sleep data with an accuracy about 80% (compared
      with Polysomnography) in patients who have undergone surgery.

      But this accuracy has not been validated in relation to none surgical inflammatory diseases.
      This study will investigate the accuracy of actigraph measured sleep in diverticulitis
      patients.

      Following methods will be applied

      Device: Wrist-Actigraph - Octagonal Basic Motionlogger, Ambulatory monitoring Inc, New York,
      USA

      Other: Sleep-diary

      Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA)
