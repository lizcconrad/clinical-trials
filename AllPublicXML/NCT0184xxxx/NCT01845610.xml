  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complementary food supplements (CFS), fortified products that are mixed with the infant's
      usual complementary foods, have the potential to improve nutrition among infants. In Africa,
      maize is a major staple food used for complementary feeding. Compared to rice or wheat, maize
      has higher levels of phytates, which bind trace elements such as iron and zinc, and inhibit
      their absorption. The impact of CFS products in the context of a maize-based diet has not
      been well investigated. This study will test two newly developed fat-based CFS products made
      from soy.

      The first product is a fortified fat-based spread that contains essential fatty acids with
      added docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA), and phytase to improve iron and
      zinc bioavailability. The second product is a fortified fat-based product containing
      essential fatty acids. Both products contain soy. The enrichment of the products with
      essential fatty acids is of particular interest in the South African context, as consumers
      are exposed to higher linoleic acid (LA) diets due to the inclusion of mostly high
      LA-containing sunflower oil during food preparation. The CFS products could contribute
      towards restoring the balance between LA and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) intake.

      The results of this study will provide evidence on whether or not two types of fortified CFS
      have the potential to address malnutrition (linear growth) and improve psychomotor
      development in infants. If proven effective, this approach of providing multiple nutrients
      can be made available to infants in the developing world and may lead to sustainable actions.
