  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study the feasibility and reliability of pocket-size diagnostic
      ultrasound examinations performed by nurses of postoperative patients who have underwent
      cardiothoracic surgery in a cardiac unit.

      Patient inclusion: Post-operative cardiothoracic surgery patients transferred to a cardiac
      unit. All such patients are eligible for inclusion if they consent to participate in the
      study. No other exclusion criteria other than not willing/able to give their consent. Only
      postoperative patients will be included.

      Study population: Approximately 50 patients

      Intervention: All participants will undergo careful medical history, physical examination and
      blood tests led by residents. All patients will routinely be examined with ultrasound by
      nurses trained in ultrasound examinations of the pleural space and the pericardium and a
      complete high-end echocardiography including assessment of both pleural cavities and the
      pericardial space will be performed in all by cardiologists.

      Statistics and results: Feasibility and reliability will be studied.
