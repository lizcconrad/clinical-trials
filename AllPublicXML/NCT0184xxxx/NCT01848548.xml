  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Awake tracheal intubation is the standard management for patients as risk for airway
      compromise. It is also commonly done in cases where there is significant cervical spine
      pathology i.e. cervical myelopathy or instability. The anesthetic technique used for the
      awake intubation is crucial to the patient's safety. One of the most important aspects of the
      anesthetic technique is airway anesthesia prior to placement of an endotracheal tube. The
      superior laryngeal nerve is responsible for mediating the cough reflex around the vocal
      cords. The investigators have developed an approach to reliably block the superior laryngeal
      nerve by injecting local anesthetic near the nerve in a unique approach. Injecting local
      anesthetic into or through the thyrohyoid membrane will effectively block the superior
      laryngeal nerve
