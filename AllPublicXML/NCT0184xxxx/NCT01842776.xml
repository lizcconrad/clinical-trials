      The goal of this pilot is to reduce the 30-day hospital readmission rate for dialysis
      patients. It is a quality improvement project that consistent of 4 &quot;tracks.&quot; Tracks 1 &amp; 2:
      Implement use of checklists of activities for staff to complete when patients are admitted to
      the hospital, and post-hospitalization with emphasis on fluid assessment, nutrition
      management, patient coaching, and communication between institutions. Track 3: Work with
      physicians to develop process to individualize post-hospitalization dialysis orders and
      improve medication reconciliation. Track 4: Use a renal Care Transitions Case Manager to
      follow patients in the hospital and 30 days post-hospitalization to facilitate care and
      patient coaching.
