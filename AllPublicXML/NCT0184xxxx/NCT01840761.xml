    <textblock>
      Delayed vasospasm (DCVS) is the most serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (aSAH) perioperative period ,the incidence rate up to 30% to 90%, and often can
      cause severe brain ischemia or brain damage of delayed ischemic and even lead to cerebral
      infarction, to be the main factor of deadly and severe disability . (aSAH) perioperative
      delayed vasospasm (CVS) is the bottleneck to restrict the long-term effect. Since there is no
      standard clinical treatment programs, limiting the advantages and characteristics of
      traditional Chinese medicine to play.Guangdong Provincial Hospital of TCM is the province's
      Medical Center encephalopathy, treated 100 brain aneurysm patients each year, more than 80
      times craniotomies and surgical interventions , with a rich source of patiengs to carry out
      the study. In this study, on the basis studies on hemorrhagic stroke of a yin and yang
      syndrome and comprehensive treatment programe of the State 1995,the 15th research , in
      accordance with characteristics of the pathophysiology and understanding of cause and
      pathogenesis in aSAH perioperative period , through expert advice and review of the
      literature, under the guidance of Liu Maocai who isChinese medicine practitioners of
      Guangdong province , from diagnosis, diagnosis and treatment,prescription drugs, and other
      aspects of efficacy evaluation, developmenting a standardized treatment program of delayed
      CVS after aSAH . To evaluate the efficacy of the standardized program by prospective,
      randomized,controlled clinical trial,improving the postoperative results, reducting
      significantly the mortality and morbidity patients with cerebral aneurysms.
