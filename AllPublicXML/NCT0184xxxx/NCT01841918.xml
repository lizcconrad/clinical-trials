      The purpose of this study is to evaluate immune response and safety of live attenuated
      influenza H5 vaccine candidate strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) manufactured by GPO,
      Thailand in healthy Thais.

    <textblock>
      It is a double blind randomized study using 7.5-8.5 log EID50 dose which is the same dose as
      being tested in phase I.

      150 participants (100 vaccinees and 50 placebos) age 18-49 years old will be enrolled. All
      will be separated in 4 batches; Batch 1: 36 participants (24 vaccinees and 12 placebos) Batch
      2: 38 participants (25 vaccinees and 13 placebos) Batch 3: 38 participants (25 vaccinees and
      13 placebos) Batch 4: 38 participants (26 vaccinees and 12 placebos)

      Each batch will be admitted in the isolation ward for 5 days after each immunization mainly
      for safety assessment. Two doses of live attenuated influenza H5 vaccine candidate strain
      A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) will be given by intranasal route 28 days apart. Total
      follow up is 60 day.
