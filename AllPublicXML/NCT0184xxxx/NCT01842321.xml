      Screening : All women 18+, with a confirmed locally advanced or metastatic Triple Negative
      Breast Cancer (TNBC), will be screened and invited to participate (300-500 patients).

      Only patients with a centralized confirmation of ER-/PR-/HER2- and evaluation of AR+ will be
      included and treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (31 patients).

      The Treatment phase comprises a series of 4 weeks-cycles with continuous study treatment.
      Study drug treatment will continue until the earliest of the following events: disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.

      At disease progression, patients must be discontinued from study drug and should be evaluated
      within 30 days during the Post treatment visit and then entered into the Follow-Up
      phase.Patients should enter the Follow-Up Period regardless of reason for study drug
      discontinuation and should be monitored every 3 months (± 7 days) during 2 years.

    <description>The 6-months CBR is the measurement of all patients who have a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), according to RECIST criteria v1.1. At six months, patients will be classified as success (Alive at 6 months AND CR/PR/ SD) or failure (dead OR alive with progression).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>median follow-up = 2 years</time_frame>

    <time_frame>during the on-treatment period (defined as the period from the time of first dose of study medications up to 30 days of the last dose)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall safety profile of the treatment is determined by the occurrence of adverse events and toxicities. The severity of the adverse events and toxicities will be graded according the NCI CTCAE scale version 4.0.</description>
