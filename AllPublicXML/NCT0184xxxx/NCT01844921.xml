  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open label observational trial of patients undergoing
      EGD. The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the ability of physicians to
      position the NvisionVLE catheter to acquire an image of an area of the esophagus to identify
      and discriminate abnormal areas of tissue from normal.

    <measure>The primary endpoint will be the number of patients achieving a VLE (volumetric laser endomicroscopy) image that includes stomach, gastro esophageal junction (GEJ) and esophagus.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Achieving a VLE image is defined as completing a full 6cm scan. This will be presented as a percentage of patients.</description>

    <measure>The evaluation of procedural workflow and physician interface to the NvisionVLE Imaging Console.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Procedural workflow and physician interface to the console will be assessed by a questionnaire that will be completed by the investigational staff involved in the procedure (eg - Were you (physician) able to position the catheter in the desired position?).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females over the age of 18 years.

          -  Patients presenting for an EGD.

          -  Ability to provide written, informed consent.

          -  Females who are able to become pregnant, and are willing to take a pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on anticoagulation undergoing high risk procedures in accordance to American
             Society For Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guideline for the management of
             antithrombotic agents for endoscopic procedures (2009)*.

          -  Patients with esophageal varices that preclude biopsies.

          -  Presence of an esophageal mass that precludes full distention of the balloon from the
             NvisionVLE Catheter.

          -  Patients with esophageal strictures that would prevent adequate expansion of the
             balloon from the NvisionVLE Catheter.

          -  Patients with known inflammatory disease, esophageal tears or ulcers, which would
             prohibit full distention of the balloon from the NvisionVLE Catheter.

          -  Patients with known eosinophilic esophagitis.

          -  Patients that are pregnant.

          -  Patients with a history of hemostasis disorders**.

               -  Patients on anticoagulation undergoing low risk procedures are not excluded.
                  **Hemostasis disorders will include, but will not be limited to: patients with
                  hemophilia or other congenitally acquired clotting factor deficiencies, patients
                  with cirrhosis with coagulopathy, patients known to have thrombocytopenia
                  (&lt;100,000 plt/ul) and individuals with von Willibrand's disease or other known
                  platelet malfunction disorders.
