  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only a small proportion of patients with cholangiocarcinoma or ampullary carcinoma are
      suitable for surgical resection. The endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
      is accepted approaches for the relief of jaundice in malignant biliary obstruction. But
      restoration of bile flow have few improvement of the survival of cancer patient. By using
      endobiliary radiofrequency energy to destruct the tumorous tissue may delay tumour growth,
      which might improve the survival of patients. The feasibility and safety of this technique
      using HabibTM EndoHBP probe has been evident. The aims of this randomised, controlled,
      multicentre study is to evaluate whether endobiliary radiofrequency ablation(RFA) can improve
      the median survival of patients with unresectable biliary malignancy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RFA is well established method for treatment of some solid tumors, like liver cancer, lung
      cancer, etc. Recently, an endoscopically applicable radiofrequency probe, HabibTM EndoHBP
      catheter, was approved for clinical use. It uses bipolar electrical energy for tissue
      coagulation and can be easily applied during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ERCP). Endobiliary radiofrequency can destruct the tumor tissue and has potential benefit
      for controlling tumour growth. Several cohort studies have been published and the feasibility
      and safety of such technique has been proved.

      The aims of this study is to conduct a randomised, controlled, multicentre clinical trial to
      compare the effect of endobiliary RFA plus biliary stenting with only biliary stenting in
      patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma or ampullary carcinoma.

      The objectives are

        -  To evaluate whether endobiliary RFA prior to biliary stenting can improve the patients'
           survival as compared to the only stenting therapy.

        -  To assess the impact of RFA on the stent's patency.

    <description>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) would be performed under standard operating conditions to confirm the biliary malignancy. Subjects will receive endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (Endobiliary RFA) followed by plastic stent(s) placement.
Three months later, subjects will receive the second RFA therapy followed by biliary stents (plastic or SEMS) placement.
During follow-up, if stent occlusion occurs, the patient will undergo endoscopic re-intervention for stent exchange without endobiliary RFA</description>
