  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery in pediatrics has the potential to cause an
      increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). Previous studies have proposed that ultrasonographic
      measurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) correlate with signs of increased ICP.
      Therefore, this study aims to confirm the increased ICP by ultrasonographic measurement of
      ONSD during laparoscopic surgery in pediatric patients.

    <time_frame>change of ultrasonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath in 10 minutes after anesthesia induction, 10 minutes after pneumoperitoneum, and 10 minutes after CO2 desufflation.</time_frame>
    <description>A thick layer of gel is applied on the upper closed eyelid. The linear 13- to 6-MHz ultrasound probe is then placed in the gel, without exerting pressure on the eye. Two measurements are taken for each optic nerve: one in the transverse plane, with the probe being horizontal, and one in the sagittal plane, with the probe being vertical. The final ONSD is the mean of these measurements.</description>
