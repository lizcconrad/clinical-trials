  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cohort study plans to identify initiators of oral anticoagulants using electronic claims
      data from a commercial insurance database to quantify associations between anticoagulant
      choice (warfarin and dabigatran) and the occurrence of selected outcomes in patients with
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke.
