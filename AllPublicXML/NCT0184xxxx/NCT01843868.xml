  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients
      receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy for in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not well documented. The
      contribution of prednisolone to CINV control in the R-CHOP regimen is also unclear.

      This study aims to evaluate the overall effectiveness of antiemetic control using a
      standardised 5HT3 (5-Hydroxytryptamine 3) antagonist-containing regimen (e.g. ondansetron) in
      a heterogeneous group of patients receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy (Rituximab Doxorubicin
      Vincristine Cyclophosphamide Prednisolone).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to investigate the incidence and severity of CINV in patients
      receiving R-CHOP for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and standardised antiemetic
      prophylaxis.

      The study hypothesises that the control of delayed nausea and emesis is suboptimal in a
      proportion of patients receiving R-CHOP regimens and that delayed CINV is not prevented by
      use of 5HT3 antagonists beyond the first day of use post-chemotherapy administration.

      Participating institutions will prospectively collect data on the incidence of CINV, the
      severity of CINV, the use of break through/rescue medication for episodes of CINV
      uncontrolled by prescribed regular antiemetics, the effectiveness of additional measures used
      when previous CINV control has been inadequate (for example the use of aprepitant as an
      additional measure in subsequent cycles) and the major side-effects likely to be related to
      the antiemetics.

      The analysis of these results will determine the incidence and severity of CINV in patients
      receiving R-CHOP and the effectiveness of the prescribed antiemetic regimens. Analysis will
      also determine if the control and incidence of CINV is a significant problem in defined
      subgroups of patients receiving R-CHOP and could inform the design of future research (or an
      extension of the current protocol) in this area. Sub groups for investigation will include
      patients with advanced disease, those with abdominal involvement, those receiving R-CHOP
      every 14 days versus every 21 days (R-CHOP14 versus R-CHOP21), those receiving 6 or 8
      treatment cycles of R-CHOP, older patients, younger females etc. A potential randomised study
      evaluating the role of aprepitant could be contemplated in high risk groups.

    <description>This is a single arm study.
All patients receive R-CHOP every 14 or 21 days for a minimum of 3 cycles. Standard anti-emetics will be used as follows:
5HT3 (5-Hydroxytryptamine 3) antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron or tropisetron) used as the local institutional standard of care will be permitted, although the preferential use of ondansetron or granisetron will be encouraged.
Dexamethasone will not to be used as patients receive hydrocortisone and oral prednisolone in R-CHOP. In this study, the use of oral prednisolone on day 1 will be regarded as equivalent to dexamethasone. Prednisolone will be given PRIOR to the chemotherapy with the 5HT3 antagonist.
Anti-emetics (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine and lorazepam) may be prescribed to be used 'as needed' for breakthrough emesis.
Patients 'failing' the standard Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting prophylactic regimen will be eligible to receive aprepitant (Days 1 to 3) for subsequent cycles.</description>
