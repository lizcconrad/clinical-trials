    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD) of Irosustat
      (BN83495) in postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer with disease progression after prior hormonal therapy.

      This study is designed to provide necessary information on safety and dose response of
      BN83495, when given by repeated once daily oral administration, while achieving a maximal STS
      inhibition and a maximal reduction in plasma oestradiol (E2) and adiol levels. The data
      obtained will be used to plan further clinical studies.
