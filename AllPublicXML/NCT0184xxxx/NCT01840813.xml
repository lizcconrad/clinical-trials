      Administration of intraumbilical misoprostol to women with retained placenta despite active
      management of third stage of labour reduces the need for manual removal of placenta and the
      amount of blood loss vaginally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retained placenta (RP)is one of the complications of third stage of labour; it should be
      managed promptly as it may cause severe bleeding, infection, maternal morbidity and mortality
      .The current standard management of RP word wide, by manual removal aims to prevent these
      problems, but it is unsatisfactory method because it requires general anaesthesia in
      hospital, It is an invasive procedure with its own serious complications of bleeding,
      infection and genital tract injury. Umbilical vein injection of misoprostol is a simple, safe
      method and could be performed at the place of delivery .
