      Objective: The investigators aim to evaluate the impact of a adding a &quot; limitations &quot; section
      in systematic review's abstract on result's interpretation by readers Design: randomized
      controlled trial with two parallel arms. Participants will be invited to participate in an
      online survey.

      Participants: Eligible participants are corresponding authors of clinical trials published
      between 2010 and 2012 and referenced in Medline.

      Intervention: The investigators will evaluate the impact of the presence of a &quot; limitations &quot;
      section in abstract of systematic review with meta- analysis. The investigators selected
      abstracts of meta-analysis from a sample.

      Selected abstract will be standardised and the treatment's name hidden. Two groups of
      abstract will be presented as follow: 1) abstract without &quot; limitations &quot; section 2) abstract
      with &quot; limitations &quot; section. The &quot; limitations &quot; section will be written by authors and will
      briefly describe the risk of bias of included studies.

      Selected participant are invited by e-mail to answer the survey. After reading one abstract
      from his/her group of randomisation they are invited to answer 5 questions about their
      interpretation of the results.
