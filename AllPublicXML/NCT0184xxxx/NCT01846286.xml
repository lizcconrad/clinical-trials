      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete the following tests and procedures
      at the beginning and at the end of the study (on clinic visits, typically around 3-6 months
      after completion of treatment):

      Â°You will complete 5 questionnaires about any pain and other symptoms you may have had, your
      general well-being, drugs you may be taking, and personal information, such as your age. The
      questionnaires will take about 25-50 minutes to complete.

      Every week during treatment period, you will complete a questionnaire about pain you may be
      having. This questionnaire will take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for about 3-6 months after the last day of treatment.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 1200 will take part at MD Anderson.

        For AIM 1: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck patients for whom genome-wide
        (730,525 SNPs) and pain data are available; AIM 2: Newly diagnosed and previously untreated
        patients with locoregional (excludes Stage IVc) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
        neck recruited at the Head and Neck Center at MD Anderson; AIM 3: Populations from AIM 1 &amp;

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aim 1 Discovery Phase: The samples are from a large NIH-funded Genome-wide association
             study of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Shete; PI). A total of 2900
             &quot;case&quot; patients and 1200 control patients were recruited for the study. In this study,
             we will only use cases who were: a) Newly diagnosed, untreated, histopathologically
             confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx; b) No
             previous cancers; c) Age 18 years or older; d) white Caucasian.

          2. Aim 2: a) Newly diagnosed patients (have not had any prior cancer treatment) with
             loco-regional squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, b) Will receive cancer
             treatment at MDACC or at Ben Taub, c) Are 18 years or older, d) English or Spanish
             speaking; e) Able to understand the description of the study and give written informed
             consent; f) Will state that they will receive follow-up at MD Anderson post-treatment
             or at Ben Taub. This sample will also be included in the Validation Phase of Aim 1. We
             note that population stratification, i.e., the presence of a systematic difference in
             allele frequencies between subpopulations in a population possibly due to different
             ancestry, is an issue for genetic association studies.

          3. Aim 3: Patients included in aims 1 and 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Exclusion for Aim 2: a) Patients with distant metastasis (Stage IVC); b. Patients
        participating in clinical trials/ investigational drugs for pain control. Aim 1 (discovery
        phase) and Aim 3 will use existing data.
