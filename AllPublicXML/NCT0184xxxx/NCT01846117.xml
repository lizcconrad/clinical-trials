  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating whether the flax lignan, secoisolariciresinol
      diglucoside, decreases oxidative stress and inflammation. The flax seed lignan is believed to
      be broken down in the body to produce the health benefits of flax. Flax lignan is separated
      from the whole flax seed as this compound is believed to have health effects. Decreasing
      oxidative stress and inflammation should improve a number of the problems associated with
      aging. This intervention consists of 600 milligrams of the flax lignan SDG daily or an
      equivalent amount of whey protein.

      The investigators are comparing lignan to a placebo (whey powder) to examine whether a
      dietary intervention (i.e. flax seed containing lignan) might decrease oxidative stress and
      inflammation.
