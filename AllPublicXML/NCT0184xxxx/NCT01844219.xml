  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery has been reported to increase morbidity and
      mortality. Several risk scoring models for prediction of aortic kidney injury after cardiac
      surgery have been developed. However, predictive accuracy of these models is stil unclear.
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of four pre-existing prediction models
      using a gray zone approach in patients who underwent aortic surgery in our institution.

      Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery has been reported to increase morbidity and
      mortality. Several risk scoring models for prediction of aortic kidney injury after cardiac
      surgery have been developed. However, predictive accuracy of these models is stil unclear.
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of four pre-existing prediction models
      (AKICS, Wijeysundera, Mehta, and Thakar model)using a gray zone approach in patients who
      underwent aortic surgery in our institution. Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
      curve analysis, we will construct a gray zone using the cut-off values with a sensitivity of
      &lt; 90%, and a specificity of &lt; 90% (diagnostic tolerance of 10%).
