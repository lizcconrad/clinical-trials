  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Losses of imprinting are involved in various syndromes. Those occurring in the 11p15 region
      lead to Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell Syndromes. These losses of imprinting follow a
      mosaic pattern, rendering their detection difficult, especially given the scarcity of
      available DNA in amniotic fluid. Thus, in spite of growing demand, prenatal diagnosis (PND)
      for imprinting abnormalities of the 11p15 region is not available.

      The recent development of a quantitative PCR method that permits the methylation index (MI)
      of imprinted regions to be calculated renders PND technically possible. Nevertheless, because
      of the mosaic nature of these anomalies, it is essential to verify that the methylation
      pattern of the 11p15 region obtained from the amniotic fluid matches that obtained from the
      blood.

      To evaluate the agreement between the methylation index of the 11p15 region obtained using
      DNA extracted from amniocytes and that extracted from cord blood leukocytes, by calculating
      the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

      Ancillary study :

      This second part of the study aims to determine the standard of methylation index of the
      11p15 region (inclusion of 100 additional patients). The use of amniotic liquid will allow to
      calculate :

        -  the average of methylation index,

        -  the value of the standard deviation

        -  the inter-assay coefficient of variation for the test-used.
