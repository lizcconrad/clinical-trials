  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MUCIPLIQ is a nanopolymer engineered to mimic glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfates.
      Glycosaminoglycans are involved 1) in the stabilization of cells micro-environment, known as
      extracellular matrix, by binding to structural proteins, and 2) in cells communication
      process by protecting growth factors. At the site of a lesion, glycosaminoglycans are
      degraded, thereby the extracellular matrix is disorganized and the tissue is destroyed. By
      replacing damaged glycosaminoglycans, MUCIPLIQ provides a protection, and restores the matrix
      scaffold and cells communication, a process known as Matrix Therapy.

      The purpose of this new controlled study is to determine whether MUCIPLIQ can decrease the
      incidence and the severity of radio-chemotherapy-induced mucositis in patients suffering of
      upper aerodigestive tract cancers, when used as a preventive agent.

      The study's main hypothesis is that MUCIPLIQ mouthwash applications before radiotherapy would
      protect the healthy oral tissue against cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy and radiations.
