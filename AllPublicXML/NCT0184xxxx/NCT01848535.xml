  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prebiotics are thought to be a potential means to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea
      because of their ability to stimulate beneficial bacteria. In-vitro results showed a
      promising recovery of Bifidobacteria combined with an increase of Short Chain Fatty Acids
      (SCFA) upon Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation to amoxicillin-treated microbiota.
      As the microbiota is nowadays considered as a key factor in human health, a further
      understanding of the gut microbiota functioning in-vivo is essential. This understanding of
      the use of specific prebiotics may possibly be beneficial in the prevention or recovery of
      antibiotic-disturbed microbiota. As the effects of GOS supplementation on the microbiota
      composition and activity from healthy adults receiving amoxicillin have never been tested
      in-vivo, the investigators propose the current study as a proof of principle.

      Objective:

      To explore whether the promising effects of GOS supplementation on the composition and
      activity of gut microbiota from healthy adults as found by in-vitro, can also be observed
      in-vivo.

      Study population:

      10 healthy men and women volunteers, 18 - 40 yr old

    <description>Microbiota composition of the collected faecal sample will be investigated using a phylogenetic microarray, the Intestinal-Chip. With this microarray, more than 400 species of the intestinal microbiota can be detected.
Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus as beneficial bacteria as well as Enterobacteriaceae and possible other pathogens (Cells/ g faecal dry weight) will also be measured using a real-time PCR with specific primers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Microbiota activity</measure>
    <time_frame>evaluation between july and september 2013</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Chain Fatty acid (SCFA) amount produced will be measured using chromatographic approaches (Gas Chromatography, High Performance Liquid Chromatography).
The remaining GOS will be measured with High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) or with Capillary Electrophoresis -Light Induced Fluorescence, which has a better resolution than HPAEC.</description>
