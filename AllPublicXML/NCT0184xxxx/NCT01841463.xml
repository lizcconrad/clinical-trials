      -  An Open Label, Multicenter, Phase I Extension Study of an Oral Cdk Inhibitor P1446A-05
           Administered with an Oral BRAF Inhibitor Vemurafenib (Zelboraf®) in Patients with
           Advanced or Inoperable Malignant Melanoma with BRAF Mutation

        -  The primary objective is to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and dose
           limiting toxicity (DLT) of the co-administration of P1446A-05 with vemurafenib, in
           melanoma patients with BRAF mutation

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose and Dose Limiting Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 6-8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be conducted in two phases- Phase I (Dose escalation phase), and Extension phase. In the Dose escalation' phase patients will be co-administered P1446A-05 (150, 250, 350 mg qd) and vemurafenib (720, 960 mg bid) in a cohort of three to six patients on a 28-day cycle, until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Escalation to the next higher dose during the dose escalation phase will depend upon demonstrated safety in the previous dose group. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of P1446A-05 and vemurafenib co-administered will be determined. In the 'Extension' phase, sixty patients with BRAF V600E/K mutations (forty patients naïve to selective BRAF inhibitor therapy, and twenty progressing on selective BRAF inhibitor therapy) will be treated at the MTD on a 28-day cycle, until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity to determine efficacy of the co-administration.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic (PK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle1 (Day 15 and 22) and Cycle 2 (Day1,15 and 28)</time_frame>
    <description>PK parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Kel, CL, Vz and t1/2 will be determined using standard non-compartmental and population pharmacokinetic approach (wherever possible).
Blood samples (6 mL at each time point) for pharmacokinetic assessment will be collected at the following time points in Dose Escalation Phase- Cycle 1- Day 15: pre-dose (within 30 min before swallowing the capsule/s, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8hr; Day 19: pre-dose (within 30 min before swallowing the capsule/s, 1, 2, 4, 8hr; and within one hour post dose on Day 22.
Additionally, blood samples for PK analysis may be collected should patient develop SAE at the earliest feasible time point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 6-8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The biomarkers will be assessed pre- and post-treatment and will focus on (a) inhibition of the MAPK pathway as a target of vemurafenib, a RAF inhibitor; (b) cell cycle pathways as an effect of P1446A-05, a Cdk inhibitor; (c) mechanisms of resistance; and (d) markers for senescence and apoptosis as evidence of target engagement/drug response.
During phase I dose escalation, optional tumor samples will be collected at screening, within 4 to 6 hours of drug administration on Day 14 of Monotherapy and between Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 1 Day 21, and at disease progression
After the MTD is determined, 10 additional patients will be enrolled in &quot;Serial Tumor biopsy cohort&quot;
During the Extension phase, tumor samples will be collected at screening, Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 1 Day 21 within 4 to 6 hours of drug administration, and at disease progression.</description>
