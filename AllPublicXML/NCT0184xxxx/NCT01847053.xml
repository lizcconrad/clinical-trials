    <textblock>
      A partial double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-treatment crossover study design
      will be used to evaluate bioavailability of various forms of cinnamon and to determine the
      effects of 3 and 6 g of cinnamon added to instant oatmeal on blood glucose levels in 8
      healthy subjects. In the extended dose response study, three subjects will continue the study
      and be offered 5 day consecutive feedings of 9 g cinnamon extract and on Day 6, and blood
      samples would be collected over 6 hours after a single morning dose. Urinary samples would be
      collected upon to 48 hours.

      Objective:

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the bioavailability of selected procyanidin
      derived metabolites from various forms of cinnamon.

      Study Products:

      Core Study

        -  Control: Oatmeal (~70 g) without cinnamon

        -  Active A: Oatmeal (~70 g) with 3 g ground cinnamon

        -  Active B: Oatmeal (~70 g) with 3 g cinnamon extract

        -  Active C: Oatmeal (~70 g) with 6 g cinnamon extract

      Extension Study

      •9 g cinnamon extract in capsule form (unblinded) The 9 g/d cinnamon extract will be consumed
      by subjects on days 22 through 26. At visit 6 (day 27), subjects will return to the clinic
      for the test day. The cinnamon extract capsule (9 g) will be consumed with an oatmeal (70 g)
      breakfast.

      Subjects:

      Subjects will be healthy men 18 - 40 years of age (inclusive), each with a body mass index
      (BMI) 25.00-29.99 kg/m2.

      Outcome Variables:

      Primary Outcome Variable The primary outcome variables will be the area under the curve (AUC)
      from 0 to 360 min for plasma procyanidin-derived metabolites, where t=0 min is the start of
      study product consumption.

      Secondary Outcome Variables

      Secondary outcome variables will include the assessment of:

        -  The maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to reach peak concentration (Tmax) for plasma
           procyanidin-derived metabolites, as well as the net incremental AUC values to account
           for possible non-zero pre-load values.

        -  The effect of a single dose of cinnamon on the metabolic profile using an untargeted
           metabolomics analysis on both plasma and urine specimens.

        -  The effect of a single dose of cinnamon on plasma glucose and insulin.
