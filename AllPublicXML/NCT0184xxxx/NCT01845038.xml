  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how OTX-TP, a sustained release travoprost drug
      product, when placed in the canaliculus of the eyelid compares to timolol drops for the
      lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension.
