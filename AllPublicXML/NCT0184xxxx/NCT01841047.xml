  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retro peritoneal liposarcomas are rare (less than 15% of sarcomas) whose prognosis is
      locoregional.

      In the treatment of retroperitoneal liposarcomas main prognostic factor is the quality of the
      surgical resection. The effect of radiotherapy combined with surgery is uncertain and until
      now limited perhaps because of limited prescribed doses (of the order of 45Gy to 50Gy) due to
      high risk of organ toxicity nearby.

      The helical tomotherapy is an innovative equipment radiotherapy to make conformational
      radiotherapy modulation intensity and is particularly suitable for irradiations precision
      (imaging mode associated with daily scanner) in large complex volumes. Increasing doses
      (increase of the prescribed dose to 54 Gy, thus potentially curative), the helical
      tomotherapy should allow to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.

      Retro peritoneal liposarcomas are rare (less than 15% of sarcomas) whose prognosis is
      locoregional. In the treatment of retroperitoneal liposarcomas main prognostic factor is the
      quality of the surgical resection. The effect of radiotherapy combined with surgery is
      uncertain and until now limited perhaps because of limited prescribed doses (of the order of
      45Gy to 50Gy) due to high risk of organ toxicity nearby.

      Two elements can overcome these difficulties:

        -  Preoperative radiotherapy made rather than Postoperatively, the tumor in place back the
           gastrointestinal tract and reducing toxicity,

        -  The contribution of conformal radiotherapy techniques with intensity modulation (IMRT).
           The helical tomotherapy is an innovative equipment radiotherapy to make conformational
           radiotherapy modulation intensity and is particularly suitable for irradiations
           precision (imaging mode associated with daily scanner) in large complex volumes.
           Increasing doses (increase of the prescribed dose to 54 Gy, thus potentially curative),
           the helical tomotherapy should allow to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Liposarcoma histologically proven, in case of non-biopsy contributive: diagnosis
             radiologically validated meeting multidisciplinary consultation (RCP)

          2. Protocol TOMOREP technically feasible,

          3. Patients over 18 years

          4. Considered a priori tumor operable even with excision multi-visceral

          5. Absence of morbidity against-indicating surgery necessary. The evaluation will be
             performed by the surgeon or the radiotherapist according to the definitions by the ASA
             classification.

          6. Original form (as well as tumors made after first incomplete excision) and form in
             first relapse.

          8. Patient signed informed consent,

          9. Patient affiliated to a social security scheme.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Metastasis associated

          2. Extension intraperitoneal associated mesenteric extension

          3. bilaterally

          4. Against disease-indicating the need for surgery (ASA 3 and 4).

          5. Cons-indication for radiotherapy (such as prior radiotherapy the volume to be
             treated).

          6. Patient included in another clinical study

          7. Unable to undergo medical monitoring test for geographical, social or psychological,

          8. Private patient freedom and major subject of a measure of legal protection or unable
             to consent.
