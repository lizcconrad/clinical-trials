  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to study the effects of three forms of bariatric surgery: gastric
      bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and lap banding. The surgery is not part of the clinical trial.
      If insurance does not cover the procedure, then the patient is responsible for payment of the
      surgical process. The investigators are doing pre- and post-surgery testing to provide a
      better understanding of the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on 1) alcohol
      absorption, distribution and elimination from the body; 2) the effects of alcohol on blood
      sugar; and 3) the effects of alcohol on mood.

      The study includes seven groups of women: One group will be undergoing gastric bypass,
      another group will be undergoing lap banding, a third group will be undergoing sleeve
      gastrectomy, the fourth group will be women who underwent gastric bypass 1-5 years ago, the
      fifth group will be women who underwent lap banding 1-5 years ago, the sixth group will be
      women who underwent sleeve gastrectomy 1-5 years ago, and the seventh group will be a control
      group who have not undergone bariatric surgery.
