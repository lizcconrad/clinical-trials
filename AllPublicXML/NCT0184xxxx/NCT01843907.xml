  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) To investigate and compare the effect of two preventive
      interventions on readmission rates, loss of functions, quality of life and cost-benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At baseline:

      Nutritional status, BMI and weight, depression (GDS5), dementia (MMSE), pain (Verbal Ranking
      Scale), muscle strength (hand-grip strength, chair-to-stand-test), quality of life (EQ5D),
      coping (Sense of Coherence 13 item scale), patient experience (NORPEQ), medication management
      (MedMaide).

      At follow-up three months after discharge:

      BMI and weight, depression (GDS5), dementia (MMSE), pain (Verbal Ranking Scale), muscle
      strength (hand-grip strength, chair-to-stand-test) and EQ5D. In addition, need for initiated
      municipal assistance after discharge. Project employee who performs data collection is
      blinded to the group to which the patient is randomized.

      The control group Patients in the control group undergo the same measurements and
      registrations at discharge and 3 - month follow-up, as the intervention groups, but receive
      otherwise usual treatment and care, and are discharged without further intervention. After
      six months control patients receive a report comprising the screening results, relevant
      information material and a cover letter. Patients' GP and municipality care section receive a
      summary of outcomes, as well as a cover letter.

      Register data Information on mortality, readmissions and services in primary health care are
      obtained after 6 months from the National Patient Register, Population Register and
      municipalities.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group 1 receive a communication report which will also be sent to the physician and home care. In communication report includes the results and interpretation and explanation of the measurements in layman's terms. The report also includes relevant and targeted information on pain management, depression among the elderly, dementia and disability in old age and ways to maintain and improve functional capacity. Links and addresses of relevant, local organizations, and networks are also included. The information material is also included in the report sent to the General Practitioner (GP) and home care.</description>
