  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the mean number of stimulation (high
      definition-transcranial direct current stimulation) sessions (up to 26) needed to achieve a
      clinical response with this response defined as a 50% decrease in Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
      for pain. These data will be important in defining the optimal number of sessions for future
      fibromyalgia subjects in Phase III trials.

    <description>Investigate the mean number of sessions (up to 26) needed to achieve clinical response associated with the use of HD-tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1), with response defined at a 50% decrease in baseline Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects who achieve clinical response</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will count the number of subjects who achieve clinical response (as defined in Aim 1 as a 50% reduction in baseline VAS) for the duration of the trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of sensory and auditory evoked potentials</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure brain pain response using electroencephalography (EEG) to measure somatosensory Event Related Potentials (ERPs) with a heat pain threshold device. We will also measure auditory ERPs. We will investigate the relationship between these ERP measurements and overall clinical response of patients (as outlined in Aim 1 and Aim 2)</description>
