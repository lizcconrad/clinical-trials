  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether taking Rifaximin (Xifaxan) in conjunction
      with the use of nutritional concepts is effective in improving morbidity and quality of life
      in cirrhotic patients suffering from hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

      Prevention of portal hypertension complications should be at the forefront. In doing so, the
      end result will be an improvement in the multitude of morbidity and mortality issues. The
      proposed prospective trial will compare patients with similar demographics and medical and
      clinical settings utilizing standard of care therapy. Study subjects will be randomly
      assigned into two treatment groups. Group one will receive Lactulose 30ml three times a day
      as SOC and Rifaximin Placebo 550mg twice a day with nutritional supervision and group two
      will receive Rifaximin 550mg twice per day as SOC and Lactulose placebo 30ml three times per
      day with nutritional supervision.
