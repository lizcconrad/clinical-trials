  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      S-1 is a newly developed novel oral dihydrouracil dehydrogenase inhibiting fluoro-pyrimidine
      drug consisting of i M tegafur (FT), 0.4 M 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyrimidine (gimeracil), and
      1 M potassium oxonate (oteracil), with efficient antitumor activity and low gastrointestinal
      toxicity. Several studies have proved the safety and efficacy of single agent S-1 in
      metastatic breast cancer. This study is designed to further investigate and compare the
      efficacy and safety of Epirubicin-cyclophosphamide-S-1(ECS) vs.
      Epirubicin-cyclophosphamide-5-fluorouracil (ECF) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
      local advanced breast cancer.
