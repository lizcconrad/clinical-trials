      This study examines the efficacy of the &quot;Preconception Reproductive Knowledge Promotion
      (PREKNOP)&quot; intervention, designed to promote women's reproductive health and positive
      pregnancy outcomes. The study's goal is to educate low-income women about reproductive
      changes related to their menstrual cycle. The main hypothesis of the study is that women who
      receive the PREKNOP intervention will report reduced risk of unplanned pregnancy and
      increased reproductive knowledge, self-efficacy about that knowledge, and pregnancy planning
      ability.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of the PREKNOP intervention in a sample of 120
      women 18-44 years old. Teams of nursing students and community health workers will administer
      the 12-month intervention. In addition to 10 home visits during which women will receive
      information on the female reproductive system and the expected monthly cyclical changes,
      PREKNOP will consist of use of ovulation test kits, a 12-month menstrual calendar, a digital
      thermometer, and educational brochures covering: the female reproductive anatomy, hormones
      and menstrual cycle, how to recognize ovulation period, various methods of birth control and
      how they work, and early pregnancy symptoms.

    <description>Women will receive the &quot;Knowing your body&quot; kit. The kit contains: 6 ovulation test strips, a 12 month menstrual log sheet/calendar, and a thermometer to help women determine their body temperature; and educational materials that contain information on female body parts involved in pregnancy, hormones and the menstrual cycle, how birth control works, body temperature changes, characteristics of cervical fluid, and adapting to pregnancy during the first trimester. Participants will receive a total of 10 visits. During the first visit, the nursing student/community health workers team will review the intervention kit and continue to discuss topics related to women's health during subsequent visits.</description>
