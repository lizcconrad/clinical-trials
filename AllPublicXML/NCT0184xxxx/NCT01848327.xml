  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background/Rationale: Cognitive problems are a common symptom in individuals with Multiple
      Sclerosis (MS). Treatment options are limited, and there is a pressing need for new
      interventions to treat MS-related cognitive impairment. Glucose (a type of sugar) is used to
      fuel the cells of the healthy brain. For people with neurological conditions such as MS,
      glucose is not converted into energy as efficiently as it would be in a healthy brain, which
      can lead to a decrease in cognitive function. Caprylic Triglyceride may work to bypass this
      problem by providing an alternative energy source that is metabolized in the liver and used
      by the brain.

      Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of 90 days of caprylic triglyceride on
      cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.

      Design: Randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial of 158 subjects.

      Outcome: Change in Total Learning (Trials 1-5) on the California Verbal Learning Test-2nd
      Edition-(CVLT-II) AND Change in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) (at day 90

    <textblock>
      Patients with all types of MS (Relapsing Remitting, Secondary Progressive, or Primary
      Progressive) are eligible to participate. Participants will undergo detailed cognitive
      assessment before initiating treatment and again after 90 days of treatment, to determine
      whether Caprylic Triglyceride demonstrates a benefit over placebo.

      Dosage: 40 gram packet orally once a day Duration of Treatment: 90 days

      Analyses: Interim analyses will be conducted after 72 subjects have completed the trial and
      objective STOP criteria for efficacy and futility have been defined in the protocol. Final
      analyses will be an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis to evaluate each of the primary aims.
