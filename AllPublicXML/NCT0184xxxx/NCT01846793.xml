    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a second transrectal
      intraprostatic injection of NX-1207 given to subjects with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)
      who previously received an injection of NX-1207 in an earlier U.S. clinical trial of NX-1207.
