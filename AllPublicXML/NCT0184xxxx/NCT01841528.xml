      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women of
      childbearing age. However, the optimal infertility treatment for PCOS patients is still a
      matter of controversy. Despite producing more follicles and more oocytes than other women
      undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation during an IVF cycle, women with PCOS have
      comparable or lower pregnancy rates. Additionally women with PCOS patients undergoing IVF
      have a higher risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which may be
      aggravated by pregnancy after an embryo transfer in a fresh cycle. Further women with PCOS
      are thought to have higher rates of later pregnancy complications including spontaneous
      abortion, pre-eclampsia, and preterm labor that may be related to impaired implantation in
      the superovulated endometrium. We propose a randomized clinical trial of elective embryo
      cryopreservation followed by a programmed cycle of endometrial preparation and frozen embryo
      transfer (FET) compared to fresh embryo transfer in women with PCOS undergoing in vitro
      fertilization (IVF).

      This will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio)clinical trial of
      frozen-thawed embryo transfer vs. fresh embryo transfer after a uniform
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol in infertile PCOS patients
      receiving IVF therapy. Qualified 1180 patients are randomized into either of two groups:
      group A will undergo fresh embryo transfer (590 cases), Group B will undergo elective
      cryopreservation of all embryos followed by transfer of thawed embryos to a programmed
      endometrium (590 cases). All of the participants will receive recombinant follicule
      stimulating hormone (rFSH)/GnRH antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation and standardized
      luteal phase support.

      The target population will be infertile PCOS patients aged between 20 and 35 years, diagnosed
      by the Chinese PCOS Criteria(i.e. menstrual disorders PLUS either one of the remaining two
      criteria, hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, with exclusion of secondary
      causes of hyperandrogenism and ovulation dysfunction). And subjects will be those who are
      undergoing their first IVF or intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle without other
      known factors interfere reproductive or metabolic functions.

      The randomization will take place at the oocyte pick-up day by an on-line randomization
      system.

      The pregnancy test results, pregnancy complications, congenital anomalies neonatal
      complications will be followed up by checking medical records and telephone calls.
