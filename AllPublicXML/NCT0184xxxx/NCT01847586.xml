  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a novel brain stimulation approach using
      magnetic stimulation (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [TMS]) can improve memory and
      thinking processes in individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim at assessing and then enhancing neuroplasticity in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and working memory - a key function of DLPFC - in
      patients with mild AD. The investigators will use a novel non-invasive brain stimulation
      approach, Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS). PAS simulates in humans the induction of
      long-term potentiation (LTP), a prototype of synaptic neuroplasticity. PAS involves the
      repetitive pairing of electrical stimulation of the median nerve with - 25 ms later -
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the contralateral DLPFC. As such, these two
      stimulations arrive simultaneously in the DLPFC and result in potentiation of TMS induced
      cortical evoked potential, analogous to in vitro LTP.

      Specific Aim 1: To compare LTP in the DLPFC among patients with mild AD and healthy subjects.

      Specific Aim 2: To assess the effect of a 2-week course of PAS (rPAS) as applied to the left
      DLPFC on LTP and performance on working memory in patients with mild AD in comparison with a
      2-week course of PAS control condition (PAS-C, described below) (rPAS-C).

    <description>We are using a novel technique of TMS- EEG as developed by our group. Through this technique, not only motor evoked potential (MEP) but also cortical evoked activity (CEA) is recorded continuously while TMS is being delivered to the cortex. Thus, PAS-induced LTP could be indexed through the potentiation of not only MEP but also of CEA. TMS-EEG has been used by our group and others. Our group has used TMS-EEG in healthy individuals and patients with severe mental illness to study several neurophysiological phenomena in M1 and DLPFC such as cortical inhibition, gamma oscillations, and recently LTP.
In summary, we propose to combine PAS with TMS-EEG to assess DLPFC neuroplasticity in patients with mild AD and then deliver a 2-week course of daily repetitive PAS (rPAS) to enhance DLPFC neuroplasticity and function as indexed by the N-back task. This will be measured to see if there are any changes after 1 day, 7 days and 14 days of the intervention procedure.</description>

    <description>Working Memory Assessment: Participants will have their working memory assessed pre- and 1, 7, and 14 days post intervention using the N-back task. In the N-back task participants determine whether a stimulus is the same as that presented N trials back. One and 7 days post-intervention, the N-back task will be administered to assess the short- and long-term effect of rPAS on working memory as our preliminary data demonstrate a long-term enhancing effect of PAS on motor learning</description>
