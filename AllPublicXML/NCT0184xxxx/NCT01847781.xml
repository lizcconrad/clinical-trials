  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study the immune response to conjugated pneumococcal vaccination (Prevenar13)
      in Immunoglobulin G-deficient patients and healthy controls. Our hypothesis is that the
      antibody response will be impaired in patients as compared with controls. In contrast, we
      postulate that the cellular immune response will be intact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten patients with Immunoglobulin G1 and/or Immunoglobulin G2 deficiency will be enrolled
      together with 10 age and sex- matched controls. Blood-samples will be drawn at base-line and
      after 1, 2 and 4 weeks post-vaccination. Serum will be analyzed for opsonophagocytic
      antibodies. Peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) will be isolated, frozen and later
      analyzed for all time-points simultaneously. PBMCs will be stimulated with vaccine-antigens
      for 3-5 days and cellular activation markers will be measured together with cytokines
      (Interferon-gamma, Interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22). In addition, levels of
      antimicrobial peptides in nasal fluid will be measured at baseline and after 4 weeks
      post-vaccination.
