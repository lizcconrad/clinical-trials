  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the skin lipid and protein composition between term and
      premature infants and determine how the skin composition changes over the first four weeks of
      life. The investigators hope to elucidate the unique characteristics of premature skin by
      measuring the lipid and protein content in skin, how it changes during the first month of
      life, and how it varies with formula feeding versus breast feeding. Additionally, the
      investigators will study the relationships among diet, skin composition and plasma lipids in
      premature infants over the first four weeks of life.

      Infants in the UCDMC Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with no congenital or acquired diseases of
      the skin or cardiovascular system will be enrolled after informed consent has been obtained
      from their parents. This is an observational study with no intervention. Procedures: At
      enrollment, 2 weeks and 4 weeks of age, skin lipids will be collected using three methods.
      First two small pieces of blotting paper (2 cm x 2 cm) will be placed on the infant's skin,
      one on the left side of the abdomen just above the umbilicus and one on the left inner thigh.
      The blotting paper will be left in place for 15 seconds and then removed. Second, two
      adhesive discs will be placed on the skin, one just below the umbilicus and one on the right
      inner thigh. The discs will be left in place for 30 seconds and then removed. Third, two
      areas of skin, one on the right side of the abdomen just above the umbilicus and the other on
      the inner right thigh, will be gently swabbed with sterile cotton swabs (one for each
      location). The intent is to remove a thin layer of oil/lipid from the skin upon removal of
      the paper or the adhesive disc or with swabbing without disrupting the skin surface (similar
      to taking a fingerprint). Blood specimens will be obtained three times, each time 1 ml : once
      at enrollment, at 2 weeks and the last one at 4 weeks of age, to generate a plasma
      lipoprotein profile and size distribution (HDL, LDL, VLDL, total cholesterol). For infants
      that are fed expressed human milk, we will also obtain a sample of mother's milk for analysis
      of lipid profile (about 2 ml).
