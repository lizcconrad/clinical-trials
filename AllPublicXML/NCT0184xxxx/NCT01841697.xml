  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority study comparing omarigliptin with sitagliptin in participants with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy. The
      primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c
      (A1C) in participants treated with omarigliptin is non-inferior to that in participants
      treated with sitagliptin. There will be a 2-week run-in period with placebo + metformin prior
      to the double-blind treatment period.

    <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an adverse event.
