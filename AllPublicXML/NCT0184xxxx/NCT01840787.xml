  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As new contact lens products continue to be developed and improved, it's becoming harder for
      some individuals to tell whether one product is different from another. In addition, not
      everyone has the same level of sensitivity of their eyes, making it difficult for these
      judgments to be made. The purpose of this study is to explore the idea of using a
      pre-determined &quot;expert panel&quot; of individuals who are able to tell differences between contact
      lenses based on their comfort.

      As technology continues to advance, contact lenses and lens care products are becoming harder
      to differentiate. In addition, assessing comfort in clinical trials is complicated, with
      full-masking behind hard to achieve and the psychology of the participant having unknown
      impact on the results. While the development of a reliable system to assess comfort would be
      beneficial for the research and development of new products, the use of a &quot;sensory panel&quot;
      itself may also lead to a better understanding of the drivers of discomfort at the end of the
      day.

      The objective of the study is to explore the use of a sensory panel, defined as individuals
      who have a good correlation between subjective and objective measures of discomfort, at
      rating the comfort of various contact lenses.

      The hypothesis is that in the &quot;discriminative&quot; group, the matrix of paired comparisons
      (between lens dissimilarity) is related to the ranked comfort of the lenses, while for the
      &quot;poorly discriminative&quot; group, the matrix of the dissimilarities will be random. An
      additional hypothesis is that the &quot;discriminative&quot; group will be less random than the entire
      group.
