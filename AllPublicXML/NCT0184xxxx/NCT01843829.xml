  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 7500 patients are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer each year in the UK of which less
      than a quarter have resectable disease at diagnosis. There is a general lack of consistency
      in the standard of care for patients across UK hospitals. Patients are either treated with a)
      chemotherapy followed by surgical removal of the tumour, or b) chemoradiotherapy followed by
      removal of the tumour by surgery, as part of their standard of care. Recent research supports
      the latter treatment, as chemoradiotherapy maybe more effective at shrinking the tumour and
      preventing the disease from spreading than taking chemotherapy alone. However, there is no
      definitive way of identifying which treatment is best without a clinical trial.

      Evidence suggests that the effect of the chemoradiotherapy currently used as standard
      practice may be improved and the side effects reduced by using a different chemoradiotherapy
      combination. In this trial, eligible patients will receive 2 cycles of the same chemotherapy
      before being randomised to receive two different chemoradiotherapy regimens (carboplatin and
      paclitaxel verses oxaliplatin and capecitabine) both of which have shown promising results in
      previous studies. Patients will then have their tumour removed. The best chemoradiotherapy
      regimen will then be taken forward to a Phase III trial in which chemoradiotherapy will be
      compared with chemotherapy alone.

      The efficacy of the regimens will be measured by counting the number of patients who i)
      remain free from cancer, ii)have local or distant spread of their cancer, iii) are
      successfully recruited and iv) experience toxicities. A specific set of toxicity criteria
      will be used to monitor any treatment induced side-effects and provide justification for any
      necessary dose modifications or withdrawal of treatment.

    <description>The trial safety will be assessed by looking at the toxicity. Toxicities during treatment and at 6 and 12 months post-surgery will be recorded using the CTCAE version 4. SAEs will be collected in real time. The morbidity/mortality rate post surgery will also be assessed.</description>
