  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if aclerastide (DSC127) is effective in increasing incidence of complete wound
      closure up to 10 weeks confirmed 2 weeks later, compared with vehicle (gel without active
      ingredient) and compared with a standard-of-care gel, in subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM)
      who have chronic Wagner Grade 1 or 2 diabetic foot ulcers, 0.75 - 6cm2 in size.

      Subjects will undergo a two week screening period to assess plantar ulcer healing, and those
      healing less than 30% will be eligible for randomization providing all other criteria are
      met. Four weeks of &quot;blinded&quot; randomized treatment follows the screening period, and an
      observation period of six weeks follows the treatment period. If the ulcer closes during the
      treatment or observation period, the closure will be confirmed at a visit two weeks later,
      and at this time the subjects enters a durability assessment period of up to 12 weeks.

      All aspects of Standard of Care are followed throughout the study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female ambulatory subject age ≥18 years at the time of informed consent

          -  Has type 1 or type 2 DM under metabolic control as confirmed by a glycosylated
             hemoglobin (HbA1c) of ≤12% and a serum creatinine level of ≤3mg/dL

          -  At Screening and Baseline (prior to randomization), subject has at least one ulcer
             that fulfills all of the following criteria:

               -  present for ≥1 month and ≤1 year

               -  Partial- or full- thickness and not involving bone, tendon, or capsule (probing
                  to tendon or capsule), i.e. Wagner Grade 1 or 2.

               -  Has no sign of infection or osteomyelitis

               -  Plantar neuropathic ulcer - predominately be on the plantar surface (i.e. weight
                  bearing) of the foot to ensure adequate off-loading and may include the toes

               -  Size of the target ulcer must be 0.75-6 cm2.

               -  Target ulcer must be non-healing as defined as &lt;30% reduction in area in response
                  to standard of care during the Screening Period

                    -  If more than one ulcer is present that meets the inclusion criteria, the
                       largest one will be considered the target ulcer

                    -  If there are two ulcers of the same size that meet all criteria, the one
                       with the higher Wagner Grade will be considered the target ulcer

                    -  If there are two ulcers of the same size and the same Wagner Grade, the one
                       present for the longest qualifying time will be the target ulcer.

                    -  Non-target ulcers will also be treated according to standard of care (Acute
                       Charcot Neuroarthropathy of the foot with the target ulcer must be excluded)

             acceptable method of birth control, such as Essure®, hormonal contraception (oral
             pills, implantable device, or skin patch), intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or
             double barrier throughout the study. A female subject of childbearing potential who
             practices abstinence is not required to employ birth control.

          -  Has the ability and willingness to understand and comply with study procedures and to
             give written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study or initiation of study
             procedures
