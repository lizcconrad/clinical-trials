  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eighteen patients were given a dose of 2g Cefazolin in anesthetic induction, supplemented
      with 1g delivered through continuous infusion during surgery. Adipose samples, obtained at
      the beginning and end of surgery, were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography.

      Some published studies suggest that the dose of 2g does not supply the minimum inhibitory
      concentration for principal causal agents of surgical site infection.

      To determine the concentration of Cefazolin in adipose tissue of patients undergoing
      bariatric surgery and to evaluate the relationship between concentrations obtained and body
      mass index (BMI).

    <description>Cefazolin used in antimicrobial prophylaxis
Cefazolin administered a first dose of 2g in anesthetic induction, followed by continuous dosage of 1g diluted in 250mL of saline solution for two hours.
Two samples of subcutaneous tissue were collected for analysis: the first soon after the incision, and a second before skin synthesis.
The samples were processed by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).</description>
