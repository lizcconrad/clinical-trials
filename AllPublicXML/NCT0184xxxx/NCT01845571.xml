    <textblock>
      Background:

      Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is an ophthalmic emergency that, without surgical repair,
      often leads to blindness. The incidence is about 1/10000/year. The leading causes are myopia
      and aging which cause retinal tears often resulting in retinal detachment. Patients commonly
      experience photopsia, floaters, and peripheral visual field loss.

      Two different general surgical treatment options exist for retinal detachment; scleral
      buckling or vitrectomy. However, the precise indications for each approach have not been well
      established. Correct classification of the retinal detachment is important. The first step is
      to decide whether an intra- or extra-ocular surgical approach is more appropriate. Simple
      rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are usually treated extraocularly with scleral buckling
      surgery, whereas more complicated cases require intraocular primary pars plana vitrectomy and
      one or more of gas, silicone oil, laser therapy, or cryotherapy.

      Study objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate different surgical techniques for the treatment of
      retinal detachment. Data relating to retinal status before treatment, surgical treatment,
      post-operative anatomy and visual acuity, post-operative OCT, and intra- and post-operative
      complications will be collected.

      Vitreous cytokines will also be analyzed to monitor intravitreal inflammation as a result of
      retinal detachment.
