    <textblock>
      While most of the research on integrated approaches of occupational health and safety and
      worksite health promotion to date has focused on manufacturing settings, employment is
      shifting to the service sector. Within this sector, health care employs over 12 million
      workers, and is the second fastest growing industry in the U.S. economy. In contrast to
      workers in other industries, rates of occupational injuries and illnesses among health care
      workers have increased over the past decade. The purpose of this study is to lay the
      foundation for integrated interventions in health care through examination of the
      associations of worker health outcomes and risks on and off the job with work policies and
      practices and to address the prevalent issues of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs),
      particularly low back pain disability (LBPD), and health promotions through physical activity
      among patient care workers. The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To estimate the efficacy and determine the feasibility of an integrated intervention,
           addressing both health protection and health promotion in order to reduce MSD symptoms
           and improve health behaviors among healthcare workers. We will assess between-group
           differences in MSD symptoms, health behaviors, including physical activity, and a set of
           secondary outcomes, including unplanned absence, reported injuries, worker compensation
           claims and costs, turnover and retention, intention to leave the job, and work-role
           function. This study will explore the working hypothesis that: Workers employed at
           baseline in patient-care units receiving the intervention will report greater reductions
           in their MSD symptoms (primary outcome) and greater improvements in health behaviors,
           compared with workers employed at baseline in units assigned to the Usual Care control
           group.

        2. To determine the factors in the work environment which contribute over time to
           reductions in MSD symptoms and improvements in safe and healthy behaviors. (1) The work
           environment, work organization, and psychosocial factors, measured in our current study,
           will be associated with changes in workers' health behaviors and health outcomes between
           the assessments in the current and proposed studies; (2) Improvements in the work
           environment over time will be associated with improvements in workers' health behaviors
           and health outcomes. We will conduct multilevel modeling analysis to evaluate the
           simultaneous effects of worker-level and unit-level factors on MSD symptoms and safety
           and health behaviors.

    <textblock>
      Improving and protecting the health and well-being of healthcare workers requires addressing
      key risks in the work environment as well as promoting safe and healthy behaviors. Healthcare
      workers are at elevated risk for musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to a range of job
      factors, including lifting and transferring patients; working long hours (often at night);
      and limited control over decisions on the job. Among these, nurses and nurses aides bear the
      largest burden of injury. Back injuries in particular constitute the greatest source of their
      disability. These risks are likely to increase in coming years due to the aging nursing
      workforce, increase in work demands, and labor shortages. Health behaviors, including
      physical activity, inadequate sleep, and dietary patterns associated with being overweight or
      obese, are also influenced by the work environment and psychosocial factors on the job, and
      are also associated with MSD risk. Traditional approaches to redressing these risks have
      focused separately on health protection, including efforts to reduce MSD risk, and health
      promotion aimed at improving health behaviors. Little research has systematically examined
      the dual and potentially synergistic effects of the work environment on risk of MSDs and
      worker health behaviors, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the most efficacious
      ways to ameliorate the combined effects of these health risks. Our long-term goal is to
      improve the overall health and well-being of healthcare workers by making available
      evidence-based worksite policies, programs, and practices that foster a healthy work
      environment, reduce potential hazardous job exposures, and promote safe and healthy
      behaviors. The proposed study is the next logical step in building this evidence base.
      Factors in the work environment, including high work demands, low social support, and long
      work hours, have been shown to increase risk of MSDs, as well as risk-related behaviors. Yet
      little research has systematically explored these cross-cutting pathways and their
      implications for improving the effectiveness of worksite interventions to address the broad
      spectrum of worker health outcomes.

      The proposed research provides a novel approach to worksite interventions that integrate
      occupational safety and health and worksite health promotion, taking into account the shared
      factors in the work environment shaping both MSDs and health behaviors. Standard approaches
      to occupational health and safety and worksite health promotion are based on a parallel
      structure of separate silos functioning relatively independently in the worksite, each
      drawing from their own disciplines and training experiences within public health. Although
      these parallel efforts share the common mission of improving worker health, their strategies
      are based on different assumptions about and approaches to improving worker health outcomes.
      The proposed research integrates these parallel approaches. Although our prior research has
      rigorously tested the efficacy of this integrated intervention model in changing worker
      health behaviors, to our knowledge no prior research has examined the impact of this
      integrated model on health outcomes associated with work exposures - here, notably, on MSD
      symptoms.

    <description>The intervention follows principles for integrated approaches to promoting and protecting worker health. It will occur on 4 inpatient units at Massachusetts General Hospital beginning in January 2013, and will continue for 1 year.
Overall intervention objectives:
Motivate individual staff members to engage in targeted health and safety behavior changes;
build awareness of ergonomic and safety hazards and of opportunities for healthy dietary choices and physical activity;
facilitate unit-level norms supportive of breaks, safe patient handling, and targeted health and safety behaviors; and
promote co-worker and supervisor support for targeted health and safety behaviors.</description>
