      Objectives:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of RU-101 for 4 weeks in
           patients with severe dry eye

      Secondary

        -  To explore the efficacy of RU-101

        -  To explore optimal endpoints for future studies

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, multicenter, dose escalation, double-masked, placebo
      controlled study consisting of two stages. In Stage I, 3 cohorts are planned to evaluate
      escalating doses of RU 101 ophthalmic solution, instilled 6 times daily into each eye for 4
      weeks (28 days). Each cohort will comprise 4 patients randomized 3:1 to RU-101 or placebo. A
      masked safety data review will be performed prior to each dose escalation to determine if any
      dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred and to define the MTD or highest dose to be used in
      Stage II. In Stage II, an expanded cohort will receive the dose defined in Stage I (MTD or
      highest dose if MTD is not reached), instilled 6 times daily into each eye for 12 weeks (84
      days). The expanded cohort will comprise approximately 96 patients randomized 1:1 to RU-101
      or placebo, provided in a double-masked manner.

          2. Patients have had dry eye symptoms at least 4 months.

          3. Patients have the following signs in the worst eye:

               1. Corneal staining score with fluorescein staining ≥ 6/15 with at least one in the
                  central

             of RU 101, or any solutions planned for use in this study.

         13. Any significant chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator
             (PI), could interfere with the study parameters.

         14. Use of any investigational product or device within 30 days prior to the Screening
             Visit or during the study.

         15. Known history of alcohol and/or drug abuse within the past 12 months, which in the
             opinion of the PI could interfere with study compliance, outcome measures including
