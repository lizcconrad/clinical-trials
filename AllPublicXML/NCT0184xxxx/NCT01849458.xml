    <description>The primary objective is to report the number of participants with device associated adverse events.
Device associated adverse events are defined as adverse events that are classified as possibly or definitely related to the study product or procedure, or anticipated adverse events listed in the product's Instruction for Use regardless of relationship to the study device.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Functional Outcome - Adjusted Constant-Murley Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate clinical functional outcome Adjusted Constant-Murley Score. The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient.[1] The Constant-Murley score was introduced to determine the functionality after the treatment of a shoulder injury. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function. A score of 0 is considered the worst outcome and 100 is considered the best outcome.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Functional Outcome - WORC Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate clinical functional outcome WORC Index. This is a quality-of-life measurement specific for rotator cuff disease based on 21 questions answered using visual analog scales. It is organized in 5 subscales: physical symptoms, sprots/recreation, work, lifestyle, and emotions. Each item has a possible score from 0-100 where higher scores represent a lower quality of life. The scores are summed up to a possible 2100 points. The total number of points is subtracted from 2100, divided by 2100, then multiplied by 100 to create a percentage. The final score is thus a percentage ranging from 0 to 100 with higher percentages indicating better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Clinical Functional Outcome - Adjusted Constant-Murley Score</title>
        <description>Evaluate clinical functional outcome Adjusted Constant-Murley Score. The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient.[1] The Constant-Murley score was introduced to determine the functionality after the treatment of a shoulder injury. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function. A score of 0 is considered the worst outcome and 100 is considered the best outcome.</description>

        <title>Clinical Functional Outcome - WORC Index</title>
        <description>Evaluate clinical functional outcome WORC Index. This is a quality-of-life measurement specific for rotator cuff disease based on 21 questions answered using visual analog scales. It is organized in 5 subscales: physical symptoms, sprots/recreation, work, lifestyle, and emotions. Each item has a possible score from 0-100 where higher scores represent a lower quality of life. The scores are summed up to a possible 2100 points. The total number of points is subtracted from 2100, divided by 2100, then multiplied by 100 to create a percentage. The final score is thus a percentage ranging from 0 to 100 with higher percentages indicating better quality of life.</description>
