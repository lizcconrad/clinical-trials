  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actively developing stem cells (SCs) transplantation techniques cause natural interest to the
      problem of regeneration in the lungs. Numerous experimental studies proved the benefits of
      different types of SCs in experimental models of pulmonary emphysema (PE).

      G. Zhen et al. have shown that the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to rats
      with papain-induced emphysema leads to their migration into the lungs, differentiation into
      type 2 alveolocytes, and inhibition of apoptosis and prevention PE.

      K. Schweitzer et al. have proved the activity of inflammation in the airways, alveolocytes
      and endothelial cells apoptosis decreased after adipose SCs intravenous administration to
      mice with emphysema caused by chronic exposure to tobacco smoke or VEGF receptors blockade.
      The study of E.P. Ingenito et al. found that endobronchial installed MSCs engraft into the
      alveolar wall and peribronchial interstitium and release integrins, extracellular matrix
      components (collagen IV, laminin and fibrillin), platelet-derived growth factor receptor and
      transforming growth factor β2.

      Our study also found reliable deterrent effect of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs on the
      development of elastase-induced emphysema in rats at different terms of transplantation.

      After the success of pilot studies have started clinical trials. Currently, the website
      http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov reported three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      MSC transplantation in patients with COPD and emphysema. Two of them have already been
      completed and the results of the first pilot project published.

      Authors on the example of 4 patients showed a complete absence of adverse effects, improved
      quality of life and stability of functional parameters at 12 months after starting treatment
      One of the problems of MSC transplantation in patients with respiratory failure is an
      accelerated apoptosis of transplanted cells under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines
      and oxidative stress. Since it is proved that preconditioning MSCs under hypoxia increases
      their survival in hypoxic conditions, increases the expression of growth factors and
      antiinflammatory cytokines, we suppose that MSCs grown in hypoxic medium may have a
      significant positive effect on the disease.
