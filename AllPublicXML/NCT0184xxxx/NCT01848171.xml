  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothyroidism is a common clinical entity which is often complicated by dyslipidemia. It is
      also reported increased risk for incidence of atherosclerosis and resulting coronary heart
      disease(CHD), heart failure(HF) and cardiovascular(CV) death. The effect of L-thyroxine
      replacement treatment on serum lipid and atherosclerosis is controversial in hypothyroid
      patients, especially in those with mild or moderate subclinical hypothyroidism. The present
      study was designed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement was effective in improving
      serum lipid profiles and retarding atherosclerosis progress.
