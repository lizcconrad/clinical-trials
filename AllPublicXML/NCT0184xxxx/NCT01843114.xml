  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes and diabetes-associated complications is still increasing. Several
      major long-term complications of diabetes such as cardiovascular disease, chronic renal
      failure, diabetic retinopathy and others relate to the damage of blood vessels. Given that
      the eye provides the unique possibility in the human body to directly visualize blood
      vessels, much interest has been directed towards studying the ocular circulation. Although
      data of large epidemiological studies indicate that changes in retinal vessel caliber reflect
      other diabetes related factors, such as fasting glucose levels, there is still conflicting
      evidence on blood flow alterations in patients with diabetes. This is also related to the
      fact that up to now, methodological difficulties aggravate the assessment of blood flow
      changes in the retina in larger groups of patients. In the present study we propose to
      overcome this problem by using a technique called bi-directional Fourier Domain Doppler
      Optical Coherence Tomography (FDOCT), which we have developed in the recent years to measure
      retinal blood velocities. This technique allows for the non-invasive investigation of blood
      flow changes in human retina and will help us to better understand diabetes related vascular
      changes. The present study will use this technique to assess retinal blood flow changes in
      patients with diabetes and healthy subjects.
