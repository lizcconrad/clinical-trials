    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of
      electricity) reduces post-stroke shoulder pain. This study involves a device called the
      Smartpatch System. The Smartpatch System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the muscles
      in the shoulder. The Smartpatch System includes a small wire (called a &quot;Lead&quot;) that is placed
      through the skin into the muscle of the shoulder. It also includes a device worn on the body
      that delivers stimulation (called the Smartpatch Stimulator).

    <measure>Change From Baseline Shoulder Pain Intensity at End of Treatment (EOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment (4-weeks of Treatment/Control)</time_frame>
    <description>A diary was used in the study to capture daily worst shoulder pain intensity over a 7-day period. The diary included a pain intensity question asked each day to the subject. The pain intensity question is excerpted from the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form Question 3 (BPI-3) and is stated as &quot;please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours&quot;. BPI-3 is a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain. The median scores were calculated for each diary period. The median diary score at End of Treatment (EOT) was compared to the median baseline diary score to calculate the change in pain intensity. The group mean of the median scores for treatment was compared to the group mean of the medians scores for the control group at baseline and at EOT.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Device Related Adverse Event Rates in Treatment and Control Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks total - 4 weeks from baseline visit to EOT visit, followed by 12 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit following the baseline assessment, subjects were questioned if any changes in their medical status or condition had occurred. If the change was an adverse event, an adverse event form was completed by the site.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Shoulder Pain Interference at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment (4-weeks of Treatment/Control)</time_frame>
    <description>The degree to which shoulder pain interferes with daily activities was assessed using Question 9 of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-9) collected from the BPI Short Form administered during clinic visits. This question asks the subject to rate the degree to which their pain has interfered with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 is &quot;completely interferes&quot; within the last week. The mean of these seven scores will be calculated to obtain the pain interference score.</description>

    <measure>Durability of Change From Baseline Shoulder Pain Intensity at 12-weeks Beyond Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-wks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A diary was used in the study to capture daily worst shoulder pain intensity over a 7-day period. The diary included a pain intensity question asked each day to the subject. The pain intensity question is excerpted from the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form Question 3 (BPI-3) and is stated as &quot;please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours&quot;. BPI-3 is a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain. The median scores were calculated for each diary period. The median diary score at 12 weeks post-treatment was compared to the median baseline diary score to calculate the change in pain intensity. The group mean of the median scores for 12 weeks post-treatment was compared to the group mean of the median scores for the control group at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Quality of Life at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment (4-weeks of Treatment/Control)</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36v2) was administered at clinic visits to assess the impact of peripheral nerve stimulation on the subject's health-related quality of life. The SF-36v2 is a generic health survey designed to assess basic physical functioning and emotional well-being regardless of the disease or treatment. The 36 questions were grouped into two components: physical and mental. The survey was scored using norm-based scoring algorithm where a score of 0 indicates maximum disability and a score of 100 indicates no disability. Change in each component score was derived from End of Treatment score minus baseline score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Average Pain Intensity at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment (4-weeks of Treatment/Control)</time_frame>
    <description>A diary was used in the study to capture daily average shoulder pain intensity over a 7-day period. The diary included a pain intensity question asked each day to the subject. The pain intensity question is excerpted from the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form Question 5 (BPI-5) and is stated as &quot;please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain on the average&quot;. BPI-5 is a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain. The mean scores were calculated for each diary period. The mean diary score at End of Treatment (EOT) was compared to the mean baseline diary score to calculate the change in pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment (4-weeks of Treatment/Control)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale was administered at EOT to assess subject perception of overall improvement and patient preferences. The PGIC scale asks subjects to rate their improvement with treatment on a 7-point scale (centered at 4) that ranges from &quot;very much worse&quot; to &quot;very much improved&quot; relative to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Medication Usage at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment (4-weeks of Treatment/Control)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed 7-day diaries, in which they listed all pain medications they took during the 7 days. A blinded third party medication committee reviewed medications collected for each 7-day diary period and scored medication changes, in comparison to the baseline diary medications as &quot;no change&quot; (no change in dosage or change is not clinically meaningful to impact pain outcomes), &quot;increase&quot; (clinically meaningful increase in medication that would impact pain outcomes), or &quot;decrease&quot; (clinically meaningful decrease in medication that would impact pain outcomes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment (4-weeks of Treatment/Control)</time_frame>
    <description>The Blinded Evaluator rated each subject enrolled at their site using a question adapted from the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, known as the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I). For the CGI-I, a Blinded Evaluator was asked to rate the subject's total improvement compared to their condition at baseline. The CGI-I uses a 7-point scale (centered at 4) that ranges from &quot;very much worse&quot; to &quot;very much improved&quot;.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment began in March 2013 and was concluded in May 2015. Subjects were screened for the study from the available pool of candidates who presented to the Investigators with shoulder pain following stroke.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following informed consent and enrollment in the study, subjects were given a 7-day diary to complete at home. At the following visit, subjects were randomized once all eligibility criteria were met. Therefore it was possible for subjects to no longer meet eligibility criteria or drop out after enrollment, but prior to being randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline Shoulder Pain Intensity at End of Treatment (EOT)</title>
        <description>A diary was used in the study to capture daily worst shoulder pain intensity over a 7-day period. The diary included a pain intensity question asked each day to the subject. The pain intensity question is excerpted from the Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form Question 3 (BPI-3) and is stated as “please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours”. BPI-3 is a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain. The median scores were calculated for each diary period. The median diary score at End of Treatment (EOT) was compared to the median baseline diary score to calculate the change in pain intensity. The group mean of the median scores for treatment was compared to the group mean of the medians scores for the control group at baseline and at EOT.</description>

        <description>The degree to which shoulder pain interferes with daily activities was assessed using Question 9 of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-9) collected from the BPI Short Form administered during clinic visits. This question asks the subject to rate the degree to which their pain has interfered with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is “does not interfere” and 10 is “completely interferes” within the last week.

        <title>Durability of Change From Baseline Shoulder Pain Intensity at 12-weeks Beyond Treatment</title>
        <description>A diary was used in the study to capture daily worst shoulder pain intensity over a 7-day period. The diary included a pain intensity question asked each day to the subject. The pain intensity question is excerpted from the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form Question 3 (BPI-3) and is stated as &quot;please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours&quot;. BPI-3 is a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain. The median scores were calculated for each diary period. The median diary score at 12 weeks post-treatment was compared to the median baseline diary score to calculate the change in pain intensity. The group mean of the median scores for 12 weeks post-treatment was compared to the group mean of the median scores for the control group at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Quality of Life at End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36v2) was administered at clinic visits to assess the impact of peripheral nerve stimulation on the subject’s health-related quality of life. The SF-36v2 is a generic health survey designed to assess basic physical functioning and emotional well-being regardless of the disease or treatment. The 36 questions were grouped into two components: physical and mental. The survey was scored using norm-based scoring algorithm where a score of 0 indicates maximum disability and a score of 100 indicates no disability. Change in each component score was derived from End of Treatment score minus baseline score.</description>

        <description>Subjects completed 7-day diaries, in which they listed all pain medications they took during the 7 days. A blinded third party medication committee reviewed medications collected for each 7-day diary period and scored medication changes, in comparison to the baseline diary medications as “no change” (no change in dosage or change is not clinically meaningful to impact pain outcomes), “increase” (clinically meaningful increase in medication that would impact pain outcomes), or “decrease” (clinically meaningful decrease in medication that would impact pain outcomes).</description>

        <description>The Blinded Evaluator rated each subject enrolled at their site using a question adapted from the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, known as the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I). For the CGI-I, a Blinded Evaluator was asked to rate the subject’s total improvement compared to their condition at baseline. The CGI-I uses a 7-point scale (centered at 4) that ranges from “very much worse” to “very much improved”.</description>

        <description>Subjects who reported an reduction of at least 30% in either pain intensity or pain interference from baseline to End of Treatment (EOT) using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form.
The pain intensity score is excerpted from BPI question 3, worst pain, taken from 7-day diaries. This scale ranges from 0 representing no pain to 10 representing worst pain. The median diary score at EOT was compared to the median baseline diary score to calculate the percentage of subjects who had at least a 30% reduction in pain intensity.
Pain interference was assessed using BPI question 9. Subjects rated the degree to which their pain interfered with seven facets of daily life on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is “does not interfere” and 10 is “completely interferes”. The mean of these 7 scores was calculated to obtain the pain interference score. The score at EOT was compared to the baseline score to determine the percentage of subjects who had at least a 30% reduction in pain interference.</description>

        <description>The degree to which shoulder pain interferes with daily activities was assessed using Question 9 of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-9) collected from the BPI Short Form administered during clinic visits. This question asks the subject to rate the degree to which their pain has interfered with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is “does not interfere” and 10 is “completely interferes” within the last week. The mean of these seven scores was calculated to obtain the pain interference score. The score at End of Treatment (EOT) was compared to the baseline score to determine the percentage of subjects who had a clinically significant (30% or greater) reduction in pain interference.</description>

          <title>30% Reduction in Pain Interference From Baseline to End of Treatment (EOT)</title>
          <description>The degree to which shoulder pain interferes with daily activities was assessed using Question 9 of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-9) collected from the BPI Short Form administered during clinic visits. This question asks the subject to rate the degree to which their pain has interfered with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is “does not interfere” and 10 is “completely interferes” within the last week. The mean of these seven scores was calculated to obtain the pain interference score. The score at End of Treatment (EOT) was compared to the baseline score to determine the percentage of subjects who had a clinically significant (30% or greater) reduction in pain interference.</description>
