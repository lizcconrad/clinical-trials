      Determine the objective response rate in sarcoma patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and
      sirolimus.

      This study evaluates the daily morning single dose of hydroxychloroquine /sirolimus combined
      therapy in sarcoma patients. Study arm were treated with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg /sirolimus
      2mg gd for 8-wk therapy. Patients will be discontinued from the study after 8-wk observation
      period.

      Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into
      the study.

      TREATMENT PLAN:

        1. Both hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/tab and sirolimus 1 mg/tab are pills each are taken 2
           tablet orally every day. Treatment will be divided into time periods called cycles. Each
           treatment cycle is 28 days. The exception to this 28 day cycle is when participants
           start taking the pills for the first time. When the hydroxychloroquine and sirolimus
           begins, the first cycle of 28 days begins.

        2. There are several tests and procedures that will be performed at specific time periods
           during protocol treatment. These include: blood work, performance status assessment,
           questions about medical history and medications, tumor assessment with PET/CT or MRI
           and, eye exams.

        3. Dose modification criteria:

      Participants may continue to receive study treatment as long as they experienced grade 1 or 2
      side effects. The treatment drug will be 50% reduction of dose in any grade 3 toxicity; and
      discontinued of treatment (off-study) in any grade 4 toxicity or disease progression during
      treatment.

    <time_frame>2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A baseline whole-body [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) PET was performed before therapy initiation. Patients received 1 mg of Rapa and 200 mg of HCQ twice a day before a meal for 2 weeks. A second [18F]-FDG PET was performed after treatment completion. SUVs were calculated for all lesions. Regions of interest (ROI) were contoured to represent tumors (&gt;2 cm) and organs (lungs, spleen, and liver) on all transaxial and coronal slices. ROIs were normalized for injection dose and body weight, and the maximum voxel value was recorded for each region or organ. The highest SUV measured with increased uptake was considered the SUVmax. Correlative diagnostic CT examinations were used for accurate localization of the lesions. The most intense uptake at baseline was identified as the index lesion and evaluated for treatment response.</description>

Patients received 1 mg of Rapa and 200 mg of HCQ twice a day before a meal for 2 weeks. A second [18F]-FDG PET was performed after treatment completion. SUVs were calculated for all lesions. Regions of interest (ROI) were contoured to represent tumors (&gt;2 cm) and organs (lungs, spleen, and liver) on all transaxial and coronal slices. ROIs were normalized for injection dose and body weight, and the maximum voxel value was recorded for each region or organ. The highest SUV measured with increased uptake was considered the SUVmax.
