    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to evaluate, after implantation of a drug eluting stent (DES),
      coverage of the stent struts by new tissue. The evaluation will be performed by means of
      intravascular imaging technology (optical frequency domain imaging, OFDI). Renewed tissue
      coverage over the implanted stent struts prevents direct contact between blood and
      metal/polymer, which could lead to adverse events: patients need to take blood-thinning drugs
      to prevent these events. Ous new stent has drug and polymer only on the outside of the stent,
      and the polymer is degraded by the body leaving a bare metal stent after 3-4 months. This
      should allow fast coverage of the struts, and might allow to reduce duration of the
      supportive medical treatment. Our hypothesis is that &lt;20% of the struts remain uncovered at 3
      months after implantation, as assessed by OFDI.

      We will enroll patients with multiple coronary lesions, which, as is routine practice, will
      be treated with the new DES in 2 sessions (second one approximately 3-5 weeks after the first
      one). We will assess lesions by OFDI after the implantation and at the time of 3 months
      follow-up, when we will ask patients to undergo a coronary angiography. Patients will then
      have a follow-up contact at 1 year after initial implantation.
