    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Determine how well people tolerate sodium bicarbonate taken by mouth in higher doses
           than those usually given for heartburn.

        -  Determine if sodium bicarbonate can reduce cancer-related pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single institution Phase I/II study of sodium bicarbonate in combination with standard
      medical management for patients with moderate to severe tumor related pain.

      Patients with metastatic solid malignancies and patients with hematologic malignancies with
      moderate to severe tumor related pain on a stable opioid regimen will be the subjects of this
      study.

    <measure>Phase I - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks per participant</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the safety (Phase I) of oral Sodium bicarbonate capsules as an adjuvant pain reliever in patients with tumor related moderate to severe pain.
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral sodium bicarbonate capsules for patients with tumor related moderate to severe pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II - Percent of Participants With Desired Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the efficacy (Phase II) of oral Sodium Bicarbonate capsules as an adjuvant pain reliever in patients with tumor related moderate to severe pain.
Percent of patients with greater than 30% improvement in pain intensity by visual assessment scale at 4 weeks compared to baseline without a corresponding increase in opioid regimen. The response rate with 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Measurement Ranking</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be rated by the participant using a visual assessment scale (VAS) on a 0 to 10 scale. Mild Pain (1-4), Moderate Pain (5-6), Severe Pain (7-10). The change in pain between baseline and 4 weeks after treatment as measured by the VAS will be assessed using two-sided one-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, depending on whether normality assumption holds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The change in score between baseline and 4 weeks after treatment will be compared using two-sided one-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as appropriate.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have metastatic or unresectable solid malignancy or hematologic
             malignancy (multiple myeloma or lymphoma) and must have moderate to severe tumor
             related pain visual assessment scale (VAS)&gt;4) on a stable or no opioid regimen (at
