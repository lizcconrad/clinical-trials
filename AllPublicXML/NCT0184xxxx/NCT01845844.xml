      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of Intravitreally administered 0.3mg ranibizumab in
      subjects with persistent Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) after recent and frequent bevacizumab
      (at least 2 bevacizumab intravitreal injections within 2 months prior to enrollment and at
      least 6 bevacizumab injections within 9 months of enrollment).

      30 eyes will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio (Group A= 10 patients; Group B= 20 patients) Group
      A: (&quot;monthly group&quot;)- Consented patient with enrolled eye will receive 12 monthly required
      injections of 0.3mg ranibizumab over 1 year OR Group B: (&quot;As needed (PRN) Group&quot;)- Consented
      patient with enrolled eye will receive 6 monthly required injections of 0.3mg ranibizumab for
      6 months, followed by as needed (PRN) dosing (required ranibizumab if DME persistent on
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Early Treatment Diabetic Retina Study (ETDRS) Best
      Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) &lt;20/20) for 6 months.

          -  An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity loss would not improve from the resolution of macular edema

          -  History of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent
             other than bevacizumab within 9 months prior to randomization
