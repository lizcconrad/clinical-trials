    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the effectiveness of a Sun Protection Strategies
      workbook for kidney transplant recipients. Since the medication taken to preserve the kidney
      transplant puts kidney transplant recipients at an increased risk of developing skin cancer.
      The program will help people learn about how to practice effective sun protection after the
      transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive interview about the Sun Protection Strategies workbook will be performed with up to
      25 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) who have participated in past surveys. A second phase
      of the study involves 156 KTRs that will be asked to take part in a randomized controlled
      trial evaluating the fully developed sun protective strategies workbook.

      Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at risk to develop skin cancer. Adequate sun
      protection after transplantation can reduce the risk of developing skin cancer. In 2006, the
      National Kidney Foundation (NKF) found that sun protection education delivery and content
      varied among transplantation centers. Clinicians rarely knew when to initiate education about
      skin cancer risks and prevention including timing and scope, and rarely demonstrated
      understanding of the importance of reminders for and repeated education of patients (National
      Kidney Foundation 2006).

      Aims:

        1. To explore culturally sensitive use of terms describing ethnic cultural perceptions of
           sun burning, pigment darkening after sun exposure and description of skin color by the
           amount of photo-protective pigment in the skin.

        2. To pilot test the sun protection workbook with English speaking KTRs representing the 3
           ethnic groups: White, Black and Hispanic.

        3. To assess the effectiveness of an education intervention encouraging the use of sun
           protection strategies.

        4. To explore understanding of the importance of sun protection and the KTRs confidence in
           their being able to practice sun protection.
