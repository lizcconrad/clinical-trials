  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of
      omacetaxine and its metabolites in patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematologic
      malignancies or advanced solid tumors following subcutaneous (sc) administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, nonrandomized study to determine the
      pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of omacetaxine and its
      metabolites following a sc dosage of 1.25 mg/m2 in adult patients with relapsed and/or
      refractory hematologic malignancies or advanced solid tumors. The study consists of a
      screening period of up to 28 days, followed by a 7-day pharmacokinetic assessment period
      (period A) that includes administration of a single radiolabeled dose of omacetaxine, an
      open-label treatment period of up to six 28-day cycles (period B), and a final assessment to
      occur approximately 28±7 days after the end of the last treatment cycle. Period B will begin
      after collection of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic sample during period A.
