  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects on fertility. Obese women have lower pregnancy rate after infertility
      treatments.They need more doses of hormone during ovarian stimulation, more days for
      stimulation. During IVF treatment less oocytes are collected and the quality of embryo also
      harmed.

      The first line treatment for those women with obesity and infertility is weight loss.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that weight reduction improves ovarian reserve and fertility
      treatment outcome.
