  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      White blood cell membrane and surface structures are affected by the metabolic disorders and
      complications found in diabetes mellitus. Therefore, cellular activation, signal propagation,
      intracellular signaling as well as bactericidal effector functions are altered.

      When diabetic symptoms are corrected by the systemic intervention and treatment of the
      patients (Anti-diabetic Therapy/ADT, i.e. anti-diabetic medication, diet and dietetic
      supervision, physiotherapy and physical exercises), white blood cell functions will then
      normalize and reach the functionality comparable to those cells derived from healthy
      subjects.

      Gum diseases like periodontitis have long been associated with and termed complications of
      uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Vice versa, after diabetic conditions are corrected,
      periodontitis treatment will be proven effective, when oral hygiene regimen, full mouth
      decontamination (FD, i.e. the oral use of topical antiseptics prior and after professional
      mechanical tooth cleaning, tooth as well as root surface planing, polishing as well as gum
      and soft tissue decontamination in combination with systemic antibiotics) are performed. To
      reinforce gum healing, reinfection prevention (RP) as well as supportive periodontal therapy
      (SPT) will be administered by dental professionals on an individual basis and a detailed
      schedule.

      If periodontal pockets critical for participant's self care are not eliminated by FD
      including RP and SPT, and niches &gt;5mm after 6 month persist, patients are informed and
      offered surgical intervention as indicated for gum disease elimination.

      Dental follow up exams will be offered to all participants.

      Specific Aims

        1. To investigate if cytosolic Ca2+- ( delta[Ca2+]i) and pH (delta_pHi) signaling responses
           and bactericidal effector functions of PMN dependent upon the status of diabetic control
           and are reduced or increased when compared to age and gender matched controls

        2. To determine the biochemical basis for diabetic PMN alteration of motility as well as
           bactericidal functions: production of superoxide and release of elastase, respectively

        3. To characterize the molecular basis of the observed alterations in the regulation of
           cytosolic calcium (delta[Ca2+]i) and pH (delta_pHi) exhibited by diabetic PMN

        4. To investigate if the pre-activated state and altered bactericidal functionality of
           diabetic PMN are reversed when the patients' glycemic control is normalized, blood
           glucose levels as well as periodontal disease are corrected

        5. To evaluate, if systemic and periodontal intervention can lead to clinical attachment
           gain in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) at 6 and 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>CAL: Clinically and quantitatively, level of attachment is defined as the distance in mm from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) of the teeth to the bases of the periodontal pockets. Attachment gain may be found during healing or periodontal treatment procedures.</description>

    <measure>Probing Pocket Depth (PPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PPD: also called periodontal probing depth is defined as the distance in millimeters from the gingival margin to the base of the sulcus or periodontal pocket. It is measured on six surfaces/tooth (disto-buccal, mid-buccal, mesio-buccal, disto-lingual, mid-lingual, and mesio-lingual) of all teeth present using the pressure calibrated Florida probe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding on Probing (BOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BOP: will be determined by recording the presence or absence of bleeding following probing to determine pocket depth (PPD). This parameter will be expressed as % bleeding sites out of all examined sites in the dentition and will be documented with the Florida probe software.</description>

    <measure>Neutrophil Cytoplasmic pH (pHi)</measure>
    <time_frame>-3, 0 and 2 weeks; 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>pHi: ex vivo liganded neutrophil receptors initiate a series of signals, resulting in phagocytosis of an entity and release of the phagocyte granules' contents as well as oxidative products. The specific mechanisms by which these effector functions occur depend upon the receptor involved among [Ca2+]i is changes of pHi.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Release of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)</measure>
    <time_frame>-3, 0 and 2 weeks; 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ROS: these NADPH products are predominantly found within phagolysosomal compartments of the neutrophils. During phagocytosis, neutrophils may release ROS resulting in collateral tissue damage. The reactivity of ROS release will be assessed ex vivo after activation of chemoattractant as well as phagocytic receptors of the cells.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Release of Neutrophil Elastase (EA)</measure>
    <time_frame>-3, 0 and 2 weeks; 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>EA: residing in the azurophilic granules of the neutrophils, elastase is activated after phagolysosomal fusion; thence, in proximity to the engulfed entities it unfolds bactericidal activity by degrading valine-rich proteins. The elastolytic activity will be assessed ex vivo after chemoattractant as well as phagocytic activation of the neutrophils' receptors.</description>
