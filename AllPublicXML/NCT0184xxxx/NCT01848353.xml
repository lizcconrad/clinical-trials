  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among youth populations, American Indians have the highest prevalence of diabetes in the
      United States. This study will use exercise as the principal lifestyle modification approach
      to reduce the risk of diabetes in this population. The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma has several
      excellent, but underutilized wellness facilities in their Health Services Area in rural
      Southeast Oklahoma, a low socioeconomic region. It has been established that exercise lowers
      diabetes risk, and many overweight/obese, insulin resistant American Indian youth who live in
      this region would benefit from an increase in regular exercise. The challenge is to modify
      behavior so that routine exercise is established and maintained. The proposed study will test
      whether monetary incentives can elicit greater frequency and duration of exercise in American
      Indian youth when transportation and access barriers are reduced.

      Study participants in the intervention arm of the study will be asked to exercise on 3 days
      per week for 48 weeks. Clinical and physical assessments will be performed at baseline and
      after 16, 32 and 48 weeks. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups. Each group
      will receive payment for exercise sessions completed but one group will be on a fixed
      schedule of compensation and the other will have a schedule that incentivizes frequency or
      duration of exercise. In addition, two reference groups of age-matched participants who are
      normal weight and subclassified as having either low or high levels of physical activity and
      fitness will be tested. The reference groups will complete baseline tests and will not enter
      the exercise intervention program.

    <time_frame>at baseline (week 0) and weeks 16, 32, and 48.</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency and duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity will be measured using heart rate monitors. The monitors will be worn each exercise session. Participants are asked to complete 3 exercise sessions per week throughout the 48-week period of enrollment. The primary comparison between the experimental and active comparator groups will be the volume of exercise (total time) accumulated. Comparisons will be made for accumulated exercise volume at 16, 32, and 48 weeks and the change from baseline (week 0).</description>

    <description>Fasting blood glucose and insulin concentration will be measured and used to calculate the homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Testing will be performed at baseline (week 0) and weeks 16, 32, and 48. Data analysis will focus on the change from baseline and whether that change differs between groups.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>All participants will perform exercise training. Participants in this arm will receive a fixed amount of money for exercise session lasting at least 20 minutes during weeks 1-16 (phase 1). All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the experimental group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Standard payment, phase 2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>All participants will perform exercise training. Participants in this arm will receive a fixed amount of money for exercise session lasting at least 20 minutes during weeks 17-32 (phase 2). All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the experimental group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Ramp-down payment, phase 3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>All participants will perform exercise training. This phase will last from weeks 33-48 (phase 3). Participants in this arm will receive a fixed amount of money for exercise session lasting at least 20 minutes, but the value of the payments will decrease weekly (ramp-down) until reaching zero in week 41. All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the experimental group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Incentivized payment, phase 1</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>All participants will perform exercise training. Participants in this arm will receive an increasing amount of money when they increase exercise frequency (number of days) during weeks 1-16 (phase 1). All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the active comparator group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Incentivized payment, phase 2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>All participants will perform exercise training. Participants in this arm will receive an increasing amount of money when they exercise for longer than 20 minutes per session during weeks 17-32 (phase 2). All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the active comparator group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior</description>

    <arm_group_label>Raffle payment, phase 3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>All participants will perform exercise training. In weeks 33-48 (phase 3)participants in this arm will receive fewer financial incentives than in the prior 32 weeks but they will be delivered through a raffle system to utilize a variable reinforcement approach. All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the active comparator group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior.</description>

  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group of participants will complete only the baseline tests and assessments and will serve as a reference group. They will be selected to have low physical activity and fitness like the intervention group. Therefore differences in their results with the intervention group will reflect the effects of overweight/obesity on the variables of interest.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Normal weight, high activity group</arm_group_label>

    <description>This group of participants will complete only the baseline tests and assessments and will serve as a reference group. They will be selected to have higher physical activity and fitness than the intervention group. They will therefore serve as a healthy reference group and differences in their results with the intervention group will reflect the effects of both overweight/obesity and physical activity on the variables of interest.</description>
