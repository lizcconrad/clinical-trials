  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracotomy, is a surgical procedure performed routinely in connection with pulmonary
      surgery. Pain induced by thoracotomy is considered as the most severe post-operative pain.
      Control of the pain is essential in the perioperative management.

      Nowadays, there are several strategies to support this pain, including regional anesthesia
      techniques in the context of multimodal analgesia. Epidural analgesia reduces pain scores and
      respiratory complications significantly. ParaVertebral Block (PVB) is a technique as
      effective as epidural analgesia in the treatment of pain after thoracotomy and could present
      a more limited number of complications. However, there is no consensus on the best technique
      for realisation of PVB.

      Para-vertebral catheterisation can be performed by posterior approach in seeking a strength
      loss after bone contact of transverse vertebral process using the technique of Eason and
      Wyatt, but it is a blind technique. The ultrasonographic control, developed in the context of
      all puncture invasive actions, is an effective contribution to the realisation of a BPV, but
      still insufficiently validated. First used to measure the distance skin - posterior
      costo-transverse ligament and skin - parietal pleura before procedure, the ultrasonography
      has recently led to the publication of echo-guided techniques combining recognition of
      structures defining the space para- vertebral, viewing the progression of the needle and the
      spread of the local anesthetic. The handling of the ultrasonographic probe associated with
      the puncture requires additional learning.

      The objective of this project is to study the feasibility of para-vertebral catheter
      insertion under ultrasonographic control. The appearance like &quot;pigtail&quot; of the catheter, the
      most recently proposed, seems the more attractive in terms of safety. The aim of this pilot
      prospective study is accurately quantify all qualitative parameters related to the technique
      in order to achieve a future validation with a medico-economic component.

      Ultrasound-guided technique will correspond to a technique with a puncture of the lateral to
      medial space described by Shibata, after spotting of the first rib proposed by Bouzinac.

      This study will be proposed to patients undergoing thoracotomy for total or partial pulmonary
      resection in Thoracic Surgery service of Centre Jean Perrin, the number of patients required
      is 60 patients over a period of inclusion of 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective followed of cohort including consecutive patients, all receiving the same
      technique of anesthesia and analgesia:

        -  Preoperative para-vertebral catheterisation on the surgery side.

        -  Preoperative test of the efficiency of para-vertebral block.

        -  Conventional general anesthesia.

        -  Conventional rescue postoperative analgesia.

        -  Systematic radiographic control with injection of contrast product into the
           para-vertebral catheter.

        -  Conventional postoperative monitoring.
