  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HBV-related liver failure (HBV-LF), a dramatic clinical syndrome, is characterized with
      massive necrosis of liver cells. Liver transplantation might be the most effective therapy
      for HBV-LF. However, there are a lot of problems such as lack of donors, surgical
      complications, transplant rejection, and high cost, which could limit the application of
      liver transplantation. It is demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells could directionally
      differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in injured liver, as well as reduce
      inflammation of the liver by immune regulation. In this study, we assess the safety and
      efficacy of human bone marrow and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation for
      patients with HBV-LF.
