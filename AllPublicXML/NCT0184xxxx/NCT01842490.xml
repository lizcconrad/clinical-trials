      No serum biomarker has qualified for clinical use until now. However several biomarkers,
      especially markers of inflammatory or proteolytic activity seem to promising in the
      identification of vulnerable plaques. Moreover, recent study confirmed that contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound imaging(CEUS) can visualize intraplaque neovascularization and represent the
      plaque vulnerability. In this study we try to identify indicators through analysis of the
      relationship between plaque neovascularization seen by CEUS and well known biomarkers such as
      serum matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-2, MMP-9, cathepsin family(L,S,V), cystatin C,
      lipoprotein phospholipase A2, and hs-crp
