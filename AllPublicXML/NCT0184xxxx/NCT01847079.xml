      PROBIC

      Rationale: Procalcitonin measurements can reduce the number of blood cultures in the ICU.

      Objective: The investigators suggest that PCT is a marker for blood stream infection in all
      patients in the ICU in whom attending physicians/ intensivists order blood culturing in the
      suspicion of microbial infection. The investigators want to demonstrate that its use for
      guiding blood culturing is cost-effective and safe compared with blood cultures alone.

      Study design: Prospective, non- inferiority, multicenter, single-blinded, cluster- randomised
      cross-over clinical trial.

      Intervention (if applicable): The intensive care units will be allocated into two groups: a
      control group (blood culture) and the intervention group (procalcitonin).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Safety, expressed as mortality at day 28 and 90, with a
      mortality difference not exceeding a between groups difference of 10% by non-inferiority
      analysis.

      Cost-effectiveness, expressed in euro, calculated by deducting costs of procalcitonin testing
      from saved blood cultures compared with standard treatment spending on blood cultures in the
      control group.

      ICIS

      Rationale: The aim was to evaluate the Intensive Care Infection Score (ICIS) in predicting
      microbial infection and its sequelae in critically ill patients in whom attending physicians/
      intensivists order blood culturing in the suspicion of microbial infection.

      Objective: Because of the complexity of the pathophysiology of systemic inflammation it is
      unlikely that a single parameter will have sufficient diagnostic accuracy for infection.
      Therefore we will study combining parameters producing a diagnostic score.

      Study design: Prospective, multicenter, cohort trial. Supplement for the control arm of the
      ProBIC study.

      Intervention (if applicable): Blood is drawn for daily routine laboratory measurements and
      collected in K3EDTA aliqnots. The ICIS score is composed of five blood-cell derived
      parameters which can be extracted using the same aliqnots.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: To develop and evaluate a blood- cell derived score to
      enable the diagnosis of microbial infection, its likelihood, its invasiveness and severity.
