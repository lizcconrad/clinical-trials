      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of adavosertib when given together
      with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed or
      glioblastoma that has come back. Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving adavosertib, radiation
      therapy, and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with newly diagnosed or
      recurrent glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of adavosertib (AZD1775 [MK-1775]) in
      combination with the current standard of care (radiotherapy/temozolomide for concomitant
      therapy and temozolomide for adjuvant therapy) for treating patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma.

      II. To define the MTD of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in combination with 6 weeks of daily
      (Monday-Friday [M-F]) radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) administered at 75
      mg/m^2/day in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. (Arm 1) III. To define the MTD of
      AZD1775 (MK-1775) in combination with adjuvant TMZ administered at 150 mg/m^2/day-200
      mg/m^2/day for 5 days every 28 days in patients with glioblastoma after concurrent RT/TMZ.
      (Arm 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety profile of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in combination with RT and
      concomitant TMZ (Arm 1) and AZD1775 (MK-1775) with adjuvant TMZ (Arm 2) in patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      II. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in combination with
      upfront radiation/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the intratumoral concentration of AZD1775 (MK-1775) achieved in patients
      treated with the putative MTD.

      II. To characterize the time course of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in extracellular fluid within brain
      tumors following a single oral dose of drug by microdialysis.

      III. To characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of AZD1775 on tumor through
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of pRb (S807/811), proliferation (e.g. Ki-67), pCDC2,
      Wee1, and apoptosis (e.g. cleaved caspase 3) on resected tumors exposed to drug.

      IV. To characterize MGMT methylation and P53 pathway status, also P-gp and wee1 expression
      levels in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with standard therapy in
      combination with AZD1775 (MK-1775).

      V. To explore and analyze adaptive resistance mechanisms to AZD1775 using proteogenomics, and
      connect this data to spatially resolved drug distribution through targeted, imaging-based
      quantification of drug efficacy and tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INITIATION COURSE: Patients receive adavosertib orally (PO) on days 1, 3, and 5 or days 1-5
      weekly and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) for 6 weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent
      radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE COURSES: Beginning in week 10, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive adavosertib PO QD on days 1, 3, and 5 or 1-5 weekly, and
      temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
