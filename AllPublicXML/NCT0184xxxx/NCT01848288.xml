      The purpose of this study is to evaluate intra-operative phacoemulsification machine metrics
      after phacoemulsification with the CENTURION® vision system configuration compared with the
      INFINITI® vision system configuration.

    <measure>Cumulative Dissipated Energy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day), each eye</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative Dissipated Energy (CDE) is an estimation of the energy at the incision site experienced during the removal of cataractous lens and is measured in %-secs. The incision is defined as 5.6mm back from the cutting edge of the tip. A lower CDE indicates that less energy was present at the incision site.</description>

    <description>Aspiration fluid used is the amount of aspiration fluid used during the removal of the cataractous lens. A lower value indicates that less fluid was removed from the eye.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day), each eye</time_frame>
    <description>Aspiration Time indicated the amount of time the system was aspirating during the removal of the cataractous lens. A lower value indicates that the surgeon spent less time aspirating fluid and material from the eye during surgery.</description>
