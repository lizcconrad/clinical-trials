      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RAL-based regimen in
      treatment-experienced patients with resistant HIV infection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our study, both efficacy and safety of raltegravir(RAL)-based therapy will be assessed.
      300 treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistant HIV will be randomized to two arms
      (2:1). Group A (n=200) will be assigned with RAL-based regimen (RAL+TDF+LPV/r).Group B
      (n=100) will be assigned with current second-line regimen in China (3TC+TDF+LPV/r). Both
      virological and immunological profiles and responses at baseline and at week 4, 8, 12, 24,
      36, and 48 will be evaluated. This study will be the first large-scale, multicenter,
      randomized, prospective RAL-based therapy study in China for HIV/AIDs patients. The result
      will provide proves for further practical antiviral therapy for China or other
      resource-limiting countries.
