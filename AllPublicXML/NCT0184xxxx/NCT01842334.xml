      1. Compare the relative efficacy of ten weeks of once weekly 250 mg D-cycloserine (DCS) vs.
           placebo (both in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and nicotine
           replacement therapy (NRT) on reducing cigarette smoking in treatment-seeking
           nicotine-dependent outpatients.

        2. Compare the relative efficacy of ten weeks of once weekly 250 mg DCS vs. placebo on the
           process of extinction and the memory encoding process.

      The investigators will conduct a Stage 1 pilot feasibility study at McLean Hospital to
      develop a medication to treat nicotine dependence. In a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial, 40 nicotine-dependent participants ages 18-65 will receive
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) over a 10- week
      period, with half receiving D-cycloserine (DCS) pretreatment and half receiving placebo.
      Participants will receive either 250 mg DCS or placebo prior to weekly CBT sessions in
      addition to NRT over a 10-week treatment period. The investigators also aim to determine the
      effects of DCS on performance on neuropsychological tests. A 10-week treatment period will be
      followed by follow-up assessments including neuropsychological tests at 1 and 3 months
      post-treatment. Primary outcomes will include smoking as measured by carbon monoxide levels
      and self-report measurements.

        cigarettes per day and less than or equal to 20 cigarettes per day; 5) an expired carbon
        monoxide (CO) determination greater than or equal to 10 ppm over ambient values; 6) for
        women of childbearing age, a negative pregnancy test at screening with agreement to use
        adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and multiple subsequent pregnancy tests; 7)
        consent for us to communicate with their prescribing clinician; 8) furnish the names of 2
