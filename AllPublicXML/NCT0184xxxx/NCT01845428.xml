  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn if using statin in patients with nephrotic
      syndrome could lower the risk of blood clots. Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of signs and
      symptoms that occur when the glomeruli -the tiny filters that work in the kidney- leak
      protein in the urine.

      One of the symptoms associated with nephrotic syndrome is hyperlipidemia: too much bad
      cholesterol (LDL). This bad cholesterol could be linked to the increased risk of blood clots
      in patients with nephrotic syndrome. The study doctors would like to see if taking a statin
      drug to reduce the amount of bad cholesterol could reduce the risk of blood clots.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events are common in the nephrotic syndrome (NS) occurring in up
      to 30% of patients when systematically screened. The investigator proposes to explore a novel
      mechanism for the increased clot formation in NS. To date, the only consistently identified
      underlying risk factor for VTEs is severe hypoalbuminemia related to the NS. The underlying
      pathophysiology related to VTE in NS remains poorly understood and has previously been
      ascribed to dysregulation of pro- and anticoagulant clotting factors due to urinary protein
      losses and reflected by the low serum albumin. However, the direct evidence for this
      mechanism is inconsistent and relatively poor. Another feature of NS is that of severe
      hyperlipidemia which also correlates with hypoalbuminemia. In other severely hyperlipidemic
      states (e.g. Familial Hypercholesterolemia), the level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein
      (oxLDL) is markedly elevated. Forms of oxidized LDL interact with monocytes and macrophages
      leading to expression of Tissue Factor (TF), a procoagulant molecule. Furthermore, monocytes
      and macrophages activated in this fashion also release microparticles, small cell-membrane
      derived vesicles, that also express TF and participate in initiating intravascular clot
      formation. the investigator hypothesizes that the hyperlipidemia of the nephrotic syndrome
      leads to elevations in oxidized LDL and in turn, elevations in microparticle Tissue Factor
      (MP-TF) and its activity. The investigator also hypothesizes that serum albumin levels will
      inversely correlate with hyperlipidemia as well as oxLDL levels and MP-TF activity. Here, the
      investigator will study the effect of treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on
      ox LDL and MP-TF activity patients with NS.

    <description>The investigator will measure MP-TF activity . Microparticles will be isolated from platelet-free plasma (PFP) in a two-step sequential ultracentrifugation (20,000xg) process. Following the addition of Factor VIIa, Factor X and CaCl2, FXa generation is measured. Recombinant human relipidated TF will be used as a standard. TF-dependent plasma coagulation activity (PCA)generation is calculated by subtracting PCA generated in the presence of blocking antibodies from the amount of total PCA generated in the presence of an IgG control. The use of MP-TF activity as an outcome measure is unique in that it reflects both the pathophysiology and is a measure of PCA that correlates with VTE events</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and week6</time_frame>
    <description>the investigator will also perform other more routine measures of plasma coagulation activation to determine the overall effect of hyperlipidemia in NS that may include TF-independent mechanisms.
Thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) also provide information regarding the downstream effect of Tissue Factor in the coagulation cascade.
