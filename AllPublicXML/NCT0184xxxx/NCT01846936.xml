  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One lung ventilation (OLV) is accomplished with a double lumen tube (DLT) or a bronchial
      blocker (BB). In this study, the investigators compared the effectiveness of lung collapse
      using DLT, BB with spontaneous collapse, and BB with disconnection technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In selecting this maneuver of OLV, lung collapse is a major concern because it permits
      adequate surgical exposure. Although once lung deflation was achieved, the overall clinical
      performance appears to be similar, BB takes longer to deflate the operative lung and there is
      some conflict reports as to BB provides a similar degree of lung deflation compared to that
      of DLT.

      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of BB and DLT for achieving lung collapse,
      and to evaluate the efficacy of disconnection technique with monitoring the carbon dioxide
      trace on a capnograph in BB. The investigators further evaluated the disconnection time,
      which is the time to loss of carbon dioxide trace on the capnograph, needed to facilitate
      lung collapse.

    <description>The degree of lung collapse after 5 min from the start of OLV. The degree of lung collapse was assessed using a lung collapse score (0 = no collapse, to 10 = complete collapse) by one thoracic surgeon. The surgeon who assessed the lung collapse was absent from the operating room during DLT or BB placement and was blinded to the airway device.</description>

    <time_frame>The time to loss the carbon dioxide trace on the capnograph (30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>Before initiating OLV in group 3, we turned-off the ventilator and fully opened the adjustable pressure limiting valve allowing both lungs to collapse. And then, the time which capnograph lose the carbon dioxide curve is considered the disconnection time required for both lungs to collapse before initiating one lung ventilation.</description>

The BB cuff is inflated with air under FOB vision with the volume necessary to seal the bronchus and initiate one lung ventilation. And then, dependent lung is ventilated.</description>
