      extended-release (ER) as a potential smoking cessation aid in treatment-seeking smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine dependence is a major public health problem and currently available treatments are
      ineffective for the majority of smokers. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and test
      new medications to aid in smoking cessation. Recent evidence from a genetic study of
      prospective smoking cessation conducted at the CIRNA suggested smoking cessation may be
      influenced by variationin acetylcholine levels. The proposed proof-of-concept study is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm pilot study of the effects of the
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine (vs. placebo), on short-term abstinence among 24
      treatment-seeking smokers. The primary outcome is the number of days abstinence a 7 day quit
      attempt. Secondary outcomes include: smoking rate during the run-up and monitored abstinence
      phase, medication adherence, side effects, cognitio, and smoking urges and other withdrawal
      symptons. The pilot data generated will be used to support an NIH grant application by a new
      investigatot to evaluate whether acetylcholinesterase inhibitors could be effective smoking
      cessation medications.
