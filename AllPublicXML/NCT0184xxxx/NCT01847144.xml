  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Response to treatment in Type 2 Diabetes is highly variable; the same medicine may have
      little effect in one person but a large effect in another. Understanding mechanisms of
      altered response to treatment could aid treatment selection and assist the design of new
      medications with lower nonresponse rates.

      This study will examine the physiological mechanisms and potential clinical/biomarker
      predictors of altered response to sulphonylurea and DPPIV inhibitor glucose lowering
      medication and answer fundamental methodological questions for the future study of variation
      in treatment response in Type 2 Diabetes. Participants will withdraw sulphonylurea therapy
      for up to 2 weeks with assessment of baseline characteristics and glycaemic response.
      Participants will then enter an optional extension where they receive sulphonylurea or DPPIV
      inhibitor therapy in crossover fashion.

      Participants will withdraw sulphonylurea therapy for up to 2 weeks (part 1) followed by an
      optional cross-over extension (part 2)where they are randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with
      Gliclazide (DPP-IV thera) or Sitagliptin (sulphonylurea), followed by 4 weeks of the second
      treatment with a 2 week wash-out period in between.

      Part 1 will allow assessment of response rates to long standing sulphonylurea treatment in
      clinical practice and potential predictors of this, as well as whether a very brief period (1
      week) of treatment withdrawal is a valid assessment of an individual's response to therapy.
      Part 2 will allow comparison of the approach in part one with response to the same treatment
      in a trial setting and will allow assessment on whether response is consistent across
      therapies with different mechanisms of action.
