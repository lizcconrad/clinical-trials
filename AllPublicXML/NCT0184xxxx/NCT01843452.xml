  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence of a role of EGFR, treatment with EGFR-inhibitors in anal cancer
      and synergies of EGFR-inhibitors with radiotherapy. Addition of the human anti-EGFR antibody
      Panitumumab to chemoradiotherapy seems therefore solidly justified. This trial investigates
      concurrent panitumumab/capecitabine/mitomycin concurrent to IMRT-radiotherapy. Treatment
      components used in this study have been selected on scientific rationale. The trial regimen
      should be feasible with acceptable toxicity and outcome similar to historic series.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      -To assess efficacy of treatment regimen composed of capecitabine, mitomycin, panitumumab,
      and radiotherapy in terms of locoregional control rate in patients with stage II-IIIB
      squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal.

      Secondary:

        -  To further assess efficacy of this regimen based on complete response (CR) rate,
           colostomy-free survival, functional colostomy-free survival, overall survival (OS), and
           progression-free survival (PFS).

        -  To assess the tolerability and safety profile of this regimen.

        -  To assess the role of PET for staging and outcome prediction (for those patients who had
           PET following local standards).
