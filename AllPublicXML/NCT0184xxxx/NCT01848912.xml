  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a way of detecting infection earlier in patients
      receiving bone marrow transplant. This is accomplished by continuous individualized
      monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature variability in this patient
      population. The investigators are collecting data to determine whether or not subtle
      differences in heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature will help physicians to detect
      infection earlier in order to begin faster treatment before a patient's condition
      deteriorates. Blood tests will also be performed to check for certain biomarkers that may
      indicate infection

    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational study, patients receiving bone marrow transplant are
      selected for continuous monitoring of heart rate, respiratory and temperate variability. Data
      is collected as per standard practice using the Zephyr Biopatch device, a highly compact
      wireless monitor with two small gel electrodes, that is much more comfortable than previous
      belt/strap-based monitoring devices.

      The patient is asked to wear the Zephyr Biopatch device for approximately 23 hours a day,
      beginning the day before he/she begins bone marrow transplant. The patient is asked to
      continue wearing the device for a period of up to 10 days or until he/she is no longer
      experiencing any fever. The Zephyr Biopatch device records heart rate, respiratory rate and
      temperature for calculation of heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate variability
      (RRV) and temperature variability (TV) using the Continuous Multiorgan Individualized
      Variability Analysis (CIMVATM) software engine. The variability outcomes will look at the
      presence, rapidity and severity of change in variability prior to the onset, diagnosis and
      treatment of infection. Bloodwork will also be performed to check for certain biomarkers that
      may indicate infection.
