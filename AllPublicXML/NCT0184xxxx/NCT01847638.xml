        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are male or female at least 18 years of age who require cataract surgery and no other
             surgical procedures during the cataract surgery.

          -  Agree not to have any other ocular surgical procedures in the study or fellow (non
             study) eye within 15 days prior to the initiation of dosing with the test article or
             throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Have a Best Corrected Visual Acuity of 20/200 or better in either eye.

          -  Are able to self administer test article (or have a caregiver available to instill all
             doses of test article).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have known hypersensitivity to bromfenac, nepafenac, loteprednol or any component of
             the test article (including &quot;procedural&quot; medications such as anesthetic and/or
             fluorescein drops, dilating drops, etc.).

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to salicylates (i.e., aspirin) or NSAIDs (nonsteroidal
             antiinflammatory drug).

          -  Have intraocular inflammation (i.e., cells or flare in the anterior chamber as
             measured on slit lamp examination) in study eye at screening visit.

          -  Have a known blood dyscrasia or bone marrow suppression, a diagnosis of
             uncontrolled/unstable peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or ulcerative
             colitis, or any uncontrolled/unstable pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, autoimmune,
             hepatic, renal, or central nervous system disease.

          -  Have used ocular, topical, or systemic NSAIDs or ocular, topical, or systemic
             gentamicin, or cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion within 7 days prior to initiation of
             dosing with the test article or throughout the duration of study,with exception of
             allowing patients on a stable dose of aspirin 81 mg daily or less.

          -  Have used ocular prostaglandins within 30 days prior to initiation of dosing with test
             article or throughout the duration of study.

          -  Have active corneal pathology noted in the study eye at screening visit. Active
             corneal pathology is defined as corneal pathology that is non stable, or greater than
             mild, or will compromise assessment of the safety or efficacy of treatment.
             Superficial punctate keratitis in study eye.

          -  Have any extraocular/intraocular inflammation in the study eye at screening visit
             (blepharitis allowed if mild only, and no concurrent conjunctivitis or lid
             erythema/edema) or ongoing, unresolved uveitis.

          -  Have used topical, ocular, inhaled or systemic steroids within 14 days prior to
             screening.

          -  Have had radial keratotomy, corneal transplant, or corneal refractive surgery in the
             study eye within the last two years.

          -  Have a history of abuse of alcohol/drugs within six months prior to the screening
             visit.

          -  Are pregnant or nursing/lactating.

          -  Have participated in any other study of an investigational drug or device within 30
             days prior to randomization.
