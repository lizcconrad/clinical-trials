    <textblock>
      This study will assess the pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      indacaterol maleate (QAB149), administered via the EPIC test fixture. The study aims to
      determine whether the novel device has a similar clinical profile as the established concept

    <time_frame>Days 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second.

    <time_frame>Days 1, 2, 3, 4</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. FEV1/FVC represents the proportion of the total amount of air that is exhaled from the lungs during the first second of forced exhalation. FEV1/FVC was measured at each timepoint up to 4 hours on Days 1 and 3 and 23hours 10mins and 23hours 45 mins on Days 2 and 4.</description>
