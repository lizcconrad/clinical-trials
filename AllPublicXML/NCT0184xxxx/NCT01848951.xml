  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to examine this rational by comparing the infiltrative
      transversusabdominis plane (TAP) block with liposomal bupivacaine to EA in major abdominal
      surgery . The efficacy of the TAP block for abdominal surgery is well documented in the
      literature (McDonnell 2007) (Kadam 2011), but there are no studies utilizing long-acting
      bupivacaine. The investigators believe the primary outcome will demonstrate no difference
      between the two in terms of pain scores and opioid consumption. The investigators anticipate
      that patients who have undergone TAP blocks will have improved secondary outcomes with
      respect to a decreased costs, urinary retention, and hypotension.

    <description>The skin will be disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine. Under sterile technique, the epidural will be placed.Epidural catheter will be placed at thoracic vertebral levels T5 to T10. Level chosen as clinically indicated. The epidural solution should contain UNMCs standard solution of Bupivicaine 0.05% and hydromorphone 10 mcg/cc. However, solution type should be clinically indicated.</description>

    <description>The skin will be disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine. The bilateral dual TAP infiltrative blocks will be placed using high-frequency ultrasound.2.The TAP blocks will be performed using lipospheric bupivacaine (Exparel) with the following dosing regimen.A 266mg (20cc) vial of lipospheric bupivacaine will be equally into 2 30 ml syringes using strict sterile technique. The solution will be diluted in each syringe with 20cc preservative free sterile 0.9% normal saline to a total volume of 30 ml in each syringe. Once the transversus abdominal plane is identified then a 5-10 ml of plain 0.9% normal saline will be injected to open the fascial plane. Once the plane is opened then the 15cc of diluted lipospheric bupivacaine will be administered under direct ultrasound visualization in all 4 TAP quadrants ( subcostal position x2 and lateral position x2)</description>
