      Phase I Study

        -  to determine and compare the safety of single ascending doses of POL6326 by intravenous
           infusion

        -  to determine the relationship between 2-hour single intravenous infusion doses of
           POL6326 and the concentration of HSC and mature WBC in peripheral blood using
           immunophenotypic assays.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Mobilization and collection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) using G-CSF at least 6
             weeks but less than 6 months prior to protocol enrollment.

             for stem cell donation.

          4. Subject must be eligible for normal blood donation according to requirements for IDMs
             as laid out by national law for blood donors.

          5. Ability to comprehend the investigational nature of the study and provide informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:
