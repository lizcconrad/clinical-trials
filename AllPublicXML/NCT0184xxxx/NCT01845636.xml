  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Odor identification deficits, which are a result of early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology
      in the olfactory bulb and tract as well as olfactory projection areas in the medial temporal
      lobe (entorhinal and piriform cortex and hippocampus), lateral and central orbitofrontal
      cortex and several other regions, occur in AD and strongly predict mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) conversion to AD. Our pilot data, along with converging findings in the literature,
      suggests that odor identification deficits, both incremental change over time and change in
      response to an anticholinergic challenge, may be clinically simple, relatively inexpensive,
      predictors of cognitive improvement with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ACheI) treatment
      with potential clinical implications for predicting improvement and monitoring ACheI therapy.

      In this clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate, treat and follow a broad sample of
      60 adult patients with amnestic MCI at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia
      University Medical Center. Recruitment will be from clinics and/or advertisements. In the
      protocol, all 60 amnestic MCI patients will receive baseline memory and olfactory assessments
      and begin treatment with donepezil. Patients will be followed for a total of 1 year. During
      this time, patients will be monitored closely by the study physician and will receive memory
      and olfactory assessments at weeks 8, 26, and 52. In addition, an olfactory challenge test
      will be done at baseline.

      This project will be of value in the selection of patients with mild cognitive impairment for
      treatment based on the evaluation of olfaction tests to predict response to donepezil and
      other ACheI. Since mild cognitive impairment is widespread and Alzheimer's disease represents
      a major public health problem, this study has considerable public purpose and significance.

    <measure>Selective Reminding Test (SRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 8, Week 26, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Selective Reminding Test (SRT) is a 12-item test of verbal learning and memory. To administer, the researcher will read aloud a list of 12 words. The participant repeats each word aloud to ensure that the word was heard correctly. Immediately following the reading of all 12 words, the participant is asked to recall as many words as possible within the one minute time limit. The participant is then reminded of the words they did not say and asked to recall the list again. This process is repeated for 6 trials. The total immediate recall is the total number of words recalled by the participant from all 6 trials. This is the number that is reported. Lower scores indicate fewer words recalled and a poorer performance.</description>

    <measure>Total Number of Errors Measured Using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 8, Week 26, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) is a cognitive battery that assesses learning, memory, language production, language comprehension, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, and orientation. The ADAS-Cog is not a timed test and the participant's score does not depend on how rapidly the test is completed. The ADAS-Cog total score is based on the total number of errors made in the test by the participant. Therefore, a lower total score indicates a higher cognitive performance. The total score ranges from 0 to 95 and is determined by summing the errors from 12 subscales. The total score, indicating number of errors made, is the number that is reported at each timeframe.</description>

    <description>FAQ is a widely used 10-item instrument that takes 3 minutes to administer and focuses on instrumental, social and cognitive functioning. The instrument assesses the patient's current ability, at the point of testing and through the past month, in these various domains. The total score is described as the cumulative scores of each item, ranging from &quot;0 - No help needed&quot; to &quot;3 - No, unable to do.&quot; More impairment is indicated by higher scores.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of Everyday Cognition (Ecog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 26, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument has 40 items, takes 20 minutes to administer, and focuses on functional correlates of cognitive deficits. This assessment asks the study informant to rate the participant's ability to perform certain tasks with the domains of Memory, Language, Visual-spatial and Perceptual Abilities, Executive Functioning: Planning, Executive Functioning: Organization, and Executive Functioning: Divided Attention. The informant is asked to compare functioning from 10 years prior to the time of testing. The Everyday Cognition measure uses the sum score of all of the subscales, and the items are reverse coded (i.e., 1= &quot;Better or no change&quot;, 2=&quot;Questionable/occasionally worse&quot;, 3=&quot;Consistently a little worse&quot;, 4=&quot;Consistently much worse&quot;), meaning that lower scores are better.</description>

          <title>Selective Reminding Test Total Recall Score</title>
          <description>The Selective Reminding Test (SRT) is a 12-item test of verbal learning and memory. To administer, the researcher will read aloud a list of 12 words. The participant repeats each word aloud to ensure that the word was heard correctly. Immediately following the reading of all 12 words, the participant is asked to recall as many words as possible within the one minute time limit. The participant is then reminded of the words they did not say and asked to recall the list again. This process is repeated for 6 trials. The total immediate recall for all 6 trials is the number that is reported.</description>

        <title>Total Number of Errors Measured Using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)</title>
        <description>The modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) is a cognitive battery that assesses learning, memory, language production, language comprehension, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, and orientation. The ADAS-Cog is not a timed test and the participant's score does not depend on how rapidly the test is completed. The ADAS-Cog total score is based on the total number of errors made in the test by the participant. Therefore, a lower total score indicates a higher cognitive performance. The total score ranges from 0 to 95 and is determined by summing the errors from 12 subscales. The total score, indicating number of errors made, is the number that is reported at each timeframe.</description>

        <description>This instrument has 40 items, takes 20 minutes to administer, and focuses on functional correlates of cognitive deficits. This assessment asks the study informant to rate the participant's ability to perform certain tasks with the domains of Memory, Language, Visual-spatial and Perceptual Abilities, Executive Functioning: Planning, Executive Functioning: Organization, and Executive Functioning: Divided Attention. The informant is asked to compare functioning from 10 years prior to the time of testing. The Everyday Cognition measure uses the sum score of all of the subscales, and the items are reverse coded (i.e., 1= &quot;Better or no change&quot;, 2=&quot;Questionable/occasionally worse&quot;, 3=&quot;Consistently a little worse&quot;, 4=&quot;Consistently much worse&quot;), meaning that lower scores are better.</description>

            <description>Atropine nasal spray is administered at baseline for the atropine challenge which involves administration of the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) immediately before and 45 minutes after atropine administration. Immediately after the atropine challenge, donepezil treatment is started and continues for 52 weeks.
Donepezil: Donepezil 5mg will be given for 4 weeks and if tolerated, the dose will be increased to 10 mg per day. The dose range of 5 to 10 mg of donepezil per day will be continued for the study duration, and this is the recommended dose for donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
Atropine: A single acute dose of 1 mg of atropine nasal spray is administered to the nostril. The dose chosen reflects clinical doses typically used by Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) physicians.</description>
