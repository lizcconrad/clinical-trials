  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of a computer-facilitated Screening and
      Brief Intervention system adapted for Military use (cSBI-M) in reducing substance use among
      18- to 25-yr-old U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps personnel (USN/USMCs). The aims and
      hypotheses of this project are to: 1)Test the effects of cSBI-M on any alcohol use.
      Hypothesis: Among 18- to 25-yr-old USN/USMCs coming for routine health screenings, those
      receiving cSBI-M will have lower rates of any alcohol use at follow-ups compared to TAU. 2)
      Test the effects of cSBI-M separately as a preventive, early therapeutic, and risk-reduction
      intervention. Hypotheses: (a) Among 18- to 25-yr-old non-drinking USN/USMCs (negative history
      of past-12-months drinking at baseline), those receiving cSBI-M will have lower rates of
      drinking initiation and heavy episodic drinking (HED, a.k.a. &quot;binge&quot; drinking). (b) Among 18-
      to 25-yr-old drinking USN/USMCs, those receiving cSBI-M will have higher rates of drinking
      cessation, reduced intensity of drinking (e.g., past-3-months drinking days, HED, and driving
      after drinking or riding with a drinking driver.(3) Test the effects of cSBI-M on tobacco
      use; explore its effects on other drug use. (4) Assess potential moderators (e.g., age,
      gender, race/ethnicity, substance use history +/-, parent/sibling/peer substance use),
      mediators (e.g., Patient to Provider Connectedness,17 perceived harmfulness of alcohol and
      drug use), and explore cSBI-M's mechanism of action. Hypotheses: among 12- to 18-yr-old
      patients coming for routine care, those receiving c-ASBI will have 1) lower rates of any
      alcohol use, of drinking initiation and riding with a driver who has been drinking, and 2)
      higher rates of drinking cessation, reduced intensity of drinking, heavy episodic drinking
      and driving after drinking or riding with a driver who has been drinking.

      Hypothesis: Among 18- to 25-yr-old USN/USMCs coming for routine health screenings, those
      receiving cSBI-M will have lower rates of any alcohol use at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month
      follow-ups than Treatment As Usual (TAU). 2) Test the effects of cSBI-M separately as a
      preventive, early therapeutic, and risk-reduction intervention. Hypotheses: (a) Among 18- to
