      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CNTO 1959
      following subcutaneous administration in participants with palmoplantar pustulosis.

    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind (participants and study personnel will not know the identity of
      the treatments given), multicenter study that is placebo-controlled (a placebo is identical
      to a study treatment, but has no active ingredients). Participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 2 treatment groups (CNTO 1959 or placebo). The total duration of participation will
      be approximately 30 weeks, including a screening period of about 6 weeks before dosing.
      Participant safety will be monitored throughout the study.
