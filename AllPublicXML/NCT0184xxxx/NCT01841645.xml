  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) from
      dairy products on fatty acid metabolism and human health. A CLA depletion-repletion study was
      carried out with healthy volunteers. CLA depletion was achieved through an eight-week dairy
      fat restriction, followed by an eight-week repletion period consisting of intake of a butter
      naturally enriched with CLA. Changes in body composition, fasting glucose and insulin,
      inflammatory mediators, cell membranes' stability, plasma lipid levels and fatty acid
      composition of lipid classes are evaluated after depletion and repletion phases.

      After collecting baseline blood samples, CLA-depletion phase started with dietary
      orientation, by a registered dietitian, to the study subjects (n=29) to exclude from their
      diets any type of dairy fat for the following 8 weeks. Blood samples were taken at the end of
      CLA-depletion, and CLA-repletion phase was initiated by dietitians' instructions: volunteers
      returned to their regular diets, and additionally consumed a CLA-enriched butter for another
      8-week period. Blood samples were taken at the end of the CLA-repletion phase. The effects of
      CLA on the following parameters were evaluated: inflammatory mediators; fatty acid
      composition of erythrocytes, plasma phospholipids and cholesterol esters; body composition;
      clinical factors associated with the metabolic syndrome and indicators of cell membranes'
      stability.
