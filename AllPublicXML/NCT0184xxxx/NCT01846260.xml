  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy is an important reported post-treatment
      side-effect among breast and other cancer survivors. As some patients report cognitive
      complaints before the administration of their therapy, some authors suggest an association
      with psychological risk factors such as distress. Distress, a multifactorial unpleasant
      emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioral and emotional), social and/or
      spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to cope with cancer effectively, its
      physical symptoms and its treatment, can easily be assessed by the Distress Thermometer.

      In this trial we aim to determine if the Distress Thermometer, accompanied by the 38-item
      Problem List, could predict cancer-related cognitive impairment in patients with hematologic
      malignancies, and in patients with gynecological, urological, breast, lung or
      gastro-intestinal cancer receiving curative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, radiochemotherapy,
      anti-hormonal or targeted therapy.

      Design: Prospective, observational study. All cancer patients of the above mentioned cancer
      types receiving an anticancer treatment with curative intent will be asked to participate to
      this study. Consenting patients will undergo serial assessment at baseline, and 6 months
      after inclusion. Patient will be screened by the Distress Thermometer and 38-item Problem
      List followed by a neuropsychological assessment and self-assessment tools.

        The study population consist of newly diagnosed cancer patients of all ages (â‰¥18 years),
        presenting with a solid tumour (lung, gastro-intestinal, GIST, urological, prostate,
        breast, sarcoma or gynecological cancer) or hematologic malignancy, in an early or advanced
        stage, eligible for systemic treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, radiochemotherapy,
        radiobiotherapy, anti-hormonal or targeted therapy) with curative intent.

          -  Patients should have reached a minimum age of 18 years at the time of enrolment

          -  Newly detected histologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid (lung, gastro-intestinal,
             GIST, urological, prostate, breast, sarcoma or gynecological cancer) or hematologic
             malignancy

          -  Patients should receive a treatment with curative intent based on the investigator's
             judgment or have an expected median overall survival of at least 5 years
