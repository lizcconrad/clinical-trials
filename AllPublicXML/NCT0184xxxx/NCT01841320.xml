  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research examines the effectiveness of an intervention that employs seek, test, and
      treat strategies for Vietnamese injection drug users (IDU) and their network members, by
      ensuring that high risk individuals are sought for HIV testing and promptly referred to and
      maintained on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV prevention interventions are provided to IDUs
      who test HIV-negative, as well as those who test HIV-positive. HIV-positive IDUs will be
      referred to HIV care through a two-arm randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of
      different levels of engagement in care on ART uptake, ART adherence, and treatment outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid injection and HIV infection are major public health problems in Vietnam. Injection
      drug users (IDUs) have a high burden of HIV infection (20% HIV prevalence, nationally; 6%
      mortality per year) and the high rate of HIV transmission continues (HIV incidence, 5% per
      year). The investigators propose an intervention that employs the seek, test, and treat
      strategies for the IDU population and their network members, by ensuring that high risk
      individuals are sought for HIV testing, promptly referred to and maintained on ART, while HIV
      prevention interventions provided to the many who test HIV-negative, as well as those who
      test HIV-positive. The intervention will seek and test IDUs and their network members in the
      community, particularly those who are recently released from drug treatment centers.
      HIV-positive IDUs will be referred to HIV care through a two arm randomized controlled trial
      to compare the effects of different levels of engagement in care on ART uptake,
      antiretroviral adherence, and treatment outcome.
