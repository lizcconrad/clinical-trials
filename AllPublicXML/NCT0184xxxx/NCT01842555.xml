  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The data elements for the PDT Registry project include virtually all the elements in the
      standard hospital-based cancer registry record, although in some cases at a finer level of
      detail. All data points should be found in the participant's medical record. The principal
      difference between the PDT Registry data set and that collected by the registries is the
      inclusion of more information specific to PDT.

      Participating centers will need to describe its own mechanism for patient identification and
      eligibility screening. A data manager, identified by the Principal Investigator at each
      participating center, will screen all patients for eligibility. Appointment, diagnosis and
      treatment data will be reviewed using information such as clinic records, appointment lists,
      pathology department records, OR schedule and/or tumor registries. Patients meeting inclusion
      criteria will be enrolled in the 3-year registry which will comprise retrospective and
      prospective parts. Patients will be accrued retrospectively for the first 12-month period of
      the registry. The retrospective part will include patients who received PDT with Photofrin速
      from 2007 up to 2012. Patients who are eligible but die prior to enrollment will also be
      included to minimize bias resulting from non-inclusion of advanced stage patients. The
      prospective recruitment parts will be three years. The estimated length of follow-up for each
      patient will be 3 years. Follow-up will be conducted by research study staff at each
      institution via medical record review, under the direction of the Principal Investigator at
      that site. No patients will be contacted at any point to obtain study data or for follow-up.
