  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is a unique sedative medication able to provide sedation without causing
      respiratory depression and maintaining neurological functions. Patients having an acute
      ischemic stroke and need to undergo endovascular therapy require constant assessment of their
      neurological status prior, during and after the interventional procedure. In this study the
      investigators will compare the efficacy of Dexmedetomidine to other standard sedative
      medications in providing optimal sedative effect while maintaining neurological function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Precedex is a unique FDA-approved intravenous medication for conscious sedation in that it
      allows for &quot;arousable&quot; sedation, which is particularly appealing for use in patients with
      compromised neurologic function. While Precedex has been shown to be equivalent, if not
      superior to, conventional sedation in the procedural setting, it has not yet been evaluated
      in the setting of endovascular treatment of acute stroke. This setting is particularly ripe
      for evaluation, as there is currently controversy over the best method for management of
      patient sedation in light of the auxiliary need to preserve neurologic function. In order to
      evaluate the benefit of Precedex in this setting, it must be compared to the usual standard
      of care. Through the investigators double blinded randomized trial, the investigators will
      obtain information on the comparison between two arms, one receiving Precedex and the other
      the usual standard of care at the investigators institution, for achieving and maintaining a
      pre-defined level of conscious sedation, while preserving baseline neurologic status. This
      assessment will optimistically serve as the basis for future large-scale studies and
      ultimately to the establishment of Precedex as a first-line sedative in the management of
      acute stroke and cerebral vasospasm patients undergoing endovascular intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numbers of patient movements (events) that delay or adversely affect the procedure performance and safety.</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary outcome wil be asessed during the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will be continuously monitored for movements that delays or adversely affect the performance of the procedure by the patient assessor in a safe and timely manner (an event). One minute interval between patient event assessments will be given to prevent subjective bias. After every one minute, it will be determined if an event has occurred. Over the length of the procedure, the total number of one-minute intervals with an event occurrence will be summed and then divided by the total of minutes in the procedure to obtain a standardized value as the primary outcome. This will allow for direct comparison of values across the procedures of varying length. This approach will be more systematic and more easily replicable than counting events directly, which requires interpretation as to when a movement event begins and ends, which can be difficult and more subjective.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preserved neurological examination.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment occurs six times: prior, during and after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status using modified NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) will be assessed six times in all patients: 1) prior to the procedure, 2) twenty minutes after starting the drug, 3) one time during the procedure, 4) at the conclusion of the procedure, 5) thirty minutes after stopping the drug drip and 6) three hours after the conclusion of the procedure. RASS score will also be concomitantly assessed with each preserved neurological exam assessment. The observed proportion of times out of the 5 trials after the start of the procedure that neurological exam is preserved will be a secondary outcome in this study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maintenance of optimal sedation target in both groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline before procedure and every twenty minutes during procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Both arms will be assessed by the patient assessor with RASS score measurement at baseline and every 20 minutes thereafter for the length of the procedure. In the Dexmedetomidine arm the drug will be titrated by 0.1mcg/Kg/hour by the treating physician clinical judgment, in order to achieve and maintain RASS of 0 - 1. In the control arm the drug adjustment will not be based on the RASS score, but by physician discretion only.</description>

    <description>Precedex will be started after randomization/prior to catheterization and will be stopped at the end of the procedure. It will be used for an average of 90 minutes and will be used as a continuous intravenous infusion started at 0.3 mcg/kg/hour. If HR &gt; 80 and BP &gt; 120/70, a full loading dose (1.0 mcg/kg/hour) will be administered over 10 minutes. If HR is 60 - 80 or systolic BP is 90 - 120, or age &gt; 65 years, a reduced loading dose of 0.5 mcg/kg will be given over 10 minutes. If no volume overload history, 500mL of colloid (hespan or albumin) will be bolused with 0.2mg of glycopyrrolate. Every 10 minutes, Precedex will be titrated by 0.1 mcg/kg/hour to achieve and maintain RASS of 0 to -1.</description>

    <description>Our usual standard of care is to attempt the intervention without sedation. As per attending physician discretion, Fentanyl (50mcg) and/or Midazolam (0.5 mg) intravenous boluses will be used to control aggressive patient movement that adversely affects the technical capacity of the procedure. The boluses will be repeated at interval of 10 minutes, as necessary. Control arm patients will receive a normal saline placebo drip for the purposes of ensuring patient assessor blindness.</description>
