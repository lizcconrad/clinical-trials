    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that addition of dexmedetomidine to
      fentanyl-based intravenous patient controlled analgesia (PCA) reduces requirement of fentanyl
      bolus and consequent postoperative nausea and vomiting in high-risk patients undergoing
      lumbar spine surgery.

    <description>After induction of anesthesia, peak velocity of carotid artery blood flow is measured by the pulsed wave Doppler signal obtained from the left common carotid artery. Respirophasic variation of the peak velocity is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of peak velocity divided by the mean of the two values during one respiratory cycle. Fluid responder is defined as a patient whose stroke volume index is increased ≥15% after volume expansion. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to discriminiate fludi responder is performed.</description>
