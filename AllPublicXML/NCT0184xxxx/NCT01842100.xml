      Screen-and-treat approach reduces postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease after induced
      abortion, and at the same time alters women's sexual behavior and prevents further
      re-infection by sexually transmitted infections when compared to the universal antibiotic
      prophylaxis strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While universal antibiotic prophylaxis during induced abortion has been proven to reduce
      postabortal pelvic inflammatory diseases, screen-and-treat approach has the potential benefit
      of altering women's sexual behavior and preventing further re-infection by sexually
      transmitted infections. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of
      the two approaches in preventing postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease and the women's
      sexual behavior.

    <description>In the universal prophylaxis group, all women received doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days starting on the day of induced abortion. Screening for sexually transmitted diseases was done as baseline but the results were not revealed to the patients.</description>

    <description>In the screen-and-treat group, the results of screening for sexually transmitted infections (STI) were revealed to the patients. They would only receive appropriate specific antibiotics treatment only if they were screened positive for any of the STIs. If they were found to have STI, their sexual partners would also be referred to the local social hygiene clinics for contact tracing and treatment. Contraception by barrier methods would also be advised.</description>
