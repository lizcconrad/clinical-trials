      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To collect data necessary for assessing the performance of advanced Vaginal Tactile
           Imager (VTI) and evaluating the probe ergonomic design, safety and patient tolerance;

        2. To assess the clinical suitability of the interface software to facilitate the data
           collection process and to get in vivo examination data for validation of visualization
           and analysis routines;

        3. To test the data collection technique and establish a reliable examination procedure.
