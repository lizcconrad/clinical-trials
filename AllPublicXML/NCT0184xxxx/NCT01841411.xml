  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an amino acid with strong antioxidant, mucolytic and antibacterial
      properties, and is produced within the human body.Its effect in biofilms has been tested in
      several bacteria. Biofilms have recently been observed in 90% of subjects with bacterial
      vaginosis (BV) with Gardnerella vaginalis being the predominant species. Although a wide
      range of antimicrobial agents are currently available, treatment options for controlling BV
      are still limited. Furthermore, the number of relapses are increasing and require alternative
      treatments. This study is aiming to evaluate the role of NAC in treatment of BV and
      prevention of recurrence.

    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most frequent diagnosis made in women with lower genital
      tract symptoms. It has recently been observed that 90% of subjects with BV show the growth of
      bacteria in the form of biofilms,and that Gardnerella vaginalis was the predominant species.
      The propensity of G. vaginalis to form biofilm is clinically relevant because this form of
      growth allows it to tolerate higher concentrations of certain antibiotics, thus increasing
      the possibility of recurrent BV even after apparently curative therapy. So new treatment
      strategies must be used to insure complete cure and prevent recurrence. NAC is an amino acid
      with strong antioxidant, mucolytic and antibacterial properties, and is produced within the
      human body.Its effect in biofilms has been tested in several bacteria.

      This study aims to test the efficacy of NAC in treatment of BV either alone or in combination
      with the traditionally used metronidazole. Also the effect of using NAC in prevention of
      recurrence of BV will be monitored.

    <description>N-Acetyl cysteine is a pharmaceutical drug and nutritional supplement,it is a derivative of the natural amino acid cysteine, from which it differs by virtue of the introduction of an acetyl group on the nitrogen atom of the amino terminal.It is used mainly as a mucolytic and in management of paracetamol overdose. It has been observed that N-acetyl cysteine has shown good properties in terms of combating bacterial infections. In particular, it has been observed that NAC presents good activity in terms of inhibiting bacterial adhesion and in dissolving the biofilm matrix.</description>
