  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although uncomplicated cystitis is considered to be a mild condition and mostly self
      limiting, most patients who see a doctor will be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are
      known to give a quick relief of symptoms and shorten the course of the condition by a few
      days. The aim of this study is to evaluate ibuprofen versus mecillinam in the treatment of
      uncomplicated cystitis in otherwise healthy, non-pregnant women. Our main objective is to see
      whether symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen is equally efficient as treatment with
      mecillinam in this group.

      The design of the study will be a double blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). Half of
      the patients will receive treatment with mecillinam and the other half will receive treatment
      with ibuprofen. The study will follow the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

      Urine cultures will be obtained on day one and after two weeks. The patients will be given a
      diary where they daily will register symptom load, possible complications or adverse effects
      and on which day they feel completely cured. We will contact the patients after two weeks to
      make sure they have followed the study procedures. After four weeks we will perform a final
      interview with the patient.
