  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate and disease free survival
      for IIIAN2 non-small-cell lung cancer patients with EGFR 19 or 21 exon mutation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant therapy has been used for years to treat patients with non-small-cell lung cancer
      whose primary tumors are too large to allow for surgery. Reduction in size of the primary
      tumor with neoadjuvant therapy has made it possible for those patients. Moreover, the goals
      have expanded to include: determination of the sensitivity of the tumor so that subsequent
      therapy can be modified accordingly; to prolong disease free survival; to prolong survival.
