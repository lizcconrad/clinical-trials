  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is the best treatment option for colorectal cancer. Despite this radical
      approach, recurrences within five years are still common. Several authors have proposed that
      the immunosuppressive state surrounding the perioperative period was a key element of cancer
      cells spread.

      A particular subtype of T lymphocytes, the Natural Killer cells (NKs), is the main actor of
      the innate immune system. Several factors of the perioperative period can reduce activity of
      NKs such as stress, pain, opioids and general anaesthetics.

      Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic that has been widely used intravenously for abdominal
      surgeries. Intravenous lidocaine has been shown to reduce pain scores, morphine consumption,
      ileus time and length of stay in major colorectal surgeries. It reduced markers of systemic
      inflammation as well.

      The authors hypothesize that the use of intravenous lidocaine during laparoscopic surgeries
      for colorectal cancer resection will preserve NKs activity.
