      Purpose: Non-traumatic rupture of the spleen should be suspected when patients (especially
      young men) present with abdominal pain and a history of acute infectious or
      myeloproliferative disorders. Preoperative imaging studies in hemodynamically stable patients
      may obviate the need for surgery even in the presence of massive hemoperitoneum. The purpose
      of this research is to inform acute management where spontaneous rupture is suspected in
      order to avoid surgery where appropriate, rationalise angiographic intervention and blood
      transfusion.

      Hypothesis: Indentifying the cause of injuries can help target preventative intervention.

      Background: Non-traumatic rupture of the spleen is a rare condition. It may occur in the
      diseased spleen secondary to a variety of pathologies including malaria and
      myeloproliferative disorders. In some cases rupture may occur in an apparently normal spleen.
      The incidence, symptoms, causes, therapy and prognosis are poorly defined. The investigators,
      therefore, propose an extension of retrospective analysis conducted, presented and published
      in 2003 to examine all the cases of non-traumatic splenic rupture treated at Ziv Medical
      Centre from the last 26 years to present.

      Methods: Analysis of the medical notes of all patients with spontaneous splenic rupture in
      the medical archives.

      The investigators hope to determine the true incidence of this condition within the local
      population, increasingly diverse in origin, travel and the incidence of predisposing
      infectious disease; and to devise a practical protocol in their safe diagnosis and
      management, especially as non-operative interventions have grown in safety and effectiveness.

      Discussion: Although rare, spontaneous splenic rupture may be fatal if not suspected or
      treated inappropriately. Understanding the pitfalls in diagnosis and management better
      informs decision making towards improved care of these patients.

      Non-traumatic rupture of the spleen is a rare condition. It may occur in the diseased spleen
      should be suspected when patients (especially young men) present with abdominal pain and a
      history of acute infectious or myeloproliferative disorders. Rarely, rupture may occur within
      an apparently normal spleen. The incidence, symptoms, causes, therapy and prognosis are
      poorly defined. We, therefore, propose an extension of retrospective analysis already
      presented in 2003 to examine all the cases of non-traumatic splenic rupture treated at Ziv
      Medical Centre over the last 26 years and to rationalise treatment plans taking into
      consideration pitfalls and complications in management so that the care and outcome for these
      patients is improved.

      Methods:

      Patients with a diagnosis of non-traumatic splenic rupture will be identified from the
      hospital database, their medical records retrieved and analysed to determine their actual
      diagnosis and examine their management and outcomes.

      Time frame:

      The retrospective data over the last 26 years will be analysed over the next year.

      Endpoints:

      This is a retrospective study. Our records indicate that as non-traumatic splenic rupture is
      a rare diagnosis, there are fewer than 50 patients listed with this diagnosis, fewer still,
      where examination of the medical records will reveal this to be the actual diagnosis.

      Inclusion criteria:

      All patients where review of the medical records indicates non-traumatic rupture of the
      spleen.

      Exclusion criteria:

      Patients with antecedent trauma. Statistical analysis: Data will be subjected to statistical
      analysis using IBM SPSS and incremental risk calculator software.

      Budget: not needed

      Ethics:

      This study focuses only on the analysis of medical records. Supplementary information from
      patients and health care staff will not be collected. There are no interviews or
      questionnaires planned and data nor treatment outcomes will be discussed outside the context
      of scientific debate (including presentation and publication).

    <description>This is a retrospective study looking at each case and determining the clinical course. Possible patterns in presentation that determines investigation and management will be observed. Patients with infectious disease or myeloproliferative disease who develop actute abdominal pain routinely have a CT scan and surgical review. If CT shows a bleed and the patient is unstable, the patient must have an intervention to stop the bleeding - usually surgical splenectomy. The outcome is to determine the clinical course of non-traumatic splenic haemorrhage.</description>
