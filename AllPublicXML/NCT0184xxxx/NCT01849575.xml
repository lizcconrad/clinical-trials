    <textblock>
      This population based randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims at optimizing cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) prevention through accurate identification of individuals at high risk of CVD
      and accurate perception of the risk, and better compliance to preventive treatments and
      reduced premature CV morbidity and mortality Increased carotid artery intima-media thickness
      (CIMT) and carotid plaques, assessed by ultrasonography, are early signs of atherosclerosis
      and associated with myocardial infarction and stroke. Few studies have systematically
      evaluated image-based risk stratification and its effect on clinical outcomes and results are
      conflicting.

      The Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP), Northern Sweden, is integrated in primary care
      services with assessment of traditional CV risk factors and individual health promoting
      counseling for all 40-, 50- and 60-year olds (n=6500/yr). Those with diabetes, hypertension,
      family history of premature CVD and/or hypercholesterolemia are referred to treatment.

      VIP participants with at least one conventional CV risk factor (60% of participants) are
      eligible for inclusion in VIPVIZA. During 2013-2015, 3200 participants will be enrolled.
      Portable carotid ultrasound machines will be used for ultrasound examinations, whereby CIMT
      and plaque formation will be visualized and measured.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; 1/ Intervention: Written information
      to patient and physician, including graphic presentation in color of CIMT and of plaque,
      vascular age, an ultrasound image, general information about atherosclerosis as a dynamic
      process, and recommendation to follow clinical guidelines for risk factor control. 2/
      Control: No information from the baseline ultrasonography.

      We will explore determinants of behavioral change using psychometric questionnaires and level
      of health literacy. Deep interviews at the time point for the ultrasound examinations will
      explore how the screening relates to risk perception, quality of life, coping strategies,
      attitudes to and skills of self-care.

      Both groups will be managed according to clinical guidelines within the usual health care.
      After three years (2015-2017), the ultrasonography is repeated and information given to all
      participants and their physicians.

      CV risk factors, life style and pharmacological treatments will be assessed after one and
      three years. CV morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality will be followed during five
      years, i.e. until 2020.

      Visualization of asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease to improve cardiovascular prevention.
      Design of a randomized controlled intervention within ordinary health care - VIPVIZA.

      Design and methods: a randomized controlled trial integrated in the existing set-up for
      population based CVD screening and prevention within primary health care, the Västerbotten
      Intervention Programme (VIP). VIP provides CVD risk factor screening and individual health
      promotion to all county citizens at ages 40, 50 and 60 years with high participation rate
      (around 70%), only small social selection bias and standardized procedures.

      Study population: VIP-participants were invited to the study according to inclusion criteria.
      This design guarantees a population base for the study, focus on individuals at intermediate
      CVD-risk, clinical relevance and external validity.

      Sample size and power: Power calculations were based on VIP data on CVD risk factors 2011,
      and on CIMT data from the Tromsö study, Norway. Enrolment of 3200 participants was estimated
      sufficient to test outcomes with a probability of 0.8 to detect a true difference between
      groups at a significance level of 0.05. To compensate for drop-outs during the study period,
      of 3600 individuals were recruited.

      Population sample Inclusion criteria: i) age 60 years, ii) a history of CVD before age 60
      years among first-degree relatives iii) age 50 years and at least one of the following:
      smoking, diabetes, hypertension, S-LDL-cholesterol ≥ 4.5 mmol/L, abdominal obesity.

      Exclusion criteria: a significant stenosis as defined by &gt;50% luminal narrowing of the
      investigated carotid arteries according to vascular ultrasound and Doppler measurements.

      Participants are randomly with equal probability assigned to two groups. Intervention
      Image-based risk communication, i.e. visual information about carotid ultrasound results, to
      the participant and his/her primary care physician in the form of atherosclerosis highlighted
      graphically in color against normal vascular age patterns and as plaque formation. After 2─4
      weeks a follow─up call by a research nurse, to give additional information and reassurance,
      if needed.

      Control No information about the carotid ultrasound to participant and physician.

      Both groups are followed and managed according to clinical guidelines within primary health
      care during the entire study period.

      Outcome definitions for differences between intervention and control group:

      Primary outcome: CVD risk as evaluated by statistical risk model based on conventional risk
      factors at one year. Variable: Framingham risk score at one-year follow-up (Specific aim 1).
      This is a surrogate variable for change of atherosclerosis as assessed by carotid intima
      media thickness and presence of plaque. The atherosclerotic process is too slow and the
      precision in ultrasound measurements too low to allow for evaluations between intervention
      and control group after one year.

      Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes are divided into three categories, corresponding
      specific aims are indicated.

        1. CVD risk factors, measured with standard clinical methods (variables: blood pressure,
           Lipids, glucose values, BMI) and lifestyle, (Physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol
           (AUDIT), diet) measured with questionnaires at baseline, 1-year and 3-year visits.
           (Specific aims 1).

        2. Atherosclerotic disease, i.e. Ultrasound results at baseline and year 3: carotid intima
           media thickness (CIMT), presence of plaque and presence and degree of stenosis. A
           portable automatic carotid ultrasound equipment (CardioHealth Station®, Panasonic
           Healthcare Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) is used. A standardized protocol according to current
           guidelines is applied and the angle of insonation is automatically provided by the
           system and recorded. Measurement of CIMT (max, min and mean values) is automatic
           (Specific aims 1).

        3. Pharmacological treatment will be followed through the Pharmacological register and
           medical records (Specific aims 2, 4)

        4. Novel biomarkers: Plasma samples collected at baseline and at the 3-year follow-up will
           be longitudinally analyzed for novel hypothesized CVD biomarkers. For Lipidomics
           collaboration is established with Umeå Plant Science Centre, for Protein biomarkers
           SciLifeLab in Uppsala (Specific aim 3).

        5. Clinical endpoints will be followed through registers on hospitalizations and causes of
           deaths (all-cause and CVD specific): Myocardial infarctions (MI), stroke,
           revascularization procedures (Specific aim 5).

      Psychological and behavioral factors, determinants and mediators of preventive actions:

        1. Validated psychometric questionnaires at baseline and 3.year follow-up: e.g. Health
           related quality of life (Rand 36), Self efficacy (The General Self-efficacy test),
           coping strategies (Brief COPE), Optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised), social network
           and support (ISSI), work stress (Karasek demand/control model) (Specific aim 2)

        2. Social support and network, education, civil status, stress at work, quality of life:
           VIP-data.

        3. Barriers and facilitators for primary CVD prevention explored through deep interviews
           with physicians and participants and evaluated with qualitative methods (Specific aim 4)

      Data analyses, statistical analytical tests: Parametric and non-parametric tests will be used
      as appropriate. Imaging results will be related to the risk factors establishing multiple
      linear regression models. Predictive Cox Proportional Hazard models will be developed to
      estimate the overall predictive ability of CIMT, plaque and risk factors on CVD morbidity and
      mortality at 5 and 10 years taking into account time at risk for disease and deaths. Receiver
      Operating Characteristic Curves (ROC) by estimating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to assure
      highest possible sensitivity and specificity of predictions. Confirmatory (structural
      equation modelling) and exploratory (partial least squares analysis) statistical modelling
      employed to establish relationships between the intervention and intermediate and mediating
      factors and variables' relative contribution to explain changes in the outcome variables.

      Qualitative analyses, Deep interviews with participants and physicians will be transcribed
      verbatim and analyzed using Qualitative Content Analysis.

      Time plan: Recruitment and base line measurements were completed June 2016 (In VIP: CVD risk
      factors, life style questionnaire and sampling of frozen blood to the Medical Biobank.
      Carotid ultrasound and psychometric questionnaires, interviews).

      1-year follow-up started May 2014, will be completed June 2017. (CVD risk factors, life style
      questionnaire) 3-year follow-up starts August 2016, will be completed June 2019 (CVD risk
      factors, life style questionnaire, frozen blood samples, carotid ultrasound and psychometric
      questionnaires, pharmacologic treatments.

      5 and 10-year follow-up for clinical events, register data 2021 and 2026. Period for this
      application: 2017-2019, the second phase of data collection from participants.

      Implementation: The project is conducted as an integrated part of clinical care. Evaluations
      and prevention based on ultrasound results and risk factors are done by family physicians
      according to clinical guidelines in routine care. The carotid ultrasound examinations are
      performed with a portable machine that can easily be used in settings outside specialized
      care. The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes, the methodology is user friendly and automated,
      follows a strict protocol, and can after a short learning period be performed by
      non-specialized staff. The existing software provides a report that can accurately be
      interpreted by patients and doctors. Therefore, the results and methods are expected to be
      relevant, valid and ready for direct implementation in other CVD prevention programs,
      including being decentralized and performed on an everyday basis in high volumes by
      non-specialized staff. If necessary, evaluations by a specialist can be done at long
      distances within specialized care as ultrasound results can be electronically transferred.

      Organisation: The source population is the whole middle-aged county population, from the more
      densely-populated urbanized coastland to the sparsely-populated rural inland. The research
      environment is interdisciplinary with a strong multi-professional team of researchers with
      solid experience of clinical prevention and research in the field. For the practical project
      work a close collaboration is important between the applicant and the medical coordinator of
      VIP with representatives of Heart Centre including Clinical Physiology, Stroke center,
      Behavioral Medicine. Additional specialists in the team are; cardiology, image based
      techniques, internal medicine, family medicine, behavioral medicine, epidemiology and global
      health, psychology, statistics, qualitative methods. For biomarker research we collaborate
      with, Umeå Plant Science Centre (omics), SciLifeLab Uppsala, and Uppsala Clinical Research
      Center. Research on ultrasound technical development is a collaboration between Heart Centre
      and Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Radiation Sciences. Agreements about premises,
      staff, research nurses and technicians are made long-term. The County Council has authorized
      the study all over the county.

      Premises and facilities: The daily work is managed and organized by experienced research
      nurses at the Clinical Research Centre, Umeå University Hospital, where about 50% of the
      ultrasound examinations are performed. In the remote districts they are performed at the
      primary health care centers with use of the same portable ultrasound machine. VIP-nurses
      working continuously with prevention at each PHC are deeply involved for recruitment and 1-
      and 3-year follow-up measurements. The Clinical Trial Unit, another research supporting
      facility hosted by the county council, will monitor the trial according to GCP.

      ETHICAL APPROVAL All individuals participating in the study has to provide written informed
      consent. The Regional Ethical Review Board, Umeå University, has approved the VIPVIZA study
      including the above described substudies (Dnr 2011-445-31M,2012-463-32M, 2013-373-32M) .
