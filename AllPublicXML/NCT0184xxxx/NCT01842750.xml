  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the hypothesis that insertion of an endorectal balloon into a patient
      receiving radical prostate radiotherapy by treatment radiographers is feasible without the
      patient experiencing undue discomfort. In addition this study will test the hypotheses that
      insertion of the rectal balloon prior to radiotherapy delivery stabilises rectal volume
      during radiotherapy treatment and minimises organ motion within the pelvis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be assessed for 4 weeks throughout radiotherapy treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim is to determine whether the balloon insertion is tolerated throughout treatment. The principle outcome measure is the percentage of patients who tolerate the endorectal balloon throughout treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>rectal volume</measure>
    <time_frame>patient scans will be reviewed over 4 weeks of radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Rectal volume stability will be determined by comparing the rectal volume for scans with the endorectal balloon(ERB)in situ to scans without the ERB in situ</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of planning target volume (PTV) coverage</measure>
    <time_frame>patients will be reviewed across a 4 week radiotherapy treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>PTV coverage and an assessment of prostate shape and position between the weekly imaging scans with the balloon in situ will be compared with the position of the prostate and PTV coverage on the original planning scan with the balloon in situ</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rectal wall sparing</measure>
    <time_frame>patients reviewed across 4 weeks of radiotherapy treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Rectal wall sparing will be assessed by comparing the estimated dose determined from the imaging scans with the ERB in situ and not in situ against the planned dose from the radiotherapy planning scan</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>patients toxicity will be assessed over 4 weeks of radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Acute toxicity according to CTCAE v. 4.0. This will record any reasons why balloon insertion is not possible for review.</description>

    <description>A cone Beam scan will be performed prior to balloon insertion and then again with balloon in situ. The scans will be compared to see if the organs are stabilised. Questionnaires will be completed by the radiographer and the patient.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Patients with PS-2 as a result of comorbidity will be
             excluded).

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  Patients who are going to undergo treatment with radical radiotherapy for prostate
             cancer.

          -  Patients must be able to receive and understand verbal and written information
             regarding the study and give written, informed consent

          -  Patients must be able to comply with trial requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have a history of previous bowel surgery involving the rectum or
             anus.

          -  Evidence of significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding which, in the opinion
             of the investigator makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial,
             as well as any other serious uncontrolled medical condition.

          -  Any patient with a medical or psychiatric condition that impairs their ability to give
             informed consent

          -  Pre-existing anorectal disease, e.g. Haemorrhoids, active bleeding, anal irritation,
             inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  Patients who are unable to give consent.

          -  Patients in clinical trials of new investigational medicinal products or treatment
             regimens unless there is written, prior agreement that the patient can also consent to
             this study, and that clinical data can also be used for this study.
