  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, multicentre randomised double-blind placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in
      patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The investigators aim to recruit patients with
      mild Alzheimer's dementia as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and
      Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorder Association
      (NINCDS-ADRDA) Criteria for Probable Alzheimer's Dementia or meeting Dubois criteria for
      early AD, with Mini Mental State Evaluation score of at least 20 out of a maximum of 30 and a
      CDR Global score of 0.5 or 1.

      Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive liraglutide or matching placebo.
