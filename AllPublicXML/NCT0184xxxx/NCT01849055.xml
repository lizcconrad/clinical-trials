    <textblock>
      This is a study of LY3023703 in healthy participants. The purposes of this study are to look
      at safety, how well the study drug is tolerated, how much of the study drug gets into the
      blood stream and how long it takes the body to remove the study drug. The effects of
      LY3023703 on blood pressure after 28 days of dosing will be studied. Information about any
      side effects that occur will be collected. The study is expected to last 21 weeks.
