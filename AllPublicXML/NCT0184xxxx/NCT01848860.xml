    <textblock>
      Primary spontaneous pneumothorax usually occurs in young, lean male without underlying lung
      disease. In most cases, the cause of pneumothorax is rupture of blebs at the apex of the
      lung. Traditionally, bullectomy with mechanical pleurodesis through thoracotomy is indicated
      in patients with recurrence or persisted air leakage. In recent years, thoracoscopic
      bullectomy with pleural abrasion is getting popular, thanks for the advance of endoscopic
      instruments and technique. The pneumothorax recurrence rate after thoracoscopic surgery is
      around 10%, which is significantly higher than that of thoracotomy. In addition, the rate of
      postoperative prolonged air leakage is 5-8%. The possible causes of recurrent pneumothorax
      and prolonged air leakage are missed bleb surrounding the endoscopic suture line or
      suboptimal suturing or healing of the thoracoscopic suture. To prevent these complications, a
      novel method using coverage of the endoscopic suture line by a large absorbable mesh during
      thoracoscopic surgery was proved to be safe and feasible. Theoretically, the mesh can
      strengthen the suture line and induce local fibrosis surrounding the suture line, and reduce
      the rate of recurrent pneumothorax and prolonged air leakage. To prove this hypothesis, the
      investigators are conducting a prospective randomized trial in National Taiwan University
      Hospital. The investigators will enroll 204 patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax
      who will be randomly assigned to additional mesh pleurodesis (mesh group, 102 patients) or
      not (control group, 102 patients) after thoracoscopic bullectomy and pleural abrasion. The
      primary endpoint is to compare the rate of pneumothorax recurrence within one year between
      the two groups. The secondary endpoints are to compare the safety, efficacy, and long-term
      pulmonary function between the two groups.

      Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly occurs in young, tall, lean males (1, 2). The
      estimated recurrence rate is 23-50% after the first episode and increases to 60% after the
      second pneumothorax (3). Optimal management of this benign disease, especially after repeat
      attack, has been a matter of debate. Recent advances in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
      (VATS) that combine bullectomy with pleural abrasion provide a preferred intervention for
      treating primary spontaneous pneumothorax (4-6). Unfortunately, recurrence rates of
      pneumothorax after VATS range between 5% and 10%, which are higher than the rates reported
      after open thoracotomy (7-11). It is suggested that a higher chance of missed leaking blebs
      around the staple line of endoscopic staplers (12) and a less intense pleural inflammatory
      reaction are induced by VATS procedure than by thoracotomy (13, 14). In addition,
      postoperative air leakage usually occurs at the staple line. (7, 15) As a result, the
      efficacy of VATS is questioned and more aggressive procedures, such as limited thoracotomy
      with pleurectomy, are sometimes performed to enhance the effects of pleural symphysis (10,
      14).

      Theoretically, reinforcement of the visceral pleura around the staple line is a reasonable
      way to prevent postoperative air leak and recurrent pneumothorax. Previous retrospective
      studies showed that staple line coverage with absorbable mesh after thoracoscopic bullectomy
      is safe and may be effective in decreasing the rates of pneumothorax recurrence (16,17). One
      animal study also showed that when absorbable mesh insertion is coupled with pleural
      abrasion, appropriate pleurodesis is predictably achieved (18).

      In the present study, additional absorbable mesh coverage of the staple line will be randomly
      administered in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax after VATS to test the
      efficacy and safety of this method.

    <description>Thoracoscopic bullectomy and pleural abrasion will be performed in a standard fashion under general anesthesia using intubated one-lung ventilation. When blebs are identified, they will be grasped with the ring forceps and excised with an endoscopic stapler. Blind apical stapling was done at the most suspicious area if no bleb could be identified. Thoracoscopic pleural abrasion will be performed at the parietal pleura above the 5th intercostal space by inserting the dissector with a strip of diathermy scratch pad through the port sites in all patients.</description>
