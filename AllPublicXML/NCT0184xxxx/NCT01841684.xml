  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effect of anacetrapib on low-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) when added to ongoing lipid-lowering therapy. The primary
      hypothesis is that treatment with anacetrapib 100 mg for 12 weeks will lower LDL-C to a
      greater extent than treatment with placebo.
