      The primary object is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for symptoms
      of menopausal transition .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menopause transition is called perimenopause in the past time. 40-80% women aged 40 to 65
      have symptoms during this period. Hormone therapy is the recommended therapy for menopause
      and there is not enough evidence in favor of alternative medicine's effect.

      Our pilot trial showed that electroacupuncture had better effect for menopause transition
      symptoms than sham electroacupuncture. We are going to conduct a phase Ⅱ clinical trial to
      further evaluate the safety and effect of electroacupuncture for menopause transition
      symptoms.

    <description>Stick adhesive tapes to all points. For ST25, EX-CA1 and RN4, insert the needle vertically through the pads and the skin, and then slowly and vertically penetrate through the layer of fatty tissue, up into the muscles of the abdominal wall .For RN4, manipulate the needle with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method slightly for 3 times. Insert the needle vertically at SP6 to a depth of 1 cm. Manipulate the needle with an even lifting, thrusting and twisting method slightly for 3 times to reach de-qi. Put the electric stimulator on the pair of EX-CA1 and ST25 points with a dilatational wave, 10/50 Hz, 0.5-1.0mA. To turn on the current intensity till the abdomen shivers. The same manipulation methods for RN4 and SP6 will be given every 10 minutes (3 times in all).</description>

    <description>Non-points proximate to RN4 (P1), EX-CA1(P2)，ST25 (P3) and SP6 (P4) (double sides) are used.P1 and P3 are at the sites 1 cm (outward in horizontal direction) proximate to RN4 and ST25 respectively. P2 is 2 cm (outward in horizontal direction) proximate to EX-CA1. P4 is at the middle site of the spleen meridian and the kidney meridian (backward in horizontal direction proximate to SP6).
Stick adhesive tapes to all points. Blunt needles will be used to be inserted to but not piercing the skin. Even lifting, thrusting and twisting manipulation methods will be given for each non-point for 3 times. Put the sham electric stimulator on the pair of P2 and P3 with the same parameters as the acupuncture group. But there is no current intensity actually.</description>
