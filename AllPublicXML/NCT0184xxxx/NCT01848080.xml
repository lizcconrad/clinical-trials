  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, only 10 to 15% of individuals following a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) receive
      intensive rehabilitation services. The majority of individuals return home with or without
      rehabilitation services, as outpatient services are unable to meet the demand.
      Telerehabilitation is a promising alternative approach that can help improve access to
      rehabilitation services once patients are discharged home. The main hypothesis is: The
      participants who received the intervention via telerehabilitation will have a gain in their
      Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB&amp;M) score that will not be inferior to the gain
      observed in participants who received the intervention via home visits (less than 4 points).
      The investigators therefore postulate a non-inferiority hypothesis of the telerehabilitation
      approach compared to home visits. The secondary hypotheses are: Two to four months following
      discharge from hospital, the investigators hypothesize that the level of: 1) gain in physical
      and psychological capacities related to mobility; 2) gain in the quality of life, and 3)
      satisfaction of services received will not be inferior in the TELE group compared to the
      VISIT group and that 4) the Tele approach will be more cost-effective compared to the VISIT
      approach. The platform used will be based on a technological infrastructure that was
      developed and tested in previous telerehabilitation studies. The study is a randomized
      control trial (RCT).The study population of interest will target individuals who have had a
      stroke who stayed in a hospital. Participants will be recruited during the hospitalization
      period at each of the three sites. The investigators expect to recruit 240 participants, 120
      per group. All evaluations will be completed in the research centers/hospitals of the three
      sites and will last approximately 1.5 hours. The first evaluation will be conducted prior to
      hospital discharge (T1) to establish the baseline measures. The two other evaluations will be
      conducted 2 months (T2) and four months (T3) following discharge from hospital. The
      independent variable is individualized exercise program, based on Tai Chi. The dependant
      variables are Balance, functional mobility, physical capacities, psychological capacities
      related to mobility and balance, quality of life, satisfaction with care received, cost of
      services according to the healthcare system. The difference between the two groups will then
      be compared using a t-test. The economic analysis will be a type of cost-effectiveness.

The exercise program consists of movements based on a combination of alignments and body-specific orientations, weight transfers and changes in direction inspired by Tai Chi.
