      RATIONALE: Adjuvant chemotherapy has been proven to reduce significantly the risk for relapse
      and death in women with operable breast cancer.In the North American Inter-Group factorial
      trial design (CALGB 9741) the concept of dosedense adjuvant chemotherapy was further tested
      in patients with node-positive breast cancer.Weekly paclitaxel after standard adjuvant
      chemotherapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide improves disease-free and overall survival
      in women with breast cancer.Investigators asked if dose-dense 2-week intertreatment intervals
      (supported by the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) were better than the
      conventional inconvenient weekly intervals.
