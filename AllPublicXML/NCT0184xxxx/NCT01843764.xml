  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to follow clearance of malaria infections and detection of new
      malaria episodes after initiation of antimalarial treatment in Tanzanian children. For this
      purpose the investigators used five diagnostic tools, 2 Rapid Diagnostic tests based on
      Histidine Rich Protein 2(HRP2) and Lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), 2 microscopical methods and
      one polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The investigators followed the 53 enrolled children
      during 42 days.

    <measure>Clearance time with five diagnostic tests</measure>
    <time_frame>2009 June to 2012 May (up to day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>Children were followed up on 9 occasions until day 42. Mean and median time until clearance after initiation of arthemeter-lumefantrine treatment was measured for HRP2 based Rapid diagnostic tests, LDH-based Rapid diagnostic tests, Giemsa and Acridine Orange stained microscopy and real-time PCR.</description>

    <measure>Detection of recurrent infection with HRP2 and LDH-based Rapid diagnostic tests during follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>2009 June to 2012 May (up to day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>Ability to detect recurrent malaria infection with the HRP2 and LDH-Rapid diagnostic tests during the 42 days of follow up was studied through comparing them with three other diagnostic tests.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficiency of P.falciparum specific rapid diagnostic tests</measure>
    <time_frame>2009 June to 2012 May (up to day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>Efficiency of two rapid diagnostic tests based on two different antigens for diagnosis and treatment follow up among children &lt;5 years in a moderately high endemic area was determined. Specificity and false positivity rate for HRP2 and LDH based rapid diagnostic tests are calculated against Giemsa stained microscopy and PCR.</description>
