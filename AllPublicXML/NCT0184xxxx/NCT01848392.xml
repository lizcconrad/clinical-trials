  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity seems to be a prognostic factor for quality of life and survival in
      patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Whereas their exercise capacity has been assessed through
      medical examination, their daily physical activity has been little studied. Activity monitors
      have measured physical activity only in a few studies which considered mainly respiratory
      status and more recently bone mineral density and body composition. Determinants of physical
      activity in patients with CF remain largely unknown.

      The objective of this study is to measure daily physical activity with activity monitors in
      adult patients with CF and to investigate the determinants of physical activity, with a focus
      on extra-respiratory factors (nutritional status, diabetes, bone mineralization, anxiety
      and/or depression, cardiac impairment).

      Seventy adult patients with CF, regularly cared at the Cochin adult CF centre, will be
      recruited in a stable period during their annual review. During this assessment, laboratory
      tests will be carried out (especially parameters for nutritional status), as well as
      measurement of body composition and bone mineral density, respiratory function tests and a 6
      minute walk test, and echocardiography. Patients will wear for 7 consecutive days a
      multi-sensor armband SenseWear on the arm, to assess the intensity of physical activity in
      metabolic equivalents (METS) and steps per day. Finally, patients will complete three
      self-administered questionnaires: Quality of Life (CFQ14 +), hospital anxiety depression
      scale and physical activity.

      After a descriptive analysis of the study cohort, we will study qualitative and quantitative
      criteria related to physical activity (assessed quantitatively by the number of steps/day or
      metabolic equivalents).

      Linear regression models will then be developed to assess the independent factors associated
      with physical activity, adjusting for different variables of interest related to patients
      demographic, behavioral, clinical (respiratory and non-respiratory ) and biological
      parameters. Conversely, the &quot;predictive&quot; independent aspect of physical activity will be
      studied according to respiratory function, nutritional status and quality of life.

      Ambulatory adult CF patients are recruited at time of their yearly evaluation.

      Phenotypic patients' characteristics Age, gender, CFTR genotype, pancreatic status (presence
      or absence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency), number of IV antibiotic courses and number
      of hospitalization over the previous year, are reported.

      Physical activity measurement Physical activity is measured over 7 consecutive days using a
      multisensor armband (SenseWear Pro Armband; BodyMedia, Inc.,Pittsburgh, PA) that is worn on
      the upper right arm over the triceps muscle. It incorporates a biaxial accelerometer that
      records steps per day, and physiologic indicators of energy expenditure that enable the
      investigator to determine the physical activity level.

      Evaluation of respiratory function and cardiovascular status Patients will perform a
      respiratory function test to evaluate FVC and FEV1 and six minutes walk test. Arterial blood
      gases will be done at the beginning and at the end of walk and the walking distance will be
      indicated in meters.

      Echocardiography will be performed to look for left or right cardiac dysfunction and measure
      systolic pulmonary artery pressure. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP)
      will be used as a systemic biomarker of heart failure.

      Bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition They are measured by X-ray absorptiometry
      (DEXA) on the lumbar spine, femur and whole body, and measurement of lean and fat mass (Lunar
      Prodigy).

      Nutritional evaluation Weight and height are measured and body mass index (BMI) is
      calculated. As part of the annual dietary assessment, there will be an evaluation of the
      amount of ingested nitrogen.

      Blood will be drawn to measure: albumin, prealbumin, vitamin E, vitamin A and vitamin
      25(OH)D3, HbA1c. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen will be measured as indicators of
      inflammation.

      Urinalysis will measure: creatinine, nitrogen and 3-methylhistidine. Oral glucose tolerance
      test will be performed (fasting blood glucose and blood glucose 2 hours after ingesting 75 g
      of glucose) in pancreatic insufficient patients with unknown diabetes.

      Self-administered questionnaires

      Patients will answer 3 questionnaires:

        1. quality of life CFQ14+ questionnaire

        2. hospital anxiety depression (HAD) scale validated in French

        3. Baecke physical activity questionnaire
