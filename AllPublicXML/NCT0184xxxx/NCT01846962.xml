    <textblock>
      Therapeutic strategies for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) actually include: 1) allergen
      avoidance through dietary modifications, and 2) pharmacologic antiinflammatory therapy.
      Medical treatment is mainly based on topical administration of corticosteroids by swallowing
      fluticasone propionate or budesonide spray. Dietetic treatment with highest efficacy is
      elemental diet, consisting in exclusive feeding with amino-acid based formulas, often
      administered trough SNG. Alternative choices of acceptable efficacy are empirical six-foods
      elimination diet (cow's milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanuts, fish) and targeted elimination diet
      based on the results of allergy tests. Most of the paediatric patients with EE respond to
      elemental or targeted elimination diets, and therefore such authors recommend elimination
      diets to be considered the treatment of choice in children. However, elimination diets can
      often be complex to follow and may be associated with poor adherence owing to the low
      palatability of a highly restricted diet. In non-compliant patients, especially in
      adolescents and young adults, it may be more practical to proceed first with corticosteroid
      treatment. In the case of partial response to elimination diets or corticosteroids, a
      combination of both treatment mod. However, there has been limited testing of these regimens
      in randomized controlled trials, while most of available literature is based on case series.

      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of six-foods elimination diet, swallowed
      fluticasone, swallowed budesonide and oral viscous budesonide (OVB) in pediatric patients
      with active EoE. The investigators assessed the effects of randomly assigned treatment on
      clinical and endoscopic/histologic severity as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.
      The investigators describe clinical, allergological, endoscopic and histological features,
      and pH study results, of our pediatric population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized by significant eosinophilic infiltration of
      esophageal mucosa, leading to tissue damage and consequently to esophageal symptoms. The
      clinical presentation in childhood often mimics gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD),
      sometimes in association to feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. Later in life, the
      most common symptoms are dysphagia and food impaction, due to esophageal dysmotility. The
      progression of a non-recognized, untreated disease, is thought to lead to chronic esophageal
      inflammation with fibrosis and stenosis. Diagnosis requires multiple esophageal biopsies (at
      least 4 in both proximal and distal esophagus, regardless of gross appearance of mucosa) to
      demonstrate a mucosal infiltrate of at least 15 eosinophils for high power field (HPF) in
      patients with a normal pH study or refractory to acid-suppression therapy. Although the
      endoscopic examination may be unremarkable, endoscopic features of EoE have been well
      characterized and include: linear furrowing, concentric rings (thachealization), white spots
      (eosinophilic abscesses), Schatzki ring, strictures, and linear superficial mucosal tears
      occurring after introduction of the endoscope.

    <description>The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Severity Score assessed at baseline (time 0) and after 3 months of treatment (time 1). We scored each symptom basing on its frequency, intensity, and interference on life quality. One point was added in the presence of feeding difficulties leading to growth delay (weight/heigth ratio &lt;5Â° centile) or significant weight loss (&gt;10% of initial body weight). Two points were added the in case of gastrointestinal bleeding or severe strictures requiring urgent hospitalization.</description>
