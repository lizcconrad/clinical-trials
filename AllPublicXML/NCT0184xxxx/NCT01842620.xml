  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, 2-way crossover study to evaluate the
      bioequivalence of OXEMET™ 1000 mg coated tablets, relative to 1000 mg of the reference
      product administered as two 500 mg tablets, under fasting conditions, in 24 healthy adult
      subjects. Each subject will receive two treatments (Treatment A and Treatment B). In Period
      1, subjects will be dosed with either one OXEMET™ 1000 mg tablet (Treatment A, Test) or two
      500 mg tablets of reference product (GLAFORNIL™ 500 mg) (Treatment B, Reference). Following a
      washout of at least 7 days, subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to receive the
      treatment that they did not receive in Period 1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt; 35%).

          -  Single QTc &lt; 450 msec.

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 21 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential

             for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator)
             prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that
             point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 7 days post-last dose.

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 - 27 kg/m2 (inclusive).

             distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.
