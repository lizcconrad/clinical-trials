    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center clinical investigation to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Heparin-induced Extracorporeal Lipoprotein Precipitation (H.E.L.P.) Therapy as a
      treatment for non-exudative (dry) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). A total of 14
      clinic visits are scheduled, one baseline visit, 8 visits for H.E.L.P. therapy treatments (to
      be performed over a period of 12 weeks for each patient) and 5 follow-up visits to be
      performed one week following the 4th H.E.L.P. therapy session and 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36
      weeks and 52 weeks after the final H.E.L.P. therapy session.
