    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open/unblended study (3:1Treatment: Control) to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the g-Cath EZ Suture Anchor Delivery Catheter as an early weight
      loss intervention compared to a diet and exercise control only. Mean % Total Body Weight Loss
      [TBWL] in Treatment subjects versus that of Control subjects at 12 months is the primary
      endpoint. The proportion of subjects achieving ≥ 5% TBWL at 12 months in the treatment group
      is a co-primary endpoint.

      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the g-Cath EZ Suture Anchor Delivery
      Catheter as an early weight loss intervention compared to a diet and exercise control only.
      The weight loss outcomes will be used to assess treatment effect. This study is a
      multi-center, open/unblinded, prospective randomized feasibility study (3:1Treatment:
      Control) study. Patients in the control group will be offered the opportunity to crossover to
      the treatment group at 12 months.
