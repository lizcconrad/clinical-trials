  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The particle size of the active ingredient may impact dissolution rate in the gastro
      intestinal tract and hence the amount of drug available for absorption. Similarly,
      differences in the percentage of the excipients used in the formulated capsules may affect
      dissolution rate. The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect that particle size and
      percentage of excipients could have in drug absorption, which will improve the manufacturing
      process of the formulated capsules.

    <description>AUC is a measure of the serum concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
