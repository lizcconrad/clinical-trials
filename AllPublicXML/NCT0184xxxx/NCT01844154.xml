  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a prevalent health concern among older adults and is associated with an
      increased risk of falls that can cause fracture, injury or mortality. Identifying the factors
      related to falls occurring within this population is essential for the development of
      effective regimes for fall prevention. Studies have shown that muscle quality and good
      posture alignments are critical for balance control in older adults. People are diagnosed
      with osteoporosis often combining with muscles weakness, and increased spine kyphosis leading
      vertebral, fractures and poor balance control, even falls. Therefore, improving muscle
      quality, strengthening weak muscles and correcting postural alignment are essential elements
      for fracture and fall prevention in older adults with osteoporosis. The long-term objectives
      of this work are to prevent fracture and fall in older adults with osteoporosis by improving
      the function of degenerative muscles using exercise training.
