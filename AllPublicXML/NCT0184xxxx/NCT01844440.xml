  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to establish and validate High resolution manometry (HRM) criteria
      for the definition of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (tLESRs) in
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tLESRs represent the main mechanism of all types of reflux events. Inhibition of transient
      lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (tLESRs) has become one of the most relevant
      therapeutic objectives in patients with reflux symptoms resistant to proton pump inhibitors.
      HRM is the gold standard for detecting and characterizing tLESR, and could be considered as
      part of the pharmacological evaluation of new drugs targeting tLESRs. HRM criteria for the
      objective definition of tLESRs in GERD patients have to be established, as it has been done
      in healthy patients Subjects will undergo impedance / manometry recording with solid-state
      catheter systems, during a 30-min fasting and a 2-hour postprandial periods.
