    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies nanoscale artificial nose (NA-NOSE) in monitoring response and
      detecting recurrence after surgery or radiation therapy in patients with stage I or stage II
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using the NA-NOSE breath test may be an effective way to
      monitor response and detect recurrence of NSCLC after surgery or radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if a suitable fraction of patients become NA-NOSE negative within three years
      post treatment. We will test the hypothesis that this fraction is at most 30% versus the
      alternative that it is at least 50%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if patients who become NA-NOSE negative post treatment then become NA-NOSE
      positive prior to clinical recurrence.

      II. Estimate the time post treatment needed to become NA-NOSE negative. III. Estimate the
      lead time gained between a negative to positive NA-NOSE transition and clinical recurrence.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo breath sample collection for the NA-NOSE breath test at baseline (2
      pre-treatment samples), and post treatment samples at regularly scheduled follow up visits,
      for 2 years in the absence of disease progression.

    <description>We will test the null hypothesis that at most 30% of patients will become nanoscale artificial nose negative within 3 years post- surgery. The alternative will be that this fraction will be at least 50%. If at least 15/35 patients become nanoscale artificial nose negative within 3 years post treatment follow up we will reject the null. The test has 84.5% power and 7.31% type I error.</description>

    <description>We will test the hypothesis that at most 25% of patients who become nanoscale artificial nose negative within 3 years and recur within that time frame will become nanoscale artificial nose positive before recurrence. The alternative is that at least 50% of such patients will become nanoscale artificial nose positive before recurrence.</description>

    <description>We will restrict this estimate to data from patients who experience a transition and will use the method of Kaplan and Meier. We will tabulate frequencies of patients who recur with or without such a transition as well as those for patients who never become nanoscale artificial nose negative.</description>
