  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even with careful prostate surgery, men find it difficult to have an erection. Our previous
      research shows that couples are not often supported to cope with the effects of surgery on
      their sexual relationships. In this study, the investigators will design a way of supporting
      couples, and test how well it works.

      The investigators will decide what the support should include (e.g. duration, frequency and
      timing of the support). The investigators will do this by looking at available literature on
      the subject.

      The investigators will recruit 68 couples to the study, half will receive standard care and
      the other half will be invited to attend six sessions of psychosexual support with specially
      trained professionals (trained by men affected by prostate conditions and a cancer/couple
      support specialist). Before and after the support, men and their partners will be asked to
      complete questionnaires which measure quality-of-life, emotional needs, and their
      relationship. The investigators will ask the couples to fill out the questionnaires again
      six-months later to see if the support has long-term benefits. At the end of the study the
      investigators will also interview 10 couples to find out their views of the support, and
      another 10 couples about standard treatment.

      When the investigators have tested this support, they expect to see men and their partners
      tell us that their quality of life has improved, and they have higher satisfaction with their
      relationship. The investigators will calculate the overall cost of providing this support,
      and the benefits it has on reducing the need for other health-care services (like General
      Practice use).

      Scientific abstract

      Evidence shows significant unmet psychosexual needs for couples affected by prostate cancer.
      Studies have identified the contribution that psychosocial interventions could have for
      couples, e.g. strengthening healthy adaptation and better communication, developing coping
      skills for distressed couples, and facilitating healthy spousal communication to address the
      sexual rehabilitation needs.

      This is a feasibility study with a built-in pilot, which will examine the acceptability,
      feasibility and outcomes of a psychosexual intervention to support couples, drawing on the
      Medical Research Council complex intervention framework.

      The intervention will be developed from the extant and our pilot work. Men in outpatient
      surgical follow-up clinics will be screened using EPIC, and recruited if scoring under the
      clinical threshold for potency. 68 couples will be randomised to two arms, one receiving six
      sessions of couple-support from specially trained counsellors and the others receiving
      standard care. The primary outcome measure is health-related quality-of-life. Pre, post and
      6-month follow-up outcomes will be measured in both individual (quality of life;
      anxiety/depression) and in relational terms (relationship between couples). An economic
      analysis will identify population costs.

    <description>EPIC is a quality of life tool used in prostate cancer studies, focused on physical and sexual outcomes. It is validated with population norms. We used the sexual bother sub-scale as the primary outcome measure; score range 0-400. A higher score indicates better function/better outcome.</description>

    <description>The HADS has two scales: one anxiety and one depression. It is validated with population norms. Results are presented for T2 (6 month follow-up) and split by Patient, Partner and again by Intervention, Control.
Responses are scored on a scale of 0-3 (3 indicates higher symptom frequencies. Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0-7, mild 8-10, moderate 11-14, and severe 15-21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.</description>

    <description>6 session manualised intervention, This manual-based family-relational-psychosexual support was based on systemic principles combined with techniques from sex therapy, i.e. sensate focus. The manual offered an intermediate level of specificity, enabling practitioners to use their own therapeutic style and take some lead from the couple while meeting the objectives of the intervention. Specialist training in delivery of the intervention was provided to practitioners holding accredited counselling or psychotherapy qualifications. Practitioners engaged in routine clinical supervision with one additional team supervision session offered by one of the practitioners</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Score of ≤60 on EPIC (a signal of potency) (EPIC is the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index
             Composite)

          -  &gt;11 weeks post-operative for Prostate Cancer (PCa) (to recruit people who have
             recovered from the immediate effects from surgery and begun to regain some
             functioning. Follow-ups are held at 6weeks, 12weeks, 6months from surgery, until no
             further follow-up is required).

          -  Has a partner

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Does not have a partner (this is a couple intervention, the study can therefore only
             include men with a partner).

          -  Prognosis of ≤1year (Most men who have had recent surgery will have a good prognosis,
             consequently it is unlikely that many men will be excluded by this criteria.)

          -  Unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Residing in Dumfries and Galloway. The recruiting clinic sees patients from a wide
             catchment area. However to prevent excess burden on participants traveling to the
             intervention site in Edinburgh, the investigators will exclude those living in
             Dumfries and Galloway.

          -  &gt;2 years from surgery (since long term adaptation will have commenced).

          -  Unable to communicate in English (this is a feasibility trial, if the study moves to a
             full scale trial in future then it will seek to include couples and
             interpreters/translators).

Responses are scored on a scale of 0–3 (3 indicates higher symptom frequencies. Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0–7, mild 8–10, moderate 11–14, and severe 15–21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.</description>
