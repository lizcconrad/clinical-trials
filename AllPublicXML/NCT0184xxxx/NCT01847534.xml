      One of the essential treatments for assisting patients in their recovery from illness is the
      provision of nutrition in a liquid form which is delivered into the stomach or as a fluid
      into the vein. Until recently the benefits of nutrition were undervalued in the critically
      ill, however, it has now become clear that targeted nutrition can positively affect a
      person's outcome. This is particularly important for patients who are significantly unwell
      and require increased amounts of nutrition to support recovery. Inadequate nutrition therapy
      leads them to rapidly lose weight, predominantly in the form of muscle loss which greatly
      contributes to their poor recovery.

      Whilst nutrition is essential for recovery, there are several issues with the delivery of
      nutrition via the stomach (the most commonly used method of delivering nutrition in the
      critically ill). For many reasons, patients are unable to tolerate large quantities of
      nutrition via the stomach and in addition to this there are hospital or procedural reasons
      for nutrition being turned off for lengthy periods of time. As such, this results in patients
      being delivered only about half of the nutrition that is planned. One potential way to
      overcome this is to deliver nutrition via the vein, whilst nutrition into the stomach
      continues, with the aim to meet the energy gap that is lost by inadequate nutrition via the
      stomach.

      In this study of 100 patients, we will deliver combined nutrition via the vein and stomach in
      50 patients and the other 50 patients will receive nutrition as per normal practice. We will
      measure important outcomes for these patients to determine if this allows us to meet
      significantly more of their nutrition needs. This study will also help us determine how best
      to design a larger study of this strategy.

      The principal objectives are:

        1. To determine whether the supplemental Parenteral Nutrition (PN) strategy leads to the
           delivery of increased amounts of total nutrition (measured as energy delivered), and is
           safe in regards to adverse effects.

        2. To measure the clinical outcomes in patients receiving both study strategies to provide
           information to assist design of a larger randomized controlled trial.

           Secondary objectives in a sub-set of patients are:

        3. To determine whether the supplemental PN strategy leads to improved nitrogen balance.

        4. To determine both the nutritional requirements and nutritional intake of critically ill
           patients during the period of hospitalization after transfer from the Intensive Care
           Unit (ICU).

    <description>Supplemental PN to complete inadequate EN provision
Patients allocated to the supplemental PN (intervention) group will have PN commenced within 2 hours of randomisation. The starting dose of PN will be determined by the amount of energy received in the 24 hours prior to randomisation.
EN will be managed as per local protocol however EN must not be reduced based on the supplemental PN being administered.
The adequacy of nutrition provision from both PN and EN will be assessed at midday each day for 7 days or until ICU discharge. The dose of PN will be adjusted according to a prespecified schedule.</description>
