    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cluster randomized trial is to determine whether an intervention
      implemented in a General Surgery, based in improving patient-provider communication, results
      in a better diabetes self-management in patients with lower educational level. A secondary
      objective is to assess whether telephone reinforcement enhances the effect of such
      intervention.

    <description>is carried out by the GPs during the clinic visit and consists of seven visits, one every three months. Each session consists of completing a diabetes care record sheet (DCRS) together with the patient. The DCRS consists of two parts: Five questions on self-care activities in the last three months and a graph with previously measured HbA1c levels. This information is completed at each session, resulting in a graph showing the evolution of glycaemic control related to self-care activities. The DCRS is explained patients, emphasising the relationship between self-care and glycemic control. At the end of the session, patients are given a copy of the DCRS and suggested to show it and discuss it with their relatives.</description>

    <description>In this group patients receive the above described intervention A plus a telephone reinforcement It consists on five telephone calls lasting about 10 minutes each, to provide advice on carrying out physical exercise and eating a balanced diet and to encourage the use of health services related to diabetes control. Any problems or doubts that patients have stemming from any aspect of diabetes care are also discussed. Telephone reinforcement is carried out by a professional who has previously been trained in promoting T2DM self-management and in motivational interviewing techniques.</description>
