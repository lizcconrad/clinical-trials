  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness between CAELYX and topotecan
      hydrochloride (HCl) in Chinese participants with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma
      following failure of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy, who have received no more than
      one prior platinum-based regimen therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the
      study medication is assigned by chance), comparative bridging study (a supplemental study
      which performs to provide data of effectiveness, safety, and dosage to compare two study
      medications in a new region). The study consists of 3 phases: screening phase (30 days before
      administration of study medication), treatment phase, and follow up phase (every 8 weeks for
      tumor assessment until disease progression or death, or until the study completion, whichever
      is earlier and every 3 months after disease progression for overall survival and for
      anti-tumor therapy for a minimum of 1 year). In the treatment phase, approximately 120
      eligible participants will be categorized prospectively for platinum-sensitivity (sensitive
      versus refractory) and bulky disease (presence versus absence). Later on participants will be
      randomly assigned either to experimental arm (CAELYX: administer on Day 1 of each cycle) or
      control arm (topotecan HCl: administer on Day 1 to Day 5 of each cycle). Treatment will
      continue until disease progression occurs and may continue for at least 2 cycles after
      confirmed complete response (disappearance of all target lesions). On average, it is expected
      that participants will continue treatment for approximately 3 to 6 cycles in experimental arm
      (CAELYX) or 4 to 8 cycles in Control arm (topotecan HCl). Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram
      (or multiple gated acquisition scans), vital signs, and physical examination which will be
      monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be approximately 23
      months.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival Incidence at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival incidence was be measured as number of participants who were progression-free and alive. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after the last dose (24 weeks) administration</time_frame>
    <description>It was calculated as the time, in weeks, from the day of randomization until documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first using a Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was measured as number of participants with at least a durable response: Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is defined as at least a 30 percentage decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Stable disease defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease. Progression in disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Not evaluable participants were those who were not analyzed. The reference of the baseline sum of diameters of lesions was considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life Assessment (HQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each cycle of study medication and Week 4 after last dose of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>Calculation of each HQL domain scale will be performed according to the scoring guidelines for each of the HQL measures. The HQL analyses will include scales measuring physical functioning, pain, nausea, fatigue, and global quality of life. Each item is measured on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = no impact on quality of life and 3 = extreme impact on quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 after the last dose of the study medication and approximately up to 1 year after the disease progression or completion of the study treatment or death, whichever is earlier</time_frame>
    <description>Number of Participants With Overall survival were categorized as number of 1) Deaths, 2) Still alive, 3) Early termination from the study due to lost to follow up, 4) Early termination from the study due to withdraw of consent, 5) Other. Overall survival is defined as the time interval from randomization to death from any cause.</description>

        <description>Response rate was measured as number of participants with at least a durable response: Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is defined as at least a 30 percentage decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Stable disease defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease. Progression in disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Not evaluable participants were those who were not analyzed. The reference of the baseline sum of diameters of lesions was considered.</description>
