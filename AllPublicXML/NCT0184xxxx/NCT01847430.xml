  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term persistence of immunity to hepatitis B
      in adolescents aged 15-16 years who were vaccinated with Engerix™-B Kinder in infancy. The
      study will also assess the immune response to a challenge dose of Engerix™-B Kinder in these
      subjects.

      This MDD has been updated following the Protocol Amendment 1, dated 20 June 2013.

      The Protocol was amended because GSK replaced its in-house Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay
      (ELISA) that was used to measure anti-HBs (antibodies to Hepatitis B surface antigen)
      antibody concentrations with ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay (CLIA).

      Additionally, the threshold level of prednisone was modified to reflect the dosage normally
      prescribed to adolescents.
