  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This human pharmacokinetic study investigates, whether processes of drug metabolism and
      transport are determined by genetic or hereditary factors. Therefore, approved drugs are
      applied to twins and metabolism and transport processes are investigated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to study entry including informed consent for
             genetic research

          -  Both genders (male and female)

          -  Willingness to meet the study instructions and to co-operate with the study personal

          -  No clinically relevant pathological findings in any of the investigations at the
             Screening visit. Minor deviations of laboratory values from the normal range may be
             accepted, if judged by the investigator to have no clinical relevance

          -  Female subjects will only be included if they have negative serum pregnancy test
             during screening and the willingness not to become pregnant during the entire study
             period by practicing reliable methods of contraception as specified in the respective

             parameters.

          -  Any disease affecting liver or kidney or impairment of the liver or kidney-function

             drug (except appendectomy or herniotomy)

          -  Taking any medication within 7 days before or during the trial with the following
             exceptions: Single doses of mild analgesics (e.g. aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen) may
             have been taken except for the time from 6 hours prior to taking the test drug until
             24 hours after taking the test drug. Oral contraceptive drug used will be documented
             but will not be an exclusion criterion. Other medication might be allowed on single
             case basis if considered necessary for the subject's safety and well-being.

          -  History of alcohol and/or drug addiction and/or any abusive use of medicaments and/or
             positive drug screen

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis

          -  If hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to one of the IMPs is known so enrolment is
             possible but application of the concerned IMP must not be allowed in all siblings

          -  Clinically significant diseases as judged by the investigator

          -  Body temperature &gt; 37.5°C prior to drug application
