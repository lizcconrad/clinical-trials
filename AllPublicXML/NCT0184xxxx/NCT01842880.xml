      The purpose of this study is to analyze the efficacy of MicroRNAs as biomarkers on the Chagas
      Disease prognosis. This analysis will be done through the correlation between the plasmatic
      levels of this molecule with functional and laboratory tests.

      The patients included in the study must at first sign the written consent. They shall be
      accompanied in the specialized outpatient clinics for Chagas disease - Hospital São Rafael -
      Centro de Biotecnologia e Terapia Celular. They will be submitted to several tests,
      including:

        -  Collection of Blood samples for biochemical analysis;

        -  Electrocardiogram;

        -  Holter Electrocardiogram;

        -  Echocardiogram;

        -  Treadmill Test;

        -  X-Ray Imaging;

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging;

        -  Evaluation of the quality of life through the application of questionnaires (SF 36 and
           the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire).
