  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat many types of cancer including bowel and
      stomach cancer. Unfortunately a side effect of this drug is that it causes heart problems
      including heart attacks. An alternative drug, called teysuno is used extensively in other
      countries instead of capecitabine and appears to have less of a bad effect on the heart
      whilst still killing cancer cells. This study will investigate the effect of these two drugs
      on the heart and blood vessels and will be the first of its kind in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluoropyrimidines (FPs) are widely used chemotherapy agents for the management of patients
      with colorectal, breast, upper gastrointestinal, head and neck cancers. Capecitabine is an
      oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) which is used extensively in the UK but is associated
      with clinically overt cardiotoxicity in up to 9% of patients. Cardiotoxicity occurs more
      commonly in patients with cardiovascular disease and manifests as chest pain, myocardial
      infarction, congestive heart failure, or sudden death with a mortality as high as 30%. In a
      study of continuous ECG Holter monitoring in patients receiving 5FU infusion, the majority
      (68%) of patients had ischaemic ECG changes and 2 patients died suddenly. We conducted a
      national survey of UK oncologists and 60% felt that 5FU/capecitabine cardiotoxicity was a
      significant problem in their clinical practice.

      Hypotheses for this toxicity include ischaemia secondary to coronary artery spasm, direct
      endothelial cell toxicity, myocardial toxicity and interactions with the coagulation system.
      Studies implicate a catabolite of 5FU, in particular fluoro-alanine (FBAL). FBAL is further
      metabolized to fluoroacetate (FAC), a cardiac toxin that inhibits mitochondrial aconitase,
      resulting in cell death.

      Teysuno is an oral fluoropyrimidine that has recently obtained a European licence. It is a
      combination of tegafur (5-FU prodrug), gimeracil (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)
      inhibitor) and oteracil (phosphorylation inhibitor). There have been no reports of cardiac
      toxicity with teysuno. The incorporation of a DPD inhibitor should reduce FBAL concentrations
      which may prevent FP cardiotoxicity. However, this remains to be established.
