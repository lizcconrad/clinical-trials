  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate the effects of Â±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
      (MDMA; ecstasy) on social and emotional processing in healthy humans. Ecstasy is a widely
      used recreational drug, with over 2 million Americans reporting use of the drug in 2006. With
      this number of users, and evidence that high doses of MDMA are neurotoxic in laboratory
      animals, the public health implications of ecstasy use may be substantial. Certain subjective
      effects of this drug distinguish it from other stimulants, and may contribute to its
      widespread use: That is, users report that ecstasy produces profound feelings of empathy and
      closeness to others. These so-called 'empathogenic' effects, which may reflect the
      distinctive neurochemical profile of action of the drug, have yet to be characterized in
      controlled laboratory studies. The investigators propose to characterize the effects of MDMA
      on measures of social and emotional processing that may contribute to this 'empathogenic'
      profile, including measures of emotion recognition, emotional responsiveness and sociability.
      The investigators will assess effects of MDMA (0, 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg up to 125 mg) one active
      control drug (oxytocin: 20 IU) in 100 volunteers who report some prior ecstasy use. Oxytocin
      will be used because it appears to produce pro-social behavioral effects resembling those
      attributed to MDMA.

    <measure>Emotional Recognition (MDMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes during each session</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete the Dynamic Emotional Identification Task, or DEIT (Wardle et al. 2012) following MDMA, oxytocin or placebo administration during which they identify emotional facial expressions presented on the screen. Participants completed this task once during each of the sessions.
In the DEIT, 10 actors performed angry, fearful, sad, and happy expressions, for a total of 40 sequences, which were presented in random order. Each sequence consisted of 50 &quot;frames&quot; progressing from 0 to 100% emotional intensity at 2% steps, producing a color video of an emotional expression developing. Participants were instructed to &quot;press the space bar as soon as you know what expression is being displayed.&quot; This ended the sequence and presented options of &quot;angry,&quot; &quot;fearful,&quot; &quot;sad,&quot; and &quot;happy.&quot;
Perception of expressions was quantified as the intensity (0-100 %) of the face when the participant pressed the space bar for correctly identified sequences.</description>

      <recruitment_details>From July 2010-June 2012, healthy male and non-pregnant female occasional ecstasy users, aged between 18 and 35 years, were recruited through posters, print and internet advertisements and word-of-mouth referrals. All recruitment and study procedures were conducted in a medical laboratory setting.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were excluded for one of or more of the following reasons: history of adverse effects from ecstasy; current Axis I disorders; medical conditions precluding participation including high blood pressure, abnormal EKG, first degree relatives with heart disease; pregnancy or lactation (females), and significant nasal or sinus condition.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Emotional Recognition (MDMA)</title>
        <description>Participants complete the Dynamic Emotional Identification Task, or DEIT (Wardle et al. 2012) following MDMA, oxytocin or placebo administration during which they identify emotional facial expressions presented on the screen. Participants completed this task once during each of the sessions.
In the DEIT, 10 actors performed angry, fearful, sad, and happy expressions, for a total of 40 sequences, which were presented in random order. Each sequence consisted of 50 âframesâ progressing from 0 to 100% emotional intensity at 2% steps, producing a color video of an emotional expression developing. Participants were instructed to âpress the space bar as soon as you know what expression is being displayed.â This ended the sequence and presented options of âangry,â âfearful,â âsad,â and âhappy.â
Perception of expressions was quantified as the intensity (0â100 %) of the face when the participant pressed the space bar for correctly identified sequences.</description>

        <description>Participants complete the social choice task following administration of MDMA or placebo during which they choose between spending time 1) talking with another person; 2) sitting quietly alone; or 3) solving word problems. Choices were rated on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 indicating the highest level of desire to engage in that activity). The main outcome measure was desire to socialize (i.e., rating of &quot;talking to another person&quot;).</description>

          <description>Participants complete the social choice task following administration of MDMA or placebo during which they choose between spending time 1) talking with another person; 2) sitting quietly alone; or 3) solving word problems. Choices were rated on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 indicating the highest level of desire to engage in that activity). The main outcome measure was desire to socialize (i.e., rating of &quot;talking to another person&quot;).</description>

Within-subjects (oxytocin and placebo): This was a within-subjects, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled experiment during which each participant received oxytocin (20 IU) on one session and placebo on one session.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Behavioral measures may not have been obtained at optimal times to detect oxytocin effects. Placebo and oxytocin nasal spray formulations differed slightly. Other potential limitations are the selection of participants, or the doses administered.</limitations_and_caveats>
