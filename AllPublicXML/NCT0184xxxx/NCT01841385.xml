    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a fitness program from the application
      of Pilates on lung function, thoracoabdominal mobility and respiratory muscle strength in
      women.

    <textblock>
      Study in the Cardiorespiratory Physiotherapy laboratory and clinics of Pilates in the region,
      in which the voluntary of the Pilates group would start the Pilates method.

      The study included women with body mass index (BMI) ≤ 29 kg/m2 were not engaged in regular
      physical activity, or sedentary lifestyle with scores up to eight, according to Baecke et
      al., non-smoker, non-alcoholic, without any abnormalities of the cardiovascular, respiratory
      and neuromuscular.

      The study excluded women with disabling diseases, pregnancy, postpartum less than a year,
      inability to understand the tests and exercises proposed or refuse to participate in the
      study.

      The volunteers, aged between 25 and 55 years, were allocated in to two groups:

        1. Pilates Group (n = 16): sedentary volunteers, but that would begin activities with the
           Pilates method and evaluated three months.

        2. Control group (n = 13): sedentary volunteers and remain sedentary and evaluated in three
           months.

    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was carried out according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) (2005). Three types of maneuver were used in order to evaluate the lung volumes and flows: Slow Vital Capacity (SVC), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV). The maneuvers were carried out until three acceptable and reproducible curves were obtained, not exceeding more than eight attempts. The values extracted from each maneuver were selected according to Pereira (2002), and the predicted values calculated using the equation proposed by Pereira et al. (1992) for Brazilians.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Thoracoabdominal mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of thoracoabdominal mobility was performed by using a tape scaled in centimeters. In the standing position, the measurements were made at levels axillary, xiphoid and abdominal, during rest, and at maximal inspiration and maximal expiration. At each level, the measurements were performed three times. It computed the highest value of inspiration and the lowest of expiration. The absolute difference between these values was considered the thoracoabdominal mobility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle strength was assessed by measuring maximal respiratory pressures (MRP) with the use of an analog manometer, with operating range of ± 300 cmH2O.
The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was measured from a maximal expiration, near the residual volume. The maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) was measured from a maximal inspiration, near total lung capacity. Each inspiratory or expiratory effort was sustained for at least two seconds and was respected the 45 seconds between each maneuver.
To minimize the learning effect five measurements were performed and the difference between them should be as high as 10%. Was considered for analysis the highest value obtained.</description>
