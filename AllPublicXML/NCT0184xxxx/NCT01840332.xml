    <textblock>
      The treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DCT) includes surgery followed by radioiodine
      treatment. In the follow-up of patients it is necessary to induce TSH elevation to test for
      cancer recurrence. One of the options is to stop L-thyroxin replacement for several weeks.
      Current pilot study aims to induce the necessary TSH elevation by decreasing the L-thyroxin
      dose. The main hypothesis is that necessary TSH stimulation will be achieved during 4-6 weeks
      in majority of patients.

      The treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DCT) includes surgery followed by radioiodine
      treatment. In the follow-up of patients it is necessary to induce TSH elevation for the
      measurement of thyreoglobulin and/or total body scanning. There are two principal methods to
      obtain TSH elevation: 1) injection of recombinant human TSH , and 2) to stop L-thyroxin
      replacement for several (3-4) weeks. As use of recombinant TSH is rather expensive, this
      method is not feasible in many countries. The problem with stopping L-thyroxin is development
      of severe hypothyroidism for several weeks with concomitant symptoms and signs.

      Current pilot study aims to induce the necessary TSH elevation by decreasing the L-thyroxin
      dose. The main hypothesis is that necessary TSH stimulation will be achieved during 4-6 weeks
      in majority of patients with fixed dose of L-thyroxin. Concomitantly, blood tests and
      symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism will be obtained to get information about possible
      deviations during treatment with low dose of thyroxin.
