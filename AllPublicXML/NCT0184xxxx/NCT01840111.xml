  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goals of this proposal are to 1) identify the network of brain regions
      specifically activated by personal smoking environment cues and 2) to evaluate the effects of
      exposure to these cues on smoke self-administration and subjective reactivity. The results of
      this study will inform the development of novel and more efficacious cue-exposures therapies
      targeted at helping smokers quit smoking and will provide novel mechanism information
      regarding the influence of environmental context on drug taking.

      The investigator hypothesizes that cue-exposure treatments (CETs), in which drug use is
      prevented during exposure to drug cues (e.g. lit cigarette) have been of limited efficacy in
      part because they have not included cues representative of the contexts in which drug use
      occurs. By demonstrating that context cues have a differential and robust influence on brain
      and behavioral responses, we will have provided a substantial basis for including such
      stimuli in the context of treatment. At the same time, we will have identified novel
      mechanisms by which such stimuli promote continued drug use and relapse.
