  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot; Cohort CP &quot; is a multicentre cohort study, initiated by the Hospices Civils de Lyon in
      September 2009. Population targeted are children with bilateral cerebral palsy, level GMFCS
      IV or V, aged from 2 to 10 years at inclusion. They are followed-up during 10 years, at the
      rhythm of 1 visit per year. At each visit are collected clinical, orthopaedic, radiological
      and environmental data.

      The primary objective is to establish the incidence of orthopaedic complications (scoliosis
      and hip joint) depending on patients' age.

      Secondary objectives are to describe the sequences over time of these complications and the
      related pain, to explore the impact of nutrition, surgery, asymmetric postures and
      environmental factors, and to describe the medical and rehabilitative follow-up of these
      patients.

      385 patients are expected by the end of 2016. We expect of this long-term follow-up to gain
      tools that permit to improve patient's care and patient's quality of life, by putting in
      place preventing actions and adapted treatments related to their own pathologies.

    <description>Hip migration is measured in percentage (Rimers method), and scoliosis is measured in degrees (Cobb angle).
For the first visit (A00= inclusion), if hip migration measured on the last radiography is ≥ 20%, it is asked to trace the history of the migration with measurements of previous patient's radiographies. For this first visit, if the Cobb angle on the last radiography is ≥ 20°, it is also asked to trace history of scoliosis with previous radiographies.
For the following visits (A01 to A10), only the last radiography is required for each year.</description>

    <description>Pattern of individual evolution of pain function of age, and quantification of orthopedic surgery impact on pain evolution.
Pain is measured with the DESS scale (Douleur Enfant San Salvadour) for children with no oral language, or with the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) for children who have an oral language. In addition, the location, the frequency and the length of time of the related pain are recorded on the Case Report Form.</description>
