  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to demonstrate that Deep Inspiration Breath Hold
      (DIBH), the technique used at the University of North Carolina (UNC) for left-side breast
      cancer radiation therapy, can reduce side effects to the heart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the rate of radiation-associated regional
      myocardial perfusion defects in patients 6 months after breast/chestwall radiation with DIBH
      for left-sided breast cancer. Cardiac perfusion will be assessed using SPECT cardiac
      perfusion scans pre- and 6 months post-radiation.

    <measure>Changes in cardiac perfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months post radiation</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac perfusion will be assessed using SPECT cardiac perfusion scans pre- and 6 months post-radiation. Any post-radiation summed-rest score (SRS) &gt; 0 will be counted as a perfusion defect in the calculation of the perfusion defect rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wall-motion abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of wall-motion abnormalities will be assessed using SPECT in the same 12 segment scoring system used to quantify perfusion. Wall-motion abnormalities will be recorded as present or absent in each cardiac segment. When present, wall-motion abnormalities wil be classified as gypokinetic, akinetic, or dyskinetic. The extent of wall involvement (small or large portion) will be described as mild or severe.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent document for
             protocol

          -  age &gt;= 18 years

          -  histologically confirmed left-sided breast cancer scheduled to undergo curative intent
             radiation treatment post lumpectomy or mastectomy

          -  stage 0-III left-sided breast cancer (including DCIS)

          -  SPECT score of 0 at baseline

          -  radiation oncologist agrees target volume coverage will not be compromised via use of
             the DIBH technique along with conformal field shaping

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  active cardiac disease, defined as a history of angina, arrhythmias, myocardial
             infarction, congestive heart failure, or any other cardiac condition, which in the
             opinion of the treating physician would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for
             the patient

          -  symptomatic pulmonary disease currently requiring regular medication including but not
             restricted to bronchodilators
