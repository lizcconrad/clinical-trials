  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine use disorders are an unrelenting public health concern. Intensive research
      efforts have yielded behavioral interventions that reduce methamphetamine use, however, these
      interventions are not universally effective and treatment effects diminish over time.
      Development of a pharmacotherapy that enhances the efficacy of these interventions is a
      priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This study proposes to determine the
      impact of buspirone maintenance on self-administration of methamphetamine. These preliminary
      data will be used to support further research developing buspirone as a pharmacotherapy for
      methamphetamine use disorders. The investigators hypothesize that buspirone will attenuate
      the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine.

    <measure>Number of Methamphetamine Doses Self-Administered</measure>
    <time_frame>One test per methamphetamine dose level per intervention for each participant over his/her approximate 25 day inpatient admission</time_frame>
    <description>The reinforcing effects of methamphetamine will be determined during placebo and buspirone treatment using a modified progressive ratio procedure in which subjects are offered the opportunity to earn previously sampled doses of methamphetamine. Each ratio completed on the task will earn 1/10th of the sampled dose.</description>

    <measure>Peak Score on Sedative Subscale of the Adjective Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects completed this measure at 15 minute intervals for 2 hours after sampling each methamphetamine dose under both buspirone and placebo maintenance conditions.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed 16 items that loaded into the Sedative Subscale of the Adjective Rating Scale. The items were rated 0-4 on a Likert-type scale and the sum for the 16 &quot;sedative&quot; items was summed to yield the Sedative Subscale score. The maximum score for this scale was 64, the minimum was 0. Higher values represent greater subjective effects on this item. Peak scores were calculated from multiple assessments for each methamphetamine dose under both bupsirone and placebo conditions.</description>
