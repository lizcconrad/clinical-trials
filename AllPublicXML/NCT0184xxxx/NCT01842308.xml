    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of carfilzomib when given
      together with melphalan and to see how well they work in treating patients with multiple
      myeloma before stem cell transplant. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving carfilzomib together with melphalan may kill
      more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib that can be added to high
      dose melphalan as part of conditioning chemotherapy for myeloma. (Phase I) II. To determine
      the efficacy of the combination in patients with myeloma undergoing stem cell
      transplantation, as defined by achievement of complete response (CR). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the toxicities associated with addition of carfilzomib to high dose melphalan
      in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

      II. To determine the progression free rate at 1 and 2 years post registration.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)
      negative status.

      II. To assess the HevyLite assay prior to and during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib followed by a phase II
      study.

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -6, -5,
      -2, and -1. Patients also receive melphalan IV over 1 hour on days -4 and -3.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30, day 100, and then
      every 90 days for up to 5 years.
