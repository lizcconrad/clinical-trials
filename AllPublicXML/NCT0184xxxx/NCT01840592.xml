  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of
      the drug sorafenib in combination with the drug doxorubicin might have on the growth and
      spread of liver cancer (HCC).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of HCC confirmed histologically, excluding mixed HCC histology (e.g. HCC
             plus cholangiocarcinoma) or fibrolamellar variant.

          -  Prior treatment with sorafenib as single agent or in combination, with no less than
             200 mg once every other day dose of sorafenib, with radiologic evidence of progression
             of disease.

          -  Measurable disease using RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          -  Non-cirrhotic or no more than Child-Pugh A cirrhosis.

          -  Expected survival of at least 3 months.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  KPS ≥ 70%

          -  Fully recovered from any prior surgery and/or radiation and none within 2 weeks of
             initiating treatment.

          -  Patients may have been treated with locoregional liver directed therapies such as
             embolization, chemo-embolization including drug-eluting beads doxorubicin
             chemoembolization (prior non drug eluting beads chemoembolization with doxorubicin is
             excluded), radiation, radioactive microspheres, etc., provided that they either have a
             target lesion that has not been subjected to local therapy and/or the target lesion(s)
             within the field of the local therapy has shown an increase of ≥25% in the size since
             last treatment. Such therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to treatment
             initiation. Patients that have received palliative radiation therapy to the bone need
             not wait 4 weeks to begin protocol therapy.

          -  Informed consent must be obtained prior to study initiation.

          -  Total bilirubin ≤3.0 mg/dL and no evidence of bile obstruction.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/μL.

          -  Platelets ≥75,000/μL.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal range, or, if serum creatinine &gt;1.5
             x the upper limit of normal range, then the creatinine clearance must be ≥ 60 mL/min.

          -  Subjects with active hepatitis B or C on anti-viremic compounds may remain on such
             treatment, except for interferon.

          -  Patients with a history of hypertension should be well controlled (&lt; 140/90 mmHg) on a
             regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy.

          -  Brain metastases are allowed if well controlled and without seizures.

          -  Prior palliative radiation therapy to bone sites is allowed as long as it is completed
             more than two weeks ago.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant cardiac disease:

          -  Congestive heart failure &gt; Class II New York Heart Association (NYHA).

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or
             digoxin.

          -  Serious myocardial dysfunction, defined as scintigraphically (MUGA, myocardial
             scintigram) or echocardiogram determined absolute left ventricular ejection fraction
             (LVEF) below normal (&lt;50%).

          -  Participation in concurrent investigational studies.

          -  Prior loco-regional therapy including drug-eluting beads doxorubicin chemoembolization
             (prior non drug eluting beads chemoembolization with doxorubicin is excluded) is
             allowed.

          -  Prior exposure to systemic intravenously given doxorubicin.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness or psychiatric illness or social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Subjects with history of another primary cancer, with the exception of: a) curatively
             resected non-melanoma skin cancer; b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ;
             or c) other primary solid tumor with no known active disease present in the opinion of
             the investigator will not affect patient outcome in the setting of current HCC
             diagnosis. Allografts, including but not limited to liver and bone marrow transplants.

          -  Bleeding esophageal or gastric varices within 30 days prior to treatment initiation.

        Concomitant treatment with Rifampin or St John's Wort. Patients should discontinue these
        drugs at least 4 weeks prior to starting protocol treatment.

          -  Subjects known to be HIV positive.

          -  History of bleeding diathesis.
