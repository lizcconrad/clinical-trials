    <textblock>
      The application of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has provided remarkable opportunities for
      infertile couple to conceive in the last four decades. Historically IVF was performed for
      patients with bilateral tubal obstruction, but its use is presently widespread. Although the
      efficacy of assisted reproductive technology continues to improve, endometrial implantation
      remains the limiting step towards a successful pregnancy. Reduced endometrial receptivity and
      embryonic defects are the probable primary causes of implantation failure during IVF(1).
      Patients with repeated implantation failure despite transferring good-quality embryos
      continue to be a major dilemma for clinicians and are a topic of great research interest.
      Barash et al. unintentionally discovered and initially reported that an endometrial biopsy
      prior to IVF in women who have had one or more implantation failures was associated with an
      increased clinical pregnancy (66.7% vs 30.3%, p&lt;0.01) and live birth rates 48.9% vs 22.5%,
      p=0.02) compared to a control group(2). The mechanism by which a local endometrial injury
      (LEI) may increase the pregnancy rate is still not fully clear. Possible etiologies include
      its role in promoting a beneficial local inflammatory response, inducing endometrial
      decidualization, or improving endometrial maturation synchrony (3-6).

      Following Barash et al's publication, several randomized controlled studies confirmed their
      findings (7-11). However, there has been extensive heterogeneity among studies, including the
      number of biopsies, how the biopsy is performed and the selected patient population. On the
      other hand all the studies have in common that the endometrial biopsy was performed prior to
      the start of the IVF cycle.

      The optimal timing of an endometrial biopsy with respect to an IVF cycle is unknown. There is
      reason to suspect that an endometrial biopsy during the follicular phase of an IVF
      stimulation cycle may improve pregnancy outcomes, although this has not been directly
      examined. We therefore propose a randomized controlled study to evaluate the impact of an
      endometrial biopsy on the implantation and pregnancy rate in both the luteal phase prior to
      the IVF cycle as well as the follicular phase of the concurrent IVF cycles.

      HYPOTHESIS

        1. Local endometrial injury improves implantation and pregnancy rates

        2. Specifically, local endometrial injury during the follicular phase of an IVF cycle
           improves the implantation and pregnancy rates in comparison to that in the luteal phase
           prior to ovarian stimulation .

      OBJECTIVES Primary objective

      •To determine the impact of local endometrial injury on implantation rates in patients
      undergoing fresh IVF cycles.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To determine the impact of local endometrial injury on pregnancy outcomes (biochemical
           pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate) in
           patients undergoing fresh IVF cycles.

        -  To determine the optimal timing for local endometrial injury (mid-luteal phase prior to
           ovarian stimulation or early follicular phase during ovarian stimulation) to improve
           pregnancy outcomes.

        -  To determine if there is a correlation between endometrial biopsy pathology and IVF
           pregnancy outcomes among patients randomized to local endometrial injury.

      STUDY DESIGN The study will be a randomized controlled study (RCT) and consists of patients
      undergoing fertility treatment with their second fresh IVF cycle, which includes ovarian
      stimulation with gonadotropin hormones (&quot;microdose flare protocol&quot;), an oocyte collection
      procedure and a single embryo transfer.

      The patient population will be randomized using computer-generated random table into three
      arms:

        -  Luteal Phase Arm: LEI in mid-luteal phase (day 21-26) prior to the treatment cycle.

        -  Proliferative Phase Arm: LEI in early proliferative phase of current treatment cycle
           (day 2-3).

        -  Control Arm: No LEI will be performed. Patients will undergo a routine fresh IVF
           treatment cycle.

      Other than the local endometrial injury, all patients will receive the same treatment and
      follow up care as per standard practice at our clinic.

      All patients in this study will undergo a &quot;microdose flare protocol&quot; fresh IVF cycle. As part
      of this protocol patients are to take oral contraception pills for a month duration prior to
      the start of the IVF cycle. Therefore the possibility of an undocumented pregnancy at the
      time of the LEI in the luteal phase is minimized.

      The LEI will be performed using the standard technique using a Pipelle sampling catheter in
      the outpatient department. After a speculum examination is performed and the cervix is well
      visualized, the Pipelle will be inserted gently through the cervical canal into the uterine
      cavity and advanced slowly until resistance is noted. At this point the internal piston is
      withdrawn to create negative suction and the Pipelle is gently maneuvered up and down
      alongside the uterine cavity wall. The Pipelle catheter is then withdrawn gently and any
      obtained specimen (uterine lining) will be sent for histopathological examination.

      Both the embryologist who prepares the embryo and the physician who will transfer the embryo
      will not be directly aware of which study arm the patient was allocated to. However all
      procedures performed at our clinic, including a LEI, are documented on the patients chart and
      therefore are accessible.

      As per routine practice at our clinic, pregnancy tests will be performed by quantitative
      serum beta-hCG level 12 days after embryo transfer. A clinical pregnancy will be confirmed by
      using a transvaginal ultrasound 2 weeks after a positive pregnancy test (serum BHCG).
