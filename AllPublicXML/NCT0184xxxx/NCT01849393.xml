  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to assess the study population's acceptance of two
      medication adherence support strategies: incentive-based programs and electronic medication
      monitoring. The study population is adolescents (ages 16 - 24) positive for human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) currently undergoing treatment with antiretrovirals at St.
      Jude's HIV clinic. Participation in the study will involve completion of a survey: an Audio
      Computer Assisted Self Interview (ACASI). The duration of the survey is anticipated to be
      10-20 minutes. Patient identifiers will not be attached the survey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whether or not patients take their medications is one of the most noticeable and important
      predictors of treatment success or failure for HIV infection. Ways to improve compliance,
      specifically rewards-based programs and electronic medication monitoring, have shown some
      success in limited clinical research studies focused on adult subjects. Because the social
      and developmental factors in adolescents are different from adults, adolescents may not
      respond to these interventions in the same way as adults. This study will investigate
      adolescent acceptance and the effectiveness of these programs.

    <description>Participants will complete a survey/questionnaire on the computer describing their disease state, the frequency and amount of medication taken daily, and how well they comply with taking their medications and attending their clinic appointments. They will also note their perceptions about how incentive-based adherence programs and electronic medication monitoring. Descriptive statistics will be prepared from survey results.</description>

          -  HIV positive

          -  Ages 16-24 years.

          -  Participants must understand written or spoken English, because the ACASI used in the
