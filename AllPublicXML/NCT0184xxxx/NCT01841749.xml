  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) and
      a mastectomy indication will be obtained by calculating the proportion of women with GAS
      in-patient population that will prove to be DCIS or DCIS-MI + CCI. A confidence interval of
      95% will be deferred.

      The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with DCIS and a mastectomy indication
      will be obtained by calculating the proportion of women with GAS in-patient population that
      will prove to be DCIS or DCIS-MI + CCI (after the final histology). A confidence interval of
      95% will be deferred (binomial).

      The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with DCIS-MI and an indication of
      mastectomy is obtained by calculating the proportion of women with a GAS-all women with
      DCIS-MI and an indication of mastectomy. A confidence interval of 95% will be deferred
      (binomial).
