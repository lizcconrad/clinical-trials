  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease associated with infiltration of cluster of
      differentiation 4(CD4 +) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) + cells around the hair
      follicles. One of the therapeutic approaches of inflammatory diseases such as alopecia areata
      is the induction of tolerance. This tolerance induction can be obtained by stimulating
      regulatory T cells (Treg). The low-dose interleukin-2 plays a central role in the
      development, expansion, regulation and survival of regulatory T cells CD4 + cluster of
      differentiation 25 (CD25) + forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3). Recently, recombinant interleukin
      2 (IL2-R) with low dose showed very promising results in two inflammatory disease (GVHD
      vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia secondary to hepatitis C): clinical efficacy, increased
      population Treg in the blood and an excellent safety profile. We hypothesized that
      administration of IL2-R in patients with severe alopecia areata might allow regrowth via
      activation of Treg and thus induce regrowth of the air.
