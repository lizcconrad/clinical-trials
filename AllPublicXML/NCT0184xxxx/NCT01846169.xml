      This application, funded by the American Association of Retired Persons(AARP) Foundation, is
      to implement the Healthy Eating for at Risk Older Adults (HERO) initiative. This initiative
      will address barriers of affordability, and reduced mobility by providing older adults with
      nutritious foods that are usually difficult to purchase due to high cost; delivering needed
      foods to individuals in their homes; tailoring food delivery frequency based on level of food
      insecurity; and offering basic nutrition education.

    <description>Frequency of food deliveries is based on level of food insecurity at baseline (i.e., more food insecurity receives more frequent food deliveries). Deliveries are tailored to the diet of the client (e.g., consist of soft foods if participant has trouble chewing; has more fruits and vegetables if that was a food category the participant at less of at baseline). The brief nutrition education is a review of basic nutrition concepts and healthy eating ideas.</description>
