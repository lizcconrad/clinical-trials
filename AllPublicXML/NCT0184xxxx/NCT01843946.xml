  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Roxithromycin is effective in the treatment of intracellular organisms, including chlamydia
      and mycoplasma, and exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects on respiratory
      diseases. To explore the potential therapeutic benefit of roxithromycin in chronic
      prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), this study compared the effect of
      roxithromycin with ciprofloxacin and aceclofenac.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 75 patients with CP/CPPS were randomized to three groups in open-label: group 1,
      ciprofloxacin; group 2, aceclofenac; and group 3, roxithromycin. The patients were treated
      for 4 weeks and were subsequently followed for 12 weeks. Changes from baseline in the total
      and domain scores of the NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) were evaluated.
