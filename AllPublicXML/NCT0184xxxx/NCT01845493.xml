  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a pilot study of daily treatment with oral sulforaphane (SFN)
      for 3 days to determine if Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) induction is
      possible with this supplementation regimen in individuals with allergic asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine if oral SFN supplementation can induce NRF2 and NRF2-dependent
      phase II enzymes in nasal epithelial cells of allergic asthmatics. Subjects will receive both
      a SFN-rich broccosprout homogenate preparation and an alfalfa sprout homogenate (placebo) in
      a crossover fashion. mRNA levels of NRF2 and NRF2-dependent phase II enzymes will be compared
      between the active and placebo periods.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18-50 of both genders

          2. History of episodic wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath after age of 6
             years consistent with asthma, or physician diagnosed asthma after age of 6 years.

          3. AND: Positive methacholine test. A positive test is defined as a provocative
             concentration of methacholine of 10 mg/ml or less producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20
             methacholine). Methacholine challenge in a separate screening protocol (98-0799), or
             from other venues will be accepted.

          4. OR: Pre and post bronchodilator FEV1 improvement by 12% or more after 4 puffs of
             albuterol inhaler.

          5. FEV1 of at least 80% of predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio of at least .70 (without use of
             bronchodilating medications for 12 hours), consistent with lung function of persons
             with no more than mild episodic or mild persistent asthma (NHANES III predicted set).

          6. Allergic sensitization to at least one of the following allergen preparations: (House
             Dust Mite f, House dust mite p, Cockroach, Tree mix, Grass Mix, Weed Mix, Mold Mix 1,
             Mold Mix 2, Rat, Mouse, Guinea Pig, Rabbit, Cat or Dog) confirmed by positive
             immediate skin test response in a separate screening protocol. Proof of allergy from
             other venues, including ImmunoCAP testing from a medical workup, provided by the
             subject, will be accepted.

          7. Oxygen saturation of &gt; 94 % and normal blood pressure (Systolic between 150 - 90,
             Diastolic between 90-60 mm Hg)

          8. Willing to provide information regarding health history and habits of cigarette smoke
             exposure;

          9. Willing to avoid antioxidant vitamins and cruciferous vegetables as well as
             juices/drinks with added vitamin supplements for 2 days prior the baseline screening
             visit and throughout initial dosing period.

         10. Subjects must be willing to avoid antihistamine use for 4 days prior to each session
             and NSAIDs for 7 days prior to each session. Nasal steroids must be held for 2 weeks
             prior to the session.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical history or underlying health problems that preclude participation in the
             protocol per the study physician;

          2. Current nutritional disorder such as anorexia, bulimia, irritable bowel syndrome,
             Crohn's disease etc;

          3. Use of oral corticosteroids within the past 4 weeks;

          4. Presence of upper or lower respiratory tract infection or treatment with antibiotics
             within the previous 4 weeks;

          5. Pregnancy as determined by menstrual history or urine pregnancy test;

          6. Current smokers will be excluded. Anyone with a smoking history &gt; 0.5 pack year and/or
             &gt;1 pack per month will also be excluded.

          7. History of bleeding disorder;

          8. Recent nasal surgery (with 6 months). If a subject has had nasal surgery between 6
             months and 5 years, a study physician will visualize the area prior to the biopsy to
             evaluate the suitability of the nose for the procedure.

          9. History of intolerance of or aversion to broccoli

         10. Unable to withhold nasal steroids for 2 weeks before each session. These subjects may
             be deferred until after their allergy season.
