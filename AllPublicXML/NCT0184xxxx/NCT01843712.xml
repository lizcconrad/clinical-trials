  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The aims were to measure caloric compensation (CC) and eating in the absence of
      hunger (EAH) in 2 to 7 year-old French children in their regular eating context and to link
      these measurements with individual characteristics (adiposity, age, gender) and parental
      feeding practices.

      Design: Three consecutive weeks an identical lunch was served in four preschool canteens
      reaching 236 children. The first lunch was a control session. For the CC situation (week 2),
      thirty minutes before the lunch children were offered a preload (137 kcal). For the EAH
      situation (week 3), ten minutes after lunch children were exposed to palatable foods (430
      kcal). Food intake was measured at the individual level. Parental eating behaviour and
      feeding practices were measured by questionnaires. Child's height and weight were measured by
      a medical doctor.

    <description>In order to collect measurements of caloric compensation, children were offered a chocolate bun 30 minutes before the lunch on the second week. The food intake at lunch was recorded. We calculated if children compensated the chocolate bun, by comparing energy intake at this lunch with energy intake from the control lunch which took place on week 1.</description>
