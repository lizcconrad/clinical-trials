    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate heart rate variability during Acute uncomplicated
      diverticulitis by ECG-monitor (Holter), the investigators hypothesis is the inflammation
      causes a decrease of High Frequency(HF)-power component of heart rate variability and this
      correlates with sleep quality and daytime fatigue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of studies have shown that circadian variation in the excretion of
      hormones, the sleep-wake cycle, the core body temperature, the tone of the autonomic nervous
      system and the activity rhythm are important both in health and disease processes. The
      investigators are interested in investigating the heart rate variability (HRV) during an
      acute surgical non-inflammatory condition, and to exam whether there are correlations
      between: HRV and sleep stages, HRV and cytokine levels in blood and HRV and subjective
      fatigue.

      Following methods will be applied

      Device: Holter monitor - Medilog AR12 (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, England)

      Other: Karolinska Sleepiness Scale

      Other: Physical Fatigue Scale

      Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA)

      Procedure: Plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF(tumor necrosis factor)-alfa)

      Procedure: Plasma CRP(C reactive protein) and leukocytes
