  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to look for factors that influence whether or not head and
      neck cancer patients follow the swallowing exercises that they are asked to perform while
      receiving radiation treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer patients who receive radiation are at risk for permanent swallowing
      disorders. Because of these potential problems, swallowing exercises are an important part of
      recovery. Researchers want to learn what factors affect how well patients follow the
      swallowing schedule they are given, and what can be done to make it consistent.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the following procedures performed.

      Videotaped Swallowing Exercise:

      Researchers will ask you to perform 3 swallowing exercises while being recorded by a video
      camera. The length of the taping session will be 3 minutes. Afterward, you will fill out 3
      questionnaires. The questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study:

      You will be asked to come in 1 time for this study.

      For the next 2 years, information may be collected from your medical record. This information
      will include the cancer stage, if the disease has gotten worse, any treatment you receive,
      and any side effects you experience. This information will help researchers learn how certain
      treatments affect patients and their risk for future disease.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 225 patient will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to receive one of three sets of instructions before starting. Instructions for three swallowing exercises as well as an introductory script explaining the purpose of the exercises will be videotaped and shown to participants. Participants perform 3 swallowing exercises while researcher leaves the room. At the end of the testing period, researcher will come back into the room and record the number on participant's tracking device. Participant to tell whether they did as many repetitions as possible and if not, why they were not able to do as many as possible. This portion of the experiment will be videotaped. Participants complete an M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory for Head and Neck Cancer Patients before procedure as well as a brief 3-page post-session questionnaire.</description>
