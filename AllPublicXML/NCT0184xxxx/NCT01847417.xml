      An open label, balanced, randomized, three-treatment, three-period, six-sequence, cross-over,
      single dose, comparative bioavailability pilot study under fed conditions. For fed condition,
      after check-in, subjects will receive a standard dinner consisting (1000 - 1200 calories)
      after which they will be required to fast overnight (for at least 10 hours). Thereafter they
      will receive a non-vegetarian high calorie, high-fat breakfast (800-1000 calories) before
      dosing, and a standard meal (1700 - 1900 calories) for lunch, snacks and dinner.
