  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well docosahexaenoic acid works in preventing
      recurrence in breast cancer survivors. Docosahexaenoic acid supplement may prevent recurrence
      in breast cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 12 weeks at 1000 mg
      twice daily as compared to placebo reduces normal breast tissue levels of tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in overweight and obese patients with a history of stage I-III
      invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Paget's disease, lobular carcinoma
      in situ (LCIS), or proliferative benign breast disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effect of DHA at 1000 mg twice daily on tissue biomarkers

        -  Change from the baseline in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/interleukin-1-beta
           (IL-1beta)/aromatase measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

        -  Change from the baseline in crown-like structures of the breast (CLS-B) measured by
           immunohistochemical techniques for cluster of differentiation (CD)68.

        -  Change from baseline in CLS-B index determined as follows: ([number of slides with
           evidence of at least one CLS-B]/[total number of slides examined]).

        -  Change from baseline in CLS-B/cm^2 defined as the number of CLS-B/cm^2. II. Evaluate age
           as a predictor of CLS-B and inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-alpha/COX-2/IL-1beta) at
           baseline and over the time of treatment.

      III. Evaluate red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid level as a surrogate of compliance.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive docosahexaenoic acid orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 12 weeks.
