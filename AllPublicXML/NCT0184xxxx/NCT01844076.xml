      Establish the tolerability and safety of aimed dose of both quinacrine and capecitabine in
      combination to treat patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the well published safety profiles of both quinacrine and capecitabine, the Phase
      I portion of our study will aim to determine the tolerability of both agents in combinations
      when used at established clinical doses. This portion of the study will more closely resemble
      a pilot study or feasibility study rather than a dose escalation Phase I trial. The objective
      is to determine toxicities and adverse reactions, not a maximally tolerated dose. The
      investigators hypothesize that there will be no toxic interactions at the pharmacokinetic or
      pharmacodynamic level, and want to know the feasibility of using quinacrine and capecitabine
      at their respective recommended single agent doses. Because capecitabine is already regarded
      as standard treatment for colorectal cancer, the investigators will begin the study with a
      full dose of capecitabine combined with a slightly lower dose of quinacrine. If the
      safety-interim analysis does not detect an excess of toxicity, then subsequent patients will
      be enrolled using the full dose of both drugs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients much have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.

             previously received both an oxaliplatin and an irinotecan based regimen.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with

          -  Patients who have a history of noninfectious hepatitis or alcoholism.

          -  Patients with a lifetime history of porphyria or psoriasis because it can exacerbate

          -  Patients with a lifetime history of seizure disorder.
