    <textblock>
      The effective relief of pain is of paramount importance to anyone treating patients
      undergoing surgery. Post-operative pain increases the possibility of post-surgical
      complications, raises the cost of medical care, and most importantly, interferes with
      recovery and return to normal activities of daily living. Therefore pain control is essential
      in the management of patients undergoing spinal surgery.Parenteral administration of
      narcotics has been the mainstay for postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing
      laminectomy and discectomy. Epidural and intrathecal opioids are also effective means of pain
      control in several major surgical interventions including spinal surgery. However, some of
      the side effects have limited their widespread use (eg, late-onset respiratory depression).
      Therefore, alternative measures of pain control including infiltration of paraspinal
      musculature with local anesthetics have been investigated with conflicting results. In
      situations such as laminectomies, where the epidural space is exposed as part of the surgical
      procedure, the application of absorbable gelatin sponge soaked in local anesthetics appears
      to be an alternative for providing postoperative analgesia. By investigating the probable
      analgesic effects of this method the investigators may relieve post laminectomy pain with
      minimal side effects and also costs.
