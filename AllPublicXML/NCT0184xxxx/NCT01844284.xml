             degredants (everolimus, poly (L-lactide), poly (DL-lactide), lactide, lactic acid) and

             be adequately pre-medicated.

          3. Subject has a known contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          4. Subject had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours of the index
             procedure

               -  The subject is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset
                  AMI, such as nitrate-unresponsive prolonged chest pain with ischemic ECG changes

                  procedure.

          5. Subject has an unstable cardiac arrhythmia which is likely to become hemodynamically
             unstable due to arrhythmia.

          6. Subject has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% (LVEF may be
             obtained at the time of the index procedure if the value is unknown and the
             investigator believes it is necessary).

          7. The target vessel was treated by PCI within 12 months.

          8. Prior PCI within the non-target vessel is acceptable if performed anytime &gt; 30 days
             before the index procedure or between 24 hours and 30 days before the index procedure
             if successful and uncomplicated.

          9. Subject requires future staged PCI either in target or non target vessels.

                  seem to be caused by previous intracranial bleeding)

               -  Has known intracranial pathology that may cause intracranial bleeding per an
                  investigator assessment (e.g. untreated aneurysm &gt; 5 mm, arteriovenous

             completed its primary endpoint.

         24. Subject whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly
             influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with
             participation or of retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of
             refusal to participate (e.g. subordinate hospital staff or sponsor staff) or subject
             is unable to read or write.
