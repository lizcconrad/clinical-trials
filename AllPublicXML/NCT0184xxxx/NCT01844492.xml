  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in five deaths in the U.S. occurs in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care
      unit (ICU), typically following decisions made by surrogate decision makers to forego life
      prolonging treatment. A large body of empirical research has identified deficiencies in care
      processes that contribute to three important problems: 1) family members often experience
      poor quality communication with ICU clinicians, leading to lasting psychological distress
      associated with the ICU experience; 2) patients near the end of life frequently receive
      invasive, expensive treatment that is inconsistent with their values and preferences, and 3)
      end-of-life care is a major contributor to health care costs.[8, 9] Although advance care
      planning can prevent some unwanted treatment, many patients wish for a trial of intensive
      treatment when the prognosis is uncertain, and therefore it seems likely that the need for
      interventions to improve &quot;in-the-moment&quot; decisions by surrogates will persist.[10, 11]

      In a pilot project, the investigators developed the PARTNER intervention (PAiring
      Re-engineered ICU Teams with Nurse-driven Emotional Support and Relationship-building), an
      interdisciplinary intervention that 1) gives new responsibilities and advanced communication
      skills training to existing ICU staff (local nurse leaders and social work members of the ICU
      team); 2) changes care &quot;defaults&quot; to ensure frequent clinician-family meetings; and 3) adds
      protocolized, nurse-administered coaching and emotional support of surrogates before and
      during clinician-family meetings. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a stepped
      wedge randomized controlled trial testing the PARTNER intervention in 5 ICUs among 1000
      patients with advanced critical illness and their surrogates.
