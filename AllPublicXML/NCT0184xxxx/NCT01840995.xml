  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stellate ganglion block increase cerebral blood flow, as the consequence of that, it has
      the potential to cause an increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). Previous studies have
      proposed that ultrasonographic measurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD)
      correlate with signs of increased ICP. Therefore, this study is aim to confirm the increased
      ICP by ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD after the stellate ganglion block.

    <description>A thick layer of gel is applied on the upper closed eyelid. The linear 13- to 6-MHz ultrasound probe is then placed in the gel, without exerting pressure on the eye. Two measurements are taken for each optic nerve: one in the transverse plane, with the probe being horizontal, and one in the sagittal plane, with the probe being vertical. The final ONSD is the mean of these measurements.</description>
