  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation trial of VS-4718, a focal
      adhesion kinase inhibitor, in subjects with metastatic non-hematologic malignancies. This
      clinical study is comprised of 2 parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Expansion). The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (including the recommended Phase II dose),
      pharmacokinetics (the amount of VS-4718 in your blood) and the anti-cancer activity of
      VS-4718. The pharmacodynamic effects (genes or proteins that may predict or show how your
      body may respond to VS-4718) will also be examined in tumor biopsies and blood samples.

    <description>The RP2D will be determined based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VS-4718 as determined by number of participants with dose limiting toxicities related to VS-4718. Observations related to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and any VS-4718 related toxicities may be included in the rationale supporting the RP2D and will not exceed the MTD.</description>
