      A study to determine if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS, the device that
      regulates brain activity, can improve pain in people with neuropathic facial pain and compare
      which modality (inhibitory tDCS over the somatosensory cortex or excitatory tDCS over the
      motor cortex) can result in better pain-relief.)

      This is a pilot study designed to collect preliminary data on safety and efficacy of
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)to relieve pain in subjects with neuropathic
      facial pain,and to compare two pain-treatment tDCS modalities: inhibitory tDCS stimulation
      over the somatosensory cortex and excitatory tDCS over the motor cortex.

    <description>TDCS/sham will be delivered using the battery-operated device Phoresor II Auto with two saline-soaked sponge electrodes. To deliver excitatory (anodal) tDCS over the motor cortex, the main electrode will be placed over the motor cortex on the hemisphere contralateral to the major source of pain. The second electrode will be placed on the skin overlying the supraorbital region ipsilateral to the affected area. To deliver inhibitory (cathodal) tDCS, the main electrode will be placed over the somatosensory cortex on the hemisphere contralateral to the major source of pain. The second electrode will be placed on the skin overlying the supraorbital region ipsilateral to the affected area. The current will be delivered at the intensity of 2mA for 20 minutes. To deliver sham, the current will be delivered for 30 sec only to elicit tingling skin sensation but no cortical excitability changes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Spontaneous facial neuropathic pain due to any of following:

               1. Trigeminal neuralgia, type 1, (TN1): facial pain of spontaneous onset with
                  predominantly episodic pain.

               2. Trigeminal neuralgia, type 2, (TN2): facial pain of spontaneous onset with
                  predominantly constant pain.

               3. Trigeminal neuropathic pain, (TNP): facial pain resulting from unintentional
                  injury to the trigeminal system from facial trauma, oral surgery, ear, nose and
                  throat (ENT) surgery, root injury from posterior fossa or skull base surgery,
                  stroke, etc.

               4. Trigeminal deafferentation pain, (TDP): facial pain in a region of trigeminal
                  numbness resulting from intentional injury to the trigeminal system from
                  neurectomy, gangliolysis, rhizotomy, nucleotomy, tractotomy, or other denervating
                  procedures.

               5. Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia, (STN): facial pain resulting from multiple
                  sclerosis.

             e) Postherpetic neuralgia, (PHN): facial pain resulting from trigeminal Herpes zoster
             (shingles) outbreak in the trigeminal distribution.

          -  Pain intensity score for &quot;worst pain in the last 24 hours&quot; &gt;4 on a numeric scale 0-10
             at the time of enrollment and before the first stimulation of each treatment block.

          -  Pain intensity score for &quot;pain right now&quot; &gt;4 on a numeric scale 0-10 before the first
             stimulation of each block of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease

          -  Other painful conditions than neuropathic facial pain, that are not related to and
             can't be distinguished from the neuropathic facial pain

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Implanted neurostimulation devices (e.g. a spinal cord stimulator, a deep brain
             stimulator, etc)

          -  Active illegal drug/alcohol abuse

          -  Unable to follow directions or complete tools in English.
