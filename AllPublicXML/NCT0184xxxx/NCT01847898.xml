    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study to document and evaluate the clinical performance of
      the Vertebral Body Stenting (VBS) System in osteoporotic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar
      spine.

      The randomized, controlled trial (RCT) will compare patients with VBS and Balloon
      Kyphoplasty.

    <measure>Increase and maintenance of the vertebral body height</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The anterior edge, mid height and posterior edge of the index vertebral body are measured pre-operatively standing, after prone intraoperative positioning on the table (dynamic fracture mobility), intra-operatively following balloon dilation (height restoration), after balloon deflation and removal, after cement deposition, and finally postoperative standing. Anterior, middle and posterior height measurements will be made at each time-point during the study to measure maintenance of vertebral body height over time. The ratio between anterior and mid or posterior edge height (Beck-index) is calculated to avoid the problem of image calibration. In addition, the relative height fractions in comparison to the nearest healthy vertebral body (referent level) are calculated. Finally, local and regional sagittal angles and overall lumbar lordosis or thoracic kyphosis, respectively, are assessed for measurement of improvement of alignment.</description>

          9. Psychosocially, mentally and physically able to fully comply with the protocol
             requirements for the duration of the study including adhering to scheduled visits,
             treatment plan, completing forms and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          5. Any painful VCF with fracture age &gt; 6 months

          6. Patients with primary tumors of the bone (e.g., osteosarcoma) or solitary plasmacytoma

                  coagulopathies: Subjects on coumadin or other anticoagulants may participate.
                  Investigators should follow routine practices for perioperative discontinuation
                  and re-initiation of anticoagulants.

               -  Allergy to any device materials (e.g., bone cement) for balloon kyphoplasty or
                  vertebroplasty. Note that in subjects with allergy to iodine-based contrast,
                  other non-iodine contrast solutions may be used.
