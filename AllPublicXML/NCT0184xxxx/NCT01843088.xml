  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mannitol cream has been shown clinically to be effective for pain control. To determine if
      this effect is worth testing on a larger scale, 170 runners will receive a sample of 25%
      mannitol cream to apply on one leg, and the cream base without the mannitol on the other leg
      following a 10 km or longer run, and for the following five days. Mannitol and control legs
      will be chosen at random for each runner. Pain scores before and after cream application will
      be acquired each day for each leg. Means and standard deviations found will be used to
      determine the size of a larger study.

      The hypothesis for this study is that Mannitol cream will reduce post long run pain more than
      vehicle cream alone. In this parallel design, 170 runners who usually experience a pain level
      greater than 5/10 on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10 where zero is no pain and 10 is
      the worst pain ever, will be given a cream containing 25% mannitol to apply on one leg and
      the vehicle cream to apply on the other leg. The cream assignment will be randomized, and the
      runner, the person supplying the cream and the person inputting the data will be blinded as
      to which leg received which cream. Pain levels in each leg following the long run will be
      recorded, via an e-mail questionnaire, or, failing this, by telephone, the day of the run,
      and each day, for five days following the run. Mean and standard deviations for pain levels
      will be calculated for each treatment leg, and a repeated measures ANOVA (Analysis Of
      VAriance) will be done comparing the pain levels in each leg over the six days. Using this
      information, if the NRS (Numeric rating scale) pain levels differ by more than 1/10 between
      the two groups, a larger study will be conducted using the information gathered in this study
      to determine sample size.

    <description>NRS (Numeric rating scale) pain score from zero, no pain, to 10 worst pain ever. Change in pain score will be measured daily starting on day of race, comparing pain following the race, prior to the first cream application, to the daily scores for the subsequent five days. Pain levels in leg given mannitol cream, and leg given placebo cream will be compared according to the change in their pain scores.</description>

    <description>Description of side effects by subjects. The only likely to side effect would be a contact dermatitis as percutaneous systemic absorption of mannitol is negligible. We will therefore monitor for contact dermatitis, and record its incidence, should it happen in this small sample. In our experience with over 400 recipients, there have been no cases of contact dermatitis.</description>

    <description>Same carrier cream as that containing the active ingredient, mannitol, but without the active ingredient. Placebo cream to be applied to the painful areas of the other leg, chosen at random, on the day of a 10 km or more race, following the race, and as needed for the five days after the race. It is to be noted that, as almost no mannitol is absorbed through the skin, it is highly unlikely that this would involve the pain levels in the placebo leg.</description>
