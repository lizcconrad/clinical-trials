  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first-pass metabolism (FPM) is a barrier to the toxicity of ethanol. Changes to the size
      and function of the stomach may alter FPM. Bariatric surgery, like the gastric bypass
      procedure, involves significant changes to the size and function of the stomach and leads to
      more rapid gastric emptying. Consequences will be faster absorption and higher peak
      concentration of ethanol after surgery than before. There are growing concerns that surgery
      for obesity in this way may cause alcohol abuse.

      In this study the investigators compare changes in FPM of ethanol following two different
      bariatric surgical procedures.

    <description>Sleeve gastrectomy, a surgical procedure in which the stomach is reduced to about 25% of its original size, by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach, following the major curve. The open edges are then attached together (often with surgical staples) to form a sleeve or tube with a banana shape.</description>
