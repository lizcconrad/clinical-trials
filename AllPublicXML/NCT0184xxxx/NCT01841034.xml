  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male infertility is a multifactorial disease process with a number of potential contributive
      causes. Considering the majority of male infertility cases are due to deficient sperm
      production of unknown origin, environmental and nutritional factors must be evaluated. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of 6 months antioxidant dietary complement
      (Conceptio) on sperm parameters (sperm count, motility and DNA fragmentation) in infertile
      men with oligoasthenozoospermia.

    <measure>Spermatic parameters (numeration and mobility spermatic)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion and 6 months after the inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The spermatic parameters used within the framework of the spermogramme made in routine in the Laboratory of Biology of the Reproduction will be the numeration and the spermatic mobility from the very beginning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of fragmentation of the DNA</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion and 6 months after the inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>We shall consider the rate of fragmentation of the DNA determined according to the method of the TUNEL. This technique allows to estimate the rate of spermatozoides apoptose. It brings to light the fragmentation of the spermatic DNA in the course of process of cellular death.</description>

    <description>Any patient receipt within the framework of the coverage(care) of an infertility in the pole ORG, whatever is the étiologie and the type of treatment proposing and presenting during at least two spermogrammes an oligospermie and\or an asthénospermie. The necessity of realizing 2 spermogrammes different to determine the pathological character of the values of a spermogramme takes into account the personal variability of the results.</description>

    <description>The patients are included during a consultation whether it is with a clinician or a biologist of the Center. It is suggested in routine in the service, to all the patients consulting for a problem of infertility and presenting pathological spermatic data, taking the food complement Conceptio. At the patients wishing to take this complement it will be suggested participating in this study. This complement is usually bought by the patient, within the framework of this study this one will be gracefully supplied. The follow-up of the patient will contain no examination and no anybody visit besides the usually realized follow-up.</description>
