    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single dose and
      multiple doses of humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (Sevacizumab) in patients with
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The secondary objective is to explore the preliminary
      anti-tumor effects.
