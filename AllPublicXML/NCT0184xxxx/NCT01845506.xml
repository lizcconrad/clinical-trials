  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome for this project will be the development of a small, non-invasive
      wireless sensor that is linked to a conventional computer that can be used in health care for
      monitoring of acute and chronic health problems. The advantages of developing this technology
      are threefold. First, monitoring can be conducted for a fraction of the cost of a bedside
      nurse. Second, monitoring can be done in real time and stored so that we can diagnose and
      manage critical events in a more timely manner. Lastly, many patients can be monitored
      simultaneously. The wireless sensors will be fitted to healthy volunteers of various ages.
      The data gathered from the sensor with respect to their vital signs will be compared to that
      of conventional tools such as nursing assessments and pulse oximetry.

    <description>Subjects will also be fitted with conventional monitoring devices as per the standard of care (3 or 5 lead ECG, pulse oximeter, blood pressure cuff) and will have vital statistics obtained by a trained research assistant at regular 5-minute intervals including blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate using the standard cardiorespiratory bedside monitor's cycling protocol. The same parameters will be obtained from the wireless sensor at identical time points for a duration of 2 hours. Data obtained from both conventional and study sources will be entered into an encrypted USB device for later analysis.</description>
