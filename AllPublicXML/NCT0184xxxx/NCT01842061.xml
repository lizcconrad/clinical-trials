  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 6-month, parallel, single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      feasibility study of a self-management program to reduce sedentary time and increase physical
      activity (Sit Less to Move More) in women aged 55-70 years. The primary aim is to determine
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention; and the secondary aim is to test the
      effect of the intervention on the primary health outcome, physical activity (mean daily step
      count by accelerometry) at 6 months. The investigators will also conduct an economic
      evaluation and a process evaluation to guide a future larger study and to inform a scaled-up
      implementation plan.

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will receive a self-management program designed to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity. Specifically, they will be given an EASY Program Manual with strategies to break up sitting time during the day and increase utilitarian activity; this will include a section on how to set, monitor and maintain achievable goals. They will also be offered a pedometer program, group education sessions and encouraged to use public transport by providing free bus tickets.</description>
