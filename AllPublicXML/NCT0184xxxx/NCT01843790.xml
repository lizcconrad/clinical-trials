  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline to Week 8 between placebo and GCS-100 treatment. The
      secondary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of GCS-100 administered for 8
      weeks relative to placebo. In addition, the study will measure the effect of GCS-100 on
      circulating galectin-3 and other markers of disease activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Galectin-3 contributes to fibrosis, is elevated in patients with ESRD, and correlates with
      adverse outcomes (de Boer et. al., 2011, Dang et. al., 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et. al.,
      2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate
      a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et. al., 2012,
      Fernandes Bertocchi et. al., 2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). GCS-100 is a galectin- 3
      antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of
      galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at
      treating patients with CKD.

          2. Subject is ≥18 and ≤75 years of age; patients &gt;75 years old may be included at the
             request of the investigator and discretion of the Medical Monitor

          3. Subject has an eGFR of 15 - 44 mL/min/1.73m2 determined using the 4-variable
             Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (see Section 10.1)
