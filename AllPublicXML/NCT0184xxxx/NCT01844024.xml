  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uganda is one of the countries with highest fertility rate in the world, 6.7 children per
      women. It is estimated that 56 percent of all pregnancies are unintended and the
      contraceptive prevalence rate in Uganda is 23 percent. Unwanted pregnancy is common and
      induced abortion is illegal. Unsafe abortion is responsible for significant morbidity and
      mortality among women in Uganda. Almost 40% of admissions to emergency obstetric care units
      in Uganda due to unsafe abortion is reported and considered high in international comparison.
      Studies have revealed that trained midlevel providers can deliver safe post abortion care
      (PAC) for incomplete abortion and use manual vacuum aspiration. The prostaglandin E1 analogue
      misoprostol has been shown to be an effective tool in the treatment of incomplete abortions.
      This option is so far under-used in developing countries, especially outside the larger
      hospitals and private clinics. One significant limiting factor in providing safe PAC is the
      lack of providers. So far technical training has been mainly limited to physicians. The
      long-term goal of this project is to provide evidence based information that will contribute
      to the development of strategies to increase women's access to high level post- abortion care
      at primary health care level provided by midlevel providers in Uganda. A task shift to
      midlevel provider in providing treatment of incomplete abortion will increase access to safe
      PAC and is a key to Millenium Development Goal 5. Misoprostol treatment of incomplete
      abortion remains underused and in accessible to a majority of women in Uganda because
      national regulations restricts its prescription and supervision to doctors. However, the
      safety of misoprostol treatment should make it amenable to provision by midlevel providers.
      Training of midlevel providers in misoprostol treatment of incomplete abortion will support
      task shifting in places where doctors are costly and scarce. By evaluating the effectiveness
      of mid-level providers (midwives); administering misoprostol treatment of incomplete abortion
      the project is attempting to contribute to the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity
      and safeguard high quality of post-abortion care. A direct economic impact can also be
      expected due to reduced treatment costs of complications from unsafely induced abortion and
      incomplete abortions. The involvement of midlevel providers in medical treatment of
      incomplete abortion has previously not been systematically evaluated in African primary
      health care setting.
