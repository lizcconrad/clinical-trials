      This study is Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Multiple-Dose Study.

      The purpose is to determine the safety, tolerability, systemic exposure and pharmacokinetics
      of ME1111 after repeated daily topical application of ME1111 in a maximal use setting in
      adults with distal subungual onychomycosis of the toenails.
