  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of topical 0.03% DSC127 Gel when used for one or more continuous
      treatment periods on a chronic Wagner Grade 1 or 2 foot ulcer(target ulcer) or multiple
      ulcers in diabetic subjects. The maximum duration of any treatment period is 24 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible subjects enrolled will begin daily Treatment with topical 0.03% DSC127 gel until
      complete wound closure (defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing
      requirement) or 24 weeks, whichever occurs first.

      If a patient has multiple ulcers on one foot, all may be treated, within the maximum of 24
      weeks. If the ulcer does not heal, after a wash out period of 1 week, a new treatment period
      of up to 24 weeks may be initiated. Ulcer may be retreated if it recurs or if a new ulcer
      develops that meets study criteria.

      For the entire duration of each treatment period the standard of care for DFU will be
      maintained.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ambulatory subjects who are at least 18 years of age at screening

               1. chronic ( present &gt;1month)

               2. Wagner Grade 1 or Grade 2 ulcer (i.e. Partial- or full- thickness and not
                  involving bone, tendon or capsule (probing to tendon or capsule) and/or
                  penetrating to tendon or capsule.)

               3. with no sign of infection or osteomyelitis, and

               4. is located below the malleolus.

          3. Have an ABI &gt; 0.7, or have a TcPO2 &gt; 40 mm Hg or great toe systolic pressure &gt; 50 mmHg
             to ensure healing potential.

          4. Have Type I or Type II diabetes under metabolic control as confirmed by glycosylated
             hemoglobin (HbA1c) of ≤ 14%, obtained at enrollment or within 30 days prior to study
             enrollment.

          5. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the
             time of enrollment and at the initiation of each study treatment period.

          6. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must be willing to use a medically
             acceptable method of birth control, such as Essure®, hormonal contraception (oral
             pills, implantable device or skin patch), intrauterine device, tubal ligation, double
             barrier, or abstinence during the treatment periods of study participation.

          7. Ability and willingness to understand and comply with study procedures and to give
             written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study or initiation of study
             procedures

          1. Has a known hypersensitivity to any of the study medication components.

          2. Exposure to any investigational product within 30 days of entry into study.

          3. Has active malignant disease of any kind (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma).
             A subject, who has had a malignant disease in the past, was treated and is currently
             disease-free, may be considered for study entry. Disease-free is defined as in
             remission for at least 5 years.

          4. Chronic liver dysfunction evidenced by transaminase levels &gt; 2.5 times higher than the
             upper level of normal on two occasions.

          5. Has a history of additional risk factors for TdP (eg. heart failure, hypokalemia,
             family history of Long QT Syndrome) or taking medication which are known to prolong
             QT/QTc (Appendix G)

          6. Receiving hemodialysis or chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy.

          7. Prior radiation therapy of the foot with the ulcer under study.

          8. Current use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants within 8 weeks prior to
             enrollment into the study

          9. Sickle-cell anemia, Raynaud's or other peripheral vascular disease.

         10. Subjects receiving a biologic agent to include growth factors and skin equivalents
             (Regranex, Apligraft, or Dermagraft) in the 7 days prior to exposure to DSC127.

         11. Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has uncontrolled hypertension

         12. Subject has an ulcer which is determined to be clinically infected and requires
             antimicrobials or agents known to affect wound healing or has been taking systemic
             antibiotics for more than 7 days for any reason. (Subjects with infection at the
             initial visit of the Screening Period can be re-screened three weeks later after a
             single course of antibiotic therapy (occurring concurrently - within three weeks of
             the initial visit, the antibiotic treatment must have completed and some washout (7
             days) must have elapsed); if after that time infection is still present, the subject
             will be excluded.)

         13. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, have clinically significant anemia
