          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV NSCLC patients that are eligible to
             platinum-gemcitabine based doublet therapy (M1a and M1b, seventh edition descriptor of
             the Revised International System for Staging Lung Cancer, adopted by the AJCC.)
             Patients with a prior diagnosis of stage IIIa or IIIb NSCLC who have progressed to
             stage IV are also eligible;

          -  ECOG performance 0 or 1;

             MRI;

          -  Patients with previous radiotherapy as definitive therapy for locally advanced
             non-small cell lung cancer are eligible, as long as the selected measurable lesions
             are outside the original radiation therapy port unless there has been demonstrated
             progression in the lesion. Radiation therapy must have been completed &gt; 4 weeks prior
             to study entry;

          -  Palliative radiotherapy must have been completed &gt; 2 weeks prior to study entry.
             Concomitant palliative radiotherapy to an existing bone lesion for pain control is
             allowed;

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic NSCLC, except prior neoadjuvant

             physician);

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes. Patients with well controlled diabetes, with a HbA1C of less
             than 7%, on stable hypoglycaemic therapy and diet, are eligible;

          -  Clinically significant renal impairment or chronic pancreatitis;

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN or calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min

          -  To be dependent of oxygen treatment;

          -  Active infections requiring antibiotics;

          -  A major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28
             days of beginning treatment, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the
             course of the study;

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding. All women of child-bearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test prior to first receiving protocol therapy;

          -  Active alcohol or drug abuse;
