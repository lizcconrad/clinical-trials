  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since October 2009, H1N1 influenza vaccine has developed and approved of immunization in
      population in China. However, there was little epidemiological evidence of safety when
      vaccinated in healthy pregnant women. The main objective of this study is to assess the
      safety of split-virion inactivated H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant when administered in healthy
      pregnant women. It is a stratified and controlled clinical trial in healthy pregnant women.
      And participants were included up to 226 healthy pregnant women aged 18 -35 years old who
      have no history of novel influenza H1N1 infection or novel influenza H1N1 vaccination. The
      pregnancy week ranged from 5 weeks to 32 weeks. Subjects were divided into 2 groups:
      vaccinated group（122） and unvaccinated group（104）. Subjects in the vaccinated group were
      administered one dose of 15μg H1N1 vaccine. Subjects in the unvaccinated group received no
      vaccine as controls. Safety will be measured by assessment of pregnancy outcomes. And
      observation time for pregnancy outcomes was lasting for 28 days postpartum since vaccinated;
      and protective effect was observed for six months.
