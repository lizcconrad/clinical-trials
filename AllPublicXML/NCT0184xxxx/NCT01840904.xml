  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate subjective sleep quality and fatigue during and
      after Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis assessed by questionnaires and a sleep-diary. The
      investigators hypothesis is that subjective sleep and fatigue are correlated with the
      inflammatory activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of experimental studies have showed that inflammation can induce
      disturbances in sleep architecture, mediated by cytokines. some studies showed that cytokines
      also induce daytime fatigue. In this study the investigators aim to describe the patient
      experiences of sleep and fatigue during the acute inflammation and the recovery, and the
      investigators seek to exam the correlation of fatigue with Polysomnography-measured night
      sleep and cytokine levels in plasma.

      Following methods will be applied

        -  Other: Karolinska Sleepiness Scale

        -  Other: Physical Fatigue Scale

        -  Other: Visual Analog Scale and 10 point-scales to measure fatigue, general well-being,
           subjective sleep and pain

        -  Other: Sleep-diary

        -  Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA)

        -  Procedure: Plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-alfa(tumor necrosis factor))

        -  Procedure: Plasma CRP(C reactive protein) and leukocytes

        -  Device: Wrist-Actigraph - Octagonal Basic Motionlogger, Ambulatory monitoring Inc, New
           York, USA
