  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and optimal delivery of the
      Neo-Kidney Augment (NKA) when implanted at one site in a recipient kidney. NKA is made from
      expanded autologous, homologous, selected renal cells (SRC) obtained from the patient's
      kidney biopsy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic intervention with NKA is intended to delay the need for renal replacement therapy
      (dialysis or transplant) which at this time, is inevitable in patients with CKD. NKA is
      composed of autologous, homologous selected renal cells (SRC) formulated in a Biomaterial
      (gelatin-based hydrogel). SRC are the biologically active component of NKA. Proof of
      principle for SRC as the biologically active component of NKA was established in multiple
      models of CKD. Based on nonclinical efficacy and safety data, a single NKA dose will be
      delivered to patients in this FIH clinical trial. This dose provides a minimum of a 1.5-fold
      safety margin over doses delivered safely in nonclinical studies. In addition, this dose
      demonstrated efficacy in a nonclinical disease model.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the occurrence of procedure and/or product related adverse events (AEs) through three months post-implantation. The primary outcome measures are procedure- and/or NK product-related AEs through 3 months post-implantation. Procedure related AEs include events considered related to the surgical procedures, biopsy or implantation of NKA including HARS, and not to other study-specific procedures (e.g., MRI or blood draws).</description>

    <measure>Change in the rate of renal disease progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months post-implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint of the study is the change in the rate of progression of renal insufficiency, as measured by laboratory tests of renal function. The secondary outcome measures are laboratory assessments of renal function to assess changes in the rate of progression of renal insufficiency for each patient. Specifically, eGFR (based on cystatin-C and iohexol clearance), sCr, and ACR will be followed for 6 months to assess the post-implant rate of change compared to pre-implant changes.</description>

          3. Mean systolic blood pressure between 105 and 160 mmHg, inclusive; mean diastolic blood

             receptor blocker, initiated at least 6 weeks prior to screening.

          6. Willing and able to refrain from use of NSAIDs (including aspirin) and clopidogrel for
             10 days before and 10 days after biopsy and implant.

          7. Willing and able to cooperate with all aspects of the study.

             count.

          6. Ineligible for an MRI or renal scintigraphy (e.g. due to hypersensitivity or allergy)
             study based on the Karolinska University Hospital guidelines.

             mutations, renal agenesis).

          9. Patients with small (&lt; 10 cm) kidneys or only one kidney; patients with a history of
             highly echogenic kidneys. Patients with an average width of kidney cortex &lt; 1.0 cm as

             during the course of the study, or who are of child bearing potential and not using a
             highly effective method of birth control (including sexual abstinence). A highly
             effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate
             (i.e. less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs),

         23. Use of any investigational product (drug, biologic, or device) within 5 half-lives
             (drug, biologic) or 3 months, whichever is longer, without receiving prior written
