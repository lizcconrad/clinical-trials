  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single blind, six week dietary intervention will be conducted in order to evaluate the
      impact of fiber fortified foods on blood urea nitrogen, kidney function and quality of life
      in patients presenting with a moderate to severe decline in kidney function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients may consume lower than recommended amounts of dietary
      fiber due to typical dietary habits, dietary restrictions, and uremic symptoms. A progressive
      decline in kidney function causes an acculmulation of uremic molecules that contribute to
      further progression of the disease and reduced quality of life. In an effort to evaluate the
      impact of added fiber on blood urea nitrogen, kidney function and quality of life in patients
      presenting with a moderate to severe decline in kidney function (eGFR â‰¤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), a
      single blind, six week dietary intervention, clinical trial will be conducted.
