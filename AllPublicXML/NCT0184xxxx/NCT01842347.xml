      The purpose of this study is to treat children with severe, moderate, resistant or relapsing
      C. difficile infection and to determine the changes in the intestinal microbiome (all of the
      bacteria living in the intestines) in children receiving FMT for C. difficile infection. Data
      will be collected throughout the FMT procedure to determine effectiveness and to help
      standardize this procedure. Stool samples will be collected to look at the different bacteria
      that are in the intestines before and after FMT.
