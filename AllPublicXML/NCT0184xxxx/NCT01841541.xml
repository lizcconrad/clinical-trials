  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Training and engaging of unpaid informal providers (such as tea-sellers, women's groups,
      youth clubs, small traders and religious groups) from poorer localities in TB disease
      recognition, referral and community awareness raising will increase the access of TB patients
      to formal health facilities and decrease their delay in initiating TB treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Barriers to accessing health services faced by poor and vulnerable populations are numerous
      in developing countries. These include; geography, income poverty, lack of trust in the
      quality of public health services, and lack of empowerment of women and adolescent girls (as
      patients and carers) to mobilize adequate and timely resources to access these services.

      The project aims to test if TB case detection can be increased by engaging informal health
      care providers in active case finding. In one urban district of Khartoum, these providers
      will be trained to work as first point of entry to the health system using a comprehensive
      package that includes disease recognition, health communication, and patient referral. In a
      comparator urban district of Khartoum, no attempts will be made to engage informal providers.

      By comparing data of TB patients and Lab registers between the intervention and comparator
      districts in Khartoum, this project aims to test if, and to what extent, these expected
      effects can be realized.

      Overall this is a trial of a health policy so individual patients will not be recruited or
      randomized to one intervention or the other. Rather the policy is being applied in one
      district while the other district is being used as a comparator.
