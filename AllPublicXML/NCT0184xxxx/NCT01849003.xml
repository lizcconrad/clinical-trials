    <textblock>
      This mechanism of action study is to evaluate the effect of oral GS-6615 on the QTc interval
      in participants with Long QT-3 syndrome. This study will be performed in six cohorts of
      participants in a sequential manner, four single-dose cohorts followed by two multiple-dose
      cohorts. Duration of treatment for the single-dose cohorts and multiple-dose cohorts will be
      1 day and 7 days, respectively. Participants will be confined at the study center from
      check-in until completion of assessments at discharge.

      Participants will be continuously monitored using real-time telemetry throughout the
      in-clinic confinement. Physical examinations including vital signs, laboratory analysis,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), Holter recordings and echocardiography (ECHO) will be performed at
      defined time points throughout the study period. Assessment of adverse events and concomitant
      medications will continue throughout the duration of the study.
