      -  Introduction: Hearing loss is a prevalent condition in elderly population. However, the
           low adherence to hearing aids is a fact, with an estimation of use of 50 per cent. In
           2007 there was designed a rehabilitation program called ACE, which aims to improve
           rehabilitation directed to hearing aids users. The study hypothesis is that a counseling
           program will improve adherence to hearing aids in elderly population.

        -  Objective: To evaluate the utility of a standardized counselling program in patients
           with hearing loss.

        -  Material and Methods: A before/after trial will be carried out, approved by the Hospital
           ethics - committee. Patients with 65 years and older with hearing loss diagnosed by pure
           tone audiometry will be included. To assess adherence we will use the IOI-HA scale.

      -  Introduction: Hearing loss is a prevalent condition in elderly population. However, the
           low adherence to hearing aids is a fact, with an estimation of use of 50 per cent. In
           Chile, hearing aids are provided by the State for elderly population. In 2007 there was
           designed a rehabilitation program called Active Communication Education (ACE), that is a
           semistructured rehabilitation program for people with hearing loss, which aims to
           improve rehabilitation of hearing aids users by a strategy based on problem solution.

        -  The study hypothesis is that a counseling program will improve adherence to hearing aids
           in elderly population.

        -  Objective: To evaluate the utility of a standardized counseling program in patients with
           hearing loss.

        -  Material and Methods: A before/after clinical trial will be carried out, approved by the
           Hospital ethics - committee. Patients with 65 years and older diagnosed by pure tone
           audiometry who are beneficiaries of the Public GES hearing loss programme and receive a
           hearing aid will be included. The subjects will be randomized in two branches: Active
           branch, subject to the rehabilitation program; and passive branch, which was control,
           with usual management (no intervention). To assess adherence we will use the IOI-HA
           scale.
