      This phase II trial investigates whether patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age
      diagnosed with myeloma or another plasma cell malignancy will have better outcomes with
      transplant followed by maintenance therapy, as primarily measured by progression-free
      survival, versus non-transplant approaches.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) from the start of dexamethasone,
      cisplatin, Adriamycin (doxorubicin),Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), etoposide (DPACE) for all
      participants who have had at least one day of protocol treatment.

      II. To evaluate how well such therapy is tolerated in patients mainly over the age of 65
      years by assessing severe complications (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, death) and the
      percentage of participants able to complete the full course of therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate Quality-Of-Life post-transplant using the European Organization for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire QLQ-C30 and QLC-MY20.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1-4 and 8-11, cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) continuously, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously, cyclophosphamide
      IV, and etoposide IV on days 1-4. Patients then receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SQ) on
      days 6 and 13 and undergo collection of stem cells when white blood cell (WBC) and cluster of
      differentiation (CD)34 counts are within program range. Following stem cell collection,
      patients may receive interim dexamethasone PO on days 1-4, every 14 days at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      TRANSPLANT: Beginning between 4 weeks to 6 months after the first day of induction therapy,
      patients receive as transplant conditioning regimen dexamethasone PO on days -4 to -1 and
      days +2 through +5, bortezomib IV bolus on days -4, -1, 2, and 5, thalidomide PO on days -4
      to 5, and melphalan IV on days -4 and -1. Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant (PBSCT) on day 0. Between transplant and consolidation therapy, patients
      receive dexamethasone PO on days 1-4 every 21 days and thalidomide PO daily.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: If administered, post-transplant consolidation may begin 4-6 weeks
      after transplant but should occur no more than 4 months later. Most patients will not receive
      consolidation. Those that do will receive dexamethasone PO on days 1-4 and 8-11, thalidomide
      PO on days 1-11, bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, cisplatin IV continuously,
      doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously, cyclophosphamide IV continuously, and etoposide IV
      continuously on days 1-4.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY YEAR 1: Beginning 6 weeks-6 months after consolidation therapy or 4 weeks
      to 6 months after transplant if consolidation is skipped, patients receive bortezomib IV
      bolus on days 1, 4, 15, and 18, thalidomide PO QD on days 1-28, and dexamethasone PO on days
      1-4 and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY YEAR 2: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 15, and 18,
      cyclophosphamide PO or IV on days 1 and 15, and dexamethasone PO QD on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least once annually at the
      study center, but serum for MM marker results will be sent to the study site for close
      monitoring of PFS .

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have had a diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), MM +
             amyloidosis, or POEMS (osteosclerotic myeloma: polyneuropathy, organomegaly,
             endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin changes) requiring treatment; participants
             with a previous history of smoldering myeloma will be eligible if there is evidence of
             progressive disease requiring chemotherapy; Note that study participants do not need
             to have active disease at the time of study entry, as participants may have received
             up to 12 months of prior chemotherapy, which might have induced a response

          -  Protein criteria must be present at diagnosis (quantifiable M-component of IgG, IgA,
             IgD, or IgE and/or urinary kappa or lambda light chain, Bence-Jones protein, or Free
             Kappa Light Chain or Free Lambda Light Chain) in order to evaluate response.
             Non-secretory participants are eligible provided the participant has &gt; 20%
             plasmacytosis OR multiple (≥3) plasmacytomas or lesions on MRI at the time of
             diagnosis or study enrollment , OR the presence of lesions on PET/CT scan or skeletal
             survey at diagnosis or study enrollment.

          -  Participants must have received ≤12 months of prior chemotherapy for this disease
             without evidence of progressive disease with treatment. Participants may have received
             prior radiotherapy provided approval has been obtained from the PI. Participants with
             a history of radiation who have a platelet count &lt;150,000 due to radiation (disease,
             chemo, and other factors have been ruled out) will be excluded from this study.

          -  Participants must not have had a prior transplant

          -  Participants must be 65-85 years of age at the time of study entry.

          -  Ejection fraction by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) of &gt;=
             40% performed

             capacity [FVC]) and diffusion capacity (diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon
             monoxide [DLCO]) &gt;= 50% of predicted (adjusted for hemoglobin); if the participant is
             unable to complete pulmonary function tests (PFTs) due to disease-related pain or
             other circumstances that make it difficult to reliably perform PFTs, documentation of
             pulmonary function adequate for transplant will occur via a CT scan without evidence
             of major pulmonary disease, and arterial blood gas results

          -  Participants must have a creatinine &lt; 3 mg/dl and a GFR &gt;30mL/min/1.73m2

          -  Participants must have a performance status of 0-2 based on Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria; participants with a poor performance status (3-4)
             based solely on bone pain will be eligible, provided there is documentation to verify
             this

          -  Participants must sign the most current institutional review board (IRB)-approved
             study (informed consent form) ICF

        Exclusion Criteria:

             investigator must document this

          -  &gt; Grade 3 neuropathy

          -  Known hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes on appropriate therapy

          -  Recent (=&lt; 6 months) myocardial infarction, unstable angina, difficult to control
             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension on appropriate therapy, or
             difficult-to-control cardiac arrhythmias

          -  Participants must not have a creatinine &gt;3 mg/dl or a GFR &lt;30mL/min/1.73m2.

             by non-chemotherapeutic intervention; participants may have a history of prior
             malignancy, provided that he/she has not had any chemotherapy within 365 days of study
             entry AND that life expectancy exceeds 5 years at the time of study entry

          -  Participants must not have life-threatening co-morbidities
