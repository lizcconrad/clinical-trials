  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most local failures after definitive chemoradiation for unresectable esophageal cancer occur
      in the gross tumor volume (GTV). And the metabolic active areas post-treatment were located
      in the high FDG uptake areas prior to the radiotherapy. The hypothesis is that selective dose
      boost to the esophageal GTV could be safely delivered using a simultaneous integrated boost
      (SIB) technique, and that boosting the high 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake areas of the
      esophageal GTV defined prior to treatment may improve local tumor control.

    <description>Radiotherapy:
LEVEL 1: dose given at PTV-G and PTV-C will be 64Gy/32 fractions and 50Gy/25 fractions.
LEVEL 2: dose given at PTV-G and PTV-C will be 63Gy/28 fractions and 50.4Gy/28 fractions.
LEVEL 3: dose given at PTV-GR (with an integrated boost to the 50% SUVmax area of the primary tumor of the pre-treatment 18FDG-PET/CT scan), PTV-G and PTV-C will be 70Gy/28 fractions, 63Gy/28 fractions and 50.4Gy/28 fractions.
LEVEL 4: dose given at PTV-GR (with an integrated boost to the 50% SUVmax area of the primary tumor of the pre-treatment 18FDG-PET/CT scan), PTV-G and PTV-C will be 70Gy/25 fractions, 62.5Gy/25 fractions and 50Gy/25 fractions.
Chemotherapy:
Concurrent chemotherapy: Cisplatin 25mg/m2 IV daily on Days 1-3 and 29-31 plus 5-FU 500mg/m2 IV continuous infusion over 24 hours daily on Days 1-4 and 29-32.
