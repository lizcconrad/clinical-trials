  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the therapeutic effect and especially the mode
      of action of Wobenzym® plus, an anti-inflammatory drug containing proteolytic enzymes, on
      exercise induced muscle damage (eiMD) and recovery time in male amateur sportsmen with medium
      proficiency level compared to placebo.
