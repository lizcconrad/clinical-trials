    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 4-sequence, 2-period, double-blind, placebo controlled study in male
      and female subjects with an American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of cocaine abuse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be a 28-day screening period with eligible subjects remaining resident in the
      clinic from the evening before Day -1 up and until the morning of Day 9. On the morning of
      Day 1, a 50 mg intravenous (IV) infusion of cocaine will be administered over 10 minutes to
      all subjects. If none of the stopping criteria were met and no intervening safety concerns,
      subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment sequences on Day 3. On dosing days, Day 3
      and Day 6, subjects will have fasted at least 8 hours before dosing of cocaine and either
      RBP-8000 200 mg, RBP-8000 100 mg or matching placebo.

             defined as any female who is less than 2 years post-menopausal or has not undergone a
             hysterectomy or surgical sterilization, e.g., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             ovariectomy (oophorectomy). Females that are post-menopausal will be confirmed as such
             by the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) test at initial screening

          -  Males who do not agree to use barrier contraception and spermicide when engaging in
