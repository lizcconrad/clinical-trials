  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the impact of an online decision tool for patients with early stage
      invasive breast cancer. The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 444 newly
      diagnosed patients, recruited from multiple surgical practices in two SEER catchment areas.
      Participants will be randomized to receive either a basic version of a decision tool (similar
      to existing website with breast cancer information) or an enhanced version (featuring a
      knowledge building component, a values clarification exercise, and a patient activation
      module). Our hypothesis is that patients who use the enhanced version of the tool will have
      greater knowledge of their test and treatment options, have a higher rate of high quality
      (i.e., informed, preference-concordant) decisions, and report more positive appraisal of the
      decision-making process.

      Patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer face a series of complex decisions regarding
      locoregional and systemic treatment. Currently many of these decisions do not meet the
      definition of a high quality decision, defined as one that is both informed (i.e., based on
      an accurate understanding of the treatment risks and benefits) and preference-concordant
      (i.e., consistent with the patients' underlying preferences). Moreover, the introduction of
      evaluative tests has made these decisions more complicated for many patients. There is a need
      to improve the quality of locoregional and systemic treatment decisions for breast cancer
      patients, and to help patients understand the role of evaluative tests in this decision
      process. Ensuring patients can deliberate effectively about these decisions, assert their
      views and communicate with their clinicians is likely to improve their overall decision
      preparedness and satisfaction. This study will focus on the third pillar of individualized
      care by evaluating the impact of an innovative decision tool on locoregional and systemic
      therapy decision making for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. The innovative online
      decision tool has been developed and tested over the past two years by the CanSORT team (R21
      CA129859). Pilot data suggests that this tool has a positive impact on patient knowledge and
      decision outcomes. The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of this tool, after it is
      enhanced in collaboration with our Communication and Dissemination Core, on the quality of
      decision making for locoregional and systemic breast cancer treatment decision making.
