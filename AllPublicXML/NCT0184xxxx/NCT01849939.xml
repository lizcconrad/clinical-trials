  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Usually Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of the elderly patients. However, the
      diagnosis in young patients become more frequently with poor prognosis. The identification of
      new prognostic factors permits early determination of the high risk population and provide
      them the therapeutic intensification. Allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells
      transplantation (AHSCT) allows to long-term remission and in some cases complete and
      definitive eradication of the disease. After chemotherapy or antibodies, the Minimal Residual
      Disease (MRD) negativity is associated with better disease-free survival. MRD negativity
      occurs in some patients with the appearance of GVHD, stopping the immunosuppression or after
      donor lymphocyte injection (DLI). The negativity of MRD in the first year post-transplant is
      correlated with better progression-free survival or overall survival (Dreger 2010, Farina
      2009, Caballero 2005, Algrin, 2011). So, MRD negativity may be an objective after AHSCT. The
      aim of this prospective study is to evaluate a standardized preemptive immunointervention of
      post-allograft immunosuppressive therapy modulation and DLI administration according to MRD
      level. The objective is to obtain MRD negativity at 12 months after AHSCT.

      Patients will receive AHSCT with Fludarabine-Busulfan based conditioning :

        -  Fludarabine : 30 mg/m2/day - from Day-6 to Day-2

        -  Busulfan IV : 3.2 mg/kg/day - on Day-5 and Day-4

        -  ATG (Anti-thymocyte Globulin) : 2.5 mg/kg/day on Day-2 and Day-1

      Preemptive immunointervention post AHSCT consists in reduce immunosuppressive treatment more
      or less associated with DLI according to :

        -  the presence or absence of severe Graft versus host disease (GVHD) (acute grade 2 and /
           or chronic)

        -  the presence or absence of a response on criteria of response IWCLL

        -  Getting or not a blood MRD negative (&lt;-10 ^ -4) evaluated by flow cytometry
