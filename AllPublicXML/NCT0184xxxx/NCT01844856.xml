      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, prospective study to
      assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of eravacycline compared with ertapenem in
      the treatment of adult complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI).

    <time_frame>TOC visit: 25-31 days after the first dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was classified as cure (complete resolution or significant improvement of signs and symptoms of the index infection), failure (death related to complicated intra-abdominal infection [cIAI], unplanned surgical procedures or percutaneous drainage procedures, persisting or recurrent infection within the abdomen, postsurgical wound infection, or administration of effective concomitant antibacterial therapy), or indeterminate (outcome was neither cure nor failure, or assessment was not available). Participants who were failures at the End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit (within 24 hours of last dose) were considered failures at the TOC visit. The number of participants with a clinical response classification of cure, failure, or indeterminate is presented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female participant hospitalized for cIAI

          2. At least 18 years of age (and not over 65 years of age for participant in India)

          3. Evidence of a systemic inflammatory response

          4. Abdominal pain or flank pain (with or without rebound tenderness), or pain caused by

        <title>Clinical Response of Eravacycline and Ertapenem Treatment Arms in the Clinically Evaluable (CE) Population at the TOC Visit</title>
        <description>Clinical response was classified as cure (complete resolution or significant improvement of signs and symptoms of the index infection), failure (death related to complicated intra-abdominal infection [cIAI], unplanned surgical procedures or percutaneous drainage procedures, persisting or recurrent infection within the abdomen, postsurgical wound infection, or administration of effective concomitant antibacterial therapy), or indeterminate (outcome was neither cure nor failure, or assessment was not available). Participants who were failures at the EOT visit (within 24 hours of last dose) were considered failures at the TOC visit. The number of participants with a clinical response classification of cure, failure, or indeterminate is presented.</description>
