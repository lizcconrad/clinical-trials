      This trial is an interrogation of patients with prostate cancer to evaluate socioeconomic
      effects of radiotherapy. Patients with percutaneous or interstitial or combined percutaneous
      and interstitial radiotherapy are included. Beside medical effects and adverse events, it's
      prospectively needed to extensively inform patients about socioeconomic aspects associated
      with radiotherapy. The interrogation comprises to collect possible costs and expenditures
      during and after therapy. Aspects especially concerning post therapy period include
      additional consultations, individual applied alternative medical care, need for additional
      medical aids (salves, medicine, bandages) and changes in professional and social situation.
      It's figured out in what extend costs are absorbed by health insurance coverage. In Germany
      there is no appropriate trial with respective patient population and respective therapy.
      Primary endpoint is the evaluation of therapy concerning and follow-up costs as well as
      changes in social and professional situation. Secondary endpoints are quality of life,
      adverse events of therapy and the correlation of quality of life, adverse events and economic
      aspects for the patient and the health insurance coverage.
