  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the omega-3 fatty acid emulsion
      (Omegaven®), when used in place of the conventional soy-based fat emulsion (Intralipid), is
      effective in treating parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) in children.

      The study hypothesis is that Omegaven® can be safely provided to children who are dependent
      on parenteral nutrition and have PNALD, and can reverse or prevent progression of PNALD until
      the child can take adequate nutrition by mouth.

      Rationale for Omegaven® Treatment

      Unlike conventional intravenous fat emulsions, Omegaven® is comprised solely of fish oils
      containing primarily omega-3 fatty acids. Animal studies have shown that IV lipid emulsions
      such as fish oil that are high in eicosapentaenic and docosahexaenoic acid reduce impairment
      of bile flow as seen in cholestasis caused by conventional fat emulsions(1,2). By
      administering Omegaven® in place of conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsions, the
      cholestasis may be reversed and patients will be able to be maintained on adequate PN until
      they are able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally.
