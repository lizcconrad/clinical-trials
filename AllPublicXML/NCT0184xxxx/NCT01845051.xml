      The researchers investigated the relationship between migraine and allergy. For this purpose,
      the researchers designed a controlled study to evaluate nasal symptoms and signs; and to
      perform Specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) measurements in migraine patients and healthy
      subjects. According to these results the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in migraine group
      was planned to be compared to that of the healthy controls, statistically.

    <measure>Specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were taken from study and control group for the determination of Specific IgE panel against six different allergens: (1) fungi, (2) grass pollens, (3) tree pollens, (4) wild herbs, (5) mite 1, (6) mite 2. For all of specific IgE panels, &lt;0,7 RU/ml was negative; and &gt;0,7 RU/ml was Positive.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nasal Symptom Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms were assessed with a questionnaire for the presence and severity of allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms on a scale of 0-3 (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Symptoms of AR (Nasal discharge, nasal congestion, itching and sneezing) were graded between 0-3.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>inferior concha colour (0=natural, 1=pale, 2=bluish and 3=severely pale or bluish) and turbinate edema were assessed during ENT examination on 0-3 scale (0 = no, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe).</description>
