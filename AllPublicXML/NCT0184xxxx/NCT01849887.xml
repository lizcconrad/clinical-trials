  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of adult disability. Currently approved reperfusion therapies are
      provided to only a small percentage of patients in the U.S. New therapies are needed that
      improve outcome and that can be accessed by a majority of patients. Animal studies suggest
      that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, administered intravenously days after a
      stroke, safely improve long-term behavioral outcome. A large human experience suggests the
      safety of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The current study aims to
      assess the safety of this therapy in patients with recent ischemic stroke.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory, with onset 24-72 hours
             prior to the time that the therapy transfusion is initiated, radiologically confirmed,
             and with either diameter &gt;15 mm or volume &gt; 4cc.

          -  2. The index stroke has clinical deficits that are moderate-severe (NIHSS score 7-20),
             did not require hemicraniectomy or invasive intracranial pressure monitoring, and was
             not associated with a concomitant STelevation myocardial infarction.

          -  3. Age 18-80 years, inclusive

          -  4. Reasonable likelihood of receiving standard post-stroke medical care, as well as
             standard physical, occupational, and speech therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. No substantial pre-stroke disability (pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score 0-2).

          -  2. Females of child-bearing potential will be excluded unless (1) a negative urine
             pregnancy test is obtained and (2) the patient has been effectively using
             contraceptive method with known failure rate &lt;1 % for at least 90 days.

          -  3. Lactating mothers

          -  4. If thrombolytic therapy has been administered, at least 24 hours have passed
             between completing thrombolytic dosing and initiating the current study's transfusion.

          -  5. Known allergy to penicillin or to fetal bovine serum

          -  6. Active co-existent major neurological or psychiatric disease that could
             significantly interfere with patient compliance or study assessments, including drug
             or alcohol abuse.

          -  7. Any diagnosis that makes survival to 1-year post-stroke unlikely.

          -  8. Participation in any other experimental therapeutic clinical trial concurrently or
             in the prior three months.

          -  9. Contraindication to undergoing MRI scanning.
