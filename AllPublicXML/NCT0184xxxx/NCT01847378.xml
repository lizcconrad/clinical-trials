  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular tachycardia is one of the commonest cause of sudden death in chronic chagas
      disease. As most ventricular tachycardias originate from scar in patients with heart disease,
      catheter ablation is an important step in patient treatment. Identification of fibrosis prior
      to ablation of sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) might reduce the time of anesthesia,
      procedure time, radiation exposure and possibly the risk of complications. Knowledge of
      arrhythmia circuit within scar allows planning strategies for each procedure. Condreanu et
      al. stablished that voltages inferior to 6.52 mV (unipolar) and 1.54mV (bipolar) are useful
      tools in detecting scar during electroanatomic mapping. Accuracy, however when compared to
      magnetic resonance imaging is limited due to difficulties in maintaining good contact between
      ablation catheter and ventricular wall. Contact force catheters might help increase accuracy
      of voltage mapping because they allow detection of poor contact areas. Although the threshold
      for identification of scar in ischemic and non ischemic patients during electroanatomical
      mapping is already known, this parameters still lacking for chronic chagasic individuals. A
      marked qualitative histological difference between these fibrous scars supports the
      hypothesis that voltage scar in chagasics might be different. Catheter ablation contact with
      endo and epicardial surface is an important issue when ablating arrhythmias. Conventional
      catheter ablation is not equipped with sensors capable of detecting degree of contact with
      the target. To our knowledge, the literature lacks information in regard to late lesions
      produced by a known contact force pressure &quot;in vivo&quot;. The pattern of electrical activation in
      these patients and their relationship with local coronary veins for resynchronization likely
      to approach through the coronary sinus can be useful in defining chagasic that can benefit
      from resynchronization.

        1. Compare endocardial and epicardial impedance and voltage using CARTO 3 with fibrosis on
           3T MRI

        2. Correlate areas of late activation within scar during activating mapping in sinus rhythm
           with different signal intensity in 3T MRI

        3. Evaluate the influence of contact pressure during application of radiofrequency in
           making fibrosis analyzed 30 days after the procedure using a 3T MRI.

        4. Assess the site of latest left ventricular activation in sinus rhythm and correlate with
           the coronary veins location
