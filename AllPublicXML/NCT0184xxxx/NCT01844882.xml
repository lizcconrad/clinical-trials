  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a debilitating condition in which there is a gradual decline
      of renal function associated with increased overall mortality. Most dietary guidelines for
      CKD focus on limiting protein intake (nitrogen) and high phosphorus-containing foods.
      However, increasing dietary fiber has been proposed to increase fecal nitrogen excretion
      which may ameliorate the progress of CKD. We therefore plan to conduct a systematic review
      and meta-analysis on clinical trials to assess the effect of fiber on urea and creatinine as
      classical markers of a state of uremia in individuals with CKD. We hypothesize that
      increasing fiber intakes will improve urea and creatinine levels in individuals with CKD.
