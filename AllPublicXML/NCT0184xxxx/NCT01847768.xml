    <textblock>
      In this study, the following subjects will be exposed to human rhinovirus (HRV):

        -  those with classification of mild-moderate asthma

        -  healthy control subjects.

      The investigators will study the kinetics of HRV-induced inflammatory and remodeling
      responses in a well characterized group of asthmatic subjects and compare these outcomes to
      those in a healthy, non-asthmatic control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although changes in the lungs, known as remodeling, are a feature of asthma, the causes and
      mechanisms involved in the process have not yet been found. Recently, it has been established
      that remodeling can be observed in children prior to a formal diagnosis of asthma. Clinical
      studies indicate that HRV, &quot;common cold&quot; infections, are a common cause of recurrent
      respiratory illnesses in childhood, and children with HRV-associated wheezing episodes have
      an increased risk of developing asthma. This led to the hypothesis that HRV infections may
      play a central role in the start of the airway remodeling leading to asthma.

      The goal of this study is to determine if alterations in relevant airway remodeling growth
      factors differ between healthy controls and asthmatic subjects, pre- and post-HRV infection.
      These growth factors will be assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and endobronchial
      biopsy tissues and correlated with viral levels in both nasal lavage and BAL fluid.

             and anti-viral medications, over the counter 'cold' and influenza remedies, including

             Autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency, or any household contacts who are known to be
             immune deficient.

          -  Known allergy to lidocaine.

          -  Any other significant concomitant medical issue, or findings on physical examination
             or laboratory testing that, in the opinion of the study physician, may pose additional
             risks from participation in the study (including undergoing bronchoscopy), or which
             may impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study.

          -  Clinically significant pre-bronchoscopy safety assessment laboratory tests (CBC, INR,
             electrolytes and creatinine), as well as a positive urine pregnancy test on all female
             subjects of child-bearing age, will be done at visit 2 (day -26) and visit 5 (Day 0)
