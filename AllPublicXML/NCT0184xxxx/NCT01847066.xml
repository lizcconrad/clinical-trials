  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and efficacy of an ablative fractional, 2940-nm laser combined with the
      US Impact and cosmetic -formulations for improving the appearance of wrinkles, acne scars and
      pigmented skin.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, split face &amp; dorsal hand side by side study. The purpose of the side by
      side study is to determine whether the use of the Impact with the ablative fractional 2940nm
      laser and cosmetics improves the cosmetic outcomes when compared to using just the ablative
      fractional 2940nm laser with the cosmetics.

      This is a non-significant risk aesthetic clinical study. Only cosmetic formulations will be
      used during the study, These cosmetic formulations do not contain any ingredient categorized
      as a drug by the FDA.

          -  For FEMALE PATIENTS OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL, must have had a regular menstrual cycle
             prior to study entry (a female is considered of childbearing potential unless she is
             postmenopausal, without a uterus and/or both ovaries, or has had a bilateral tubal
             ligation) and is willing to use an acceptable form of birth control during the entire
             course of the study [i.e., acceptable methods of birth control are oral
             contraceptives, contraceptive patches/rings/implants Norplanit®, Depo-Provena®,
             double-barrier methods (e.g. condoms and spermicide), abstinence and vasectomies of
             partner with a documented second acceptable method of birth control should the subject
             become sexually active]. All systemic birth control measures must be in consistent use
             at least 30 days prior to study participation.

          -  Must be willing to comply with study visits and complete the entire course of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following are exclusion criteria for subjects in this study:

          -  A subject that underwent a laser / light treatment on the face within 12 months, or
             any topical treatment on the face with 6 months.

          -  A subject with any UNCONTROLLED systemic disease. A potential subject in whom therapy
             for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized will not be considered for entry into the
             study.

          -  A subject with a significant history or current evidence of a medical, psychological
             or other disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude enrollment into
             the study.

          -  A subject using any topical product containing a retinoid, retinol, or other vitamin A
             derivative within 3 months prior to or during the study period.

          -  A subject with recently excessive facial exposure to sunlight or artificial UV light
             (e.g.: use of tanning beds/booths and/or sunbathing). During the study, when excessive
             sun exposure is unavoidable, subjects must wear appropriate protective clothing (e.g.
             hat) and comply with the study dosing regimen of daily application of the dispersed
             sunblock.

          -  A subject with a recent history or active presence of any facial skin
             condition/disease that might interfere with the diagnosis or evaluation of study
             parameters (i.e. moderate to severe acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis,
             rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, excessive facial hair or coloration).

          -  A female subject who is pregnant, nursing an infant or planning a pregnancy during the

             during the entire study, or

          -  willing to use a different form of birth control during the study other than any form
             of hormonal methods such as oral contraceptive pills and hormonal implants 30 day
             prior to study entry and during the entire study period. For the purpose of this
             study, the following are considered acceptable methods of birth control:
             double-barrier methods (e.g.: condoms and spermicide), abstinence and vasectomies of
