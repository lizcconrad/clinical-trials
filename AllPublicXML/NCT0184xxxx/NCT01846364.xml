  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diindolylmethane (DIM), a dietary supplement, found naturally in cruciferous vegetables (such
      as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, &amp; Brussels sprouts) has been studied extensively in recent
      years for its anti-cancer effects. DIM has been shown to exert control over cancer cell
      growth in breast, uterine, cervical, ovarian, and colon cancer.

      To date no human study has been published regarding the bioavailability of DIM in thyroid
      tissue or its effects in proliferative thyroid disease. Our previous study attempted to
      elucidate DIM's promotion of anti-proliferative estrogen metabolites in proliferative thyroid
      disease and ascertain its uptake in thyroid tissue. DIM has been shown to concentrate in the
      thyroid gland. Furthermore, thyroid volumes have been seen to decrease subjectively.

      This study would continue our attempt to elucidate DIM's promotion of anti-proliferative
      estrogen metabolites in proliferative thyroid disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults diagnosed with abnormalities of the thyroid gland suspicious for benign
             adenoma, or goiterous changes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are pregnant, attempting to conceive, or lactating will be excluded due
             to possible deleterious effects of treatment on fetus/infant. Patients taking oral
             contraceptives, estrogen therapy, tamoxifin or those with a history of breast cancer
             will be excluded. Patients with liver disease and those taking statins for
             hypercholesterolemia will also be excluded to decrease the potential for possible
             liver toxicity. Any patient with elevated liver enzymes on pretreatment blood
             screening will be excluded from study participation. Patients with serious systemic
             diseases such as renal failure, diabetes, blood dyscrasia, coagulopathy, and
             non-optimized cardiopulmonary disease will be excluded due to the possibility of
             confounding blood tests screening for toxicity.
