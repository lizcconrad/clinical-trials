      Purpose : to Evaluation of the Efficacy of Escitalopram for the Treatment of Depression in
      Alzheimer's Disease

    <textblock>
      Clinical trial agreement signed by the parties to the subjects through a process of
      screening. if it is consider suitable for evaluating through the selection / exclusion
      criteria, they will be randomly assigned to the test group or control group (placebo).

      Assigned to the test group or control subjects, they will be prescribe the 5mg Escitalopram
      or Placebo. without regard to meals, it will be taking once a day.

      and than It should be increased the capacity every two weeks by 5mg/day up to a maximum
      15mg/day.

      and than, on the treatment for a 8 weeks, If you don't find the side effect, Maintaining the
      same capacity. If you find the side effect, you should lose capacity.(10mg/day)

      The test group or control subjects, will receive a doctor's examination and inspection
      through six visits for a 24weeks from the date of the randomly assigned participants.
