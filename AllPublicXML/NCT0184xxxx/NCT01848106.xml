  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the efficacy of REG1 compared to bivalirudin in
      preventing periprocedural ischemic complications and major bleeding in patients undergoing
      PCI as a treatment for CAD. Bivalirudin has been studied in patients undergoing PCI in both
      ACS (NSTEMI and unstable angina [UA]) and elective PCI. In comparison to UFH, bivalirudin has
      shown similar rates of ischemic events while demonstrating a significant reduction in
      bleeding and an improved net clinical benefit.

      Evidence from previous studies indicates that pegnivacogin represents an extremely potent,
      chemically unique anticoagulant that can be reversed by anivamersen across multiple
      populations (refer to Section 1.2.2). The question that still remains is whether Factor IX
      (FIX) inhibition by pegnivacogin can result in fewer ischemic events than a previously
      studied agent while active control with anivamersen can preserve the benefit of reduced
      bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate REG1 in an adequately powered definitive
      study with an open-label, multi-center, active-controlled, randomized design to answer that
      question.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The study population will consist of patients with CAD undergoing PCI. Three key
             subgroups will be included

          2. Willing and able to sign an Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC)
             approved informed consent prior to any study-related activities;

          3. Male or female age 18 or greater;

          4. If female of childbearing potential, must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test or be post-menopausal for at least 1 year prior to randomization. Females of
             childbearing potential must be practicing adequate birth control to be eligible. It is
             the Investigator's responsibility for determining whether the patient has adequate
             birth control for study participation;

          5. Subject is able and willing to comply with the protocol and all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction within 48 hours of randomization;

          2. Evidence of current clinical instability

          3. Evidence of a contraindication to anticoagulation or increased risk of bleeding

          4. Use of any investigational drug or device within 30 days of randomization or the
             planned use of an investigational drug or device through EOS (Day 30 follow-up);

          5. Use of the select antithrombotic agents

          6. Baseline hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;9 g/dL or equivalent;

          7. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≤ 10 mL/min/1.73m² or currently
             undergoing renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis);

          8. Baseline platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3;

          9. Known allergy or intolerance to aspirin, to all available ADP/P2Y12 inhibitors
             (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor), or to bivalirudin or REG1 (or any of their
             respective components);

         10. The following planned procedures: a. Planned staged PCI procedure within 3 days after
             randomization; b. Planned CABG or valve surgery within 30 days after randomization;

         11. Any other medical or psychiatric condition that in the Investigator's judgment
             precludes participation in the study
