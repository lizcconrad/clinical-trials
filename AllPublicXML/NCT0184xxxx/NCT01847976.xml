  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if women with bone metastases from breast cancer will
      benefit from the addition of doxycycline to their standard bone-targeted therapy.
      Participants will be asked to take 100 mg of Doxycycline orally twice a day for 12 weeks.
      Blood and tissue collection will further define the mechanism of the benefits if there are
      any.

      Potential candidates for this trial must have received intravenous bisphosphonate therapy
      (i.e. pamidronate or zoledronic acid) or subcutaneous denosumab for at least 3 months.
      Baseline patient characteristics will be recorded and screening serum PTH (to rule out
      primary hyperparathyroidism) and vitamin D (25OH-vit D) will be recorded. In order to fulfill
      the study objectives, serum will be taken for CTX (fasting morning blood sample), P1NP and
      BSAP as well as for the optional translational studies (e.g. MMP and TIMP levels). Optional
      urine will be taken for NTX. Questionnaires will also be completed for symptoms (Brief pain
      inventory (BPI) [26] and FACT-BP [27]) and analgesic use (converted into an oral
      Morphine-equivalent dose). The serum, urine and questionnaire data will be collected at:
      baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 12. In addition, toxicity information and questions about the
      occurrence of skeletal related events will be performed at baseline, weeks 4, 8 and 12. At
      baseline and week 12 the patient will also have a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy
      performed from the posterior iliac crest. These specimens will be used for ER, PR and Her2
      analysis (by FISH) and markers of apoptosis (TUNEL) and proliferation (Ki67) and also for
      optional translational studies providing tumour cells are present.

    <description>The primary objective of this prospective study is to assess the palliative benefit (reflected through changes in validated pain scores and the bone resorption marker serum C-telopeptide) of adding doxycycline 100mg PO BID daily for 3 months to standard bone-targeted (i.e. intravenous bisphosphonate or subcutaneous denosumab) therapy in women with breast cancer and bone metastases.</description>

    <description>To determine whether levels of FAK, MMPs or TIMPs correlate with palliative benefit, bone turnover, or symptom response in patients treated with doxycycline in combination with bone-targeted (i.e. intravenous bisphosphonate or subcutaneous denosumab) as compared to bone-targeted agent alone. This will be determined following a comparison of levels in baseline specimens (when patients are on bone-targeted agent alone) with end of study specimens (when patients are receiving both doxycycline and bone-targeted agents).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with metastatic breast cancer with radiologically confirmed bone metastases.

          2. On intravenous bone-targeted therapy (bisphosphonate or subcutaneous (SC) denosumab)
             for at least 3 months.

          3. ECOG ≤ 2

          4. Life expectancy &gt;3 months.

          5. No changes in the type of systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or biological
             therapy (i.e. trastuzumab, lapatinib) treatment in the 4 weeks prior to study entry or
             anticipated changes in the 4 weeks after entering the study. (Markers of bone
             formation can be affected by a change in systemic therapies).

          6. Ability to provide informed consent and complete study evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior hypersensitivity to either IV bisphosphonate therapy or SC denosumab,
             doxycycline or tetracyclines.

          2. Patients with myasthenia gravis

          3. Patients taking hepatic enzymes inducers such as phenytoin, barbiturates and
             carbamazepine

          4. Patients with rapidly progressive non-bone metastases for whom delaying a change in
             systemic anti-cancer treatment in the first 4 weeks of the study could have a
             detrimental impact on patient outcome.

          5. Women of child bearing potential who are unwilling to use acceptable methods of
             contraception while on study.

          6. Pregnancy or lactation.

             (Patients on Fragmin or Daltaperin are allowed on study)
