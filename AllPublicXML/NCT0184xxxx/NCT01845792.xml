  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take place in this research study because they have advanced
      prostate cancer that has gotten worse after other treatments. If they join this study they
      will receive a new combination of drugs that are used to treat prostate cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone acetate and cabazitaxel have been approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body such
      as the lymph nodes or bone. These drugs are approved individually for use when the cancer has
      become resistant to other treatments, including chemotherapy with docetaxel. The combination
      of these two drugs has not been evaluated, so the research team will study the safety and
      effectiveness of the combination.
