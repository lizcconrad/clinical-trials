        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Apparently healthy Indonesian infants

          -  Age 8-10 month at baseline visit

          -  Willing to take 2 sachets of study product per day

          -  Planning to reside in the study area during the next 14-16 months

          -  Written informed consent by parent(s) or legally acceptable representative (in ICF
             there is statement that both are agree that child participate in the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Haemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL at screening visit*.

          -  Significant congenital abnormality which according to investigator's clinical
             judgement will interfere the study conduct and assessment

          -  Any known conditions likely to affect nutrient absorption diagnosed by the child's
             physician

          -  Disorders requiring a special diet (such as food intolerance or food allergy or
             complaints such as reflux, constipation and cramps for which special formula is
             required).

          -  Any other current or previous illnesses/conditions or intervention which according to
             investigator's clinical judgement could interfere the study conduct and assessment
             (e.g. chronic illness or physical or mental handicaps)

          -  Regular use of MMN supplements syrup (every day in &gt; 1 week) within two weeks prior to
             entry into the study.

          -  Not intending to use micronutrient supplements during the study

          -  Participation in any other studies involving similar investigational or marketed
             products concomitantly or within two weeks prior to entry into the study.

          -  Premature birth (gestational age &lt;37 weeks)

          -  Severely under nutrition indicated by any of the following criteria: severely stunted:
             HAZ &lt; -3 SD; severely underweight WAZ &lt;-3 SD; wasted: WHZ &lt;-2 SD

             *Subject with haemoglobin level (finger prick blood sample) at screening visit between
             8-10 g/dL will be given iron syrup supplementation for 1 month. Thereafter,
             haemoglobin level (whole blood sample) will be checked at baseline visit:

          -  If Hb &gt; 10 g/dL, subject is eligible for randomisation

          -  If Hb &lt; 10 g/dL, subject is not eligible for randomisation and will be given iron
             syrup supplementation for 2 months
