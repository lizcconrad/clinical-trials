  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examination of the effect of GET 73 on alcohol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      (intoxication and sedation)and safety profile in alcohol-dependent individuals.To evaluate
      whether GET 73, as compared to placebo, results in diminished cue-reactivity responses to
      alcohol cues in terms of urge to drink during the cue reactivity session and results in lower
      quantity of alcohol consumed during an alcohol self-administration session.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in area under the plasma concentration of alcohol versus time curve (AUC), after administration of GET 73 or placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>blood samples are drawn on day 2 and day 12 at baseline and then, following the start of alcohol consumption, for the next 8 hours or until the blood alcohol level is zero on 2 successive determinations</time_frame>
    <description>On Day 2 and Day 12 subjects have an indwelling catheter placed in a forearm vein for blood draws. After the 5th dose of GET 73 or placebo is administered on Day 2 and Day 12, participants receive a dose of alcohol 30 minutes later, which is calculated to produce a peak of 0.08 g/L, based on body water content.
AUC will be evaluated as mean value of overall subjects evaluated</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pleasurable and negative effects of alcohol intoxication and sedation, measured by the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scales (BAES),during the Alcohol Self-Administration (ASA) session, when taking GET 73 compared to placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>The BAES will be administered, at Day 2 and Day 12, eight times after the priming drink is presented during the ASA.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in reaction time, measured by Conners's Continuous Performance Task (CPT),when taking GET 73 compared to placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>CPT will be assessed at Day 2 and Day 12</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cognitive performance, measured by Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), when taking GET 73 compared to placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>DSST will be assessed at Day 2 and Day 12</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of adverse events (AEs) occured after placebo or GET 73 administration</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 20-27 days</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded. Subjects are discharged from the hospital at Day 13, after the two inpatient treatment phases (Day 1-Day 3 and Day 11-Day 13). A follow-up visit, approximately from 7 to 14 days after the second CR/ASA experiment, will be performed. The AEs will be grouped by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs preferred terms into frequency tables according to system organ class (SOC).
Frequencies of AEs occurred after placebo or GET 73 administration will be compared using chi-square or Fischer's exact test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cue reactivity (CR) responses to alcohol cues, in terms of urge to drink, as measured by the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ), when taking GET 73 compared to placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 3 and Day 13 during the two treatment phases</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate whether GET 73, as compared to placebo, results in reductions in craving (as measured by the AUQ), the AUQ will be administered eight times after the priming drink is presented during the ASA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in CR responses to alcohol cues, in terms of psychophysiological responses,heart rate,mean arterial pressure and salivation changes during the CR session.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 3 and Day 13 during the two treatment phases</time_frame>
    <description>There are three experimental time periods of 3-minutes each during each CR session. Cotton swabs will be weighed at the end of each 3-minute block and the mean values for weight of salivation will be calculated. An average heart rate and an average mean arterial pressure will be calculated for each of these three time periods.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in attention to the sight and smell of cues, as measured by Alcohol Attention Scale (AAS), during the CR.</measure>
    <time_frame>This endpoint will be measured twice in each CR session (Day 3 and Day 13) through the AAS.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of GET 73 on the amount of alcohol consumed during the ASA. The maximum quantity of alcohol will be taken, to have a measure directly comparable to AUQ results</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 3 and Day 13 during the two treatment phases</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of alcohol after administration of GET 73 or placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>blood samples are drawn on Day 2 and Day 12 at baseline and then, following the start of alcohol consumption, for the next 8 hours or until the blood alcohol level is zero on 2 successive determinations</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax will be calculated at the peak level as mean value of overall subjects evaluated</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in time to peak plasma level (Tmax) of alcohol after administration of GET 73 or placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>blood samples are drawn on Day 2 and Day 12 at baseline and then, following the start of alcohol consumption, for the next 8 hours or until the blood alcohol level is zero on 2 successive determinations</time_frame>
    <description>Tmax will be evaluated as the time after administration corresponding to the time of peak plasma level and as mean value of overall subjects evaluated</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in half-life of alcohol after administration of GET 73 or placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>blood samples are drawn on Day 2 and Day 12 at baseline and then, following the start of alcohol consumption, for the next 8 hours or until the blood alcohol level is zero on 2 successive determinations</time_frame>
    <description>Half-life will be calculated as mean value of overall subjects evaluated</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Characteristics of adverse events (AEs) occured after placebo or GET 73 administration</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 20-27 days</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded. Subjects are discharged from the hospital at Day 13, after the two inpatient treatment phases (Day 1-Day 3 and Day 11-Day 13). A follow-up visit, approximately from 7 to 14 days after the second CR/ASA experiment, will be performed. The AEs will be grouped by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs preferred terms according to system organ class (SOC). When an AE occurs more than once for a subject, the maximal severity and strongest relationship to the medication will be counted.
Characteristics of AEs occurred after placebo or GET 73 administration will be compared using chi-square or Fischer's exact test.</description>
