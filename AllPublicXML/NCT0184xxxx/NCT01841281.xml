  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major impact of this study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will
      benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy. The investigators hypothesize that a subset of
      adult severe asthma patients will respond to supplemental L-arginine and derive clinical
      benefit from the addition of this therapy to standard-of-care asthma medications. The
      investigators hypothesize that the patients that benefit most will have low exhaled nitric
      oxide concentrations (&lt; 20 ppb) at baseline.

    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that a subset of adult severe asthma patients will respond to supplemental
      L-arginine and derive clinical benefit from the addition of this therapy to standard-of-care
      medications. We hypothesize that these patients will have lower exhaled NO concentrations
      (&lt;20 ppb) and lower nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2)/ arginase I (Arg1) mRNA ratios in their
      airway epithelial cells than &quot;non-responders.&quot; The aim is to test the hypothesis that adult
      severe asthma subjects with exhaled breath NO concentrations &lt; 20 ppb will have fewer
      American Thoracic Society (ATS)-defined asthma exacerbations over 3 months when treated with
      L-arginine compared to subjects with exhaled nitric oxide concentration (FeNO) &gt; 25 ppb. The
      major impact of this study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will
      benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy to define the underlying mechanisms of arginine
      benefit in asthma. This follows our initial 20 subject trial of L-arginine in asthma subjects
      (Kenyon et al., Pharmaceuticals 2011) that was designed to determine how L-arginine was
      metabolized (by testing serum markers) and whether certain participants had clinical benefit.

      To do this, we will recruit a total of 50 ATS-defined severe asthmatic subjects with ongoing
      asthma exacerbations in past two months and enroll them in a randomized, blinded,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over designed trial of L-arginine and placebo. We will compare 25
      subjects with &quot;low&quot; FeNO &lt; 20 with 25 subjects that have &quot;high&quot; FeNO &gt; 25 ppb.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the number of acute moderate exacerbations at 3 months. A moderate asthma exacerbation is defined as any of the following: 1) A drop in morning peak flow rate (PEFR) &gt;30% from baseline on 2 consecutive days (1 event), 2) Need for initiation of oral steroids or am increased dose of inhaled corticosteroids on any two consecutive days (1 event), 3) Doubling of short-acting Î²-agonist use (e.g. number of puffs of albuterol) per day for 2 consecutive days (1 event).</description>
