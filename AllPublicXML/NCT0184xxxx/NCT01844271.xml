  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle fatigue and muscle recovery after exercise are recent areas of research involving Low
      Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) and many factors remain unknown, such as optimal doses, power and
      application parameters, mechanisms of action, effects on long-term exercise and the long-term
      effects on skeletal muscle recovery.

      The present research project aims to assess the effects of long-term recovery of LLLT in
      skeletal muscle after exercise and identify the optimal dose application of LLLT.

      After defining the best dose of application, we recruited two groups which will be irradiated
      with different power, 100mW and 400mW in order to seek the optimal parameter of low level
      laser therapy in performance.

      The investigators believed that the Low Level Laser Therapy can delay the physiological
      process of muscle fatigue, reduce injury or skeletal muscle microdamage arising from physical
      effort and accelerate muscle recovery after exercise.

      To achieve the proposed objectives it was performed a randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial, with voluntary participation of high-level soccer athletes.

      Participants received an application of low level laser prior to execution of a strenuous
      exercise. It was used a laser with a cluster of 5 diodes (810 nm, 200 mW each diode) with
      different doses (placebo, 2J, 6J, 10J) and power of 200mW.

      In a second step, with the optimal dose already defined, this was used to be applied with
      different powers in two experimental groups, 100mW and 400mW.

      The investigators analysed parameters related to volunteers exercise performance (torque peak
      / maximum voluntary contraction), delayed onset muscle soreness, and biochemical markers of
      muscle damage (CK and LDH), inflammation (interleukin 1 and 6, alpha tumoral necrosis factor)
      and oxidative stress (TBARS, CAT, SOD and carbonylated proteins). The analysis was performed
      before exercise protocols, after 1 minute, and 1, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the end of
      exercise protocol in both parts of the study.

    <time_frame>Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was performed before the exercise protocol and repeted 1 minute, 1 hour, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the eccentric contraction protocol. The peak torque was performed after 3 minutes of LLLT application.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators used an isokinetic dynamometer to assess muscle function and the execution of the exercise protocol, because this tool is currently recognized as the most reliable, reliability and reproducibility for measuring the performance musculoskeletal.
The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was performed before the exercise protocol and repeated 1 minute, 1 hour, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the eccentric contraction protocol.
The peak torque was measured after evaluation of muscular pain, blood tests, stretching and warming, MVC and application of a predetermined dose of low level therapy (LLLT). It was done after 3 minutes of LLLT application through execution of a eccentric contraction of 5 series of 15 repetitions.
After the execution of the exercise protocol it was repeated the collection of blood samples, measuring DOMS and muscle function test (MVC) in 1 minute, 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 96 hours from the protocol.</description>

    <description>Comparison of different dosages of a Low Level Laser applied in six different locations of the knee extensor muscles of the lower limb non-dominant before a strenuous exercise.
We performed stretching and warming up of the muscles involved, assessment of muscle pain, withdrawal of blood sample, test muscle function (MVC), application of dose of low level laser designated for each volunteer (0, 2, 6 or 10), performing eccentric contractions protocol in isokinetic dynamometer . After the protocol we evaluated muscle function, the DOMS, and blood analyzes in 1 minute, 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours 72 hours and 96 hours.
In a second stage, the optimal dose defined by the first part of the study will be tested in two different powers, 100 and 400mW. The study was repeated in two experimental groups using the optimal dose established and the powers of 100 and 400mW that was randomly distributed in groups.</description>
