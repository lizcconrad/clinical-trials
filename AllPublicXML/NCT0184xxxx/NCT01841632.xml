      MultiStem ® is a new biological product, manufactured from human stem cells obtained from
      adult bone marrow. Factors expressed by MultiStem cells are believed to regulate immune
      system function and augment tissue repair.

      Standard of care pharmacological immunosuppression after liver transplantation can achieve
      reasonable survival of liver grafts and patients. The side effects of this treatment,
      however, are clinically significant and diminish the overall success of organ transplantation
      as a curative therapy. It is therefore the objective of this study to implement cellular
      immunomodulation therapy with MultiStem as an adjunct to standard pharmacological
      immunosuppression with the ultimate goal of significantly reducing drug-based
      immunosuppression.

      As this is the first study with MultiStem in this subject population it has been designed as
      a safety and feasibility trial. However, first evidence of a potential benefit for this
      patient population will be explored cautiously.

    <measure>Infusional and acute toxicity, using toxicity scoring mechanism</measure>
    <time_frame>up to day 30 (+10)</time_frame>
    <description>For the description of intraportal toxicity a doppler ultrasound examination will be performed to assess various parameters that describe velocity of flow and flow pattern.
For pulmonary toxicity the assessment begins with an arterial blood gas. If this reveals pathological findings, a chest X-ray is required for clinical reasons independent of the study enrolment. In addition, clinical data describing the need for postoperative re-intubation will be recorded and the patient is assessed for the occurrence of a pulmonary embolism according to clinical guidelines.
For systemic toxicity, the occurrence of anaphylactic shock due to standard clinical guidelines is recorded.</description>
