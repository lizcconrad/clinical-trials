      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine the effect that an intensive, community dental clinic centered,
           stop-smoking program using a motivational interviewing approach has upon cessation rates
           for interested, smoking inner-city dental patients.

        2. To determine the effect that providing a tooth whitening incentive, in a community
           dental clinic stop-smoking program, has upon cessation rates for interested, smoking
           inner-city dental patients.
