  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to learn more about a drug called Tranexamic acid (TA), otherwise known as
      Lysteda, and whether or not this drug can decrease menstrual blood loss in young women and
      lead to an increase in the quality of life.

      Menorrhagia in young women with bleeding disorders is typically treated with a combination of
      treatments including hormonal contraceptives. However, there are barriers to hormonal
      contraception use in younger adolescents.

      Tranexamic acid is taken orally during the first 5 days of menstrual bleeding.

      The purposes of this study include:

      To test the safety and efficacy of Lysteda in adolescent females. To learn how well Lysteda
      works in decreasing menstrual blood loss. To see if parents and children participating in
      this study think the drug is improving their quality of life.

      Lysteda has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients &gt; than 18
      years of age but not for younger patients.

      This is a multi-center (5 sites) open-label, single-arm, efficacy study of Lysteda in the
      treatment of adolescent females (10-19 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).
      Each subject will receive oral Lysteda 1.3 grams three times daily during the first five days
      of menses. Subjects will be monitored over the course of four menstrual cycles (1
      pre-treatment cycle and 3 treatment cycles). During all cycles, assessments of menstrual
      bleeding will be performed using the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) and Pictorial
      Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC).

      The study will begin as a currently funded pilot study to assess the efficacy of Lysteda in
      32 patients followed to study completion.

          3. Physician and patient have agreed to initiate Lysteda

          4. Diagnosis of HMB based on the medical judgment of the principal or site investigator

          5. Subjects must report menstrual periods occurring within 21-60 days from the start of
             one period to the start of the next menstrual period

          6. Negative pregnancy test

          7. Informed consent obtained and signed

          8. Informed assent obtained and signed

             method with spermicide in the event of sexual activity throughout the study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active thromboembolic disease, history of thromboembolic disease (including retinal
             vein or artery occlusion), known inherited thrombophilia, or family history of
