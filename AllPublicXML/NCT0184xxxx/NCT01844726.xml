  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study proposes to evaluate the potential cognitive enhancing effects of GLYX-13,
      an NMDAR partial agonist, among a group of healthy adults and those with psychiatric illness
      on a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) learning and memory tasks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a single blind randomized parallel group design, we will evaluate the whether a single
      dose of GLYX-13 vs. placebo increases cognitive performance on tasks of learning, declarative
      memory, and working memory, and associated task-related increases in BOLD activation in
      hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. Positive findings will provide
      biomarker evidence for GLYX-13 effects on neural systems underlying these cognitive
      processes.
