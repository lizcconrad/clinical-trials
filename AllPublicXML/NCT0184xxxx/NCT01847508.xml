      The primary objective is to compare the mechanical failure risks in the first year after
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biomechanical tests have shown that augmentation of screws or nails with
      polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) leads to increased mechanical properties of the bone-implant
      complex, leading to the assumption that augmentation could reduce mechanical failures in
      patients. While a few clinical studies have already been performed with augmented
      trochanteric nails in proximal femur fractures, no clinical studies exist with the use of
      Proximal Humerus Internal Locking System (PHILOS) and (PMMA) augmentation for the treatment
      of fractures in the proximal humerus.

      In this study a new standardized technique for augmentation of screw tips using high viscous
      PMMA cement (Traumacem V+) with the PHILOS plate will be applied. Fracture treatment with
      PHILOS Screw Augmentation will be compared with treatment with PHILOS without augmentation.

    <description>Mechanical failures are defined as loss of reduction (≥ 15° increase of varus malposition between the immediate postoperative position and follow-up radiograph, relative change [5 mm] of greater or lesser tuberosity compared to the immediate postoperative position), head impaction (≥ 5 mm difference in outer plate edge and tangent of humeral head between immediate post-op and follow-up. The tangent is determined perpendicular to the humeral neck), screw/plate loosening (any change outwards of screw position in relation to immediate postoperative position) and secondary screw perforation (perforation of one or more screws through the humeral head into the joint space on the follow-up radiograph(and lack of screw perforation on the intra- or postoperative Rx based on a baseline anteroposterior and axial Rx.</description>
