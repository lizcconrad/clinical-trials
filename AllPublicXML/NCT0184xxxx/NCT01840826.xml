  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project Re-Engineered Discharge (Project RED) has previously demonstrated that patients who
      received the RED were 30% less likely than patients receiving usual care to access inpatient
      or emergency services within 30 days of discharge. In this project, the investigators add a
      new dimension to RED by integrating screening, referral and treatment for depression into the
      original RED intervention and determining if this enhanced intervention increases the
      effectiveness of RED in preventing readmissions and controlling costs in the 180 days after
      discharge for patients with signs of depression.

    <measure>All-cause readmission rates</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 90 days post-discharge from hospital at index admission</time_frame>
    <description>The primary hypothesis is to test whether the RED intervention plus the collaborative-care approach for depression (RED-D) will reduce the all-cause 30 and 90 day hospital readmission rates for patients who screen positive for depressive symptoms</description>

    <description>The primary hypothesis is to test whether the RED intervention plus the collaborative-care approach for depression (RED-D) will reduce the all-cause 30 and 90 day hospital utilization rates for patients who screen positive for depressive symptoms</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cost-saving</measure>
    <time_frame>90 &amp; 180 after discharge from index hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>The economic analysis will investigate whether the two interventions are cost saving and whether the RED-D intervention is more cost saving than the RED intervention alone. The principal source of the savings is likely to be from reduced rehospitalizations within the 90 days of study follow-up. Hospital administrative records and insurance company data will be used to gather cost data. Additional costs of the two interventions will be estimated by costing staff time and other resources used. Cost-savings will be estimated by t-test comparisons of the mean costs for the groups; given randomization of patient assignment these will provide unbiased estimates.</description>

    <measure>Mental Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 90 days after discharge from index admission</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of the RED-D Collaborative Care Intervention mental health related quality of life will be ascertained using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) . The investigators will test whether collaborative care for depression can produce a clinically meaningful improvement in mental health related quality of life compared to those patients receiving either usual care or the RED discharge alone.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to receive the Intervention work with a RED-D Care Manager post-discharge. The Care Manager meets with the patient in the hospital, prior to discharge, and post-discharge via weekly phone calls. Patients have access to a range of treatment options, overseen by the Care Manager, including: (1) medication; (2) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); (3) complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) information and referral; (4) Self-help, such as reading a book, making a change in diet and/or exercise in order to improve mood; (5) active surveillance; and (6) any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5.</description>
