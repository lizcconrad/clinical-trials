      Background:

        -  Healthy people have white blood cells that protect them against bacteria, viruses, and
           fungi. However, some people have diseases which cause the body to make white blood cells
           that do not work properly. These white blood cells can attack the body s own proteins.
           These types of diseases are called anti-cytokine autoantibody-associated diseases. They
           can cause severe illnesses and even death. They are also difficult to treat with
           standard drugs.

        -  Rituximab is a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It attacks white blood cells
           that do not work properly. Currently, it is not approved for treating anti-cytokine
           autoantibody-associated diseases. However, researchers think that it may be able to help
           treat people with these immune diseases.

      Objectives:

      - To see if rituximab is a safe and effective treatment for anti-cytokine
      autoantibody-associated diseases.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have anti-cytokine autoantibody-associated
           diseases.

        -  Participants must also be enrolled in a related immune disorder study at the National
           Institutes of Health.

      Design:

        -  The study will last 24 months. Participants will take rituximab for 6 months and have
           follow-up visits for the remaining 18 months.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Other samples will be collected as needed if participants
           currently have an infection.

        -  Participants will enter the hospital for 1 week at the start of treatment. They will
           have four doses of rituximab given 2 days apart. This first treatment will be monitored
           with frequent blood tests.

        -  Over the next 6 months, participants will have four more doses of rituximab given about
           1 month apart. Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and sample
           collections as needed.

        -  There will be four follow-up study visits at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after the last dose
           of rituximab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anticytokine autoantibodies are an important and emerging cause of disease. Anticytokine
      autoantibody-associated diseases include disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection
      caused by anti-interferon- &gt;= autoantibodies, severe mucocutaneous candidiasis caused by
      anti-interleukin-17 autoantibodies, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis caused by
      anti-granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor autoantibodies. Many subjects
      undergoing treatments related to these diseases fail to respond or develop toxicity to long
      term therapy. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets antibody-producing B
      cells, has been used successfully to treat autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis),
      as well as syndromes caused by pathogenic anticytokine autoantibodies (e.g., myasthenia
      gravis and pemphigus vulgaris). This is a phase I, single arm, open-label study evaluating
      the safety and clinical response to rituximab treatment in subjects (greater than or equal to
      18 years of age; n=20) with anticytokine autoantibody-associated diseases who are intolerant
      or refractory to conventional treatment. Rituximab will be administered as intravenous
      infusions of 1 gram on days 1 and 15, and subsequently if indicated up to once a month for 5
      months (plus or minue 5 days for each visit) starting on approximately day 42. Follow-up
      visits will occur within 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months (plus or minus 2 weeks for each
      visit) after the last infusion. Subjects will be maintained on a background of appropriate
      therapy for their respective diseases. The safety and clinical response to rituximab will be
      assessed by clinical and laboratory parameters while subjects are receiving rituximab, and
      for an additional year and a half after completion of treatment.
