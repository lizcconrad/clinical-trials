    <textblock>
      Lung tumors of non-small cell stage 1A are usually treated surgically but many patients are
      not operable because of their condition or respiratory problems associated with it. The
      treatment is then suggested that local radiotherapy is conventionally carried out in split
      mode for 6 weeks at a dose of 60-65 Gy irradiation mode This exposes the patient to
      complications, including post-radiation pneumonitis.

      Lung tumors of non-small cell stage 1A are usually treated surgically but many patients are
      not operable because of their condition or respiratory problems associated with it.

      The treatment is then suggested that local radiotherapy is conventionally carried out in
      split mode for 6 weeks at a dose of 60-65 Gy irradiation mode This exposes the patient to
      complications, including post-radiation pneumonitis.

      This can be problematic in patients with respiratory failure for which surgical treatment has
      been challenged. Radiofrequency pulmonary developed as a therapeutic alternative, it has the
      advantage of being performed in a session with less toxicity in the lung parenchyma
