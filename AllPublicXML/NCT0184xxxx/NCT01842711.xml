      A Cumulative Patch Test with a Challenge Phase is a test devised to ascertain if a chemical
      agent or agents have the potential to cause contact irritation or contact allergy in the
      skin. Allergy is only elicited in immunologically competent individuals who have become
      sensitized through exposure to the chemical agent at a sufficient concentration and for a
      sufficient duration of time.
