  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad, long term objective of this interdisciplinary research is to identify effective
      therapies for low back pain sufferers and to increase our understanding of this important
      condition. The primary aim is to examine the relative efficacy of chiropractic spinal
      manipulation, rehabilitative exercise, and self-care education in terms of patient-rated
      outcomes in the short and long term for non-acute low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain remains an important public health problem with serious socioeconomic
      consequences. Despite the considerable amount of research that has been preformed, there is
      still a dire need for randomized clinical tiles of high methodological quality. The broad,
      long-term objective of this interdisciplinary research is to identify effective therapies for
      low back pain sufferers and increased understanding of this important condition. Building
      upon the principal investigators' previous collaborative research, this randomized
      observer-blinded clinical trial will compare the following treatment for patients with
      nonacute low back pain:

        1. chiropractic spinal manipulation

        2. rehabilitative exercise

        3. self care education Theprimary aim is to examine the relative efficacy of the three
           interventions in terms of patient rated outcomes in the short-term (after 12 weeks) and
           the long-term (after 52 weeks) for nonacute low back pain.

      Secondary aims include:

        1. To examine the short and long-term relative cost effectiveness and cost utility of the
           three treatments.

        2. To assess if there are clinically important differences between pre-specified subgroups
           of low back pain patients. Subgroups are based on duration and current episode and
           radiating leg pain.

        3. To evaluate if there treatment group differences in objective lumbar spine function
           (range of motion, strength and endurance) after 12 weeks of treatment and if changes in
           lumbar function are associated with changes in patient rated short and long-term
           outcomes.

        4. To identify if baseline demographic or clinical variables can predict short or long-term
           outcome.

        5. To describe patients' interpretations and perceptions of outcome measures used in
           clinical trials.
