      effective treatment of the postmastectomy pain syndrome.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, placebocontrolled, doubleblind study on the effect of the
      antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, in patients suffering from PMPS. The treatment periods are
      1 month each and the periods are separated by a 1-week washout period. The daily dose of
      levetiracetam is increased over a 2-week period to 3.000 mg/day. The primary effect variable
      is pain relief by the use of numeric rating scale. Secondary parameters are daily
      registration of pain performed by the patients during the treatment periods and the amount of
      escape medicine used (paracetamol and tramadol). Sensory testing is performed at baseline and
      after each treatment period.

    <description>The starting dose of levetiracetam was 500 mg/day and the dose was increased with 500 mg every other day to 6 tablets of 500 mg (Keppra, UCB, Belgium), divided into two doses daily corresponding to 3000 mg/day. The dose was kept at this level throughout the remaining treatment period - 4 weeks total. Six placebo tablets with identical appearance were dosed similarly to levetiracetam in the placebo phase.</description>
