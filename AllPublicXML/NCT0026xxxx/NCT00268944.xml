  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a
      critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the
      body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures
      called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates
      and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their
      normal function. The overall objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rhGAA in
      patients with advanced Late-onset Pompe disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  male or female aged greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  patient's legally authorized guardian(s) must provide signed, informed consent prior
             to initiation of study; patient's signature required if patient understands informed
             consent

          -  patient must have a documented deficit in acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) activity ,
             corresponding to the diagnosis of Pompe disease confirmed by documented genotyping

          -  patient presents with advanced documented symptoms of the disease defined as follows:
             patient is in a wheel chair and presents diaphragmatic dysfunction and requires
             invasive ventilation or non invasive ventilation (12 or more hours daily)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient has received enzyme replacement therapy with GAA from any source

          -  patient has taken an experimental drug in the 30 days prior to study enrollment, or is
             currently included in another study involving clinical evaluations; If this is the
             case, inclusion of the patient in the present study will be subject to prior agreement
             by Genzyme

          -  major congenital anomaly

          -  clinically important organic disease (except for symptoms related to Pompe disease) or
             any other medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the physician's opinion should preclude the patient's
             participation in the study or may reduce survival

          -  pregnancy and breastfeeding (women of childbearing age must use a medically accepted
             method of contraception throughout the entire duration of the trial. Male patients
             must use a medically accepted birth control method throughout the entire duration of
             the study)
