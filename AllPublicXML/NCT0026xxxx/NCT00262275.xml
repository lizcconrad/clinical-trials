  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of different dosages of aspirin on platelet aggregation and to
      determine the possible mechanisms of aspirin resistance, we intend to compare the effects of
      low, medium dose aspirin with clopidogrel (an alternative antiplatelet agent) in patients
      after coronary artery bypass surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        We intend to invite patients aged 18 to 80 proceeding to primary elective coronary artery
        bypass surgery, able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Preoperative exclusion criteria:

          -  patients who are have not stopped aspirin 7 days prior to surgery

          -  patients on concomitant NSAIDS

          -  patients with a previous history platelet disorders, splenectomy or haematological
             disorders

          -  patients with aspirin induced asthma

          -  patients with any contraindications to aspirin (GI bleed)

          -  patients who are on any medication that may result in a serious drug interaction with
             aspirin (warfarin)

          -  Women of childbearing potential

          -  Patients of less than 18 years

          -  If informed consent cannot be obtained
