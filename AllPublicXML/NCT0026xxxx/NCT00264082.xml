  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the usefulness of the TRAP protein as (1)
      an early indicator of bone destruction and (2) a tool for assessing the effect of Zometa® in
      treating symptoms of bone metastases due to breast cancer. Tartrate-resistant acid
      phosphatase (TRAP) is a protein released into the blood stream as a result of bone
      destruction caused by metastasis of breast cancer to the bone. Bone destruction causes pain
      and bone fractures. This study will measure TRAP levels in serum taken from breast cancer
      patients to see if TRAP levels will be able to predict the effect of Zometa® treatment on
      bone destruction, pain and bone fractures.
