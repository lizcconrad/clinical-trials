  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the name for rapid beats in the upper chambers of the
      heart, is the world's most common kind of irregular heart beat. People with AF experience
      symptoms such as heart palpitations (a racing or pounding feeling in the chest), shortness of
      breath, dizziness, fatigue or weakness. Although AF can occur in otherwise healthy people for
      no apparent reason, it is sometimes associated with high blood pressure, heart disease or
      lung problems. The purpose of the SAFARI trial is to study the effectiveness of pacing
      algorithms in the upper chamber of the heart for patients who have both AF and bradycardia
      (slow heart beat).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a slow heartbeat who are in need of dual chamber pacing (pacing in both
             the atrium and ventricle).

          -  Subjects who have experienced at least two episodes of rapid heart beats three months
             prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a history of permanent (chronic) or persistent (non
             self-terminating) atrial fibrillation.

          -  Subjects with atrial fibrillation due to reversible cause, (e.g. thyroid disease,
             pericarditis, post-surgery, alcohol abuse).

          -  Subjects with a history of one or more cardioversions (changing an abnormal heart
             rhythm into a normal one by either using medication or by the application of an
             electric shock) six months prior to enrollment.
