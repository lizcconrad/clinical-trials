    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the toxicity of anti-IL-5, and to see whether it lowers
      peripheral blood eosinophils and/or tissue and whether it has a steroid and/or interferon
      sparing effect.

          -  Adequate renal, cardiac, and hepatic function

          -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  A diagnosis of hypereosinophilic syndrome such as:

               -  Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome;

               -  Eosinophilia myalgia syndrome;

               -  Eosinophilic gastroenteritis;

               -  Churg-Strauss syndrome;

               -  Eosinophilic cellulitis;

               -  Benign hypereosinophilia; or

               -  Eosinophilic esophagitis.

          -  Maintained on, or in need of, the following: glucocorticoids, interferon,
             methotrexate, hydroxyurea, cytoxan, 6-mercaptopurine, or vincristine

          -  Blood eosinophil counts greater than 750 cells/mcl

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Creatinine &gt; 3 X upper limit for age

          -  AST &gt; 5 X upper limit for age

          -  Platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3

          -  Cardiac function:

               1. NYHA class IIIb or IV (patients with shortness of breath or fatigue with mild
                  exertion or at rest);

               2. Patients with symptomatic supraventricular or ventricular arrythmias requiring
                  treatment;

               3. Patients requiring IV heart failure medications;

               4. Angina or acute myocardial infarction

          -  History of renal, hepatic, endocrine, oncologic, cardiovascular disease, or any other
             condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of

          -  History of allergic or adverse response to previous antibody type therapy

          -  History of allergic or adverse response to anti-IL-5 therapy

          -  Evidence of, or history of, a parasitic infection (within past 1 year)

          -  Participation in a previous clinical trial involving an investigational agent within
