  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that small amounts of a person's own red cells,
      when treated with an enzyme to make A-ECO Red Blood Cells, can be safely re-infused,
      repeatedly. Each participant will have some blood drawn, treated with an enzyme, washed and
      re-infused five times. Additional samples of blood will be drawn for testing and evaluation.

      This study will involve a statistically valid number of subjects so that firm conclusions may
      be drawn about the safety of small volumes of A-ECO cells. All participants will receive
      their own (autologous) red cells that have been either: 1) treated with an enzyme to create
      A-ECO cells (test group); or 2) washed with saline (control group). The test and control
      groups will be compared for the rate and extent any adverse reactions or unexpected
      laboratory test results.
