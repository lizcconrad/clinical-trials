  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of the &quot;LIFE-Lung
      Bronchoscopy&quot; to identify early changes in lung tissues that show precancerous, cancer in
      situ (just beginning and not spread) and microscopic invasive cancer lesions versus the
      ability of the standard &quot;White Light Bronchoscopy&quot; to identify the same. This will be done as
      a part of routine monitoring bronchoscopy.

      Patients who have had a surgical resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and with no
      current evidence of disease (NED) will be eligible. Also eligible are patients who have had
      head or neck squamous cell carcinoma with radical head and/or neck dissection and who are
      currently NED. Patients with severe chronic, obstructive, pulmonary disease shown by
      pulmonary function testing abnormalities will also be eligible.

      In addition to the specialized bronchoscopy, doctors will be investigating the use of imaging
      spectroscopy. This is using an optical (visualizing) procedure to measure the light reflected
      back from tissue. Different lesions and normal tissues reflect light differently and in
      specific color wavelengths. By using measurements over time (different
      examinations/bronchoscopies) very small changes can be seen. This may allow eventually for
      very early diagnosing of precancerous or cancer in situ lesions, allowing for earlier
      treatment.

      The North American Lung Cancer Study Group showed that Stage I (T1,N0,M0) non small cell lung
      carcinoma patients who have undergone complete surgical resection have a 60-70% five-year
      survival but have a 3.6% per year risk of developing a second lung primary cancer. Data from
      the Mayo Clinic on patients that underwent surgical resection for sputum cytology positive
      but radiologically occult lung cancer found that second primary lung cancers occurred at a
      rate as high as 5% per year in this patient population. In a collective review of 1406
      patients with occult or stage I completely resected lung carcinomas, the incidence of
      second-primary lung cancers was 11.4% (range 3-30%). The mortality from second-primary lung
      carcinomas in surgical patients is much higher than for the first tumor because treatment is
      both more limited and complicated as a consequence of their prior lung resection. Second
      NSCLC primaries are a particularly vexing treatment dilemma in patients who have undergone a
      prior curative, surgical resection because of their limited, residual pulmonary reserve.

      White light bronchoscopy (WLB) has been shown to be a useful tool in localizing
      radiographically occult lesions. However, Woolner et al. demonstrated that only 29% of
      carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 69% of micro-invasive tumors are identified by experienced
      bronchoscopists. In 1996 an endoscopic lung imaging system developed by the British Columbia
      Cancer Research Centre in conjunction with Xillix Technologies Corp., known as the LIFE-lung
      Fluorescence Endoscopy System was approved by the FDA. LIFE-lung bronchoscopy is performed
      with a helium-cadmium laser using blue light @ 442 nm for illumination and allows
      visualization of these differences in normal and abnormal tissue autofluorescence. Lam and
      others have shown that the tissue autofluorescence spectra of areas of dysplasia and
      carcinoma in situ differ significantly from those of normal bronchial tissues. Specifically,
      LIFE Bronchoscopy improved sensitivity of detection of metaplasia and dysplasia by 171% over
      current WLB. LIFE bronchoscopy's sensitivity for the detection of CIS is 500% greater than
      that of standard WLB.

      Fluorescence bronchoscopy using the LIFE system is identical to standard flexible
      bronchoscopy except that it utilizes blue light (from a Helium-Cadmium light source) in
      contrast to white light (commonly emitted from a Xenon or Halogen light source). Both
      fluorescent and reflected light are produced when the bronchial surface is illuminated by
      visible light, the difference is that with the LIFE-lung system, the image is reconstructed
      from emitted fluorescent light instead of from light reflected off of the bronchial surface.
      Emitted fluorescence and reflective light are separated by appropriate filters.
