  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver is a life threatening complication of blood
      and marrow transplantation. Treatment with currently available (Food and Drug Administration
      [FDA] approved) agents fails in most cases. Recently conducted clinical studies indicate that
      patients benefit from defibrotide, a non-FDA approved agent. This protocol has been developed
      not with a research intent, but rather to ensure that defibrotide is used by the blood and
      marrow transplant programs at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and at Emory University in a
      safe, effective and ethical manner.
