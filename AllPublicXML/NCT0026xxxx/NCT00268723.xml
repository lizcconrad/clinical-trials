      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, two-way crossover study
      of levalbuterol tartrate HFA MDI in subjects 18 years of age and older with EIB. This study
      was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by
      Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion
