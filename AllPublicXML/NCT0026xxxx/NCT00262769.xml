      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It
      is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without cisplatin in treating
      cholangiocarcinoma or biliary tract tumors.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying gemcitabine and cisplatin to see how
      well they work compared to gemcitabine alone in treating patients with unresectable locally
      advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or other biliary tract tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with unresectable locally advanced or
           metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or other biliary tract tumors treated with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride with vs without cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, primary site of disease (gallbladder vs bile ducts vs ampulla), prior
      therapy (photodynamic therapy [PDT] vs non-PDT therapy vs none), ECOG performance status (0
      vs 1 vs 2), and disease status (locally advanced vs metastatic). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and
           15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV
           over 1½ hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and after finishing treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.
