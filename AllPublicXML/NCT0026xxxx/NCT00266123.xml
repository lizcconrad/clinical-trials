        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  End-stage renal disease with subjects scheduled to receive a primary or secondary
             renal allograft from a cadaveric donor, from a living-unrelated mismatched donor, or
             from a living-related mismatched donor. Unreported HLA values will be considered a
             match.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test before
             administration of assigned treatment and agree to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception throughout the treatment period and for 3 months following
             discontinuation of assigned treatment.

        Other inclusions apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active systemic or localized major infection.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to SRL or its derivatives, macrolide antibiotics,
             corticosteroids, TAC or MMF.

          -  Multiple organ transplants (i.e., prior or concurrent transplantation of any organs
             other than renal transplant).

        Other exclusions apply.
