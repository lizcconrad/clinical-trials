      The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a self-management program, called
      the Heart PACT Program, compared to usual health care in patients with heart failure.
      Outcomes measured were patient activation (skills needed to maintain function, collaborate
      with providers, and access care), self-care management, hospitalizations and emergency
      department visits.

      Background:

      Heart failure (HF) places an enormous burden on patients, their families, health care systems
      and society. Readmission for HF occurs within 30 days following 20 percent of discharges from
      the VA system with similar rates in the Medicare health care system. Few studies have
      examined whether chronic heart failure (HF) outcomes can be improved by increasing patient
      engagement (known as activation) in care and capabilities for self-care management.

      Objectives:

      The objective was to determine the efficacy of a patient activation (Heart PACT) intervention
      compared to usual care on activation, self-care management, hospitalizations and emergency
      room visits in patients with HF.

      Methods:

      This study employed a randomized, 2-group, repeated-measures design at a single VA site.
      Following consent, 84 participants were stratified by activation level and randomly assigned
      to usual care (n = 41), or usual care plus the Heart PACT intervention (n = 43). The primary
      outcomes and measures were patient activation using the Patient Activation Measure (PAM);
      self-management using the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) and the Medical Outcomes
      Study (MOS) Specific Adherence Scale; and hospitalizations and emergency room visits using
      self-report and VA databases. The Heart PACT intervention consisted of individual meetings
      and phone contacts over 6 months. The intervention leaders collaborated with patients to
      increase activation and improve HF self-management behaviors, such as adhering to medications
      and implementing health behavior goals. The primary analyses were 2 (group: control vs.
      intervention) x 3 (time) repeated measures analyses of variance.
