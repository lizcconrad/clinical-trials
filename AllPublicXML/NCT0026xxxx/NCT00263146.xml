    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrom is associated to lung and systemic inflammation, which
      could be worsened by mechanical ventilation.This included a proteasis - antiproteasis
      imbalance which could participate to a fibrosis process.

      Low tidal-volume ventilation (6 mL/kg) with low plateau pressure (&lt; 30 cm H2O) has been
      proved to decrease mortality when compared with more conventionnal high-volume (12 mL/kg)
      ventilation.Moreover, this lung-protective approach decrease lung annd systemic inflammation.

      Using recruitment maneuvers (i.e. the application during a short time of high pressures with
      the intention to re-open the lung, followed by an increase of PEEP-level to keep the lung
      open, in an attempt to decrease the alveolar shear-stress) has been proposed to improve
      oxygen and to reduce bio-trauma.

      However, the effect of such maneuvers on the inflammatory response and on the evolution of
      ARDS remains unknown.

      Therefore we have planned a randomized, monocentric, controlled trial consisting of the
      comparison of two approaches of mechanical ventilation in Acute Lung Injury. This trial will
      include 30 hemodynamically stable patients fulfilling the ALI or ARDS criteria defined by the
      US and European Consensus Conference.

      They will be randomized in two groups: standard low-volume ventilation vs. recruitment
      maneuvers.

      The main objective of our study is to compare both ventilatory strategies in termes of lung
      and systemic inflammation.

      The primary outcome measures will be the proteasis activity as measured in broncho alveolar
      fluid (BAL) and pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines activity as measured in the BAL and in
      the blood. Two samples (BAL and blood) will be obtained at a 48-72 hours interval. In the
      recruitment maneuver group, the first BAL will be obtained two hours before the maneuver.

      Secondary outcome measures will be gaz exchange, respiratory mechanics, systemic hemodynamics
      and visceral dysfunction scores.
