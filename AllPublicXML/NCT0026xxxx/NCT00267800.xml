  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of most interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) is still unknown. Further research, for
      example to determine predisposing genetic factors, is therefore needed. A database with
      relevant clinical data and DNA/serum samples of ILD patients could facilitate future research
      on the cause of ILDs.

      Protocol title: 'Registration of clinical data and DNA of patients with Interstitial Lung
      Disease (ILD)' Rationale: The etiopathogenesis of most Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) is
      still unknown. Further research, e.g. to determine predisposing genetic factors, is therefore
      needed. A database with relevant clinical data and DNA/serum samples of ILD patients could
      facilitate future research on the etiopathogenesis of ILDs.

      Objective: Availability of relevant clinical data and DNA/serum samples of ILD patients in a
      database. Those data can be used for future research.

      Study design: A prospective observational study

      Study population: Patients diagnosed with ILD attending the pulmonology department in
      participating hospitals.

      Intervention: a blood sample is taken from each patient. Furthermore, additional information
      is collected from the medical file.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: DNA and serum sample, demographic variables, medical
      information, occupational history and hobbies.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, group relatedness:
      two tubes of blood will be drawn from the patients. The risks of drawing blood from a vein
      are minimal.
