  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate overall survival for adult patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with talampanel during radiation therapy with
      concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. This study will also determine the toxicity and
      toxicity rate of talampanel for this therapeutic regimen.
