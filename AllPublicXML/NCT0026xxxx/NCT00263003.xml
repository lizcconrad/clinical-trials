      Study Objectives :

        -  To demonstrate the reduction in office Blood Pressure following a 8-week regimen of
           irbesartan / hydrochlorothiazide using irbesartan as a reference.

        -  To demonstrate the reduction in office Blood Pressure after 4-week regimen of irbesartan
           / hydrochlorothiazide using irbesartan as a reference.

        -  To compare the response rate (defined as office Systolic Blood Pressure/Diastolic Blood
           Pressure reduce more than 10mmHg from Week 0) of patients after 4-week and 8-week
           regimen of irbesartan / hydrochlorothiazide versus irbesartan.

        -  To compare the proportion of patients requiring titration after 4-week regimen of
           irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide versus irbesartan

        -  To ascertain the safety and tolerability of irbesartan / hydrochlorothiazide versus
           irbesartan when administered once daily
