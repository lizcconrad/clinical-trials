      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the response rate, measurable and non measurable, to Taxotere® in the
           second line setting.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the overall safety and toxicity of Taxotere®/prednisone combination as
           second line therapy in HRPC

        -  To evaluate PSA response (PSA: Prostate Specific Antigen)

        -  To evaluate symptomatic response

        -  To evaluate Quality of life

        -  To evaluate patient safety of weekly versus q3 weekly regimens of Taxotere®.
