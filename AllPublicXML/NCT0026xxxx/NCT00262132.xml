  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corticosteroids are presently the drug of choice for the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis.
      However, corticosteroids are associated with many significant side effects. For this reason,
      it would be beneficial to find an alternative agent to corticosteroids for the treatment of
      pulmonary sarcoidosis. This study is an open label trial of mycophenolate for new onset
      pulmonary sarcoidosis. Patients are candidates for this study if they have biopsy proven
      pulmonary sarcoidosis and a vital capacity or FEV1 less than 80% of predicted. Patients must
      undergo bronchoscopy where not only is the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis required, but
      in addition, cells are obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage. If the patients are diagnosed
      with pulmonary sarcoidosis, they are placed on an initial dose of 500mg BID of mycophenolate
      for 1 week. If their blood counts are not affected on this dose and they have no significant
      symptoms that are thought to be drug related, then their dose is escalated to 1g BID for the
      remaining 9 weeks of the study (the total study drug therapy time is 10 weeks). The patients
      are followed with multiple study visits. At these visits blood tests are drawn to make sure
      that there are no significant side effects from mycophenolate. In addition, the patients have
      a history and physical performed to evaluate the clinical state of their sarcoidosis and to
      detect mycophenolate side effects. On completion of 10 weeks of mycophenolate therapy, the
      patients undergo a second bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to obtain cells for
      analysis. The patients are evaluated with spirometry, measurements of shortness of breath
      (dyspnea), and a quality of life scale (SF36) at serial visits during their study. The
      primary endpoint of the study is improved, unchanged or worse FVC. It is hoped that this
      pilot study will suggest that mycophenolate is a reasonable treatment option for new onset
      pulmonary sarcoidosis.

        Inclusion criteria:

        New acute pulmonary sarcoidosis defined as a FVC or FEV1 less than 80 percent of predicted
        plus symptoms of worsening dyspnea, cough, chest pain, or wheezing in patients without a
        prior history of pulmonary sarcoidosis. All such patients will also require bronchoscopy
        with transbronchial biopsy that demonstrates noncaseating granulomas of unknown cause. Such
        patients are usually treated for acute pulmonary sarcoidosis. The transbronchial biopsy
        specimens must have negative stains for mycobacteria and fungi.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Previous history of an adverse reaction to mycophenolate.

          2. Current use of another immunosuppressive medication.

          3. History of active hepatitis or another significant liver disease with the exception of
             proven or presumed sarcoidosis of the liver.

          4. Previous history of skin cancer

         12. Evidence of significant sarcoidosis in extrapulmonary organs that requires therapy
             such that the mycophenolate doses could not be tapered if the pulmonary sarcoidosis
             was stable or improved.

         13. History of previous severe digestive system disease

         14. Patients taking azathioprine

         15. Patients taking cholestyramine or other drugs that affect enterohepatic recirculation
