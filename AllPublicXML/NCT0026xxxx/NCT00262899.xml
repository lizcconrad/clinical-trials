      RATIONALE: Genetics education and counseling may help patients make treatment decisions. It
      is not yet known how genetic counseling or usual care influence patient treatment decisions
      for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well genetic counseling works
      compared to usual care in helping patients with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ,
      stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer make treatment decisions.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the impact of rapid genetic counseling (RGC) vs usual care on the medical
           decisions of women with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I-IIIA breast
           cancer.

        -  Compare the impact of these interventions on the quality of life and psychological well
           being of these patients.

        -  Determine baseline factors that predict who is most and least likely to benefit from RGC
           in patients undergoing these interventions.

        -  Compare the cost per quality adjusted life year saved from a societal perspective in
           patients undergoing these interventions.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating site. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 interventional arms.

        -  Arm I (rapid genetic counseling): Patients undergo a 1Â½ hour genetic counseling session
           either in person or by telephone. Patients who undergo telephone counseling receive a
           booklet of visual aids and educational materials. Patient preferences and values are
           assessed immediately after counseling. Some patients may undergo BRCA1/2 status
           determination. Patients undergo follow-up telephone interviews at 1, 6, and 12 months.

        -  Arm II (usual care): Patients receive a packet of breast cancer treatment educational
           materials. Patient preferences and values are assessed 2 weeks later. Patients undergo
           follow-up telephone interviews as in arm I.

      In both arms, quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 months.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Following randomization, participants will be informed about whether they are assigned to Usual Care (UC) or Rapid Genetic Counseling (RGC). Participants in the UC arm can schedule a genetic counseling appointment at any time during the study if they wish. Participants in the RGC agree to obtain genetic counseling as soon as possible, before they make a definitive surgery decision. RGC can be accomplished by telephone or in-person. The RGC intervention is delivered by highly experienced genetic counselors at each site. This counseling is identical to our standard genetic counseling procedure for newly diagnosed patients. Immediate DNA collection via blood or buccal cell collection is available following counseling. Phone counseling participants will be been mailed a kit for DNA collection or have the option of having the sample collected at at LCCC.</description>
