  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genistein Combined Polysaccharide (GCP) is derived from adding soy powder to shiitake
      mushrooms. This concentrated mixture is currently being sold in Japan and the United States
      and is thought to possibly contain properties that may be useful in treating certain types of
      cancer.
