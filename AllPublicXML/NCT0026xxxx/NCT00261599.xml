  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very often patients receive medication before a diagnostic procedure, like a colonoscopy, to
      help them relax and stay calm during the procedure. This is called procedural or
      minimal-to-moderate sedation. One product used for sedation is called propofol. AQUAVAN
      (fospropofol disodium) is made as a water soluble form of propofol allowing for rapid
      sedation during the entire procedure. This study is designed to test AQUAVAN for sedation
      during colonoscopy procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, dose-controlled study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of a moderate dose of AQUAVAN compared to a subtherapeutic dose of
      AQUAVAN,both following pretreatment with an analgesic fentanyl, in patients who are
      undergoing elective colonoscopy. A group of patients will receive midazolam as a reference
      therapy.

      Following completion of pre-procedure assessments, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      3 treatment groups at a 2:3:1 (AQUAVAN initial dose 1 [subtherapeutic dose]:AQUAVAN initial
      dose 2 [moderate dose]: initial Midazolam Reference Dose) allocation ratio on the day of the
      scheduled procedure.

      A person skilled in airway management and authorized by the facility in which the colonoscopy
      is performed (such as a respiratory therapist, a study nurse, or a clinician) must be
      immediately available during the conduct of the study. All patients will be placed on
      supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (4 L/min), and an ECG monitor, pulse oximeter, and
      blood pressure monitor will be attached prior to administration of study medication. All
      patients will receive an injection of analgesic pretreatment followed by the administration
      of study medication. This protocol recognized 2 distinct phases of sedation: Sedation
      Initiation and Sedation Maintenance. Assessments will be made to evaluate the patients for
      levels of sedation, clinical benefit of sedation, and adverse events. Blood samples will be
      collected for PK analysis.
