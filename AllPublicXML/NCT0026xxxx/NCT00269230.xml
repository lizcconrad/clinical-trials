      People who have abnormal heart beats, or whose heart does not beat on its own, may need an
      electronic device called a pacemaker or a defibrillator. Furthermore, people whose hearts
      have a reduced pumping ability may need a device are called cardiac resynchronization therapy
      (CRT) device. A CRT device is implanted surgically just under the skin in the upper chest
      area. This device then helps the heart beat at a regular rhythm by sending electrical signals
      (pacing) directly to the heart tissue through flexible wires called leads. The device may
      also be able to stop the heart from beating too fast. Three leads are implanted into the
      chambers of your heart. Two of the leads will be placed on the right side of your heart. The
      third lead is placed on the left side of your heart and is the lead being studied.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Attain StarFixTM
      Model 4195 Left Ventricular (LV) Lead. This particular model lead has special characteristics
      that may help to better keep it in position once it is implanted into the left ventricle. It
      is also &quot;steroid-eluting&quot; which means that over time it slowly releases a small amount of
      medication into the heart tissue to help prevent too much swelling around the area it is
      implanted.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  QRS &gt; 130 ms (The QRS interval is a measurement of how the electrical signal involved
             in a heart beat travels, or is conducted, through the ventricles. A wide QRS (more
             than 120) suggests that there is a conduction problem, or block, in the ventricles.)

          -  Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (EF) &lt; 35% (Ejection Fraction is a measurement of
             how well the left ventricle pumps blood out to the rest of the body. The higher the EF
             the more blood the ventricle is pumping.)

          -  Subject has moderate to severe heart failure despite medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a previous lead in the left ventricle or previous implant attempt within
             30 days of implant or ongoing complications from a previous unsuccessful attempt

          -  Subjects with chest pain or who have had a heart attack within the past month before
             enrollment in the study

          -  Subjects that have had certain surgeries on their heart within the past three months

          -  Subjects with chronic (permanent) fast heart beats in the upper chambers of the heart
             (atrial arrhythmias)
