      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the metabolic properties of lung cancer
      cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has long been known that cancer cells absorb and break down substances in the body
      differently than healthy, non-cancer cells. This process of absorbing and breaking down
      substances is known as metabolism and is increased in cancer cells. Recent research suggests
      that this increased metabolic activity makes it easier for cancer cells to multiply. The
      objective of the study is to characterize the metabolism of glucose by lung tumors by serum
      metabolite analysis, using a variant of glucose (sugar) which makes up 1% of glucose in
      nature.

        Lung Cancer Patients (Groups 1 &amp; 2)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with suspected, clinically diagnosed, or histologically diagnosed lung
             cancer. Occasionally, other cancers (including metastatic cancers to the lung) may be
             resected for the study as negative controls for NSCLC, as warranted by the particulars
             of the case.

          -  patients must have general medical conditions to allow them to undergo surgical
             resection of their primary tumor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of diabetes for the experimental group (surgery + glucose); patients with a
             history of diabetes are allowed in the control group (surgery/no glucose)

          -  known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS)

        Healthy Subjects (Group 3)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  at least 30 years of age

          -  preferably be fasting for 12 hours (minimum 8 hours) prior to enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  prior history of diagnosed lung cancer

          -  known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS)
