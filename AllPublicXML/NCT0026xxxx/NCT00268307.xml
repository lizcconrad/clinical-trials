  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety of giving a patient's own bone
      marrow-derived stem cells delivered with a catheter (tube) into the coronary arteries (blood
      vessels of the heart). Stem cells are simple cells produced by the bone marrow that can
      develop into many types of cells. It is possible that these cells will decrease the size of
      damage caused to the heart from a heart attack and increase the pumping efficiency of the
      heart; which can be decreased due to a heart attack. The stem cells will be taken from bone
      marrow and then given back into the heart vessels.

      This protocol will test the hypothesis that an intracoronary infusion of autologous,
      unfractionated, bone marrow mononuclear cells will attenuate infarct size and improve
      left-ventricular function in 60 patients following an acute anterior myocardial infarction
      who have undergone successful revascularization with PTCA/stenting.
