      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel poliglumex and capecitabine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel poliglumex together with
      capecitabine works in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the tumor response rate and adverse event profile in patients with metastatic,
           HER2 negative breast cancer treated with paclitaxel poliglumex (CT-2103; Xyotax™) and
           capecitabine.

        -  Examine the distributions of disease-free progression times and survival times in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel poliglumex IV (CT-2103; Xyotax™) over 10-20 minutes on day 1 and
      oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.
