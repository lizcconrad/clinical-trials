        <description>A scale used to assess the extrapyramidal symptoms attributable to antipsychotics. Consists of 9 items (8 to assess individual symptoms and 1 to assess global severity). Each item is assessed from 0 (none, normal) to 4 (severe). The total points of 8 items are defined as DIEPSS total (0 to 32 points). The items for the assessment of individual symptoms are classified into 4 categories of parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia. Parkinsonism is assessed by the total points of items 1 to 5; akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia are assessed by the points given to the corresponding items.</description>

        <description>DIEPSS assesses the extrapyramidal symptoms attributable to antipsychotics. Consists of 9 items (8 to assess individual symptoms and 1 to assess global severity). Each item is assessed from 0 (none, normal) to 4 (severe). The total points of 8 items are defined as DIEPSS total (0 to 32 points). The items are classified into 4 categories of parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia. Treatment-emergent dystonia was defined as a score equal or more than 2 or an increase of equal or more than 2 points from baseline on the dystonia item (total score possible 0 to 4 points).</description>
