        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas

          -  Metastatic or locally advanced, non resectable disease(Non resectable disease will be
             determined by the investigators with clinical data)

             tumors&gt;2cm using conventional CT scan or ≥1cm with spiral CT scan)

             therapy for non-target lesion is permitted

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥60

          -  No known Central Nervous System metastases

          -  No sensory neuropathy at inclusion

          -  Biological and hematological evaluation &lt; 2 weeks prior to treatment administration:
