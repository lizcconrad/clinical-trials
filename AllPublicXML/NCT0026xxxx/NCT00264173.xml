      Primary Objective :

        -  To compare the efficacy of valproate to lithium in Bipolar I patients suffering from a
           manic or a mixed episode according to DSM IV TR (APA 2000) [Diagnostic and Statistical
           Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) fourth edition (IV)Text Revision (TR)] and over a
           periode of 3 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment

      Secondary Objective :

        -  To evaluate the clinical and biological safety of valproate compared to lithium.

        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to
        allow patients and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace
        the advice of a personal physician or health professional.

        Main criteria are listed hereafter:

        Inclusion criteria at Screening :

          -  Patients with a history of at least one manic episode in the previous three years or
             before the age of 60 for patients older than 60 at screening, as documented by medical
             records, or by a relative's report of information corroborating evidence of manic
             symptomatology for patients already known as bipolar patients. Newly diagnosed
             patients for bipolar disorder are allowed provided that the diagnosis is based on DSM
             IV TR[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) fourth edition
             (IV)Text Revision (TR)]and that the patient is less than 30 years old.

          -  Patients with a current diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder according to DSM IV TR

          -  Patients suffering from a current manic episode or a mixed episode according to DSM IV
             TR

          -  Patients with a minimum total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)of 18 at
             Screening

        Inclusion criteria on D0 (Day 0):

          -  Patients having completed the wash-out period of at least 1 day duration (except for
             patients receiving no psychiatric treatment or a benzodiazepine at a dose lower than
             the equivalence of 8 mg of lorazepam and except for patients who only received
             injectable long-acting neuroleptics at least 7 days prior to Screening)

          -  Patients with a minimum total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) of 18 at D0

        Exclusion criteria at Screening :

          -  Participation in a clinical trial within the three previous months

          -  Patients with a history of valproate intolerance defined as valproate discontinuation
             due to medically significant adverse effects

          -  Patients with a history of lithium intolerance defined as lithium discontinuation due
             to medically significant adverse effects

          -  Patients with a Central Nervous System (CNS) neoplasm, demyelinating disease,

          -  Patients with a medical condition which requires the continuous use of a treatment
             which could interfere with the safety or efficacy evaluation of valproate
             (anticonvulsant or anticoagulant therapy, zidovudine) or lithium (angiotensin
             converting enzyme inhibitors, tetracycline, reserpine, calcium channel blockers,
             triptans)

          -  Patients who received injectable long-acting neuroleptics less than 7 days prior to
