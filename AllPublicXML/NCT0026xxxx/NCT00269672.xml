  <brief_title>Study to Evaluate a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Elderly Subjects</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Open Label, Controlled Phase II Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity After Two Different 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Formulations in Elderly Subjects Aged 65 Years and Older Who Are Naive to Previous 23vPS Immunization</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) contained as an adjuvant in conjugate
      vaccines enhances the immune response in infants. There is no data so far evaluating whether
      this also applies to adults. The objective of this study is to compare the immune response of
      2 different 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate (13vPnC) formulations with and without AlPO4 to
      select a formulation and to compare the immune response to the chosen 13vPnC formulation
      relative to the immune response to 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS).
