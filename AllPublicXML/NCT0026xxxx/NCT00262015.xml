  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine when a memory immune response after re-vaccination
      with Meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (Menjugate) or challenge with Meningococcal A/C
      polysaccharide vaccine can be observed, after initial vaccination with Meningococcal C
      conjugate vaccine during the UK immunization campaign
