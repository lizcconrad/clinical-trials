  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the use of omalizumab as a pretreatment for patients
      with persistent allergic asthma who are candidates for allergen immunotherapy (ie, allergy
      shots) and will test the hypothesis that omalizumab may reduce the rate of systemic reactions
      to immunotherapy in patients with persistent allergic asthma.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Systemic Allergic Reactions (SAR) to Specific Immunotherapy (SIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with Systemic Allergic Reactions (SAR) to Specific Immunotherapy (SIT). A SAR was captured and recorded as an outcome, not as adverse events (AEs) or SAEs. The primary analysis time point was the end of Period 4 (maintenance immunotherapy). Participants were observed for 1 hour after each immunotherapy (IT) injection visit. Allergic reactions were graded on a 4-point scale from Grade 1 to Grade 4. Grade 1: Skin symptoms, Grade 2: Gastrointestinal symptoms, Grade 3: Respiratory symptoms and Grade 4: Cardiovascular symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of First Systemic Allergic Reaction (SAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic reactions associated with immunotherapy (IT), defined as occurring within 1 hour following injection of SIT, were graded on a four-point scale: Grade 1: Skin symptoms (generalized urticaria, itching, or erythema), Grade 2: Gastrointestinal symptoms (stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting), Grade 3: Respiratory symptoms (clinically significant nasal symptoms and/or dyspnea, wheezing, persistent cough, etc.), Grade 4: Cardiovascular symptoms (cyanosis, hypotension, collapse, arrhythmias, or angina pectoris).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Target Maintenance Specific Immunotherapy (SIT) Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Achievement of target maintenance IT dose is defined as answering 'Yes' to the question, 'Was the target maintenance SIT dose achieved?' on Visit 13, Week 16.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Requiring 8 to 20 Visits to Complete Cluster Specific Immunotherapy (SIT) Dosing Regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During period 3, a cluster dosing protocol was utilized to initiate the allergen immunotherapy (IT). Participants received escalating doses of IT according to a cluster dosing titration regimen. Visits 5 through 13 were cluster visits for this study. The number of visits needed for completion of the cluster SIT dosing regimen was defined as the number of planned visits plus the number of unplanned visits needed to reach maintenance IT dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Requiring 0 to &gt;=5 Doses of Rescue Medications for Systemic Allergic Reactions (SARs) to Specific Immunotherapy (SIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Epinephrine for injection, antihistamines, corticosteroids for injection, inhaled beta-agonists, and oral corticosteroids, as well as other drugs used for managing acute allergic reactions to SIT, were available during all study visits. One dose of rescue medication for SAR reactions was equivalent to 1 entry of the CRF page 'concomitant medications/significant non-drug therapies associated with immunotherapy' in response to the question 'Was this medication given in response to a SAR?'</description>

    <description>Customized allergen extracts were prepared centrally for each patient based on his/her specific skin test results. Four vials containing dilutions of the patient's extract were provided. Investigators initiated dosing according to the protocol for the cluster dosing titration regimen, beginning with vial #4 (the most dilute) and progressing to vial #1, which was the most concentrated or &quot;maintenance&quot; solution. Each dose was administered subcutaneously into the deltoid region as a single injection. During study visits that required multiple IT injections, each injection was to be given at least 30 minutes apart. During weeks that required multiple visits for IT injections, each visit was to be separated by at least 48 hours.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Requiring 8 to 20 Visits to Complete Cluster Specific Immunotherapy (SIT) Dosing Regimen</title>
        <description>During period 3, a cluster dosing protocol was utilized to initiate the allergen immunotherapy (IT). Participants received escalating doses of IT according to a cluster dosing titration regimen. Visits 5 through 13 were cluster visits for this study. The number of visits needed for completion of the cluster SIT dosing regimen was defined as the number of planned visits plus the number of unplanned visits needed to reach maintenance IT dose.</description>
