      The primary objective of this study is to determine the clinical benefits of percutaneous
      intervention to improve pulmonary blood flow on oxygen saturations, symptoms, exercise
      tolerance and hematocrit in patients with complex cyanotic congenital heart disease who are
      not candidates for surgical repair.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, retrospective study of adult patients with a diagnosis of
      un-repaired complex cyanotic congenital heart disease including Eisenmengerâ€™s Syndrome,
      single ventricle, pulmonary atresia with aorticopulmonary collaterals, complete
      atrio-ventricular canal defects, double inlet left ventricle, heterotaxy syndromes and
      truncus arteriosus. Patients with surgically placed systemic to pulmonary artery shunts will
      be included.

      Although generally incompatible with adult survival, rare patients with un-operated or
      palliated complex cyanotic congenital heart defects (CCHD) survive well into adulthood.
      Symptoms related to poor pulmonary blood flow and/ or increasing pulmonary vascular
      resistance progress with advancing age. Percutaneous interventions to improve symptoms and
      relieve hypoxemia have not been previously reported in adult patients with complex cyanotic
      congenital heart disease. Percutaneous interventions in patients with cyanotic congenital
      heart disease may be generally broken down into three types: percutaneous occlusion of shunt
      lesions, percutaneous balloon valvotomy or valvuloplasty, and balloon angioplasty and
      stenting of vascular structures (1). Percutaneous interventions for occluded or stenotic
      systemic to pulmonary artery shunts in childhood have been described (2,3). However,
      procedures to improve pulmonary blood flow in adults with CCHD have not previously been
      described.
