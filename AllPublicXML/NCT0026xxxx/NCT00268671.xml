      Study Objectives:

        -  To determine the MTD (maximal tolerated dose) and recommended dose of a weekly docetaxel
           and cisplatin combination regimen for locoregional recurrent/metastatic Squamous Cell
           Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)

        -  To determine the response rate of the recommended dose

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of the recommended dose
