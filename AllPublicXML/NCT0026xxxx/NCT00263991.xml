  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary headache disorders are now accepted as physiological diseases, and advanced
      imaging-techniques have demonstrated a migraine generator in the brain stem and increased
      stimulus sensitivity in these patients. The underlying neuronal dysfunctions remain to to
      clarified and the existing neurophysiological methods have not yet been useful. More
      sensitive and reliable methods are therefore highly needed. The aims of the study are
      therefore to develop a sensitive and reliable method to demonstrate a cortical reorganisation
      and expansion of pain sensitive cortical areas in patients with migraine or tension-type
      headache.
