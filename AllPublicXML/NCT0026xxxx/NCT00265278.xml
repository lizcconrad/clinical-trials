      The primary aims of this experiment are to determine if there are significant safety
      interactions between oral modafinil and intravenous methamphetamine. Safety will be assessed
      by measuring adverse events and cardiovascular responses of heart rate (HR), blood pressure
      (BP), and electrocardiogram (ECG) and stroke distance (ICG).
