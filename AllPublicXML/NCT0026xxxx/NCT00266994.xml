      The TE Registry is a multi-institutional bioinformatics database for the collection of data
      relevant to TE. Participating HTRS affiliated study centers may enroll patients and enter
      data in the TE Registry by completing enrollment and data entry forms and transmitting them
      to the study center. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the
      epidemiology, pathophysiology, and outcome of patients suffering from thromboembolism (TE)
      events.

      The initial objectives of the registry are:

        -  Evaluate the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of known prothrombotic risk
           factors in persons with TE.

        -  Identify the frequency and nature of complications associated with TE and its treatment.

        -  Describe the phenotypes and complications seen in persons with multiple molecular risk
           factors for TE.

        -  Compare the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and complications seen in patients
           with and without known risk factors for TE.

      Hereditary defects that predispose to thromboembolism (TE) and its complications afflict 5-8%
      of the U.S population. Annually, ~60,000 Americans die from TE and half of the survivors
      suffer long-term morbidity. Despite these staggering statistics, little is known about the
      clinical characteristics or epidemiology of the inherited risk factors for TE. Less is known
      regarding the acquired risk factors or the phenotype of TE in persons with multiple risk
      factors, yet preliminary data suggest that as many as 10% of patients may have multiple risk
      factors.

      Data from several studies, primarily involving adult subjects, shows that in a population of
      consecutively studied thrombosis patients, that one of the five most common inherited
      predispositions will occur in ~33.8%. Antithrombin (AT) is the least common (~1.9%) of these,
      while Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common (~18.8%). Most children who suffer from TE
      have indwelling catheters to assist therapy of underlying medical conditions, or are sick
      neonates. Thus, the contribution of molecular risk factors in children is largely unknown,
      with the exception of sparse retrospective data.

      The TE Registry may help clearly define the clinical phenotype, epidemiology, and
      complications seen in patients with TE associated with known molecular risk factors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients should be enrolled at the time of their FIRST thromboembolic event. Ideally,
             patients should be enrolled within three months of the diagnosis of an eligible event.

          -  Deep Venous, Arterial, or Intra-Cardiac Thrombosis

          -  Pulmonary Thromboembolism AND:

               -  Must have evidence of Venous Thrombosis on imaging studies -OR-

               -  Must have elevated Quantitative or Semi-Quantitative D-dimer level (as defined by
                  local laboratory technology/normal ranges)

          -  Arterial Thromboembolism (with imaging evidence of thrombus source)

          -  Stroke (Cerebral Vascular Accident) AND age &lt; 20 years. Stroke is defined as a
             completed stroke with symptoms persisting for &gt; 24 hours and radiographic evidence of
             infarction by Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Transient Ischemic
             Attacks (TIA) are NOT eligible for this registry.

          -  Myocardial Infarction AND age &lt;20 years. Must have elevated cardiac enzymes (CK and/or
             Troponin) and Electrocardiographic (EKG) evidence meeting the local standard for
             diagnosis. Angina is NOT eligible for this registry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bleeding disorders
