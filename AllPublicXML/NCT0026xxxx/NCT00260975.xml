  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy complain of problems with concentration
      and memory. This has been referred to as chemo fog. The current study is investigating this
      phenomenon by measuring mental function of breast cancer patients prior to and after exposure
      to chemotherapy, and by comparing mental function in those patients who receive chemotherapy
      and those who do not.

      Many breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy complain of problems with concentration
      and memory. This has been referred to as chemo fog. The current study will investigate this
      phenomenon by measuring neuropsychological functioning in early stage breast cancer patients
      prior to and after exposure to chemotherapy, and by comparing change in cognitive function in
      patients who receive chemotherapy to similar breast cancer patients receiving hormonal
      therapy only.
