    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of physician's reinforcement
      using bone marker data on the subject's compliance (at least 50% drug taken) and persistence
      on treatment after one year in postmenopausal osteoporotic women.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ambulatory women,

          -  not previously diagnosed for osteoporosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of black descent and for the US african american are excluded because of the
             very low incidence of postmenopausal osteoporosis

          -  and having used oral or parenteral glucocorticoids (&gt;= 5 mg prednisone or equivalent
             per day) within 3 months of starting study drug or for more than one month within six
             months prior to study entry.
