      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer
      cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving bortezomib
      together with rituximab may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with rituximab
      works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
      including Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of bortezomib and rituximab in patients with relapsed
           or refractory, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial response, complete response unconfirmed,
           and complete response) in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Estimate the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds once weekly in weeks 1-4 and rituximab IV
      over 5-6 hours once weekly in weeks 1-5*. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for 2 courses.
      Patients achieving stable disease or better receive an additional 4 courses of bortezomib
      alone.

      NOTE: *Patients receive rituximab in weeks 1-3 only during course 2 of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 18
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.
