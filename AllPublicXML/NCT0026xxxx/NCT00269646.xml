    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet and a
      high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diet, on insulin sensitivity and blood chemicals considered
      risk markers for heart disease, in persons with the metabolic syndrome.

      Our primary hypothesis is that the ad libitum high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diet will
      significantly improve insulin sensitivity, whereas the ad libitum low-carbohydrate, low-fiber
      diet will not.

    <textblock>
      Low-carbohydrate eating is becoming perceived as more than just a weight loss diet, but
      rather a means to improve health. Several studies have been published suggesting that
      low-carbohydrate diets may be preferable to low-fat diets for weight loss and in terms of
      some health markers. On the other hand, considerable evidence suggests that low-carbohydrate
      diets, high in fat, are associated with a number of adverse health outcomes. The health
      benefits of high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diets have also been demonstrated. This study is
      designed to assess the differences between the two different dietary strategies in terms of a
      number of health outcomes. Participants will consume, in random order, a
      non-calorie-restricted low-carbohydrate and a non-calorie-restricted high-carbohydrate,
      high-fiber diet for one month, with a 4-6 week washout period in between.
