      RATIONALE: Studying quality of life in cancer survivors may help determine the long-term
      effects of breast cancer and may help improve the quality of life for future cancer
      survivors.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the quality of life in African-American or Caucasian
      female breast cancer survivors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare disease-specific, generic, and global quality of life measures in
           African-American survivors of breast cancer with Caucasian survivors of breast cancer.

        -  Compare these quality of life measures in African-American survivors of breast cancer
           with control group of African-American women with no history of breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients and healthy participants complete a battery of quality of life (QOL)
      questionnaires over approximately 65 minutes by mail or over the phone, including the Sexual
      Function Index, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Fatigue, Concerns About Recurrence
      Scale, and other measures of symptoms/side effects (including sleep problems), the RAND
      Physical Functioning -10 Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale,
      assessment of family function/social support, ENRICH Marital Satisfaction Scale, Reed
      Spiritual Perspective Scale, assessments of coping and body image, Post-Traumatic Growth
      Inventory, and the Index of Well-being. Demographic, disease, treatment, and comorbidity
      information, as well as menstrual and gynecological history, work status and insurance
      history, and a measure of health care provider communication is collected using
      questionnaires and medical chart review.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 195 patients and healthy participants will be accrued for this
      study.
