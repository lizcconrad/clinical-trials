             of oral morphine per day or transdermal fentanyl therapy equivalent to 50 to 300 Âµg/h,
             and are on a stable dose of opioid medication for relief of breakthrough pain for at
             least 14 days prior to screening.

          -  Experiencing 1-4 episodes of breakthrough pain per day.

          -  Meet the criteria defined in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance

          -  Have received anti-neoplastic therapy within 2 weeks of study entry that, in the
             investigator's opinion, will influence assessment of breakthrough pain

          -  Have received any investigational drug (non-approved) within 30 days prior to the
             first dose of study medication, or are scheduled to receive an investigational drug
