    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the optimal timing for repair of right-to-left
      shunt lesions such as Tetralogy of Fallot defects.

      The secondary aim being define the criteria for failing medical therapy.

    <textblock>
      In the past, children with right-to-left shunt lesions such as Tetralogy of Fallot defects
      were palliated with a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt. This prevented cyanosis while the
      child grew to a size where complete repair could be undertaken. With the improvements in
      surgical technique and critical care, there is a push to do a primary complete repair for
      these defects at younger and younger ages. These operations should be delayed as long as
      possible to allow for growth but not so long that there is unnecessary cyanosis and
      hypoxemia.

      Study Design and Methodology:

      Retrospective chart review - approximately 75 patients

      Preoperative data:

      Diagnosis

      Operative data:

      Age and weight at surgery Type of surgical procedure Whether pulmonary valve is spared

      Postoperative data:

      Length of time on ventilator Length of time on inotropes Length of ICU stay Length of
      hospital stay Complications
