      Obesity and diabetes increase cardiovascular risk by complex and incompletely known
      mechanisms. The aims of this study are :

        1. to compare cardiac and vascular functions at rest and during exercise in 4 groups of
           age-matched men, without cardiovascular diseases but exhibiting increasing
           cardiovascular risk: trained and untrained healthy volunteers, obese and type 2 diabetic
           subjects

        2. to test the effects of a 8-weeks long individualized training program on these functions
           in obese subjects and in diabetics patients.

      Obesity, especially in its truncal distribution, and type 2 diabetes, increase cardiovascular
      risk. Mechanisms underlaying both early preclinical, and clinical cardiovascular
      complications are complex and still incompletely clarified.

      However, relationship between central, i.e. cardiac, and peripheral, i.e. vascular
      dysfunctions remains unclear, as well as their respective role in reduced exercise tolerance
      in these populations.

      Moreover, exercise training can improve both metabolic status and cardiovascular risk, and
      thus, has proven useful in management and prevention of chronic metabolic diseases.
      Nevertheless, respective effects of training on cardiac and vascular functions, and on their
      interaction at rest, but also during exercise, need to be clarified.

      Therefore, the aims of this study are :

        1. to compare cardiac and vascular functions at rest and during a local maximal leg
           exercise in 4 groups of age-matched men, without cardiovascular diseases but exhibiting
           increasing cardiovascular risk: trained and untrained healthy volunteers, obese and type
           2 diabetic subjects

        2. to test the effects of a 8-weeks long individualized training program on these functions
           in obese subjects and in diabetics patients.
