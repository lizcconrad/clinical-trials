      RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well gefitinib works in treating patients with
      recurrent or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Explore the activity of single agent gefitinib, in terms of response rate, in a patient
           population with recurrent or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily for at least 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>The overall response is the number of patients with the best response recorded in measurable disease (target lesions) from start to disease progression.Complete response is the number of patients with the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is the number of patients with larger than or equal to 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters from baseline. Progressive disease is larger than or equal to 20% increase in sum of the longest diameters over the smallest sum observed or appearance of new lesions. Stable disease is neither PR nor PD criteria met.</description>

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Pathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or large-cell
             undifferentiated carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction

               -  Patients must have disease that is either metastatic (i.e., M1b by the
                  definitions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 1997 staging system) or
                  recurrent after definitive therapy, and must be considered incurable by
                  conventional treatments

               -  Patients with small cell, or mixed small cell/non-small-cell histology are
                  ineligible

               -  Patients with lymphoma or sarcoma are also ineligible

          -  Disease must be measurable in at least one dimension by physical exam, x-ray, CT scan
             or MRI, ultrasound, or endoscopy

               -  Measurable disease can be a previously irradiated lesion if disease growth has
                  been documented in the lesion since completion of radiation therapy

               -  An elevation in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not sufficient to use by itself
                  in response assessment

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-1

          -  WBC ≥ 3,000/mm^3

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3

          -  Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Calcium normal

          -  No known severe hypersensitivity to study drug or any of its excipients

          -  No clinical evidence of any other uncontrolled malignancy except adequately treated
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception

          -  No evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., unstable or
             uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease)

          -  No evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease

               -  Patients with chronic stable radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not
                  be excluded

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  Patients may not have received more than one previous systemic treatment regimen

               -  Systemic treatment may have been given as part of definitive (adjuvant,
                  neoadjuvant, concurrent, or sequential) management or for metastatic or recurrent
                  disease

               -  Previously untreated patients are also eligible

          -  No previous treatment with study drug or any other epidermal growth factor receptor
             (EGFR) antagonists

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any surgery, radiation therapy, or
             chemotherapy administration

          -  Recovered from previous oncologic or other major surgery

          -  No concurrent barbiturates (e.g., phenytoin), carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital
             or Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort)

          -  No concurrent surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or other chemotherapy

          <title>The Number of Patients With Complete or Partial Response Rate of Single Agent ZD1839 in a Patient Population With Recurrent or Metastatic Cancer of the Esophagus or Gastroesophageal Junction, Using the RECIST 1.0 Criteria.</title>
          <description>The overall response is the number of patients with the best response recorded in measurable disease (target lesions) from start to disease progression.Complete response is the number of patients with the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is the number of patients with larger than or equal to 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters from baseline. Progressive disease is larger than or equal to 20% increase in sum of the longest diameters over the smallest sum observed or appearance of new lesions. Stable disease is neither PR nor PD criteria met.</description>
