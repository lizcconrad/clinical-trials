    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying cisplatin, radiation therapy, and tirapazamine to
      see how well they work compared to cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with
      cervical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and tirapazamine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Internal
      radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells.
      Cisplatin and tirapazamine may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. It is
      not yet known whether giving cisplatin together with radiation therapy is more effective with
      or without tirapazamine in treating cervical cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Compare the progression-free survival of patients with stage IB, IIA, IIB, IIIB, or IVA
      carcinoma of the cervix treated with cisplatin and radiotherapy with vs without tirapazamine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. II. Compare the toxicity
      of these regimens in these patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate study treatment with tumor expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX) and
      recurrence-free survival, overall survival, or metastasis in patients treated with these
      regimens.

      II. Correlate expression of CA-IX, hypoxia inducible factor-1α, CD-31, thrombospondin-1,
      CD-105, or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in primary tumor tissue with
      recurrence-free survival, overall survival, or metastasis in patients treated with these
      regimens.

      III. Correlate pre-treatment and/or post-treatment serum concentrations of angiogenic markers
      including angiogenin or VEGF with recurrence-free survival, overall survival, or metastasis
      in patients treated with these regimens.

      IV. Correlate various combinations of biological markers of hypoxia and angiogenesis with
      recurrence-free survival, overall survival, or metastasis in patients treated with these
      regimens.

      V. Correlate levels of individual biological markers of hypoxia or angiogenesis with
      clinicopathological characteristics including tumor size, histologic subtype, FIGO stage,
      depth of invasion, pelvic node status, site of recurrence, and hemoglobin level as well as
      patient, age, race and performance status in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to FIGO stage of disease (IB2 vs IIA vs IIB vs IIIB vs IVA), brachytherapy method
      (low-dose rate vs high-dose rate), surgical staging of para-aortic nodes (yes vs no).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29,
      and 36 (weeks 1-6). Patients also undergo external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis once daily
      on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33 (weeks 1-5). Patients then receive either 1 or 2
      applications of low-dose rate brachytherapy in weeks 6-8 OR 5 applications of high-dose rate
      (HDR)* brachytherapy once weekly in weeks 4-8 and 3-5 days of parametrial boost
      radiotherapy** beginning after the first brachytherapy implant. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 10, 12, 15, 22, 24, 26,
      and 29 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29. Patients also undergo radiotherapy
      and brachytherapy as in arm I. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *No external beam radiotherapy is administered on the day of HDR brachytherapy. If the
      majority of external beam radiotherapy has been administered, HDR brachytherapy may be
      administered in 2 applications per week (separated by at least 72 hours) in order to complete
      all treatment within 8 weeks.

      NOTE: ** Patients may receive a parametrial boost at the discretion of the treating radiation
      oncologist.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 5 years.

          <description>International Federation of Gynecologic and Obstetrics (FIGO), Clinical Staging, for Cervical Carcinoma (1995). Stage IB is defined as clinical lesions confined to the cervix or pre-clinical lesions greater than stage 1A. Stage IIA is defined as the carcinoma extends beyond the cervix but has not extended on to the pelvic wall with no obvious parametrial involvement. Stage IIB has obvious parametrial involvement. Stage IIIB includes extension on to the pelvic wall and/or hydro-nephrosis or non-functioning kidney. Stage IVA is the spread of the growth to adjacent organs.</description>
