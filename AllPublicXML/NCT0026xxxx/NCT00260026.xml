  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are conducting a research study on a
      Chinese herbal medicine known as &quot;Jin Fu Kang&quot;. We want to see if this can help patients with
      advanced lung cancer. Jin Fu Kang might reduce the growth of cancer or improve quality of
      life. You are eligible for this trial because your cancer has progressed after prior
      chemotherapy and your doctor has recommended further chemotherapy treatment.

      Lung cancer that has been confirmed and that has spread is called advanced cancer. There is
      no known permanent cure for advanced lung cancer, but chemotherapy may temporarily shrink the
      cancer and improve the quality of patients' lives.

      Jin Fu Kang is a herbal medicine specially developed in China for the treatment of lung
      cancer. It is based on a traditional medicine that is widely used and appears to be safe.
      Although clinical trials in China suggest that Jin Fu Kang may be of benefit, it has never
      been researched in patients with lung cancer in the United States. As such, its risks and
      benefits are not fully understood.

      The scientific aims are to determine the toxicity of Jin Fu Kang/docetaxel combination
      treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, to determine whether Jin Fu Kang
      alters the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and to provide preliminary efficacy and survival
      data for Jin Fu Kang/docetaxel combination treatment in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer.
