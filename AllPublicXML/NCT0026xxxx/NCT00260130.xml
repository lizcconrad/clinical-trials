  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2010 National Health Objectives call for a reduction in the prevalence of obesity. The
      marked recent increase in overweight and obesity prevalence implicates behavioral factors in
      the etiology of the epidemic. The present proposal hypothesizes the trend is attributal, in
      part, to increasing consumption of energy-yeilding beverages since they are a significant and
      increasing source of dietarty energy and they elicit weaker appetitive and dietary responses
      than solid foods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three human studies are propsed to more fully characterized attributes of liquids and solids
      that may account for the differential appetitive responses they elicit, potential
      contributory mechanisms as well as the dietary implications of their consumption. Study 1
      will contrast the acute effects of fluid and solid foods varying in macronutrient content on
      satiation, satiety and feeding. Study 2 will determine if the pattern of fluid and solid
      ingestion influences satiety and feeding by monitoring appetitive and dietary responses to
      energy and macronutrient matched fluid and solid loads ingested as meal components or between
      meal snacks. To better assess the clinical implications ofdiets incorpprating liquid or solid
      supplements. Study 3 will entail chronic ingestion of matched energy yeilding fluid or solid
      loads with concurrent measurement of appetite, dietary intake, energy expenditureand body
      weight/composition.
