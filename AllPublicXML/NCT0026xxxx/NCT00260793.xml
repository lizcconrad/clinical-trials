  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if subjects with Parkinson's disease who are
      experiencing motor fluctuations (&quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; states) and dyskinesias (involuntary
      excessive movements) would benefit from a higher dose of Requip as compared to the maximum
      FDA approved dose of dopamine agonist drugs (including Requip, Mirapex, and Permax). Requip
      as used in this study is investigational, which means it has not been approved by the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) at this dose level.
