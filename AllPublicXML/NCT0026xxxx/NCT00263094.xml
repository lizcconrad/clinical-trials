  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fasting is a known trigger for headache. People who fast to comply with religious edict have
      been shown to be prone to headache which becomes more likely to occur with increasing length
      of fasting, and in people prone to headache. This has been documented as 'Yom Kippur
      Headache' and 'First of Ramadan Headache.' We performed a study to test the hypothesis that
      Rofecoxib, a pain medicine and anti-inflammatory, with a prolonged duration of action would
      prevent or attenuate headache when taken just prior to the complete (no food or drink) 25
      hour fast of Yom Kippur.

      Introduction: Religious fasting is associated with headache. This has been documented as ‘Yom
      Kippur Headache’ and ‘ First- of - Ramadan Headache.’ The Cox2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, has been
      reported effective in preventing perimenstrual migraine and in preventing recurrence of
      migraine. Given its 17 hour half-life, we undertook this study to see whether 50mg rofecoxib
      taken just prior to the 25 hour Yom Kippur fast would be effective in preventing headache.

      Methods: We performed a double blind randomized prospective trial of rofecoxib 50mg vs
      placebo, taken just prior to the onset of fasting, Yom Kippur 2004. Healthy adults aged 18 –
      65 were enrolled from the community and from hospital staff. Subjects completed a demographic
      data form and questions regarding headache history and a post-fast survey on headache during
      the fast, headache intensity, general ease of fasting and side effects.

      Results: We sent out 170 forms of which 105 were completed and returned. Of those subjects
      receiving rofecoxib (n=53), ten or 18.9% vs 34 or 65.4 % of the placebo group (n=52) had
      headache at some point during the fast (p&lt;.0001). Severity of headache in the treatment group
      was significantly less for the treatment group (3.45 vs 6.29 on a visual analog scale of 10
      (p = .009)). None of those receiving rofecoxib reported a ‘more difficult than usual fast’
      whereas the distribution of difficult to easy fast among the placebo group was more even.

      Conclusion: Rofecoxib 50mg taken prior to a twenty five hour ritual fast prevents and
      attenuates fasting headache.
