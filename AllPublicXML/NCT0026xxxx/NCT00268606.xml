  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a new approach of examining tailored cognitive-behavioral interventions
      for fibromyalgia patients at risk. For this purpose, fibromyalgia patients are screened with
      respect to cognitive-behavioral risk factors and these patients are offered tailored
      cognitive-behavioral treatment options. It is expected that this approach will result in
      increased magnitude and maintenance of effects.

    <textblock>
      The fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic condition with widespread pain that poses a great
      challenge for patients, rheumatologists and society because of the lack of optimal treatment
      options. There is extensive evidence that, in comparison with patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis, fibromyalgia patients report higher levels of functional disability, pain,
      fatigue, and lower levels of quality of life. Although effectiveness of pharmacological
      agents and other interventions is generally limited, most promising effects have been found
      for non-pharmacological treatments, particularly those with a primary focus on
      cognitive-behavioral treatment components. However, also these treatment outcomes are
      characterized by large individual variation. Particularly patients with less impairments in
      daily life seem to benefit less from these treatments. In line with the international
      literature, previous findings of the research group suggest that effectiveness might be
      increased when tailored cognitive-behavioural treatments are solely offered to patients at
      risk.

      In the present project the effects of tailored interventions based on cognitive-behavioral
      factors for patients at risk are studied. In a randomized, controlled trial, fibromyalgia
      patients are screened for risk profiles. Patients at risk will be assigned to tailored
      cognitive or behavioral treatment conditions, depending on their risk profile with respect to
      cognitive-behavioral factors. Half of the patients are subsequently randomly assigned to a
      waiting list control condition. It is expected that this tailored treatment approach will
      increase magnitude and maintenance of treatment effects for pain, disability, fatigue and
      increased quality of life, which means an important step forward for patients, involved
      professionals and society.
