    <textblock>
      Aspirin was proved to be the drug preventing vein grafts from closure and improving clinical
      outcome after coronary artery bypass surgery. It appears to be effective when being
      prescribed as early as first 48 hr. after the operation without increasing the incidence of
      bleeding complications. the exact effective dose is not known.
