  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center, placebo- and
      active- (metformin 1.5 g) controlled study of tesaglitazar (1 mg) in patients with type 2
      diabetes. After a 1-week enrollment period, a 3 week placebo single blind run in period and
      1-week placebo single-blind baseline measurement period, the patients will be given the
      investigational product for 16 weeks in a double blind fashion. Metformin will be titrated up
      during the first 3 weeks of the double-blind period. The total study duration, including
      enrollment, run-in, randomized treatment and follow-up, is 29 weeks.
