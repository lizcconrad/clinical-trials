  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the administration of pancrelipase with meals will
      benefit symptoms of post-prandial bloating, pain and eructation.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete a double-blind crossover study in which, for one week periods, they
      will receive two pancrelipase tablets with each of the three major meals or a similarly
      administered identical placebo. Three times daily, subjects will rate the severity of
      belching, epigastric discomfort, epigastric fullness, bloating, and nausea.
