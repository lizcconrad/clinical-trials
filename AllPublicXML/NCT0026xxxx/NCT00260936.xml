      To assess whether there exist significant differences in glucose metabolism, lipids, lactate,
      body composition, and bone density between HIV-infected and uninfected young men.

      The study involves a one-time collection of health and medical history data, blood and urine
      specimens, and physical assessments. This study will elucidate the need for a further
      in-depth study to understand the pathophysiological effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-based
      and non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapies in young
      men.
