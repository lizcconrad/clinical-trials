        Inclusion Criteria:

        Clinical Study Enrollment Criteria

        Upon completing the in-vitro studies, a perspective, blinded clinical study was started.
        Patients who were older than 1 month of age, seen within 7 days of developing a red eye,
        and who demonstrate at least one criterion from two out of the three categories below were
        included:

        I. History: 1) Spread from one eye to the other several days later, 2) recent or concurrent
        upper respiratory symptoms within the preceding two weeks, 3) or an exposure to someone
        with &quot;pink eye&quot; within the preceding three weeks

        II. Symptoms: 1) Tearing, 2) mucoid or purulent discharge, 3) eye lash matting, 4) burning,
        5) itching, or 6) foreign body sensation

        III. Signs: 1) An inferior palpebral conjunctival reaction with &gt; or = 1+ papillary or
        follicular reactions, 2) presence of a preauricular node

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with associated skin vesicles, corneal dendrites, traumatic corneal abrasion,
        concurrent corneal ulcers, foreign bodies, ocular pemphigoid, trauma, previous history of
        chemical/thermal injury to eyes or eyelids (anytime in past), or greater than trace
        intraocular inflammation were excluded from the study. Additionally, patients with allergy
        to corn starch, talcum powder, or dacron were also be excluded. Patients using any topical
        ophthalmic medication (i.e. antibiotics) were required to wait at least 30 minutes from
        their last dose prior to device application and wait at least 2 hours after their last dose
        of any ointment application
