  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two pain medications delivered by two different forms
      of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) management systems: the Fentanyl HCl Patient-Controlled
      Transdermal System (E-TRANS fentanyl) and the morphine intravenous pump. Fentanyl HCl and
      morphine are narcotic pain relievers. The E-TRANS fentanyl system is a small unit worn on the
      patient's upper outer arm or chest that uses low-intensity electrical current to deliver
      fentanyl through the skin and into the patient's bloodstream. The patients studied will be
      those who have just received a total hip replacement.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two pain medications delivered by two different forms
      of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). PCA is a form of pain management that allows the
      patient to control the amount of pain medication he or she receives. The PCA E-TRANS fentanyl
      system is a credit card-sized unit that is worn on the patient's upper outer arm or chest. It
      uses low-intensity electrical current to move fentanyl through the skin and into the
      patient's bloodstream. It does not require the insertion of an intravenous (IV) needle, or
      injection for pain management. PCA IV morphine is delivered into a vein by an IV infusion
      pump that is specially designed to be controlled by the patient. The PCA E-TRANS fentanyl
      system delivers a 40 microgram dose of fentanyl and the PCA IV morphine delivers a 1
      milligram intravenous dose of morphine. The patients in this study are those scheduled for a
      total hip replacement in one (not both) hips. Before surgery, patients will be taught how to
      use both PCA devices and randomly assigned to receive either PCA IV morphine or E-TRANS
      fentanyl. After undergoing the hip replacement, patients will have the PCA device applied to
      the skin (E-TRANS fentanyl) or an IV inserted into a vein (PCA IV morphine), according to the
      random assignment. The patient will then be allowed to control delivery of the assigned
      medication for 72 hours. During the first 24 hours, the patient will be asked about the
      amount of pain he or she is having. The primary measure of effectiveness is successful pain
      relief (defined by a rating of &quot;Excellent&quot;, or &quot;Good&quot;) on the 24-hour patient global
      assessment of the method of pain control. At 24, 48, and 72 hours, the patient will be asked
      a set of specific questions to measure the effectiveness of the PCA. In addition, the
      patient's doctor, nurses, and physical therapists will answer questions about the PCA system.
      Safety will be assessed by monitoring the patient's vital signs and recording any adverse
      events, including problems at the location on the patient's body where the PCA device has
      been applied or inserted. The objective is to establish that the Fentanyl HCl
      Patient-Controlled Transdermal System (E-TRANS fentanyl) is as effective as intravenous (IV)
      PCA morphine in controlling pain after a total hip replacement.

      E-TRANS fentanyl 40 mcg transdermally per patient-activated dose over 10 minutes, up to 6
      doses per hour or a maximum of 80 doses in 24 hours; Patient controlled intravenous morphine
      1 mg dose, up to 10 doses per hour or a maximum of 240 doses in 24 hours. Study duration is
      72 hours.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a pre-operative American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status I,
             II, or III (Class I are healthy persons less than 80 years of age, Class II are
             patients over age 80 years of age with mild systemic disease, and Class III are

             bupivacaine)

          -  Surgical time of up to 4 hours for total hip replacement surgery with a single
             surgical incision
