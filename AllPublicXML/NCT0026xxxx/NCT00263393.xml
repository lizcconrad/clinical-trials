  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a novel cardiovascular disease prevention
      program designed for delivery through existing primary health care services in rural villages
      in Andhra Pradesh.

      The primary aim is to increase the number of high-risk individuals in the population that are
      appropriately managed with proven, low-cost preventive interventions. The corresponding null
      hypothesis is therefore that the prevention program will result in no change in the
      proportion of high-risk individuals identified and treated in villages assigned to
      intervention compared with those villages assigned to control.

      STUDY TYPE This project is a community intervention study that will use a large-scale,
      cluster-randomised design to compare the management of individuals at high cardiovascular
      risk in villages assigned to receive the cardiovascular prevention program (intervention) and
      villages assigned to continue usual practices (control). The definition of high-risk for
      treatment is based on an established history of previous vascular disease -heart attack or
      stroke- known hypertension or systolic blood pressure &gt; 160mmHg, or the presence of other
      risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, older age and family history
      which combined would result in a very high level of risk.

      INTERVENTION PROGRAM TO BE EVALUATED The program to be evaluated comprises: (1) simple
      strategies designed to facilitate the opportunistic identification of high-risk individuals,
      (2) clinical algorithms for the implementation of proven preventive interventions based on
      World Health Organisation recommendations (3) a health promotion campaign designed to aid
      self-identification and self-referral of high-risk people and (4) simple, structured
      education programs to assist patients to comply with their treatment.

      DATA COLLECTION Data to be collected will comprise an interviewer administered questionnaire
      with demographic details, basic medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, previous
      cardiovascular disease and any current treatments. This will be followed by a brief physical
      examination including measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height, waist and
      hip circumferences. Urine will be tested using a dipstick in all and all will have a fasting
      blood glucose assay. Fasting venous blood samples will be collected for assay of cholesterol,
      glucose and creatinine from a sample of 1,000.
