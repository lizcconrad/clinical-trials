      Metastatic Breast Cancer.

      This is a Phase II open label, nonrandomized study for patients with metastatic breast
      cancer.

      WHAT IS SATRAPLATIN:

      Satraplatin is a member of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based
      drugs have been clinically proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer
      therapies. Unlike the currently marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given
      orally.

          2. Must have had prior Herceptin√í therapy if patient has HER2+ (overexpressing) breast
