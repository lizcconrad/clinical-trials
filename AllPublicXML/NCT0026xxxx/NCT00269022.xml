  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the success of the triptan class of drugs, approximately 60% of patients who take
      medication at the moderate to severe pain stage of acute migraine, still have pain of mild or
      greater degree at 2 hrs post dose. SB-705498 is a novel, first in class TRPV1 receptor
      antagonist under development for the treatment of migraine pain. Preclinical experiments have
      demonstrated that the TRPV1 receptor is expressed both centrally and peripherally in the
      trigeminal system and inhibition of TRPV1 with SB-705498 can both prevent and reverse
      established central sensitisation.
