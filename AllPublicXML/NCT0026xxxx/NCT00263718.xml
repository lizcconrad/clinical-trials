    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the use of calcipotriol plus betamethasone
      dipropionate gel with betamethasone dipropionate in the gel vehicle, calcipotriol in the gel
      vehicle and the gel vehicle alone when used in patients with psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk
      and/or limbs. Patients will be treated once daily for up to 8 weeks.

      The primary response criterion is the number of patients with controlled disease at week 8.
