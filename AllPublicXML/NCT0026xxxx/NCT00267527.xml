  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 2 study. Patients
      will be treated for a total of 12 weeks. There will be a 6 week follow-up period after the
      treatment period ends. Patients will be randomly assigned to low dose CJC 1295, high dose CJC
      1295 or placebo.

      The objective is to assess and compare the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and
      tolerability of CJC 1295 in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated
      visceral obesity.
