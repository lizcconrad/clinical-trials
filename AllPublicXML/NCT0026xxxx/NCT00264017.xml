  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past ten years, newer drugs with more selective affinity for the alpha-receptor have
      been introduced. Alfuzosin (Uroxatral) and Tamulosin(Flomax are two second generation
      alpha-blockers. In the course of our clinical proctice, both drugs have been used routinely.
      This retrospective comparison is intended to be a priliminary comparison of their
      effectiveness and side effects.
