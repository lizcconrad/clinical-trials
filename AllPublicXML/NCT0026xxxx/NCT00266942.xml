    <textblock>
      Our aim is a retrospective chart review seeking to determine any differences in the main
      clinical and outcome variables as well as general outcome data such as functional recovery,
      readmission rates, somatic growth and mortality. An n size of 150 to 200 for each of the 2
      groups will give us excellent power to detect potential differences.

      The Fontan procedure is indicated as final-stage treatment for pediatric cardiac patients
      with single ventricle physiology. This procedure, whose aim is to provide for total
      cavopulmonary disconnect and perfusion of the pulmonary arteries via systemic veins, is
      performed via two differing techniques: intra-atrial, so-called lateral tunnel technique,
      employing PTFE graft material and internal atrial baffle, versus the extracardiac technique,
      using larger PTFE tubing and externally constructed baffle.

      There is persistent debate regarding the optimal technique to use, centered around the
      following main issues: 1) need for use of cardiopulmonary bypass and attendant consequences,
      2) rates of thrombosis and embolism, 3) incidence of postoperative protein-losing enteropathy
      (PLE), 4) incidence of arrhythmias, and 5) baffle patency rates. A handful of small- to
      medium-sized studies has addressed the above issues, but, importantly, has not used patient
      data from the same institution. Here at CHOA, there are an estimated 200+ lateral tunnel, and
      have been up to 125 to 150 extracardiac Fontan procedures, performed in the last 15 years
      (1.1.1980-3.31.2005). Data from these cases would be potentially very helpful in answering
      all of these questions.
