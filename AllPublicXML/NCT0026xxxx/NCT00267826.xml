           initially considered for inclusion in this study and to specifically state the reason(s)
           for their exclusion.

           STUDY MEDICATION, DESCRIPTION, AND ALLOCATION

           Investigational Drug

           Rituximab is supplied by Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG. Rituximab is registered for the
           treatment of B cell lymphoma in Switzerland. Investigational site personnel should refer
           to the Directions for Handling and Administration (DHA) for specific instructions on the
           handling and administration of Rituximab.

           Enrollment Procedure

           Patients are officially enrolled into the study and assigned a subject identification
           number after all screening evaluations have been completed and all study inclusion
           criteria have been met.

           Drug Accountability

           Rituximab accountability must be maintained by the investigator. The investigator must
           maintain accurate records demonstrating the dates and amount of Rituximab received, to
           whom dispensed (patient-by-patient accounting), and accounts of any Rituximab
           accidentally or deliberately destroyed. Unless otherwise notified, all vials, both used
           and unused will be saved.

           THERAPY

           Once therapy (that is, dose number 1) has begun, in order for a patient to receive a
           subsequent dose of Rituximab, the following must occur:

             -  administration of each dose of Rituximab must be separated by an interval of at
                least 7 days

             -  no clinical evidence of significant viral, bacterial, or fungal infection at the
                time of the study visit

           Treatment Schedule

           During the treatment course, all patients will receive Rituximab administered as a 1000
           mg intravenous infusion, followed by a 24-week follow-up period.

           Dosing will be according to the schedule provided unless there is evidence of clinically
           significant infection (as determined by the investigator) or leukopenia, neutropenia or
           thrombocytopenia.

           Treatment Compliance

           Compliance with Rituximab dosing will be monitored and recorded by investigational site
           personnel.

           Concomitant Therapy

           For patients on any prescription medication, every attempt should be made to keep the
           patient on a stable dose of that medication for at least 14 days prior to the first dose
           of Rituximab in any treatment course.

           Any medication and any non-drug procedure or therapy (including topical emollients) used
           from study entry until the patient's final study visit must be recorded in the patient's
           CRF.

           Allowed Concomitant Therapy

           Patients will two intravenous infusions of Rituximab either as monotherapy or in
           combination the following classes of treatments as described below. Treatments should be
           kept stable through the period from 14 days before baseline until Visit 13.

             -  Topical low or medium potency corticosteroids

             -  Topical emollients

           Adverse Events: Definition and Management

           The terms &quot;relationship&quot; and &quot;severity&quot; (used throughout this section) are defined in
           the table.

           At the time of written informed consent, the patient must be given the name and phone
           number of investigational site personnel who can be called in the event of an emergency
           or to report any medical symptom or untoward medical occurrence that is of concern to
           the patient.

           Definitions Predosing Signs and Symptoms

           For the purposes of this study, any sign (including an abnormal laboratory result, as
           determined by the investigator) or medical diagnosis noted by medical personnel, or
           symptom reported by the patient that occurs prior to the start of investigational drug
           treatment is considered to be a predosing sign/symptom. Any predosing sign/symptom
           classified as serious will be reported to the IRB/REB/IEC.

           Adverse Events

           For the purposes of this study, any sign (including an abnormal laboratory result, as
           determined by the investigator) or medical diagnosis noted by medical personnel, or
           symptom reported by the patient, regardless of relationship to investigational drug,
           that is treatment-emergent is considered to be an adverse event. 'Treatment-emergent' is
           defined as follows:

        1. Has onset any time after the start of investigational drug treatment

           OR

        2. Has worsened since the event was previously reported (this includes worsening of signs,
           symptoms, or diagnoses that were present prior to the first dose of investigational drug
           but then worsened any time after the start of investigational drug treatment)

           Classification of Event as Serious

           As soon as a patient has given written informed consent to participate in the study, any
           abnormal sign (including an abnormal laboratory result, as determined by the
           investigator) or medical diagnosis noted by medical personnel, or symptom reported by
           the patient regardless of whether or not the patient has received investigational drug
           is to be classified by the investigator as either a serious or non-serious event using
           the following definition:

           Serious Event

           Events are classified as serious if they meet any of the following criteria (in
           accordance with 21 CFR Part 312.32 and the recommendations of the International
           Conference on Harmonization [Federal Register, October 7, 1997, Vol. 62, No. 194, pp
           52239-45]):

           • Any death.

           • Any life-threatening event, i.e., an event that places the patient, in the view of the
           investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (does not include
           an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).

           • Any event that requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization.

           • Any event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.

             -  Any congenital anomaly/birth defect diagnosed in a child of a patient who
                participated in this study.

             -  Other medically important events that in the opinion of the investigator may
                jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other
                outcomes listed in the definition above.

           Immediate Telephone Reporting of Serious Events

           Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG must immediately be made aware of events classified as SERIOUS
           in order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting serious events.
           Therefore, it is the investigator's responsibility to ensure the following:

           Any serious event that occurs any time after the patient signs the informed consent form
           for this study, regardless of whether or not the patient has undergone any study-related
           procedures or received investigational drug, up to the patient's final study visit
           (i.e., Visit 11), inclusive, must be reported to Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG within 24
           hours following report of the event, regardless of severity or relationship to
           investigational drug.

           When telephoning a serious event report to Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG, the investigator
           must provide specific information regarding the patient and the event. Roche Pharma
           (Schweiz) AG must also receive written confirmation of the above information. For deaths
           that occur following a patient's enrollment into the study a Record of Death CRF as well
           as a copy of the autopsy report (when/if available) must be submitted to Roche Pharma
           (Schweiz) AG. The investigator must keep a copy of all documentation related to the
           event in the site's study files.

           The investigator must also notify the local review committee, i.e., the Institutional
           Review Board (IRB), Research Ethics Board (REB), as per local IRB/REB/IEC requirements.
           Documentation of these reports will be kept in the site's study files.

           Any serious event that has onset after the patient's first dose of investigational drug
           and that is unresolved at the time the patient permanently discontinues the study must
           be followed until the event resolves or until the patient's clinical course has
           stabilized.

           Reporting of Serious Events to Regulatory Agencies After receipt of a serious event
           report Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG will notify all appropriate regulatory authorities, as
           necessary, within the required time frames. Written safety reports submitted to
           regulatory authorities will be completed by Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG with the
           assistance of the investigator and other investigational site personnel, as needed.

           Primary endpoint is the change of EASI at Visit 7 and 24 compared to baseline via paired
           t-Test.

           Additional Endpoints Additional endpoints are the percentage of patients reaching a PGA
           of &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;almost clear&quot; and/or a reduction of EASI of &gt;= 50 or &gt;= 75% compared to
           baseline at any visit after baseline.

           Other additional endpoints are:

           the percentage of patients reaching a pruritus score of &quot;none&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; Several
           immunological endpoints

           Criteria for the Endpoints

           Patients with missing PGA scores at the visit being analyzed will be considered
           treatment failures for that visit. Patients who received disallowed therapies as listed
           prior to the visit of the course being analyzed will be considered treatment failures
           for the course in the efficacy analysis.

           Statistical Methods

           Analysis Populations 1.1.1.1 Safety

           The safety population is defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of study
           drug and have at least 1 post-baseline assessment of the safety parameter.

           1.1.1.2 Efficacy

           The efficacy population will be based on the intent-to-treat principle and is defined as
           all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.

           Demographics and statistical aspects

           All appropriate background data will be summarized by presenting frequency distributions
           and/or basic summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and
           maximum).

           Study question and hypothesis

           Due to the pilot character of this study no formal hypotheses are issued. We expect
           clear improvement with Rituximab. The effect of Rituximab is of special interest,
           because this may become a new therapeutic approach with reasonable costs and handling.
           Our investigation should be a pilot trial for a following study enrolling a larger
           population to elucidate the clinical use for treatment of patients with atopic
           dermatitis.

           Statistical methods

           Changes in the investigated variables before and after treatment will be compared using
           the Wilcoxon's signed ranks test. Subgroups will be compared using the Mann Whitney
           U-test. Otherwise, the data will be analysed and presented in a desriptive manner (see
           above).

           Safety Analyses

           All clinical adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be evaluated for safety.
           The number of patients with at least 1 dose withheld will also be evaluated.

           1.1.1.3 White blood cell counts, platelets

           Lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset (CD4+ and CD8+) counts over time will be presented.

           1.1.1.4 Laboratory Abnormalities

           Selected blood chemistry evaluations will be assessed to determine incidence of
           laboratory abnormalities that emerge within the course. Shift tables will be used to
           present changes in each laboratory parameter relative to the parameter's normal range.

           1.1.1.5 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs

           The incidences of abnormalities in physical examination and in vital signs,
           respectively, will be presented.

           Efficacy Analyses

           The proportion of patients who achieve a PGA of &quot;almost clear&quot; or &quot;clear&quot; or a decrease
           in EASI value &gt;=50% and &gt;=75 % without the use of disallowed therapy as defined in the
           protocol at each scheduled visit will be presented.

           The EASI at Visit 3-11 will be compared to EASI at baseline/Day1 using a paired t-test.
           The threshold for significant changes will be p&lt;0,05.

           APPENDIX 1: ECZEMA AREA AND SEVERITY INDEX (EASI) The EASI assigns proportionate body
           surface areas to the head and neck [10%], trunk [30%], upper extremities [20%] and lower
           extremities [40%] for children aged 7 and above. This is roughly consistent with the
           rule of nine. The numbers are modified when used with children under the age of 7: head
           and neck [20%], trunk [30%], upper extremities [20%] and lower extremities [30%]. The
           area of involvement (affected by inflammation, not including dry skin) of each of the
           four body regions is represented by a numeric coded value [0 - 6] as below (the
           investigator is required to record the percent area on the CRF).

           Table 1. EASI: Area of involvement Area Involvement 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 no eruption &lt; 10% 10%
           - 29% 30% - 49% 50% - 69% 70% - 89% 90% - 100%

           The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed separately for erythema (E),
           infiltration/papulation (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L). The average
           degree of severity of each sign in each of the four body parts, is assigned a score of
           0-3 indicating none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3) expression of the
           clinical sign. Half steps are allowed.

           Further practical details to aid the assessment are:

           The lower extremities region includes the buttocks. The trunk region includes the
           internal/medial axillae and groin. The head/neck region comprises the face and the
           anterior and posterior neck. The upper extremities region includes the hands and
           external axillae.

           The definitions of the scoring signs of EASI are given below:

           Table 2. Scoring signs of EASI Erythema (E) 0 None

      1 Mild Faintly detectable erythema: very light pink 2 Moderate Dull red, clearly
      distinguishable 3 Severe Deep / dark red Infiltration / Papulation (I) 0 None

        1. Mild Barely perceptible elevation

        2. Moderate Clearly perceptible elevation but not extensive

        3. Severe Marked and extensive elevation Excoriations (Ex)

      0 None

      1 Mild Scant evidence of excoriations with no signs of deeper skin damage (erosion, crust) 2
      Moderate Several linear marks of skin with some showing evidence of deeper skin injury
      (erosion, crust) 3 Severe Many erosive or crusty lesions Lichenification (L) 0 None

        1. Mild Slight thickening of the skin discernible only by touch and with skin markings
           minimally exaggerated

        2. Moderate Definite thickening of the skin with skin markings exaggerated so that they
           form a visible criss-cross pattern

        3. Severe Thickened indurated skin with skin markings visibly portraying an exaggerated
           criss-cross pattern

      The EASI will then be calculated according to the following formula:

      Table 3 . EASI: Calculation of score for ages 7 years and above Head/Neck (E + I + Ex + L) x
      Area(1) x 0.1 Trunk (E + I + Ex + L) x Area(1) x 0.3 Upper limbs (E + I + Ex + L) x Area(1) x
      0.2 Lower limbs (E + I + Ex + L) x Area(1) x 0.4 EASI = sum of the above four body areas

        1. Where Area is defined on a Seven Point Ordinal Scale, as shown in the table 3-3.
