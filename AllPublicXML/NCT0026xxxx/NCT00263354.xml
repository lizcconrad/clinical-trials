          -  First line locally unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer.

          -  Relapsing gastric cancer after local and/or systemic treatment with a post-surgical
             period of at least 4 weeks, a post-adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy period of
             at least 6 months.

          -  Serum bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl

          -  Platelet count &gt;or = 100, 000/dl

          -  AST/ALT &lt; or = 2.5 time-fold the institutional normal upper limit

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; or = 5 time-fold the institutional normal upper limit

          -  Imagenological evaluation of the patient at least 2 weeks prior to the drug infusion

          -  Laboratory tests at least 1 week prior to the first infusion

          -  Patient available for follow up and able to answer to the quality of life
             questionnaire

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic sensorial peripheral neuropathy

          -  Uncontrolled concomitant disease

          -  Another malignant neoplastic disease diagnosed within the previous 5 years to the
             diagnosis of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, with the exception of 'in situ'
             cervix carcinoma or non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Concomitant antitumoral treatment

          -  Cerebral metastases

          -  Unstable heart disease, even though in treatment

          -  Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months

          -  Radiotherapy within the last 6 weeks, surgery within the last 4 weeks, or chemotherapy
