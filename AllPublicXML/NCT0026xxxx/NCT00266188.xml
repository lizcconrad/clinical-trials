  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tetralogy of Fallot is the most frequent complex congenital heart malformation. Over the past
      five decades, surgical repair has been performed with respectable results. However, relevant
      postoperative residues frequently remain. Pulmonary insufficiency, in particular, has been
      identified as a factor limiting the right ventricular function and, accordingly, the quality
      of life and life expectancy.

      With increasing use of cardiac MRI for both measurement of ventricular function and imaging
      of pulmonary arteries, residual defects have been discovered that were not detectable by
      echocardiography. There is mounting evidence of right ventricular pressure and volume stress
      in Fallot patients after surgical correction. At present, it is impossible to detect right
      ventricular insufficiency at an early stage. Hence, it is to be assumed that right
      ventricular insufficiency is underdiagnosed and therapeutic action frequently is initiated
      beyond the point of no return of ventricular function.

      The objective of this study is the systematic collection of cross-sectional and longitudinal
      data from extensive standardised examinations, including MRI, echocardiography, pulmonary
      function and ergometry tests, ECG and quality of life assessments, in a large number of
      patients with surgically corrected tetralogy of Fallot, and the setup of a database. The data
      obtained are supposed to provide information on the long-term outcome of surgical correction,
      to help establish criteria for necessity and time of re-intervention or re-operation, and to
      assess the effectiveness of re-interventions and re-operations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the repair of tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary insufficiency used to be tacitly accepted as
      a result of extensive transannular patching (TAP) and considered unobjectionable. In fact,
      this is well tolerated during the first postoperative years, but today there is increasing
      evidence that the resulting chronic volume stress to the right ventricle is harmful on the
      long run, in particular if there are stenoses of the pulmonary artery in addition. Such
      stenoses, partly due to distortions after shunt surgery, together with pulmonary
      insufficiency, lead to a combined volume and pressure load of the right ventricle. The
      chronic volume stress results in a decrease in biventricular function and exercise tolerance,
      associated with increasing electrical instability with frequent, mostly ventricular,
      dysrhythmias. This constellation brings about a significantly increased risk of cardiac
      death.

      Pulmonary valve replacement can improve haemodynamics, exercise tolerance and dysrhythmia.
      However, it is still unclear, which criteria best indicate the need for re-operation or other
      re-intervention, such as balloon dilatations of peripheral pulmonary stenoses, and what may
      be the best point in time.

      Cardiac MRI has been established as non-invasive method to quantify right and left
      ventricular function without radiation exposure. Correlating quantitative functional data to
      clinical conditions may permit the evaluation of factors that influence the long-term course
      after surgical repair of Fallot's tetralogy.

      The objective of this study is to establish a broad database of cross-sectional and
      longitudinal (after one year) findings from extensive standardised examinations, including
      MRI, echocardiography, pulmonary function and ergometry tests, ECG, quality of life
      assessments performed and cardiac catheterisation, if indicated, on a large number of
      subjects with surgically corrected tetralogy of Fallot. The data obtained are supposed to
      determine parameters indicating beginning irreversibility of decreased cardiac function, to
      provide information on the long-term outcome of surgical correction, to help establish
      criteria for necessity and time of re-intervention or re-operation, and to assess the
      effectiveness of re-interventions and re-operations.
