  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the possible effect of two antiepileptic drug on enzymes in the liver that
      metabolizes a number of drugs. It is a well know fact that carbamazepine induces some of
      these enzymes and this may reduce the effect of concomitantly administered drugs. Clinical
      observations suggest that oxcarbazepine does not induce these enzymes to the same degree.

      This study directly compares the ability of these two drugs to induce the cytochrome P450 3A4
      enzyme, in healthy volunteers using a well defined biomarker reaction of a specific enzyme
      activity.

      It is the hypothesis that oxcarbazepine induces CYP3A4 to a lesser degree than carbamazepine.
