    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the efficacy and safety of naltrexone implants
      as relapse prevention for patients that are completing treatment for opiate addiction in
      inpatient (or similarly controlled) settings. Participants in the naltrexone experimental
      group are prematched in a pairwise fashion with other patients who do not want a naltrexone
      implant during the first six months after ending inpatient treatment, but who reiceive
      treatment as usual (TAU) from the Norwegian healthcare system.

      The hypotheses are that quality of life, depression, opioid use, will be significantly better
      in the naltrexone group compared to the non at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up.

      We also hypothesize that the implants can prevent death from opioid overdose up to 6 months
      after commenced treatment.
