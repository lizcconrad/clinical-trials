      The purpose of this study is to examine treatment practices of adult schizophrenia patients
      by their own doctors, and to assess patient outcomes when treated with long-acting
      risperidone injection over a two-year period of observation.

      Controlled clinical trials for treating schizophrenia often involve selected patients with
      common characteristics. It is recognized that schizophrenia are much more diverse than those
      in the clinical setting, and that physician's prescribing practices may vary. The objective
      of the study is to examine treatment practices for adult schizophrenic patients by their own
      physicians, and to assess patient outcomes when treated with long-acting risperidone
      injection. This is a 2-year, prospective, multi-center, longitudinal, observational study in
      adults with schizophrenia. Physicians will determine the appropriate treatment for their
      patients, according to their usual practice. Patients starting treatment with long-acting
      risperidone injections and meeting all the study criteria may enroll in the study. Patients
      will continue their treatment according to usual care by their physicians. Patients will be
      asked questions at baseline and every three months for a period of two years to assess:
      efficacy of the medication, how well the patient is functioning, use of healthcare resources
      (e.g., emergency room visits, hospitalizations) patient work status, quality of life and
      patient satisfaction with the medicine. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. A dose
      of 25, 37.5 or 50 mg of risperidone, administered every 2 weeks by intramuscular injection.
