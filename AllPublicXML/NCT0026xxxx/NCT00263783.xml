        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or post menopausal female patients with histologically confirmed advanced
             refractory solid tumors for which no reasonable therapy exists. Patient is not
             required to have measurable disease.

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0, 1, or 2 (see APPENDIX 1 for details).

          -  Patients who had prior surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy will be eligible provided
             at least 4 weeks have elapsed prior to study initiation. Patients must have recovered
             from treatment-related toxicities, and surgical wounds must be healed.

          -  Patients who have had prior immunotherapy with approved agents are eligible.

          -  Patients must have hemoglobin &gt;10.0 g/dL, ANC &gt;1,000/mm3, WBC &gt;3,000/mm3,000/mm3,
             platelets ³100,000/mm3, bilirubin £2.0 mg/dL, AST/ALT no greater than 5 times the
             upper limit of normal (ULN), and serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL (or calculated creatinine
             clearance ³60 mL/min).

          -  Patients must have prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplatin time (PTT) less
             than upper limit of normal or international normalized ratio (INR) less than 1.1.

          -  Patients must have thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal
             limits.

          -  Patients must be informed of and understand the investigational nature of this trial
             and give written informed consent prior to receipt of any study medication or
             beginning study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has known brain metastases or primary brain tumors, symptomatic pleural
             effusion or ascites requiring paracentesis.

          -  Patient has respiratory insufficiency requiring oxygen treatment, or has lymphangitic
             involvement of lungs.

          -  Patient has evidence of hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or hematuria (2 or greater
             on urine dipstick).

          -  Patient has a history of a significant adverse event related to previously
             administered humanized monoclonal antibody.

          -  Patient has known HIV or hepatitis virus infection.

          -  Patient has prior myocardial infarction or angina, or uncontrolled hypertension
             (systolic BP &gt;140 mm Hg).

          -  Patient has either prior strokes or transient ischemic attacks.

          -  Patient has active infections requiring systemic antiinfective therapy or other
             physical or psychological illnesses that would preclude drug administration or patient
             compliance.

          -  Patient has donated blood or received an investigational agent in the last 4 weeks.

          -  Patient has a history of active illness or behavior, including substance dependence or
             abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, might pose additional risk in
             administering the study drug to the patient.

          -  General medical or psychological conditions that would not permit the patient to
             complete the study or sign the informed consent
