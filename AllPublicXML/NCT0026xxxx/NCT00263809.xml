  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to measure platelet corrected count increments and the
      incidence of serious adverse events (SAE). The primary endpoint is the platelet corrected
      count increment measured 1-hour post transfusion in response to the infusion of platelet
      concentrates treated with the Mirasol PRT System device (test product) versus untreated
      (reference product).

      The objective of the study is to determine if the MIRASOL Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT)
      System for Platelets device performs safely and maintains adequate platelet performance in a
      clinical setting. This will be achieved by comparing the platelet corrected count increment
      measured 1 hour post transfusion and the incidence of serious adverse events in response to
      the infusion of platelet concentrates treated with the device (test product) versus untreated
      (reference product) in thrombocytopenic subjects requiring platelet transfusions. The
      performance, safety, and tolerability profile of the device will be further assessed by
      monitoring and comparing the incidence of discontinuations due to adverse events in relation
      to platelet transfusion up to 4 weeks after transfusion, including the incidence of
      transfusion associated infections, and the number and time between transfusions.
