  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be performed to assess
      the effect of N-acetylcysteine therapy on the incidence of nephrotoxicity among patients
      hospitalized with an infection and treated with aminoglycosides (AGs). Secondary goals of the
      study will be as follows: comparison of the mortality rates, and length of hospitalization
      among patients treated with N-acetylcysteine compared to the control group.

          2. Aged between 18 and 90.

          3. Recruitment time between starting gentamycin therapy and initiation of the study
             intervention will be less than 24 hours.

          4. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any known allergy or intolerance to one of the medications in the AG group.

          2. Any known allergy or intolerance to N-acetylcysteine.
