    <textblock>
      This is an investigational study looking at subjects who have been diagnosed with
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or 'fatty liver disease'. There is currently no FDA
      approved available treatment for NASH. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential
      benefit of the medication, pentoxifylline, for the treatment of NASH. The effectiveness of
      this drug will be determined by taking blood samples and a liver biopsy. To determine if
      there is any effect of the medication, two-thirds of the patients participating in the study
      will receive pentoxifylline and one-third will receive placebo (sugar pill). Thus, an
      individual's chance of receiving the drug is 67%. In addition to receiving a study drug
      (placebo or pentoxifylline) the subjects will be encouraged to achieve modest weight loss
      (~1-2 lbs/week) via low-fat diet and exercise.

      The drug (Pentoxifylline) being studied is not approved for use in people who have NASH.
      Pentoxifylline is considered experimental in this study. Pentoxifylline has been safely used
      for the treatment of other medical conditions such as alcohol related liver disease and poor
      circulation. Pentoxifylline is a pill which is taken three times a day.

    <time_frame>baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary goal of the study was to determine whether pentoxifylline (PTX) therapy improved serum ALT (&gt; or = 30% change from baseline to month 12) compared to placebo.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Effect of Pentoxifylline on Change in Tumor Necrosis Factor [TNF]-α Levels in Patients With NASH</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change from baseline to month 12 in proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α) and gene expresssion were the secondary endpoints and were analyzed with the same analysis of covariance model and summary statistics specified for the primary endpoint. Differences were regarded as statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05. The results for TNF-α are reported here. Interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-10) and expression of TNF-alpha Receptors (p55 and p75) had insufficient data for statistical analysis.</description>

        <description>The mean change from baseline to month 12 in proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α) and gene expresssion were the secondary endpoints and were analyzed with the same analysis of covariance model and summary statistics specified for the primary endpoint. Differences were regarded as statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05. The results for TNF-α are reported here. Interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-10) and expression of TNF-alpha Receptors (p55 and p75) had insufficient data for statistical analysis.</description>
