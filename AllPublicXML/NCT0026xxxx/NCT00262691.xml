  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is a complex multifactorial and polygenic disorder that is thought to
      result from an interaction between a person's genetic make up and various environmental
      factors. Although many studies have revealed that several genetic variants increase the risk
      of cardiovascular disease, the results of these studies remain controversial. The purpose of
      this study is to identify polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to cardiovascular disease
      and to clarify the adequacy of reported susceptibility gene polymorphisms. To complete this
      purpose, we will prospectively study over 5,000 local residents in whom relationship between
      these polymorphisms and occurrence of cardiovascular disease over 5 years.
