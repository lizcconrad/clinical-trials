      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may
      kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with gemcitabine
      hydrochloride works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial and complete response) in patients with
           relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with bortezomib and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate NF-kB inhibition and proteasome activity with response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <measure>Response Rate After 2 Courses of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days/course for up to 2 courses</time_frame>
    <description>Response was evaluated after two cycles of therapy using the 1999 Cheson response criteria. All responses were based on CT scans. The criteria that were developed include anatomic definitions of response, with normal lymph node size after treatment of 1.5 cm in the longest transverse diameter by computer-assisted tomography scan. A designation of complete response/unconfirmed was adopted to include patients with a greater than 75% reduction in tumor size after therapy but with a residual mass, to include patients-especially those with large-cell NHL-who may not have residual disease. For patients who had FDG-PET imaging, metabolic response was defined as a decrease in the standardized uptake value in target lesions (regions of abnormal FDG uptake on pretreatment FDG-PET images) to below three on posttreatment FDG-PET imaging). All PET scans were reviewed and interpreted by a single radiologist (SV).</description>

    <measure>Change in Proteasome Activity Compared to Baseline (Cycle 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood (40 ml) was collected on cycle 1, day 1 of prebortezomib at baseline and 2 hrs post-bortezomib treatment. The samples were refrigerated at 4C and processed within 36 h of collection. Frozen cell lysates were thawed and the proteasome activity in 10 microliters was determined using a spectroflourometric 20S proteasome assay kit. Samples were run in triplicate on two separate days. The percent change between baseline and 2 hrs (day1, cycle 1) was calculated.</description>

        <title>Response Rate After 2 Courses of Therapy</title>
        <description>Response was evaluated after two cycles of therapy using the 1999 Cheson response criteria. All responses were based on CT scans. The criteria that were developed include anatomic definitions of response, with normal lymph node size after treatment of 1.5 cm in the longest transverse diameter by computer-assisted tomography scan. A designation of complete response/unconfirmed was adopted to include patients with a greater than 75% reduction in tumor size after therapy but with a residual mass, to include patients-especially those with large-cell NHL-who may not have residual disease. For patients who had FDG–PET imaging, metabolic response was defined as a decrease in the standardized uptake value in target lesions (regions of abnormal FDG uptake on pretreatment FDG–PET images) to below three on posttreatment FDG–PET imaging). All PET scans were reviewed and interpreted by a single radiologist (SV).</description>

        <description>Peripheral blood (40 ml) was collected on cycle 1, day 1 of prebortezomib at baseline and 2 hrs post-bortezomib treatment. The samples were refrigerated at 4C and processed within 36 h of collection. Frozen cell lysates were thawed and the proteasome activity in 10 microliters was determined using a spectroflourometric 20S proteasome assay kit. Samples were run in triplicate on two separate days. The percent change between baseline and 2 hrs (day1, cycle 1) was calculated.</description>
