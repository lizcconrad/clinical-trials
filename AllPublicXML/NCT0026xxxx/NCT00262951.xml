      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Interferon alfa may interfere
      with the growth of tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy
      together with interferon alfa before surgery may shrink the tumor so it can be removed.
      Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy together with interferon alfa works in treating patients with locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and interferon alfa on converting
           patients with locally advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas to
           resectability.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate and severity of early and late toxic effects of these regimens in
           these patients.

        -  Improve surgical morbidity profile and overall survival of patients who undergo surgical
           resection.

        -  Determine overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an pilot, single center study.

        -  Part 1 (neoadjuvant therapy): Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 24
           hours on days 1-38; cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; and
           interferon alfa subcutaneously on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29,
           31, 33, 36, and 38. Patients also undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26,
           29-33, and 36-38. Patients then undergo restaging. Patients with resectable disease
           undergo surgery, and 4-10 weeks later, proceed to part 2. Patients with unresectable
           disease proceed directly to part 2, 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy.

        -  Part 2 (chemotherapy): Patients receive fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and
           36. Treatment repeats every 56 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with unresectable disease undergo
           restaging after each course of fluorouracil. If the tumor subsequently becomes
           resectable, patients then undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      annually thereafter.

    <description>Tumor response is measured in terms of resectability, as measured by CT scan at 2 weeks after completion of each course. A CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis will be performed in order to evaluate for the presence of metastatic disease. If no metastatic disease, emphasis will be paid to the local tumor. Evaluation of the growth/regression of the tumor will be made as it relates to resectability. If potential for resection then surgery will be recommended. This protocol will be followed after each cycle.</description>

    <description>After Cycle 1 treatment (if resectable)- In the absence of metastatic disease, special emphasis will be paid to the local tumor. Evaluation of the growth/regression of the tumor will be made as it relates to resectability. Surgical exploration will start with a diagnostic laparoscopy. If no evidence of carcinomatosis, liver metastases or other evidence of metastatic disease is encountered, then a laparotomy will be performed. In the absence of clear technical unresectability, a radical pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal or total pancreatectomy (and resection of any involved structures) will be performed as mandated by tumor anatomy.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients in Whom Tumor Was Resectable</title>
        <description>Tumor response is measured in terms of resectability, as measured by CT scan at 2 weeks after completion of each course. A CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis will be performed in order to evaluate for the presence of metastatic disease. If no metastatic disease, emphasis will be paid to the local tumor. Evaluation of the growth/regression of the tumor will be made as it relates to resectability. If potential for resection then surgery will be recommended. This protocol will be followed after each cycle.</description>
