  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes have increased risk of developing diabetes and are
      typically more insulin resistant than their peers with no diabetes family history. We have
      recently demonstrated that, in contrast to their sedentary counterparts, physically active
      offspring are not insulin resistant. In the proposed controlled clinical study, we will
      examine the effects of a moderate exercise programme on insulin resistance, and other
      metabolic risk factors, in sedentary offspring and matched control subjects. We hypothesise
      that offspring will exhibit an augmented response to exercise, thereby normalising their
      predisposition to an adverse metabolic profile. We will also investigate expression of
      adipokines and other genes in adipose tissue to determine whether these contribute to the
      increased insulin resistance observed in offspring and whether they are influenced by
      exercise. The results will help to determine the efficacy of exercise in normalising
      metabolism in offspring and will help elucidate the mechanisms involved.
