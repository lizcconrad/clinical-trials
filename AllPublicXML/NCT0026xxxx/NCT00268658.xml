      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the biofeedback gait training
      device in improving load bearing over an operated limb, during post-operative gait training
      therapy. The effectiveness of the device will also be tested in self-training at home.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of the biofeedback gait training device as a biofeedback
      training therapeutic tool in improving body-weight bearing over the affected lower limb,
      quality of gait, level of ambulation and physical independence during rehabilitation, in
      patients after orthopedic procedures during gait therapy training, and as a biofeedback
      device for self-training at home.
