  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is PET-CT scan better than PET or CT alone in diagnosing primary tumours in patients with
      unknown primary tumors? Can information obtained with PET-CT replace other clinical and
      radiological investigations? Is PET/CT cost-effective?

      Patients who fulfill the international definition of unknown primary tumors can be included,
      except:

           expected will not be included.

           region will not be included.
