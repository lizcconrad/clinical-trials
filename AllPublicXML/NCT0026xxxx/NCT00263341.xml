  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 1-year study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new
      contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) delivering low doses of Nestorone (NES), a new,
      nonandrogenic progestin, and ethinyl estradiol (EE), an estrogen used in oral contraceptives.
      The CVR, which is made of silicone rubber, is designed to be used for 1 year (13 menstrual
      cycles) before replacement is required.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the contraceptive efficacy, cycle control, and
      safety of a reusable CVR delivering low daily doses of NES and EE for a 1-year (13-cycle)
      period.

      Nestorone is a potent, nonandrogenic, 19-norprogesterone derivative, which is not active when
      given orally, but is highly active when delivered via non-oral delivery systems, such as
      CVRs, implants, or transdermal preparations. The high potency of NES makes it an excellent
      candidate for use in contraceptive delivery systems designed to be effective for prolonged
      periods. This characteristic of Nestorone has been utilized in the design of a contraceptive
      vaginal ring that releases low daily doses of both NES and EE and is effective for a 1-year
      (13-cycle) period. The NES/EE vaginal ring is a long-acting contraceptive device, but, unlike
      other long-term methods, it use is controlled by the woman without the need for medical
      intervention.

      The efficacy of NES/EE vaginal ring in preventing pregnancy during a 1-year (13-cycle) period
      will be studied in women who have regular sexual activity and use no other form of
      contraception. The Pearl index for all women (18-&lt;40) and Kaplan-Meier life table analyses
      will be assessed for all subjects and for subjects £ 35 years and will provide supportive
      analyses for demonstrating efficacy. Pearl indices will be based on all cycles and on all
      cycles for which back-up contraception is not used.

      The number of bleeding/spotting days per cycle or reference period will be used to evaluate
      cycle control. Safety will be evaluated by regular assessments of blood pressure, pulse, and
      body weight and by laboratory testing and Pap smears at screening and termination, and by the
      frequencies of adverse events and serious adverse events. Additional safety evaluations will
      be obtained in a companion Phase 3 study conducted by the NIH (Protocol CCN006) with three
      substudies to evaluate 1) the effect of treatment on 4 hepatic proteins that may be
      associated with a risk for thromboembolism; 2) the effect of reusing the same CVR for 13
      consecutive cycles on vaginal flora and the risk of infection; and 3) the effect of vaginal
      delivery of NES and EE on the endometrium.

      A nested pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics/safety study is also being conducted in a subset
      of 39 patients. Blood samples are drawn during study cycles 1, 3, and 13 in order to assess
      ovulation suppression, measured by serum progesterone concentration, and the pharmacokinetics
      of NES and EE.

    <description>Each subject's health status will be monitored carefully throughout the trial. Baseline data collected at the screening visit will consist of the medical and gynecologic history and physical examination findings including breast and pelvic exam (to include Pap test and STI screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea). These assessments will be repeated at the 6th cycle visit (with the exception of the Pap, and STI screening). Baseline data obtained from clinical chemistries and a CBC will be used to monitor liver and renal function, lipid levels and hematologic status.</description>

    <description>This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study of a 21/7-day regimen of the 150/15 NES/EE CVR, in healthy women followed on an outpatient basis up to one year (13 cycles) of treatment over one year. Because of the stop treatment date of December 31, 2008 for all participants, women enrolling or re-enrolling in 2008 may not complete a full 13 cycles of treatment. Subjects may also participate in a 6 month follow-up period after the 300B study. The ring is designed to last for 12 months.</description>

          -  Women not intending to become pregnant for 13 months.

          -  Intact uterus and both ovaries.

          -  Prior history of regular menstrual cycles of 28 ± 7 days when not using hormonal
             contraception; if postpartum or postabortal, history of regular menstrual cycles of
             21-35 days in length and at least one cycle (2 menses) with a cycle length consistent
             with her past cycles.

          -  Sexually active (currently) and willing to discontinue current contraceptive method to
             participate in the study.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with the protocol, e.g. live within
             the clinic catchment area or within a reasonable distance from the clinic.

          -  Do not meet any of the exclusion criteria.

          -  Signed informed consent prior to entry into the trial.

        [For pharmacokinetics study only; 39 subjects already recruited]

        - Willing to undergo frequent blooding sampling

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Contraindications for enrollment will be the same as those for use with combined hormonal
        contraceptives in addition to contraindications specific to this clinical trial including:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to estrogens or progestins.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to silicone rubber.

          -  Known or suspected pregnancy.

          -  Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.

          -  Undiagnosed vaginal discharge or vaginal lesions or abnormalities. (Subjects diagnosed
             at screening with a chlamydia or gonococcus infection may be included in the trial
             following treatment; partner treatment is also recommended. Investigators should make
             a determination if subjects are at high risk for reinfection, e.g. multiple sex
             partners, untreated partner, and whether such subjects can be included.)

          -  History of toxic shock syndrome.

          -  Current abnormal Pap smear (women who have abnormal Paps but are ASCUS HPV negative
             may participate provided there is follow up for this finding per standard of care).

          -  Cystoceles or rectoceles or other anatomical abnormality that would preclude use of a

          -  History of venous thrombosis or embolism in a first-degree relative, &lt;55 years of age
             suggesting a familial defect in the blood coagulation system, which in the opinion of
             the PI, suggests use of a hormonal contraceptive could pose a significant risk.

          -  Cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.

          -  History of retinal vascular lesions, unexplained partial or complete loss of vision.

             rest.

          -  Known or suspected alcoholism or drug abuse.

          -  Abnormal serum chemistry values according to the physician's judgment.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within last 30 days.

          -  Use of monthly injectable contraceptives (e.g. cyclofem) unless suspended 2 months
             before initiation of treatment. Use of Depo-Provera [depo-medroxyprogesterone (DMPA)]
             unless suspended 6 months before treatment.

          -  Current use of implanted hormonal contraceptives, including Mirena® [progestin
             containing intrauterine system (IUS)], Jadelle®, Norplant® or Implanon® (subjects
             using any of these methods who request removal for reasons unrelated to the purpose of
             enrollment in this study may be considered for participation).

          -  Current use of a non-hormonal IUD. Subjects with IUDs who request removal for reasons
             unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this study may be considered for
             participation.

          -  Known HIV infection.

          -  Women at high risk of contracting HIV, e.g. women with multiple sex partners who need
             to use condoms consistently, injection drug users. If women enrolled in the study do
             use condoms to protect against STIs, they should be instructed that this occasional
             use should be with non-N-9 containing condoms and they should record condom use in
             their diaries. Women found to have an STI at screening will be treated prior to
             inclusion in the study (with the exception of those infected with HIV).
