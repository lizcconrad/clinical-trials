    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized prospective clinical trial is to determine whether an
      infertility treatment that moves quickly to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is more cost
      effective than the usual treatment strategy which includes various combinations of
      infertility drugs and intrauterine insemination (IUI) prior to utilizing In Vitro
      Fertilization.

      This is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, adverse events, and
      particularly cost and cost-effectiveness of two alternative infertility treatment strategies
      for patients who would otherwise be candidates for ovulation induction and IUI as their
      initial treatment. The two therapies compared are conventional treatment and fast track to
      IVF. Conventional therapy is a cost-conscious progressive treatment strategy that begins with
      the least invasive form of ovulation induction, clomiphene/IUI. It then progresses to FSH/IUI
      and, if pregnancy is not achieved, to IVF. The fast track to IVF strategy begins with
      clomiphene/IUI; if pregnancy does not result, these patients bypass FSH/IUI and move directly
      to IVF. We hypothesize that the fast track to IVF therapy results in a higher pregnancy rate,
      lower rates of medical complications during treatment, lower rates of pregnancy
      complications, and costs no more than conventional infertility treatment.

      The trial has the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To compare the number of deliveries per initiated cycle, the proportion of women with
      a clinically recognized intrauterine pregnancy, and the time to clinical pregnancy between
      fast track to IVF and the conventional treatment arms of the clinical trial.

      Aim 2: To compare the frequency of infertility treatment complications between the fast track
      to IVF arm and the conventional treatment arm.

      Aim 3: To compare the occurrence of pregnancy complications between the fast track to IVF arm
      and the conventional treatment arm.

      Aim 4: To evaluate the costs and cost effectiveness of the two alternative treatment
      strategies by comparing the direct and indirect medical costs between the fast track to IVF
      and conventional treatment arms of the clinical trial.

      This is a collaborative study between Boston IVF, Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates,
      Harvard School of Public Health, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim
      Health Care, and Tufts Health Plan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female partner age 21 up to 40th birthday, at the time of recruitment. Infertility is
             defined as failure to conceive a recognized pregnancy after one year (or 12 menstrual
             cycles) of unprotected intercourse.

          -  Male partner has a normal semen analysis with a sperm concentration of &gt;15 million
             total motile sperm, &gt;1% normal forms by strict criteria, or &gt;5 million total motile
             sperm on IUI prep.

          -  Female patient has at least one ovary and at least one ipsilateral patent fallopian
             tube confirmed by HSG or laparoscopy; pelvic pathology amenable to operative
             laparoscopy (pelvis restored to functional). The open tube cannot have had a previous
             ectopic (tubal) pregnancy and the closed tube cannot be a hydrosalpinx (a tube that is
             blocked at the end and filled with fluid), unless a tubal ligation has been performed
             at the junction of the uterus and fallopian tube.

          -  Patients with surgically corrected stages I and II endometriosis will be included.

          -  Normal uterine cavity demonstrated by HSG, Sonohysterogram (SHG), or hysteroscopy;

             to achieve ovulation at dosages up to 150 mg of clomiphene or standard dosages of
             other ovulation inducing medications (i.e. bromocriptine). Hypoestrogenic hypothalamic
             amenorrhea patients will qualify immediately for inclusion, prior to any gonadotropin
             therapy.

          -  Normal ovarian reserve demonstrated in all patients i.e., cycle day 3 FSH/E2 values of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous tubal reconstructive surgery in which the pelvis was not restored to
             functional.

          -  Unilateral or bilateral hydrosalpinx (a tube that is blocked at the end and filled
             with fluid) that has not had a tubal ligation performed at the junction of the uterus
             and fallopian tubes.

          -  A laparoscopy that demonstrated pelvic adhesions or endometriosis for which the pelvis
             could not be restored to normal by surgery or endometriosis was not ablated or
             excised. All patients with stages III and IV endometriosis.

          -  One or more prior ectopic pregnancies in which one or both tubes were rendered
             nonfunctional; two or more ectopic pregnancies, even if tubes are patent.

          -  Severe male factor (i.e.; semen analysis with a sperm concentration of &lt;15 million
             total motile sperm, &lt;1% normal forms by strict criteria, or &lt;5 million total motile
             sperm on IUI prep). Couples using donor semen will be excluded.

          -  Previous treatment with IUI or IVF. Previous treatment of normal ovulation patients
             with gonadotropins.

          -  Inadequate ovarian reserve demonstrating FSH &gt;15 mIU/mL or estradiol &gt; 100 pg/mL.
