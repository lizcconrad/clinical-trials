    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF chimeric
      monoclonal antibody (cA2) compared to placebo in the treatment of patients with fistulizing
      Crohn's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated-dose study to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) compared to placebo
      in the treatment of patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease. The primary efficacy outcome
      of the study is the number of patients with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the
      number of open fistulae observed for at least two consecutive evaluation visits.

      Patients will be treated with either anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) or matching
      placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Crohn's disease of at least 3 months duration confirmed by radiography
             orendoscopy

          -  Having single or multiple draining enterocutaneous (including perianal) fistulae of at
             least 3 months duration

          -  If treated with oral prednisone (or equivalent), the dose must be &lt;=40 mg/day and must
             have been stable for at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment. (If currently not treated
             with oral prednisone, the stop date must have been at least 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment)

          -  If treated with 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine, the start date must have been at
             least 6 months prior to enrollment. (The dose must have been stable for at least 8
             weeks prior to enrollment. If currently not treated with 6-mercaptopurine or
             azathioprine, the stop date must have been at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with local complications of Crohn's disease such as strictures or abscesses
             that might confound the evaluations of the benefit from cA2 treatment

          -  Having abscesses that should be drained prior to enrollment, with at least 3 weeks
             between drainage of the abscess and enrollment

          -  Having a serious infection, such as hepatitis, pneumonia or pyelonephritis, in the
             previous 3 months or a history of opportunistic infection such as herpes zoster within
             2 months prior to screening, or evidence of active cytomegalovirus, active
             pneumocystis carinii, or drug resistant atypical mycobacterium

          -  Currently having signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal,
             hepatic, hematologic, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic or cerebral disease

          -  Currently having any known malignancy or any history of malignancy within the past 5
             years
