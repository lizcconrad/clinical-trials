  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the lowering of blood homocysteine levels by
      treatment with B vitamins can prevent cardiovascular disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of plasma total homocysteine is
      a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy of homocysteine lowering treatment with B vitamins for secondary prevention in
      patients who have experienced an acute myocardial infarction.

      This controlled, double-blind, multi-centre trial will include 3750 men and women aged 30-85
      who have experienced an acute myocardial infarction within 7 days prior to randomization.
      Participants will be randomized, in a two-by-two factorial design, to receive one of the
      following four treatments: A, folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg and vitamin B6 40 mg
      per day; B, folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg per day; C, vitamin B6 40 mg per day;
      D, placebo.

      The primary end point during 3.5 years of follow-up is a composite of recurrent myocardial
      infarction and stroke and sudden death attributed to coronary artery disease.
