  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketorolac has been marketed for several years in other forms (tablet and injectable) for the
      short-term relief of pain. This study will test whether a new dosage form (nasal spray)
      containing ketorolac is effective at relieving the pain of major abdominal surgery, and will
      also assess product safety. Previous studies with the nasal spray have suggested that it is
      similar to the previously approved injectable form in effectiveness for pain relief and in
      its safety profile.

      Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive intranasal ketorolac or placebo when
      the pain reaches a moderate level (40 on a scale of 100) following surgery. After the first
      dose, subjects will receive study drug every 6 hours for 48 hours, and then as needed (up to
      4 times a day) for a total of 5 days. If pain is not adequately relieved by the study drug,
      subjects will be given morphine sulfate or other standard analgesics. Follow-up safety
      evaluations will occur about 1 and 2 weeks after the start of dosing.

      Subjects will be asked to answer questions about their pain relief and any possible side
      effects of the drug during the study, and will be given physical examinations, including
      nasal evaluations, before and during the clinical trial. A small amount of blood will be
      drawn for routine clinical laboratory testing.

    <measure>The Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Ratings of Pain Intensity (PI) were made using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on which 0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain possible. The PI values were obtained every hour following the first dose of study medication on Day 1. Pain intensity difference (PID) was calculated by subtracting the posttreatment score from the baseline score, where the baseline score was the PI rating made prior to the first dose of study medication. A summed PID (SPID) on the first postoperative day was calculated at 6 hours.</description>
