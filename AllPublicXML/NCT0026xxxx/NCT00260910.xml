      Blood pressure is a quantitative trait affected by both genetic and environmental factors. It
      is known that human essential hypertension does not follow a simple Mendelian mode of
      inheritance. Stanford-Asian Pacific Program in Hypertension and Insulin Resistance (SAPPHIRe)
      is an international genetic study, which intends to map the major genetic loci underlying
      hypertension in sibpairs of Asian-Pacific Chinese and Japanese origin. Based on the data
      generated through year 1 to year 5, preliminary analysis has not shown positive results in
      the linkage analysis of genome wide scan data, although association studies of some candidate
      genes give promising results.

      Success in genetic studies may depend on many factors including the selection of the patient
      population, the identification of intermediate phenotypes, the disease subsets, and the
      genetic strategy and methodologies employed. According to our previous analysis, presented in
      SAPPHIRe Steering Committee meetings (twice a year), there is heterogeneity among Chinese and
      Japanese origins.

      In order to reduce heterogeneity of the genetic and environmental background, we will focus
      our investigation on the Chinese population. Furthermore, besides the variables associated
      with insulin resistance, which were collected and studied in year 1 through 5 of SAPPHIRe,
      some more variables will be collected and studied in order to identify most sensible
      intermediate phenotypes and more homogeneous disease subsets.

      Our general approach is to continue analyzing candidate genes as well as perform a complete
      genome search based on the exiting genome-wide scan data together with old and new phenotype
      variables.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age of subjects when recruited must be between 35 and 60 years. Subjects over age 60
             may also be eligible provided that documentation of their hypertension status prior to
             age 60 is available.

          -  Chinese ancestry, i.e. all four grandparents Chinese. Hypertension is defined as
             follows: systolic BP (SBP) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 160 mm Hg or diastolic BP
             (DBP) &gt;= 95 mm Hg or taking 2 medications for high blood pressure (Stage II
             hypertension). Alternatively the subject could have uncontrolled hypertension, i.e.
             taking 1 medication for high blood pressure and has either systolic BP &gt;= 140 or
             diastolic &gt;= 90 mm Hg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  One of the affected sibs is adopted (i.e. no parent in common) or if the sibs have
             only one parent in common.

          -  Both parents have been treated for hypertension before the age of 60. If offspring
             reports about their parents' hypertension status are conflicting, then a single
             reliable report of hypertension in both parents before age 60 is cause for exclusion.
             This exclusion criterion, however, does not apply to discordant sib-pairs.

          -  Diabetic individuals were excluded. Diabetes uncovered as a result of SAPPHIRe lab
             work does not lead to exclusion however.

          -  Severe kidney disease (except stones and remote infections) of creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl,
             unless documented proof that the subject met inclusion criteria prior to increase in
             creatinine levels.

          -  A body-mass index greater than 35.

          -  In addition, the following conditions are considered as cause for exclusion: ongoing
             (or within the past 6 months) treatment for cancer; terminal illness (life expectancy
             fewer than 6 months); liver cirrhosis or any other chronic illness; pregnancy or fewer
             than 6 months post-partum.
