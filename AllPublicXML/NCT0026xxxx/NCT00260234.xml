  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin dependent Type I diabetics require daily insulin therapy to normalize blood glucose
      but may have difficulty with significant glycemic excursions and hypoglycemic episodes and
      crises. Islet cell transplantation can provide relief from daily insulin therapy, normalize
      blood glucose and reduce or eliminate short and long-term diabetes-related complications.
      &quot;PEG-Encapsulated Islet Allografts&quot; is a new islet transplant product under development that
      does not require the ongoing use of immunosuppressive drugs after the implant. This study
      will test the safety and efficacy of PEG-Encapsulated Islet Allografts in the treatment of
      Type I diabetes and provide functional outcome measurements.

      Allogeneic Cultured Islet Cells (human, Novocell); Encapsulated in Polyethylene Glycol;
      Administered Subcutaneously are a combination biologic and device product in which the
      pharmacologically active agent is human insulin that is released from the functional islet
      cells by natural production and release, stimulated by control mechanisms in response to
      blood glucose concentrations. The device component is a uniform and conformal polymer coating
      around each islet. Islet cells are isolated from multiple human pancreases procured from
      human organ donors who meet a specific human donor profile established by the UNOS and the
      FDA's requirements for Good Tissue Practices. Because the pancreases used for islet cell
      isolation are not intended for whole-organ transplantation, specific procurement, surgical
      removal, packaging and shipping protocols are provided by Novocell, Inc. to the Organ
      Procurement Organizations.

      The primary outcome is demonstration that encapsulated islet allografts can be implanted
      safely in the subcutaneous tissues without the use of long-term immunosuppression. The
      expected functional outcomes from the implantation of the encapsulated islets are significant
      reductions in the average blood glucose daily glycemic excursions and in insulin requirements
      as well as significant increases in C-peptide levels in response to meal challenges. The
      ultimate expected outcome is that patients who receive these implants will have reduced
      hemoglobin A1c levels that may be associated with reduced long-term diabetic complications.
      An important outcome should be reduction in hypoglycemic episodes and crises with
      significantly functioning grafts without having the risks associated with hepatic portal vein
      infusion and long-term immunosuppression.
