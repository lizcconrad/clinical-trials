  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week study to determine the effect on glucose and lipids, safety, and
      tolerability of four doses of tesaglitazar (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg) compared with placebo
      in patients with type 2 diabetes. Improvement in dyslipidemia will be evaluated. The study
      comprises a 2-week screening period, 4-week placebo run-in, a 12-week randomized, double
      blind, parallel group, multi-center, placebo-controlled treatment period, and a 3-week
      follow-up.
