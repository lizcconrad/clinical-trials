  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct population based surveillance for prenatally
      diagnosed congenital defects amount residents of the five counties to: improve the
      comprehensiveness of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) to (1)
      better fulfill its objectives (2) allow assessment of the impact of prenatal diagnosis and
      elective termination on the birth prevalence of congenital defects in Atlanta (3) develop a
      registry of prenatally diagnosed defects to be used in epidemiologic and genetic studies, in
      evaluation prevention programs and in monitoring prenatal diagnostic technology.

      Since 1967, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has conducted surveillance
      of birth defects in metropolitan Atlanta through review of hospital delivery and newborn
      medical records and records from various other medical sources in the five central counties
      of the metropolitan area (Clayton, Cobb, DeKalk, Fulton and Gwinnett, and has been expanded
      to include prenatal records. The project was begun n the aftermath of thalidomide and rubella
      epidemics as a kind of early-warning system for new or resurgent teratogens. The voluntary
      participation of Atlanta hospitals was sought and obtained at the inception of the system
      (the original system was a joint effort of the CDC, the Georgia Institute of Mental Health
      and Emory University).

      A case must be diagnosed by the child's sixth birthday or within six years of the date of
      elective termination.

      Children's Healthcare is one retrospective source of medical records reviewed for discharge
      summaries and disease indices.
