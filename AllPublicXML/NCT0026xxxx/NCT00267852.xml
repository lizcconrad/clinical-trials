      This is an observational prospective, multicenter study. The aim of the study is to evaluate
      how the Italian population of patients are treated with early aggressive RA, defined by the
      Italian Society of Rheumatology Guidelines, (GIARA Registry Study Group. Clin Exp Rheumatol
      2003;21(Suppl. 31):S129-S132), in rheumatologic clinical practice and whether recent
      scientific evidence or new treatments available to rheumatologists can change their practice
      in a 2 year follow-up. The observation will primarily focus on the disease activity and
      clinical remission in patients who are receiving different treatment strategies. The primary
      goal is to define prevalence of clinical remission, according to the (Disease Activity Score)
      DAS 28 definition of clinical remission, in patients with early aggressive RA receiving
      different therapies at 1 year.

      Secondary objective are assessment of:

        -  Prevalence of Remission at the second year

        -  Disease activity at the first and second year.

        -  ACR 20%, 50%, 70% response at the first and second year.

        -  Quality of Life in patients with or without remission at the first and second year

        -  Safety Evaluations

      It was expected that approximate 200 patients were enrolled in the study. Have been enrolled
      152 patients. A Statistical Analysis Plan will contain a detailed description of criteria for
      valuable patients for analyses and a description of statistical analyses. In general, all
      patients who respond inclusion/exclusion criteria at baseline will be considered valuable for
      the study. The summaries will include descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation,
      sample size) for the continuous parameters, and absolute frequencies and percentages for the
      remaining categorical parameters.
