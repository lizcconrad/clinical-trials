      Primary Objectives:

        -  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate clinical efficacy i.e. to show that
           with respect to clinical cure rate, Ketek® (telithromycin) in the treatment of community
           acquired respiratory tract infections: community acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute
           bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and acute sinusitis (AS), in
           outpatients.

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives are to:

        -  Further assess the efficacy of Ketek® (telithromycin) by considering the rate at which
           additional antibacterials were prescribed to treat the primary infection; the rate of
           hospitalisation due to a complication of the primary infection and assessment of
           bacteriological data, chest X-ray and sinus X-ray if available.

        -  Evaluate safety of Ketek® (telithromycin) through Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse
           Event (SAE) reporting
