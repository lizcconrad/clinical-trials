    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro)
      using 10 or 20 mg daily in patients with Alzheimer's disease who are also experiencing
      agitation.

      This study is designed for men and women over 60 who have an established diagnosis of mild to
      severe Alzheimer's disease and who also present behaviors of agitation such as restlessness,
      physical aggression, yelling and socially inappropriate interactions. While nonpharmacologic
      interventions are preferable, many times they are not effective alone. Each consented subject
      will be enrolled in a 12 week study with escitalopram, 10 or 20 mg per day. Each subject will
      be evaluated using rating scales designed for symptoms of Alzheimer's and agitated behavior.
      Each subject will also undergo physical and neurological examinations, laboratory tests and
      monitoring of side effects of escitalopram.
