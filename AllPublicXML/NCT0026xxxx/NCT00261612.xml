  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains difficult to treat by standard treatment approaches. Novel
      drugs have shown promising results in early clinical evaluations. In the current trial, we
      investigate a combination of bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor), rituximab (a monoclonal
      antibody), and dexamethasone in patients with MCL, who have already been pretreated by
      standard chemotherapy and show again signs of disease progression. The study objectives
      include remission rates, safety of this drug combination, and survival time.

      Description of the treatment regimen: Bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 as i.v. bolus injection, given on
      days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each treatment cycle; Rituximab: 375 mg/m2 infusion, day 1 of each
      cycle; Dexamethasone: 40 mg per day orally (days 1 – 4) of each treatment cycle. Treatment
      will be given for a total of 6 cycles (every 21 days), followed by maintenance treatment with
      rituximab (375 mg/m2 every two months for 4 times)
