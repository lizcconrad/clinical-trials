  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children experience significant anxiety and distress during the preoperative period.
      Currently available interventions are ineffective and/or associated with significant
      disadvantages. These interventions exclusively target the child and do not attempt to reduce
      parental anxiety. Based on an integration of the literature in both the anesthesia and
      psychological milieus, we developed ADVANCE, a behaviorally oriented anxiety reduction
      program for children undergoing surgery that targets the family as a whole.

      Children and their parents (n=408) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) Control:
      received standard of care, 2) PPIA: received standard parental presence during induction of
      anesthesia, 3) ADVANCE: received family-centered behavioral preparation, and 4) oral
      Midazolam. We assessed the effect of group assignment on anxiety levels and postoperative
      outcomes.
