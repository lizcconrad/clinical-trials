      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare the tumour response rate of combination chemotherapy irinotecan/cisplatin
           (IC) versus docetaxel/cisplatin (DC) in advanced NSCLC patients who responded to 3
           courses of docetaxel/cisplatin.

      Secondary Objectives :

        -  To compare the time to progression after chemotherapy treatment between the IC and DC
           arms of treatment.

        -  To compare the toxicity profile of the IC and DC arms of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven non-small cell lung carcinoma at first
             diagnosis.

          -  Stage IIIB or IV disease.

          -  Tumour considered unresectable.

          -  Performance status Karnofsky index &gt; 60% or WHO performance status &lt; or = 1.

          -  Previous therapy

               -  Chemotherapy: None.

               -  Previous radiation therapy: prior irradiation for NSCLC is permitted, however,
                  the measurable or evaluable non-measurable disease must be completely outside the
                  radiation portal.

          -  Laboratory requirements:

               -  Hematology:

                    -  Neutrophils ≥ 2.0 10^9/l,

                    -  Platelets ≥ 100 10^9/l,

                    -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl.

               -  Hepatic function:Total bilirubin &lt; 1 Upper Normal Limit (UNL), AST (SGOT) and ALT
                  (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 UNL,Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 UNL ; except in presence of only bone
                  metastasis and in absence of any liver disorders. Patients with AST and/or ALT &gt;
                  1.5 x UNL associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x UNL are not eligible for
                  the study.

               -  Renal function: Creatinine &lt; 140 µmol/l (1.6 mg/dl) ; if limit values, the
                  calculated creatinine clearance should be &gt; 60 ml/min.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant, or lactating patients; patients of childbearing potential must implement
             adequate contraceptive measures during study participation.

                  disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving
                  of informed consent.

               -  Active uncontrolled infection.

               -  Peptic ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus or other contraindication for the use of
                  corticosteroids.

          -  Past or current history of neoplasm other than non-small cell lung cancer, except for
             curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix.

          -  Concurrent treatment with prednisone (or equivalent) except as use for the
             prophylactic medication regimen, treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions,
