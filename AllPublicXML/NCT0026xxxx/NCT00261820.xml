  <brief_title>Study Comparing Two Immunosuppressive Regimens in De Novo Renal Allograft Recipients</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized Study To Compare The Safety And Efficacy Of Two Immunosuppressive Regimens In De Novo Renal Allograft Recipients:Sirolimus Plus Mycophenolate Mofetil Plus Corticosteroids Following A Rabbit Anti-Human Thymocyte Globulin Induction (RATG) Vs Tacrolimus Plus Mycophenolate Mofetil Plus Corticosteroids</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate renal graft function (based on the calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate) at 12
      months after transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of sirolimus plus
      mycophenolate mofetil following an antibody induction (RATG) or a standard regimen combining
      tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil, both regimens including corticosteroids in patients
      undergoing renal allograft transplantation. In addition, the two treatment groups will be
      compared with respect to the incidence of acute rejection at 3, 6 and 12 months following
      transplantation, and the patient and graft survival at 6 and 12 months after transplantation.
      The safety of sirolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil following an antibody induction (ATG) will
      be evaluated beginning in the immediate post-operative period.
