      The purpose of this study is to compare Kaletra tablets with Kaletra soft-gel capsules to see
      if there is any change in the side effects you may have and to see how people in the study
      feel about using the tablets.

      The demand for once-a-day easily tolerated therapies is increasing. While Abbott Laboratories
      418 study has demonstrated the efficacy of Kaletra® with both BID and QD dosing with
      capsules, the pill count of QD dosing may decrease its attractiveness for this population. In
      some patients, issues such as diarrhea, nausea, food restrictions, or the need to refrigerate
      their medication may also impact quality of life and possibly lead to non adherence and
      ultimately treatment failure. Moreover, it is believed that the diarrhea associated with
      Kaletra® capsules may be the result of capsule excipients that are unrelated to the active
      drug.

      Kaletra® has a long track record of being highly potent and not selective for protease
      inhibitor resistance as evidence by the Phase II Study 720. The results of this study
      demonstrate that ABT-378/ritonavir therapy is highly potent, durable, and well tolerated when
      administered concomitantly with two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors to
      antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected individuals. A high proportion of subjects achieved
      normal viral suppression (&lt; 50 copies/ml – 78% by ITT). No discontinuations due to study drug
      -related clinical or laboratory adverse events occurred during the first 48 weeks of study
      but the most common adverse effect was diarrhea (25%). Given the high oleic content of the
      capsules, dosing all six capsules at once may cause a “bolus” of this acid leading to
      increased diarrhea. Because of the viral suppression advantages, there is desire to see if
      there is a difference in quality of life and tolerability between the soft-gel capsules and
      the new tablet formulation of Kaletra® which allows for fewer tablets per day and does not
      include additives possibly associated with increased diarrhea.

      Study MOO-267 (PLATO), a multi-center study evaluated and demonstrated improved quality of
      life when switching from other regimens (efavirenz, nevirapine, indinavir, and nelfinavir) to
      Kaletra®. Instruments used to measure change in quality of life included the AIDS Clinical
      Trial Group (ACTG) Symptom Distress Module (ASDM) which measures the presence of bothersome
      symptoms commonly seen with HIV and ARV treatment; the Medical Outcomes Study-HIV Health
      Survey (MOS-HIV) which is widely used to evaluate the Quality of Life (QOL) of HIV infected
      patients; and the Center for Epidemiological Studies and Depression (CES-D), a validated
      self-reporting questionnaire used as a screening tool for depression.

      The hypothesis is that patient’s quality of life will improve when switched from Kaletra®
      soft-gel to Kaletra® tablets. The tablet formulation of Kaletra® will improve quality of life
      by simplifying current HAART regimens by decreasing pill count, improving tolerability,
      eliminating food restrictions and the need for drug refrigeration. African-American subjects
      were selected for this study because they are an understudied population and due to adherence
      behavior. In reviewing Abbott Study 418 and Study MOO 267 the percent of African-American
      enrollees accounted for 27% and 15% of the study groups respectively.1,4 In studies where
      there is an association between socio demographic factors and adherence behavior, the
      direction is consistent: younger age, non-white race, lower income, lower literacy and
      unstable housing was associated with non-adherence. Adherence behavior refers to the extent
      to which patients take their medication as prescribed by their health provider. As stated
      above, patients who are younger, non white race, lower income and live in unstable housing
      are less likely to adhere to the prescribed medication regime. It is important to evaluate
      antiretroviral therapy formulations to validate patient tolerability and acceptance in order
      to promote drug adherence. This study will compare the tolerability and acceptance of
      patients on Kaletra® soft-gel capsules with that of Kaletra® tablet formulation utilizing
      validated instruments as described above.

        Inclusion Criteria:1. African American male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age 2.
        Documented HIV-infected 3. Currently on Kaletra® soft-gel capsules for &gt;2 weeks 4.
        Competent and willingness to sign and date a written informed consent 5. No recent acute
        illness in the preceding 30 days which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude
        inclusion in the study 6. No current gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline of grade II or
        greater 7. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is post-menopausal) or

          -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screen, and
             agrees to one of the following:

          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the study
             drug, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after completion or premature
             discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the investigational drug.
             Should a patient decide to become sexually active during the course of the study, she
             must be counseled and be willing to use one of the birth control methods listed below:

          -  Double barrier method (male condom/spermicide, male condom/diaphragm,
             diaphragm/spermicide)

          -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the expected failure
             rate is &lt;1% per year (not all IUDs meet this criterion)

          -  Sterilization (female patient or male partner of female patient)

          -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate
             for that method is &lt;1% per year.

        NOTE: Data are insufficient to exclude a clinically important interaction of LPV/r with
        drugs, such as hormonal contraceptives, that are highly metabolized by the cytochrome P450
        enzyme system. As a result, hormonal contraception is not considered adequate.

        Exclusion Criteria:1. Positive pregnancy test or breast-feeding 2. Known hypersensitivity
        to study medications 3. Inability to conform to protocol procedures, including alcohol or
        drug abuse, untreated psychiatric illness 4. An unwillingness or presence of any condition
        that will impair the ability to swallow medications 5. Patient has required treatment with
        radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 4 weeks prior to entry, or
        has an anticipated need for these agents within the study period.

        6. Patient requires treatment with immunomodulating agents, such as systemic
        corticosteroids, interleukins, or interferon’s within 4 weeks prior to study entry, or
        patients who have received an HIV immunotherapeutic vaccine within 3 months prior to entry.

        7. Patient requires inhaled or intranasal fluticasone
