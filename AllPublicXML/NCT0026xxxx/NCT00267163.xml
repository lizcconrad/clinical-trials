      The goal of this project is to determine if a cholinesterase inhibitor is more effective than
      placebo in delaying cognitive and brain functional decline in people at risk for Alzheimer's
      disease.

      Studies to date show that pictures of the brain using PET (positron emission tomography) scan
      measures predict memory decline in people with genetic risks for developing AD. They have
      also been shown to predict memory decline in people with mild memory complaints. These
      findings are consistent with other evidence that the changes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
      begin years before the doctor can confirm a diagnosis.

      In this study, PET and genetic risk studies will be performed in people with mild memory
      complaints. A total of 138 participants (age 40 to 90 years) who are at risk for further
      memory decline will be enrolled. They will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to one of
      two treatment groups, donepezil (a medication to treat mild AD) or placebo, and followed 18
      months for evidence of future decline. Participants will receive magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scans, PET scans, genetic risk assessment for Alzheimer's Disease, and
      neuropsychological assessments. Repeat brain imaging studies will be performed at the end of
      the 18-month treatment trial.

      These procedures will allow researchers to explore how baseline brain function and genetic
      risk for AD onset influences brain metabolic rate and memory decline, and treatment outcome.
      Participants receiving donepezil are expected to show less evidence of decline than those
      receiving placebo. This project will expand a growing research program in early detection and
      prevention of AD, designed (1) to identify persons without memory complaints who are most
      likely to benefit from early intervention and (2) to provide an objective way to monitor the
      activity in the brain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Agreement to participate in a 18 month clinical trial

          -  NIMH diagnostic criteria for age-associated memory impairment (AAMI)

          -  Age 40 to 90 years

          -  MMSE score between 24 and 30 (unless &lt; 8 years of educational achievement)

          -  No significant cerebrovascular disease - modified Ischemic Score of &lt; 4

          -  The following medications are allowed if stable for &gt; 1 month: antidepressants
             (without anticholinergic effects) if not currently depressed and no history of major
             depression for 2 years; estrogen replacement therapy; thyroid replacement therapy as
             long as patient is euthyroid

          -  On entering the study, there must be a family member or potential caregiver available
             in case the patient develops cognitive impairment that interferes with independent
             study participation.

          -  Memory and verbal fluency cut-off scores increasing the probability of incipient
             dementia (Buschke-Fuld - 34; verbal fluency - 46 for letters, 7 for categories; Benton
             Visual Retention - 5)

          -  Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing

          -  Screening laboratory tests and ECG without significant abnormalities that might
             interfere with the study
