  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a progressive disease that decreases the pumping action of the heart. This
      may cause a backup of fluid in the heart and may result in heart beat changes. When there are
      changes in the heartbeat, sometimes a pacemaker is used to control the rate and rhythm of the
      heartbeat. In this trial, the researchers will test if pacing both the left and right lower
      half of the heart (ventricles) will:

        -  decrease the number of hospital and clinic visits due to heart failure symptoms

        -  extend life

        -  delay heart failure symptoms as compared to those who are paced in only one ventricle
           (the right ventricle)

    <measure>Mortality, Heart Failure-related Urgent Care Visits, or Significant Increase in Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume Index (LVESVI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed for the duration of the study, an average of 39.8 months post-randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Events include all-cause mortality, heart failure(HF)-related urgent care (a healthcare utilization visit involving intravenous(IV) therapy for heart failure) or significant increase(at least 15%) in LVESVI (a measure of the volume of a patient's left ventricle) from randomization to a later time point. Time from randomization until the subject experienced one of these events served as the outcome measure. LVESVI endpoints occurred primarily at those visits in which LVESVI measurements were required (6, 12, 18, 24 months). Because endpoints such as death or HF urgent care could occur at any time during follow-up, the subject's outcome measure could range from less than 1 month to 105 months (maximum follow-up duration). Primary endpoints and follow-up data occurring after a subject missed a required LVESVI measurement were excluded from the analysis and the table below. The counts reflect the number of subjects meeting each endpoint, and are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>All-Cause Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed for the duration of the study, an average of 39.8 months post-randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint is the time to death from any cause. The rate of mortality, as measure by the hazard rate, in each randomization arm will be compared.
This outcome includes all post-randomization deaths, whereas the reporting of the primary outcome excluded primary endpoints (including deaths) that occurred after the subject had missed a study-required echocardiogram (used to determine if the LVESVI primary endpoint was met).</description>

    <measure>All-Cause Mortality or Significant Increase in Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed for the duration of the study, an average of 39.8 months post-randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint will be the time from randomization to either death or a visit (6, 12, 18, 24 month or interim visit) in which the subject undergoes an echocardiogram and the measured left ventricular end systolic volume index (a measure of the size of the subject's left ventricle normalized over their body surface area) is at least 15% greater than the corresponding measured value at randomization.
Only LVESVI endpoints/deaths and follow-up data occurring before a subject missed an LVESVI measurement (due to missed visit, echo not performed, etc.) were used in the analysis and included in the table below. The counts reflect the number of subjects meeting each endpoint, and are not mutually exclusive.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint will be a subject's change in Quality of Life score from randomization to 6 months. The Quality of Life score at a time point is calculated using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, which consists of 21 questions each on a 6 point scale from 0 to 5. The 21 scores are added up and the final score, ranging from 0 (best) to 105 (worst) is the subject's quality of life score. For each subject the measure will be the randomization visit - 6 month difference in QOL score, with positive values denoting a reduction in score and improvement in Quality of Life.
Subjects with missing QOL scores at one or both time points were excluded from analysis, and so the number of subjects analyzed for this outcome was a subset of the number of randomized subjects.</description>

        <title>Mortality, Heart Failure-related Urgent Care Visits, or Significant Increase in Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume Index (LVESVI)</title>
        <description>Events include all-cause mortality, heart failure(HF)-related urgent care (a healthcare utilization visit involving intravenous(IV) therapy for heart failure) or significant increase(at least 15%) in LVESVI (a measure of the volume of a patient's left ventricle) from randomization to a later time point. Time from randomization until the subject experienced one of these events served as the outcome measure. LVESVI endpoints occurred primarily at those visits in which LVESVI measurements were required (6, 12, 18, 24 months). Because endpoints such as death or HF urgent care could occur at any time during follow-up, the subject's outcome measure could range from less than 1 month to 105 months (maximum follow-up duration). Primary endpoints and follow-up data occurring after a subject missed a required LVESVI measurement were excluded from the analysis and the table below. The counts reflect the number of subjects meeting each endpoint, and are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were followed for the duration of the study, an average of 39.8 months post-randomization.</time_frame>
        <population>Only randomized subjects in both device groups were included in the analysis of this endpoint, as the analysis was restricted to post-randomization data. Subjects in the &quot;No Implant Attempt&quot;, &quot;Unsuccessful Implants&quot;, &quot;CRT-P: Not Randomized&quot;, and &quot;CRT-D: Not Randomized&quot; subgroups were excluded.</population>

          <title>Mortality, Heart Failure-related Urgent Care Visits, or Significant Increase in Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume Index (LVESVI)</title>
          <description>Events include all-cause mortality, heart failure(HF)-related urgent care (a healthcare utilization visit involving intravenous(IV) therapy for heart failure) or significant increase(at least 15%) in LVESVI (a measure of the volume of a patient's left ventricle) from randomization to a later time point. Time from randomization until the subject experienced one of these events served as the outcome measure. LVESVI endpoints occurred primarily at those visits in which LVESVI measurements were required (6, 12, 18, 24 months). Because endpoints such as death or HF urgent care could occur at any time during follow-up, the subject's outcome measure could range from less than 1 month to 105 months (maximum follow-up duration). Primary endpoints and follow-up data occurring after a subject missed a required LVESVI measurement were excluded from the analysis and the table below. The counts reflect the number of subjects meeting each endpoint, and are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</description>
          <population>Only randomized subjects in both device groups were included in the analysis of this endpoint, as the analysis was restricted to post-randomization data. Subjects in the &quot;No Implant Attempt&quot;, &quot;Unsuccessful Implants&quot;, &quot;CRT-P: Not Randomized&quot;, and &quot;CRT-D: Not Randomized&quot; subgroups were excluded.</population>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life at 6 Months</title>
        <description>The endpoint will be a subject's change in Quality of Life score from randomization to 6 months. The Quality of Life score at a time point is calculated using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, which consists of 21 questions each on a 6 point scale from 0 to 5. The 21 scores are added up and the final score, ranging from 0 (best) to 105 (worst) is the subject's quality of life score. For each subject the measure will be the randomization visit - 6 month difference in QOL score, with positive values denoting a reduction in score and improvement in Quality of Life.
Subjects with missing QOL scores at one or both time points were excluded from analysis, and so the number of subjects analyzed for this outcome was a subset of the number of randomized subjects.</description>

          <title>Change in Quality of Life at 12 Months</title>
          <description>The endpoint will be a subject's change in Quality of Life score from randomization to 12 months. The Quality of Life score at a time point is calculated using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, which consists of 21 questions each on a 6 point scale from 0 to 5. The 21 scores are added up and the final score, ranging from 0 (best) to 105 (worst) is the subject's quality of life score. For each subject the measure will be the randomization visit - 12 month difference in QOL score, with positive values denoting a reduction in score and improvement in Quality of Life.
Subjects with missing QOL scores at one or both time points were excluded from analysis, and so the number of subjects analyzed for this outcome was a subset of the number of randomized subjects.</description>

        <description>Among subjects implanted with a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy with Defibrillation device (CRT-D) and randomized, the endpoint was the time from randomization until the subject experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. For each randomization arm, the number of CRT-D subjects who experienced at least one ventricular tachyarrhythmia post-randomization is reported, as well as the number of CRT-D subjects who did not experience one or more ventricular tachyarrhythmias post-randomization.</description>
