  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has long been recognized that co-morbidity associated with multiple metabolic syndrome,
      such as adverse body composition, insulin resistance and autonomic nervous system impairment,
      may lead to significant increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is unclear
      whether the co-morbidity evident in this population are due directly to their immobility or
      are the result of unfavorable changes in their underlying hormonal milieu. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the effect of testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal
      males on:

      body composition, i.e. lean tissue and fat mass, glucose tolerance, resting energy
      expenditure, autonomic-cardiovascular integrity, muscular strength, psychological assessment

      This study is 24 months in duration. Men who have consented to pre-screening serum
      testosterone draw and are found to have total testosterone levels averaging ≤ 11.3 nmol/l
      will start testosterone replacement therapy after a 6-month baseline period. Once treatment
      begins subjects will place a testosterone replacement patch (5 or 10 mg/day) on various sites
      of the body daily. Subjects will visit the lab after 2,6, 12, and 18 months of therapy for
      testing; however they will stop taking the patch at the 12 month visit. If needed, a steroid
      cream will be provided to the subjects should any skin irritations occur. If the patch causes
      persistent skin irritations, despite use of the steroid cream, then a testosterone gel may be
      used. Detailed instructions and precautions using the gel are outlined in the consent form
      and will be reviewed with the subject.

      Those men who have consented to pre-screening serum testosterone and are found to have normal
      levels of total testosterone (testosterone total ≥ 11.4 nmol/l) are eligible to participate
      as a control subject for the full 24-month period of the study. These subjects visit the lab
      at baseline (BL), 12 and 24 months for the same testing as those in the treatment group.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry assessment of lean tissue mass (LTM) at 12 months. Total body scans were performed and the energy level used for each total body scan was based on subject thickness (e. g., thin, standard, or thick). To analyze the results of each total body scan, proprietary software algorithms were used to segment the body into trunk, pelvis, and upper and lower extremities using the standard regions of interest. In accordance with International Society for Clinical Densitometry guidelines, total body scans were repeated on 30 spinal cord injury subjects by the &quot;on-and-off -the-table&quot; method (i. e., subjects were repositioned between scans) and our precision error was equal to 1.2 % for LTM.</description>

    <measure>Resting Energy Expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Resting Energy Expenditure was obtained by the measurement of exhaled air from fractions of mixed expired oxygen and carbon dioxide by a process known as indirect calorimetry. Data was collected under steady state conditions. Participants arrived at the laboratory for testing between the hours of 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, following a 12-h fast, with a minimum of 24 h free from any type of exercise.</description>

          <title>Resting Energy Expenditure</title>
          <description>Resting Energy Expenditure was obtained by the measurement of exhaled air from fractions of mixed expired oxygen and carbon dioxide by a process known as indirect calorimetry. Data was collected under steady state conditions and was adjusted to account for differences in total body lean tissue mass. Participants arrived at the laboratory for testing between the hours of 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, following a 12 hour fast, with a minimum of 24 hours free from any type of exercise.</description>

        <title>Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) Assessment of Lean Tissue Mass (LTM)</title>
        <description>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry assessment of lean tissue mass (LTM) at 12 months. Total body scans were performed and the energy level used for each total body scan was based on subject thickness (e. g., thin, standard, or thick). To analyze the results of each total body scan, proprietary software algorithms were used to segment the body into trunk, pelvis, and upper and lower extremities using the standard regions of interest. In accordance with International Society for Clinical Densitometry guidelines, total body scans were repeated on 30 spinal cord injury subjects by the “on-and-off -the-table” method (i. e., subjects were repositioned between scans) and our precision error was equal to 1.2 % for LTM.</description>
