  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tis study was designed to test the hypothesis that pretreatment with valdecoxib, prior to
      injury could reduce or prevent the development of secondary hyperalgesia around the area of
      primary injury. A heat/capsaicin model of induced hyperalgesia was tested in healthy
      volunteers in a randomized, double blind, cross-over trial of a single dose of 40 mg
      vadecoxib versus control. Subjects rated pain intesnsity and unpleasantness following heat
      stimulation of the forearm, the area of hyperalgesia was also mapped over the course of the
      experiment.
