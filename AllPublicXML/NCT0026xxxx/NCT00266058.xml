  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether taking certain anti-HIV medicines with
      certain antimalarial medicines affects the amount of the medicines in the blood.

      The study medicines that will be used are artemether/lumefantrine (antimalarial medication)
      and lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz (anti-HIV medications). Artemether/lumefantrine is not
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but is recommended as
      standard of care medical treatment for malaria in Africa and Asia. Lopinavir/ritonavir and
      efavirenz are approved by the FDA. Artemether/lumefantrine and lopinavir/ritonavir or
      efavirenz may need to be used together to treat children in Africa and Asia. We seek to learn
      about whether or not the use of these medicines together results in a change in blood levels
      of any of these medicines. The information obtained from this study will help doctors to
      provide a better treatment to children and adults with malaria and HIV.

    <description>participants receive a total of 6 doses of artemether(80mg)/lumefantrine(480mg)for baseline PK evaluation. This is followed by a 26-day course of either efavirenz(600mg) once daily or lopinavir/ritonavir (400mg/100mg) twice daily and additional 6 doses of artemether/lumefantrine to determine the pharmacokinetics of the antimalarial medications in the context of antiretrovirals. The participants undergo at least a 14 day washout period (between the last baseline PK blood draw and the initiation of antiretrovirals)</description>
