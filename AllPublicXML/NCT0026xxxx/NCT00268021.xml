  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Automated implantable cardioverter defibrillators ,AICD, and Biventricular,BiV, Pacemakers
      have been shown in randomized trials to offer an advantage in adults with decreased
      ventricular ejection fraction, heart failure, spontaneous non-sustained ventricular
      tachycardia VT, inducible non-suppressible VT and the combination of low ejection fraction
      and prior myocardial infarction,14. Pediatric patients with a variety of different heart
      abnormalities are at high risk for life threatening arrhythmias and poor ventricular function
      or heart failure,16. Therefore, extrapolating this adult data, AICDs and BiV pacemakers have
      been used with increasing frequency in the pediatric and congenital heart disease population.
      Improvements in device size and lead design allows AICD and BiV implantation in the very
      young, in small size patients and in patients with complex cardiac anomalies,1. The use of
      BiV pacemakers and the patterns of AICD discharge are similar in young patients and in
      adults, suggesting that the risk of life threatening arrhythmia and heart failure are also
      similar,16. However, this patient population behaves differently from the adult population in
      the incidence of pacemaker complications, circadian arrhythmias,7, and more importantly, a
      relatively high incidence of complications related to AICD insertion, 8. There is a need for
      more studies to establish the risk-benefit ratio of these devices in the pediatric setting.

      This is a retrospective review of all the patients that had an AICD or BiV pacemakers
      inserted at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, Emory University, between January
      1st, 1998 and July 30th, 2004. The goal of our study is to establish the prevalence of
      beneficial and adverse effects in the AICD and BiV patient population.

      Demographic, clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics during the hospitalization as
      well as at follow-up will be obtained from the medical records and are summarized in the
      following tables Note: We defined infection as elevated temperature above 38.1 C associated
      with elevated WBC and positive cultures.

      Appendix A

      We plan to collect the following demographic information. Age Weight Delivery method
      Gestational age Weight at birth Delivery complications Cardiac anomalies Other anomalies

      We plan to collect the following medical information/diagnoses. Indication Cardiac arrest
      Sustained ventricular tachycardia Inducible ventricular tachycardia Syncope Palpitations
      Severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Congenital heart disease Primary electrical disease
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy

      We will collect the following AICD information. Lead Transvenous Subcutaneous array
      Epicardial patches Generator type

      We will collect the following outcomes information (AICD and BiV). Variable Appropriate
      discharge (AICD only) Inappropriate discharge (AICD only) Lead failure Overall survival
      Hospital Length of Stay Infection Blood transfusion/bleeding Hospital Re-admission
      Mortality/Morbidity information Cause of inappropriate AICD discharge/shock Long term
      complications
