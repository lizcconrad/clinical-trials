  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that patient will success in benzodiazepine withdrawal if they get melatonin
      to solve sleep-problems which commonly occur during benzodiazepine withdrawal. Former heroin
      addicts, currently in Methadone maintenance treatment, who are also abusing benzodiazepine,
      started self benzodiazepine withdrawal, and got for 6 weeks melatonin (5mg/day, taken every
      night) or placebo and after 1 week, additional 6 weeks with placebo or melatonin (double
      blind for what got first).Success The benzodiazepine withdrawal success was evaluated by
      urine for benzodiazepines, and sleep quality was evaluated using PSQI questionnaire
      (baseline,and after weeks 6, 7, 13)

      A total of 100 patients will participate. Follow-up of benzodiazepines in urine after study
      and 6 months later will be evaluated, as well as sleep quality (using PSQI)
