  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial has two parts. The purpose of the first part of the trial is to determine the
      doses of 2 drugs, sunitinib malate and interferon alfa-2b, that can be given safely in
      combination. This part is currently closed to enrollment.

      The purpose of the second part of the trial is to see if sunitinib malate given on a 4/2
      schedule (4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off treatment cycle) is any better at delaying
      progression of renal cell cancer than sunitinib malate given on a continuous dosing schedule.
      The trial will also determine the number of patients whose cancer responds to the treatments,
      whether life of patients can be extended, what the side effects are of the treatments, how
      bothersome disease or treatment-related symptoms are to patients, and whether tests can be
      found that will predict which patients may or may not respond to these treatments in the
      future.

    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death due to any cause, assessed up to a maximum of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>MSKCC Prognostic Factor Model assessed as low(0),intermediate(1-2) or high(=&gt;3) based on number of criteria present such as Karnofsky performance status &lt; 80 %, Lactate dehydrogenase &gt; 1.5 * Upper limit of Normal,Hemoglobin &lt; lower limit of normal, serum calcium &gt; 10 mg/dL;Time from first diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma to start of systemic therapy of &lt; 1 year.TTP was time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer.TTP was calculated as (first event date minus date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 30.44.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death due to any cause, assessed up to a maximum of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR are defined as the disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non target). PR are those with atleast 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death due to any cause, assessed up to a maximum of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 30.44. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Assessed Using MSKCC Prognostic Factors Model</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death due to any cause, assessed up to a maximum of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>MSKCC Prognostic Factor Model assessed as low (0), intermediate (1-2) or high (=&gt;3) based upon number of criteria present. Criteria as follows: Karnofsky performance status &lt; 80 %, Lactate dehydrogenase &gt; 1.5 * Upper limit of Normal, Hemoglobin &lt; lower limit of normal for local lab, Corrected serum calcium &gt; 10 mg/dL; Time from first diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma to start of systemic therapy of &lt; 1 year. OS was defined as time from date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause. OS, in months, was calculated as (event date -start of treatment date + 1)/30.44.</description>

          <description>MSKCC Prognostic Factor Model assessed as low(0),intermediate(1-2) or high(=&gt;3) based on number of criteria present such as Karnofsky performance status &lt; 80 %, Lactate dehydrogenase &gt; 1.5 * Upper limit of Normal,Hemoglobin &lt; lower limit of normal, serum calcium &gt; 10 mg/dL;Time from first diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma to start of systemic therapy of &lt; 1 year.TTP was time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer.TTP was calculated as (first event date minus date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 30.44.</description>
