      This is an early feasibility trial designed to demonstrate whether a new ablation device can
      be used safely and effectively in treating atrial fibrillation.

      This study is a prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm, multi-center trial to be conducted at
      a single study site

      This study is intended to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of the RFMesh BAS
      for electrophysiological mapping and radiofrequency ablation in the region of the ostium of a
      targeted pulmonary vein in the treatment of drug refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are between 18 &amp; 85 years of age.

          2. Patients with a minimum of 2 episodes of symptomatic PAF within the last 6 months
             prior to baseline evaluation. At least one of these episodes must have been
             documented. Documentation may include electrocardiogram (ECG), trans telephonic
             monitoring (TTM), Holter monitoring (HM), or telemetry strip. Additional PAF episodes
             (i.e., verbal accounts from the patient) will be documented in the patient's study
             record.

          3. Patients who have failed at least 1 class I or class III anti-arrhythmic medication
             regimen.

          4. Patients with the ability to understand the requirements of the study, who have
             provided written informed consent and agreed to the study restrictions and to return
             for the required follow-up assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any previous ablation of the left atrium (surgical or catheter based).

          2. Permanent or persistent atrial fibrillation.

          3. Recent myocardial infarction within 2 months

          4. Currently unstable angina.

          5. Any cardiac surgery during the previous 3 months.

          6. Currently documented intracardiac thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

          7. A left atrium &gt; 50mm in major dimension.

          8. A common ostium larger than 25 mm in major axis or any individual pulmonary vein
             larger than 25 mm in major axis.

          9. Permanent leads in or through the right atrium.

         10. Clinically significant valvular heart disease or a replacement heart valve.

         11. Congestive heart failure (NYHA classification III or IV).

         12. An ejection fraction &lt;35%.

         13. A contraindication to warfarin.

         14. A contraindication to transseptal procedure.

         15. Any cerebral ischemic event, including any transient ischemic attack (TIA), in the
             preceding 6 months.

         16. Any known bleeding disorder.

         17. Women who are known to be pregnant or nursing.

         18. Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism.

         19. Patients currently enrolled in any other clinical investigation.

         20. Any other significant uncontrolled or unstable medical condition.

         21. A life expectancy of less than one year.

         22. Currently taking amiodarone or have taken amiodarone within 4 months prior to baseline
             evaluation.
