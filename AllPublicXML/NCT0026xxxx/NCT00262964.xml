  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of: 1) the pathogenesis
      and pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in obese subjects, and 2)
      the effect of marked weight loss on the histologic and metabolic abnormalities associated
      with NAFLD. The following hypotheses will be tested:

        1. obesity causes hepatic fat accumulation because of excessive fatty acid release from fat
           tissue and increased free fatty acid availability,

        2. increased hepatic (liver) fat content causes insulin-resistant glucose (sugar)
           production by the liver and altered liver protein synthesis,

        3. increased hepatic fat content causes increased lipid (fat) peroxidation, hepatic
           inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis, and

        4. marked weight loss improves NAFLD once patients are weight stable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which
      represents a spectrum of liver diseases. NAFLD is a major health problem in the US because of
      its high prevalence and causal relationship with serious liver abnormalities. However, the
      mechanism(s)responsible for developing NAFLD in obese persons and the effects on liver
      function are not known. This gap in knowledge has made it difficult to identify effective
      therapy. The results from these studies will lay the groundwork for the development of novel
      therapeutic interventions for NAFLD in obese patients.

    <measure>Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity Index (HISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline cross-sectional data</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatic insulin sensitivity, assessed as a function of glucose production rate and plasma insulin concentration. The Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity Index(HISI) is the reciprocal of glucose rate of appearance [10000/(μmol/min)] multiplied by insulin concentration[mU/L]. The 10000 in the formula is a conventional adjustment so that insulin sensitivity measures are more readable. As yet there is no normal range for HISI, since is a surrogate marker for hepatic insulin sensitivity that has not yet been validated.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>We screened 138 subjects. 80 would-be participants failed the screening. This was often due to not having Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. Other subjects were excluded due to use of various medications or the presence of some excluded disease such as type 2 diabetes. Of the 58 that passed screening 51 chose to enroll in the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity Index (HISI)</title>
        <description>Hepatic insulin sensitivity, assessed as a function of glucose production rate and plasma insulin concentration. The Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity Index(HISI) is the reciprocal of glucose rate of appearance [10000/(μmol/min)] multiplied by insulin concentration[mU/L]. The 10000 in the formula is a conventional adjustment so that insulin sensitivity measures are more readable. As yet there is no normal range for HISI, since is a surrogate marker for hepatic insulin sensitivity that has not yet been validated.</description>

        <description>Hepatic insulin sensitivity, assessed as a function of glucose production rate and plasma insulin concentration. The Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity Index (HISI) is measured as the reciprocal of glucose rate of appearance [10000/(μmol/min)] multiplied by insulin concentration[mU/L]. The 10000 in the formula is a conventional adjustment so that insulin sensitivity measures are more readable. As yet there is no normal range for HISI, since is a surrogate marker for hepatic insulin sensitivity that has not yet been validated.</description>
