      The goal of the study is to investigate, which of two antibiotic treatments - oral penicillin
      for 10 days or oral cefuroxim for 7 days - is more successful for patients (1-16 years of
      age) with perianal dermatitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.

      The goal of the study is to investigate, which of two antibiotic treatments - oral penicillin
      for 10 days or oral cefuroxim for 7 days - is more successful for patients (1-16 years of
      age) with perianal dermatitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS).
      Diagnosis is based on positive perianal culture for GABHS. Informed consent will be obtained.

      The study will be performed in the region of Basel, Switzerland, in private practices of
      pediatricians, general practitioners, and selected pediatric dermatologists as well as in the
      out-patient departments of the University Children's Hospital Basel and the department for
      dermatology of the University of Basel.

      Patients (or their parents) will fill in a daily diary on signs and symptoms of disease;
      furthermore, clinical investigations (inspection of the site of infection) will be performed
      on enrollment (Day 1), Day 3, and at the end of treatment (Day 10).
