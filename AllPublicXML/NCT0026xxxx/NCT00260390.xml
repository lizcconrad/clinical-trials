      Growing evidence supports the notion that Late-onset Dysthymic disorder in middle aged men
      may be associated with age-related HPG hypofunctioning. In this study we seek to examine the
      efficacy of Testosterone replacement for this condition.

      Hypothesis:

      Testosterone replacement will be more effective than placebo, in treating men with late onset
      Dysthymic Disorder and hypo-gonadism.
