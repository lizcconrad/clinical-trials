        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females 17 years of age or older.

          -  Stable cancer-related pain.

          -  Are receiving a stable, fixed-schedule oral opioid regimen equivalent to 60 to 1000 mg
             of oral morphine per day or transdermal fentanyl therapy equivalent to 50 to 300 Âµg/h,
             and are on a stable dose of opioid medication for relief of breakthrough pain.

          -  Experiencing 1-4 episodes of breakthrough pain per day.

          -  Meet the criteria defined in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance
             Status for Grade 0, 1, or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have previously been exposed to EN3267.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Have uncontrolled or rapidly escalating pain.

          -  Have any clinically significant condition that would, in the investigator's opinion,

          -  Are scheduled to receive anti-neoplastic therapy that, in the investigator's opinion,
             will influence assessment of breakthrough pain.

          -  Are scheduled to receive an investigational drug other than EN3267 during the course
             of the study.

          -  Have hypersensitivity, allergy or contraindication to fentanyl.

          -  Have significant prior history of substance abuse or alcohol abuse.

          -  Would have difficulty complying with the protocol, as assessed by the investigator.
