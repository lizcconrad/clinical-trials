  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-cadherin, a protein involved in blood vessel cell binding, is increased as cancer
      progresses, and is on the surface of many tumor cells. ADH-1 blocks N-cadherin. This study
      will test the safety and effects of ADH-1 in subjects with incurable, solid tumors with a
      protein biomarker called N-cadherin. This study will identify the amount of ADH-1 that
      subjects can tolerate.

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Male and female patients &gt; or = 18 years of age with a solid tumor(s) refractory to
             standard curative therapy or for which no curative therapy exists. Study currently
             enrolling only patients with non-small cell lung cancer or advanced ovarian cancer to
             the safety expansion phase.

          -  Clinically or radiologically documented measurable disease.

          -  Immunohistochemical evidence of N-cadherin expression (at least 1+ positive) in
             archived or fresh tumor tissue

          -  Adequate performance status and organ function, as evidenced by hematological and
             biochemical blood testing and electrocardiogram (ECG)

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Receipt of ADH-1 prior to this clinical study

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or any other investigational drug within 30 days before
             study entry

          -  History of primary brain tumors or brain metastases (known or suspected) unless any
             lesions have completely resolved following appropriate treatment and there has been no
             recurrence for at least 6 months. History of spinal cord compression. History of
             tumors that have shown clinically significant evidence of active bleeding (e.g., gross
             hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematuria, melena, or bleeding superficial tumor) within 12
             weeks before study entry.

          -  Stroke, major surgery, or other major tissue injury within 30 days before study entry

          -  History of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, angina, life threatening
             arrhythmias, significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, or known
             hypercoagulable states
