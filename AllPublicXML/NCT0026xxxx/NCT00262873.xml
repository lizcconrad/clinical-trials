      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib works in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndromes.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of reduced cytopenia, in patients with
           myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine changes in marrow blast percentage or karyotypic profile in patients treated
           with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

For leukemia colony forming units (CFU-Ls), the plating mixture was comparable with the exception that the cytokines utilized were 4 U/ml erythropoietin, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 100 ng/ml c-kit ligand, and 100 ng/ml Flt3 ligand. The methylcellulose mixture and associated reagents were purchased from Stem Cell Technologies (Vancouver, BC).

Five × 10(4) light density cell for granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit (CFU-GM) or erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-E) assays were plated in 0.9% methylcellulose, 30% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10−4 mol/L β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% BSA with 3U/ml human erythropoietin, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, and 50 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF) (c-kit ligand). For leukemia colony forming units (CFU-Ls), the plating mixture was comparable with the exception that the cytokines utilized were 4 U/ml erythropoietin, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 100 ng/ml c-kit ligand, and 100 ng/ml Flt3 ligand.

        <description>Colony forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors, erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E), and leukemia colony forming units (CFU-L) were measured at day 0 and day 14 of cycle 1. Five × 10(4) light density cell for granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit (CFU-GM) or erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-E) assays were plated in 0.9% methylcellulose, 30% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10−4 mol/L β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% BSA with 3U/ml human erythropoietin, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, and 50 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF) (c-kit ligand). For leukemia colony forming units (CFU-Ls), the plating mixture was comparable with the exception that the cytokines utilized were 4 U/ml erythropoietin, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 100 ng/ml c-kit ligand, and 100 ng/ml Flt3 ligand. The methylcellulose mixture and associated reagents were purchased from Stem Cell Technologies (Vancouver, BC). Colonies were scored at Day 14 and were defined as &gt; 20 grouped cells.</description>
