      This randomized, controlled trial is designed to test whether treatment of sleep disordered
      breathing (SDB) with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy alters the natural history of
      atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients with recent AF who are now in sinus rhythm, and found to
      have SDB (obstructive and/or central sleep apnea) by formal sleep study but without
      complaints of daytime sleepiness, are randomized to PAP therapy to eradicate SDB or to usual
      care (medical management as prescribed by the patient's cardiologist).

    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a common disorder which is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of
      cardiovascular disease. Observational data suggest that sleep apnea may play a role in the
      development of atrial fibrillation (AF), and may even predispose to recurrence of AF
      following electrical cardioversion (DCCV). Because of biases and confounders inherent to
      observational studies, we propose a randomized clinical trial to assess the effects of
      treatment of sleep apnea in subjects with AF treated with DCCV. Following polysomnography,
      subjects with sleep apnea will be randomized to positive airway pressure (PAP) or usual
      medical care and followed for up to one year to compare a primary outcome of AF recurrence
      rate.

    <measure>Mean Score on Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at Baseline and 12 Month Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a measure of general level of sleepiness. The ESS asks subjects to rate their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in 8 different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily live, although not necessarily every day. The questionnaire has 8 questions, with responses ranging from 0 (would never dose) to 3 (high chance of dozing). Therefore the total score could range from 0 (no sleepiness) to 24 (high chance of dozing).</description>

    <measure>Mean Score on Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FOSQ is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire to determine functional status in adults. The measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of everyday living. There are 30 items on the questionnaire consisting of 5 factor subscales. The subject rates the difficulty of performing a given activity on a 4-point scale (no difficulty to extreme difficulty). A higher score indicates greater difficulty or impact of sleepiness on daily living. FOSQ total score ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 120 (extreme difficulty).</description>

        <title>Mean Score on Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at Baseline and 12 Month Visit</title>
        <description>The ESS is a measure of general level of sleepiness. The ESS asks subjects to rate their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in 8 different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily live, although not necessarily every day. The questionnaire has 8 questions, with responses ranging from 0 (would never dose) to 3 (high chance of dozing). Therefore the total score could range from 0 (no sleepiness) to 24 (high chance of dozing).</description>

        <title>Mean Score on Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)</title>
        <description>The FOSQ is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire to determine functional status in adults. The measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of everyday living. There are 30 items on the questionnaire consisting of 5 factor subscales. The subject rates the difficulty of performing a given activity on a 4-point scale (no difficulty to extreme difficulty). A higher score indicates greater difficulty or impact of sleepiness on daily living. FOSQ total score ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 120 (extreme difficulty).</description>
