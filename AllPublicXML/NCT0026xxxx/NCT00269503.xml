  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is a major cause of disability in the United States. The lifetime prevalence of low
      back pain is estimated at 60-90%. Back pain has conservatively been estimated to involve
      total direct and indirect costs of over $25 billion annually in lost wages, treatment, and
      related issues. These losses clearly extend to the active duty population cared for by
      military health care facilities.

      Chiropractic medicine is characterized by the use of a number of physical manipulations and
      mobilization techniques, which can be used singly or in combination to treat a variety of
      medical conditions. Although basic clinical practice guidelines for Chiropractic have been
      developed, few studies have rigorously compared techniques and their outcomes for specific
      conditions. Fewer still have sought to correlate treatment modality with both anatomical
      effect and clinical outcome.

      Throughout the military, Chiropractic care is available only to active duty personnel and
      only at a limited number of medical treatment facilities. At National Naval Medical Center,
      it is a well-established treatment option, where the full array of techniques is employed,
      primarily for painful conditions, and most often for back pain. This study seeks to clarify
      the mechanisms of action and efficacy of one specific treatment option, prone distraction,
      for the relief of subacute sciatica due to radiographically confirmed herniated disc, and to
      compare it to side-posture manipulation and standard medical management.

      Prone lumbar distraction utilizes a specialized table with motorized continual motion
      distraction. This table has multiple mechanical articulations that can be used to place
      patients in a wide variety of positions. Patients being treated with continuous motion
      distraction are placed prone with the table positioned for maximum comfort and centralization
      of symptoms.

      Side posture manipulation is a widely practiced, standard chiropractic technique, which has
      been shown to provide considerable clinical improvement for patients with sciatica. Low-
      grade oscillatory stresses are performed within the physiological range of normal joint
      motion. The hip, pelvis and lumbar spine are rotated forward with manual pressure while a
      counter rotation of the chest and thoracic spine is applied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active Duty military personnel

          -  Aged 18-45 (age is limited to 45 years due to the natural aging and degeneration of
             the discs; the less hydration the disc maintain, the less likely manipulation will be
             successful).

          -  Have subacute low back pain (more than three months duration but less than six months
             duration), with radicular component (sciatica) rated at a minimum level of 4 on the
             Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of the Brief Pain Inventory

          -  Have a confirmed herniated disc, as noted on MRI, which correlates with the clinical
             findings (sciatica)

        In this study, a &quot;herniated disc&quot; refers to any localized displacement of disc material,
        including nucleus, cartilage, fragmented apophyseal bone, or fragmented anular tissue,
        which results in back and leg pain. &quot;Herniated Disc&quot; also will include disc extrusions and
        disc bulges (protrusions) only when with associated annular tears.

        In this study, &quot;sciatica&quot; refers to pain in the lower extremity/ies that follows the course
        of the sciatic nerve

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not able to give informed consent.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Patients who have a primary bone disease, cancer, infection, spondylolysis or
             spondylolisthesis.

          -  Patients who have had prior spine surgery, including rhizotomy

          -  Participation in another conflicting research study

          -  Patients who cannot commit to a trial lasting up to eight weeks or cannot come for
             bi-weekly treatments

          -  Patients who are going through a course of physical therapy or chiropractic treatment
             or at the time of planned enrollment or are being currently being managed and/or
             treated for any pain condition

          -  Patients who have an unstable medical or psychiatric condition

          -  Patients who are planning or have been advised to have spine surgery

          -  Any contraindications to either prone distraction or side posture manipulation will
             disqualify potential subjects from any participation in this study

          -  Patients with a pacemaker.
