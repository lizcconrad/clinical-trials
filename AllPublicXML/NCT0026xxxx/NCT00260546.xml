    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is a highly effective treatment option for patients
      with symptomatic heart failure and electrical intraventricular dyssynchrony, who are
      unresponsive to medical therapy. CRT has been shown to improve the quality of life in these
      patients and lately two studies had shown a mortality reduction with and without the adjunct
      of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Unfortunately, up to 25% of the CRT
      recipients do not show a symptomatic improvement after device implantation (&quot;non-responder&quot;).
      Because of possible intermittent tachycardiac intrinsic conduction, it remains difficult in
      numerous patients to assure a 100% biventricular stimulation as the prerequisite for a
      beneficial therapeutic effect. In a important study by Knight et al it could be shown that in
      a population of 440 CRT-patients, 36% did not have continuous biventricular stimulation. The
      main cause was the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias, in particular atrial fibrillation.
      The medical control of rapid ventricular conduction remains a difficult problem in heart
      failure patients. Furthermore it is unknown how many patients have good biventricular pacing
      under resting conditions but develop an improved AV-conduction with exercise. This can cause
      inhibition of ventricular stimulation or in many cases fusion beats. Conversely, an
      AV-interval programmed too short may have detrimental effects on diastolic filling times.

      The safest method to control the ventricular rate and prevent ventricular fusion beats with a
      normal AV time is the AV node ablation using radiofrequency ablation.

      The An Art Study investigates whether patients with an implanted CRT pacemaker or a CRT
      defibrillator will benefit from an AV-node-ablation using a combined symptomatic heart
      failure endpoint and duration of biventricular stimulation as compared to a CRT control
      group.
