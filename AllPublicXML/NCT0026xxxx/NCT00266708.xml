  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with kidney failure have underlying bone disease at the time of transplant.
      Fractures of various bones can be as high as 22%. Medication required for the transplant
      plays a role in bone loss.

      Bisphosphonates are used in the general population to treat bone loss of osteoporosis and
      steroid-induced bone loss. While previous studies, using various bisphosphonates, have shown
      preservation of bone mineral density in renal transplant recipients, we have demonstrated
      that pamidronate, a second generation bisphosphonate, is associated with low bone turnover
      while still preserving bone mineral density. Improved bone mineral density is associated with
      decreased fracture risk in the general population, while low bone turnover may be associated
      with increased fracture in dialysis patients.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether risedronate, a third generation
      bisphosphonate, is effective in preserving bone density when given prophylactically following
      renal transplantation and whether it is associated with low bone turnover at one year
      following renal transplantation.

      Participants who receive a living donor kidney transplant undergo a bone biopsy at the time
      of kidney transplant and after one year of protocol. Once adequate kidney function is
      established, both groups take by mouth a weekly capsule (the control group has a placebo; the
      treatment group has risedronate 35 mg). Both groups undergo baseline, 6 month and 12 month
      DEXA bone mineral density scans. Both groups undergo bone hormonal studies at regular
      intervals.
