  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of a new
      system for analyzing the electrocardiogram (ECG) to the sensitivity and specificity of a
      conservative treadmill test in asymptomatic subjects, classified by Framingham score as
      moderate to high risk. Subjects will perform a routine exercise test with the addition of
      another set of electrodes to record high resolution ECG. All subjects will perform a stress
      echocardiography. The result of the routine ECG analysis will be compared to the new system
      and to the echocardiography results.
