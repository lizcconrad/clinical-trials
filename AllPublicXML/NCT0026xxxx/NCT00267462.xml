  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the patients seen in our practice who are seen with
      Hypertrophic Myopathy diagnosis in order to better understand the presenting characteristics
      of their disease, the diagnostic testing to determine the diagnosis, the methods used to
      follow the disease progression and management practices used in caring for these patients.
      The objectives of this data review will be an analysis to determine if there is a methodology
      that will foster improved diagnostic speed and accuracy, and determine the best management
      practices based on outcomes in these patients.

      The charts of children followed at Sibley Heart Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta
      will be identified using the Mysis system and screening for the appropriate ICD-9 codes for
      the types of Hypertrophic Myopathy. These codes include: 425.1, 425.4, 425.7, 425.8, and
      425.9. Screening will also be done for known anomalies that are associated with hypertrophic
      myopathy as seen in some syndromes and metabolic disorders.

      Data Collection:

      Age at presentation (DOB) History – Prenatal, Family, Current Surgical Procedures Physical
      Exam results EKG interpretation CXR results Echocardiography results MRI Results Holter
      monitors results Exercise testing results Radionuclear study results Spiral CT Study results
      Genetics Testing results Medication usage Enzyme replacement therapy usage Diagnostic
      laboratory results

      Statistics:

      A generalized linear model will be performed. Significance will be defined at P≤ 0.05.

      Interim monitoring of accumulated data will be performed. One interim analysis will be
      performed after 3 months of accrual with additional analyses being performed at the end of
      data collection.

      Demographic data will be summarized for all subjects. For each patient summary statistics
      will include the mean, standard deviation, frequency distribution, minimum, maximum and
      range.
