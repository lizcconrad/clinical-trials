  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health promotion in schools aims to improve the health and well being of students by
      empowering them with the knowledge, skills and confidence to take responsibility for their
      own health. We incorporated a malaria component to an established peer health education
      programme in schools in The Gambia, and evaluated its impact on knowledge attitudes and
      practice (KAP) of school students and their families using a cluster randomized design. Since
      malaria is a particular problem among children under 5 and pregnant women, students were
      encouraged to explain what they learned to their families, and we sought to evaluate whether
      the malaria messages were taken up by the students' families. Evaluation endpoints are KAP in
      students, and KAP in women living in the school students' home compound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      12 communities in The Gambia, each including an upper basic and/or a senior secondary school,
      were pair-matched on urban/rural location and school type, and one community in each pair
      randomly selected to receive the peer-health education programme immediately or after a
      delay, to permit evaluation. The intervention programme comprised training of peer health
      educators, teacher coordinators, and members of drama troupes, in key malaria messages and
      principles of health education. The peer educators then conducted a rolling programme of
      presentations to children and youth in their own schools using drama, puppetry, small group
      and in-class presentations about malaria, as well as community outreach programs targeting
      out-of-school youth and the general public. In each school a systematic sample of 75 students
      were interviewed 10 weeks and 6 months after the start of the programme, and in each school
      catchment area a sample of 80 women were interviewed at the same time, and bednet use by
      children under 5 yrs in their care was recorded. From the interviews scores were derived for
      knowledge about malaria treatment and prevention and knowledge scores and net coverage in
      children compared between intervention and control schools.
