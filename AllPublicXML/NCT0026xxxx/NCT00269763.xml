    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the clinical utility and safety of fentanyl TTS (a
      transdermal patch delivering the narcotic pain reliever fentanyl) in the treatment of pain in
      patients with cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center trial to assess the safety and
      clinical utility of the fentanyl Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) for the treatment of
      pain in patients with cancer. Patients requiring narcotics for pain management are converted
      from conventional analgesics to oral morphine, and titrated to a stable dose prior to the
      initiation of fentanyl TTS. The stabilized morphine dose provides the basis for the
      calculation of the equi-analgesic dose of fentanyl TTS based on established analgesic potency
      ratios. Patients replace the fentanyl TTS patch every 3 days. Immediate-release morphine is
      available as rescue medication for breakthrough pain. The adequacy of analgesia, use of
      morphine rescue medication, and routine safety evaluations are obtained at scheduled
      intervals throughout the trial.
