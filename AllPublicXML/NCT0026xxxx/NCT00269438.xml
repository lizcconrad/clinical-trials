    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of a new tablet formulation
      and dosing regimen of balsalazide disodium dosed twice daily in achieving clinical
      improvement in subjects with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis after 8 weeks of
      therapy.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects that achieve clinical improvement
      and improvement in the rectal bleeding subscale of the MMDAI at the end of eight weeks of
      therapy, where clinical improvement is defined as a greater than or equal to 3 point
      improvement from baseline in the MMDAI.

      The secondary endpoints are as follows:

        1. The change from baseline over the duration of treatment in total MMDAI score and in the
           individual MMDAI subscales.

        2. The change from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 in total MMDAI score and in each
           individual MMDAI subscale (endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy at Weeks 2 and 8 only).

        3. The proportion of subjects with treatment failure, defined as withdrawal due to
           significant disease progression or lack of significant improvement, as determined by the
           Investigator.

        4. The proportion of subjects with mucosal healing at Weeks 2 and 8, where mucosal healing
           is defined as an endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy score of 0 or 1

        5. The proportion of subjects achieving complete remission at Week 2 and Week 8, where
           complete remission is defined as a MMDAI score of less than or equal to 1.

        6. The proportion of subjects with improvement from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 in
           total MMDAI score and in each individual MMDAI subscale (endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy at
           Weeks 2 and 8 only).

        7. Change from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 in diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and
           subjective sense of well being, as recorded in the subjects' diaries.

        8. The proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8, where
           clinical remission is defined as a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and a combined score
           of less than or equal to 2 for bowel frequency and physician assessment using the MMDAI.

        9. Time to clinical remission, where clinical remission is defined as in secondary endpoint
           number eight.

      Safety endpoints are as follows:

        -  incidence of treatment-emergent AEs grouped by body system and evaluated by treatment
           group;

        -  changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters at each treatment visit by
           treatment group; and

        -  changes from baseline in vital sign measurements at each treatment visit by treatment
           group.

        Females of Reproductive Potential:

        If a female subject becomes pregnant while on this study, the study drug will be
        discontinued immediately and the subject followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is
        known. If a pregnancy occurs, it will be reported in the same manner as an unexpected AE
        using the guidelines provided in Section 6.4.1.9.

        Premature Subject Discontinuation:

        A subject may be discontinued from the study for the following medical or administrative
        reasons:

          -  Occurrence of an AE, which in the judgment of the investigator suggests an
             unacceptable risk to the subject (The investigator will follow the subject until
             satisfactory resolution of the AE or the AE is determined to be stable);

          -  Development on-study of any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator or the
             study sponsor, places the subject at an unacceptable medical risk if he/she continues;

          -  Pregnancy;

          -  Subject request;

          -  Institution of additional medical (rescue) therapy for UC. The investigator may
             discontinue individual subjects from the study at any time. Subjects will be
             encouraged to complete the study; however they may voluntarily withdraw at any time.
             The investigator must provide written documentation of the reason for discontinuation
             on the CRF. Regardless of the reason for withdrawal, all subjects will be asked to
             undergo an end of therapy evaluation. Every attempt will be made to obtain all the end
             of study assessments, including all of the subscales of the MMDAI (i.e., bowel
             frequency, bleeding, physician's assessment, and endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy score).

        Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn will not be replaced under this protocol.
