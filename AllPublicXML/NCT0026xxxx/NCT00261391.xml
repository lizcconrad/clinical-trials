  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      3 patients were enrolled in each of 3 study cohorts. There three cohorts were given
      differing, incrementally larger doses of this phase I drug. The same safety measures are
      being obtained on all patients. Efficacy measures were individualized as enrolllees do not
      have the same underlying vascular anomaly. The study is structured to include a 24 month
      drug-phase and a 24 month follow-up phase. The study is now closed to enrollment.
