  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide analgesia is used routinely for the dental treatment of anxious or
      uncooperative pediatric patients. In many instances it is used alone without any supplemental
      oral premedication. A controversy exists among pediatric dentists and pediatric dental
      departments regarding the need to apply pre-procedural fasting (PF) or other limitations on
      children undergoing dental treatment with nitrous oxide alone.The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the association between PF and the frequency of vomiting in pediatric patients
      receiving dental treatment with nitrous oxide analgesia.

      Materials and methods The experimental protocol will be submitted for approved by the
      Institutional Human Subjects Ethics committee of Hadassah-Hebrew University School of Dental
      l Medicine. Informed consent will be obtained from all parents or legal guardians of
      participating subjects.

      Subjects All pediatric patients attending the graduate student pediatric dental clinic of the
      Department of Pediatric Dentistry at Hadassah Clinic in need of at least two restorative
      treatment sessions with the use of nitrous oxide will be included. All participants must be
      in good health (ASA I). Prior to one session subjects will be restricted and have a
      preprocedural fasting as per the following guidelines: All subjects will be without solids
      (including milk) for at least 4 hours prior to nitrous oxide administration and without clear
      liquids 2 hours before treatment. On the alternative session subjects will have no
      restrictions on their food or liquid intake.

      Evaluation

      A survey will be given to parents prior to treatment and information regarding the following
      will be gathered:

      Age, previous nitrous oxide experience, history of vomiting or nausea (motion sickness, foods
      etc), last mea: what and when? The resident administering treatment will record the
      following: Duration of inhalation administration, percentage of nitrous oxide and flow rate,
      steady or fluctuating, occurrence of vomiting during or immediately following treatment.

      Statistical analysis of data will determine the incidence of vomiting and if any significant
      differences between the two sessions exist.
