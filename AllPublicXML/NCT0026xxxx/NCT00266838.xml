  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The antineoplastic agent Docetaxel (Taxotere®) is approved for the treatment of patients with
      metastatic and locally advanced breast cancer and other malignancies. There are 2 frequently
      used schedules of treatment with Docetaxel. Docetaxel can be administered every 3 weeks or in
      a weekly regimen. The efficacy seems to be similar but the toxicity profile changes. In the
      standard 3-weekly Docetaxel regimen the dose-limiting side effect is myelosuppression, while
      in the weekly regimen there is only a mild myelosuppression. On the other hand, weekly
      Docetaxel has a side effect that is rare in the 3-weekly schedule: epiphora (= tearing eye)
      caused by dacryostenosis.

      The underlying mechanism of dacryostenosis induced by weekly Docetaxel is fibrosis of the
      lacrimal puncta and canaliculi. Docetaxel has been reported to be secreted in the lacrimal
      tears. Direct contact between Docetaxel containing tears and the epithelial lining causes
      chronic inflammation of the mucosa and ultimately fibrosis of the most narrow part of the
      lacrimal outflow system i.e. the lacrimal puncta and canaliculi.

      A surgical treatment is possible for dacryostenosis. In case of subtotal stenosis of the
      lacrimal canaliculi, silicone intubation of the canaliculi is performed in order to prevent
      further closure. In the case of complete stenosis, placement of a permanent pyrex glass tube
      of Jones is required.

      To our knowledge, there is no primary prevention for Docetaxel induced dacryostenosis.

      The rationale of this randomized double blind interventional study is to investigate the
      efficacy of corticosteroid versus artificial tears topical eye treatment in patients on a
      weekly Docetaxel regimen in prevention of dacryostenosis. The dacryotoxic agent Docetaxel in
      the lacrimal tears will be washed away by the repetitive use of eye drops. In addition, eye
      drops containing corticosteroids have an anti-inflammatory effect and may further prevent the
      formation of fibrosis.

      A new treatment protocol will be investigated. Two different commercially available eye drops
      will be compared: dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Maxidex®, Alcon) in one eye of the patient
      and artificial tears (Lacrystat®, Viatris) in the other eye of the same patient. The study
      period will start with topical eye treatment from day 1 of cycle 1 and will continue during
      the administration of chemotherapy, with a final analysis at 26 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer receiving weekly Docetaxel
             chemotherapy with rest weeks in between at regular time intervals. The timing of rest
             weeks between cycles is not restricted. Examples of allowed regimens are Docetaxel 36
             mg/m2 day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; day 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks; day 1, 8, 15, 21, 28, 35,
             42, 49 every 10 weeks. Dosing and rest weeks can be further modified depending on the
             clinical situation, but dose intensity should be at least 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks
             during the 9 week treatments for eligibility. Combination with other chemotherapy
             (such as capecitabine) is allowed.
