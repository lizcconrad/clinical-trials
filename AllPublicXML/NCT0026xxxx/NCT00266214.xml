      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of the lidocaine
      patch 5% compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe pain associated with carpal
      tunnel syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)as determined by electrodiagnostic testing and
      moderate to severe pain will be randomized to receive either the lidocaine patch 5% or
      placebo patch q24h. The total duration of the double-blind treatment phase of the study will
      be 8 weeks.

      At baseline and at periodic visits to the clinic, patients will perform pain and
      functionality assessments. Patients with bilateral CTS will identify the &quot;index&quot; wrist (i.e.,
      the more painful wrist), which will subsequently be the wrist used for all efficacy
      assessments throughout the study.

      Treatment Regimen and Route of Administration: Patients will apply one patch (either a
      lidocaine patch 5% or a matching placebo patch) to the volar aspect of each affected wrist
      once every 24 hours.

          -  Have confirmed diagnosis of CTS in one or both wrists. For patients with bilateral
             CTS, the most painful wrist will be identified as the &quot;index&quot; wrist, and will be the
             wrist used for all efficacy evaluations.

          -  Have clinical symptoms of pain, paresthesia, numbness and/or tingling in the
             distribution of the median nerve

          -  Have positive findings from electrodiagnostic tests using accepted criteria

          -  Have classification of the wrist(s) as &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;probable&quot; using the Katz Hand
             Diagram (Katz and Stirrat, 1990)

          -  Have worst daily pain intensity greater than 5 (0-10 scale) on approximately 75% of
             days over the previous 3 months; this criteria will be assessed at the screening visit
             only
