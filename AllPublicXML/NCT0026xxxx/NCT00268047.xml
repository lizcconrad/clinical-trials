  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical evidence reveals that some patients who undergo cardiac transplantation exhibit
      problems with pulmonary vascular resistance as well. In some studies, an increase in
      pulmonary vascular resistance has been used as an indicator for increased 3-day and 3-month
      mortality after heart transplantation2. In this study, the investigators would like to look
      at pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with a surgical history of the Fontan procedure
      followed by heart transplantation.

    <textblock>
      Children born with certain congenital heart diseases such as tricuspid atresia or single
      ventricle physiology normally undergo the Fontan procedure during their course of treatment.
      The Fontan procedure however is palliative and some of these children will eventually require
      heart transplantation. It has been shown in pre-clinical animal models that pulmonary
      vascular resistance actually increases after having the Fontan procedure however this has not
      been quantitated in the human population.1

      This is a retrospective chart review with the primary objective of examining Fontan patients
      with pulmonary vascular resistance and who have undergone heart transplantation. We will
      review 50 charts at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Egleston Hospital. Three other United
      States' sites are participating. All de-identified data will be forwarded to the Great Ormond
      Street Hospital in London, England for study analysis. In order to ascertain this objective,
      the following data will be collected.

        1. Diagnosis

        2. Surgical History

        3. Information from Pre-transplant evaluation

        4. Post-transplant hemodynamics

        5. Post-transplant catheterization results
