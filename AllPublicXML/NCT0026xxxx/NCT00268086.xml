    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the clinical and radiographic findings with
      constrictive pericarditis in the adult congenital population and determine the degree of
      right heart failure and dilation from pulmonary insufficiency in the presence of constrictive
      pericarditis

      The secondary aim is to elucidate ways to better diagnose constrictive pericarditis and
      elucidate ways to diagnose right heart failure in the presence of constrictive pericarditis.

      Constrictive pericarditis is a notoriously difficult diagnosis to reach. There are no signs,
      symptoms or pathognomonic diagnostic tests for pericardial constriction. In the adult
      congenital patients, it is also difficult. In addition, with pulmonary insufficiency,
      constrictive pericarditis may mask the findings of progressive right sided ventricular
      dilation and heart failure.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the clinical and radiographic findings with
      constrictive pericarditis in the adult congenital population and determine the degree of
      right heart failure and dilation from pulmonary insufficiency in the presence of constrictive
      pericarditis

      The secondary aim is to elucidate ways to better diagnose constrictive pericarditis and
      elucidate ways to diagnose right heart failure in the presence of constrictive pericarditis.
