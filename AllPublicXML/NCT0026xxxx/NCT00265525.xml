  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial (RCT) is planned to evaluate a web-based intervention (CardioFit)
      against usual care in increasing physical activity levels in patients with Coronary Artery
      Disease (CAD). We hypothesize that compared to usual care, participants in CardioFit will; a)
      have increased physical activity levels, b) will have a higher health-related quality of life
      at measurement dates and, c) will have greater improvements in psychosocial predictors.

    <textblock>
      Most existing cardiac rehabilitation programs have little ability to expand participation
      using traditional delivery models that emphasize supervised, facility-based programs.
      Futhermore, facility based programs to promote physical activity behavior in patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD) are limited in their impact because most patients are unwilling
      to travel more than 30-40 minutes to participate in a program. CardioFit is an off-site, 26
      week web-based physical activity coaching service for people with heart disease. Within the
      CardioFit program, patients will be assigned to an on-line &quot;coach&quot; and receive customized
      exercise programs based on their medical history, personal goals and preferences. A
      randomized control trial (RCT) is planned to evaluate the effectiveness of the web-based
      intervention at increasing physical activity levels against usual care in patients with CAD.

      This study is in the third phase of a three-phase research program to examine interventions
      to promote physical activity for the secondary prevention of Cardiovascular disease.

    <description>CardioFit is a 26-week tailored web-based physical activity coaching service for individuals with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). It has been designed to help patients develop personalized exercise programs based on their medical history, personal goals and preferences. Access to Cardio-fit is through a secured website. The cardio-fit website contains physical activity advice and heart health educational information. Each patient is assigned an on-line coach, whose role is to assist in creating safe an effective physical activity program, and to answer any questions that patients may have throughout the program.</description>
