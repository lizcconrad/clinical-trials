    <textblock>
      The major aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of a home-based treadmill walking
      program in improving walking capacity and quality of life in people with early mid-stage
      Parkinson's disease(PD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common degenerative
      neurological condition suffered by Australians, with more than 30,000 Australians having PD
      at any one time (Parkinson's Australia). Hypokinesia, ie, reduced speed and amplitude of
      movement, is a major impairment of motor control affecting walking in people with PD. Over
      time, the development of slow, shuffling walking contributes to loss of independence and
      falls, with devastating consequences for individuals with PD and their families(Ashburn et
      al, 2001, Playfer 2001). Any decrease or delay in disability will reduce the personal and
      financial costs to individuals with PD, their families, health care resources and the
      community.

      A number of previous studies suggest exercise capacity and exercise habits are positively
      correlated. In people with mild Parkinson's disease (Canning et al 2005), walking capacity,
      measured as distance walked in the 6-min walk test, correlated with the amount of walking
      (r=.64, p&lt;0.01) performed each week. Similarly, in an earlier study of people with mild to
      moderate Parkinson's disease, regular exercise was associated with better exercise capacity
      (Canning et al 1997). It appears, therefore, that proactive intervention aimed at developing
      good exercise habits in sedentary individuals with early to mid-stage Parkinson's disease has
      the potential to reduce or delay walking difficulties.

      This study aims to establish the efficacy of a home-based treadmill walking program in
      providing an early intervention which addresses the primary motor control impairment of
      hypokinesia, while at the same time maintaining or improving exercise capacity.
