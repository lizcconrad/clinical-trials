  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive, largely chemo-resistant disease with a poor prognosis.
      EGFR and VEGF are both overexpressed in pancreatic cancers and thought to contribute to
      tumour development and progression. The combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine has
      recently been shown to be effective in advanced pancreatic cancer. The combination of
      gemcitabine plus erlotinib has also been shown to be effective in advanced pancreatic cancer.
      The aim of this study is to assess whether combining a chemotherapy doublet (gemcitabine plus
      capecitabine) and a biologic doublet (erlotinib plus bevacizumab) is a safe and effective way
      to treat advanced pancreatic cancer by targeting multiple tumour stimulating mechanisms
      simultaneously.

      To establish the safety and efficacy of a combination of four drugs (capecitabine,
      gemcitabine, erlotinib and bevacizumab) in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study will be divided into two parts:

      Part A (Phase I ): Is to establish the optimal dose of capecitabine for combination with
      gemcitabine, bevacizumab and erlotinib. This part of the study is necessary in order to
      characterise any increased side effects that may occur as a result of this combination of
      drugs. The dose of capecitabine will be increased in cohorts containing 3 to 6
      patients(according to standard dose escalation study design) whilst side effects are closely
      monitored. The doses of the other three drugs will remain fixed during this period:

        -  Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2 Days 1, 8, 15

        -  Bevacizumab: 5 mg/kg every two weeks iv

        -  Erlotinib: 100 mg/day orally

      Maximum tolerated dose is the dose at which 2 out of a cohort of three to six patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity within the first cycle (28 days) of treatment. The
      recommended dose for further evaluation will be one dose level below this.

      Part B (Phase II): Once a recommended dose of capecitabine has been chosen, this will be used
      for the remainder of the trial to further characterise the efficacy and safety of the drug
      combination in this group of patients.
