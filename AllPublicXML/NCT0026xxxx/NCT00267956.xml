  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor the patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), parallel-group
      (each group of patients will be treated at the same time), multicenter study to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of CNTO 1275 compared to placebo in the treatment of patients with
      active psoriatic arthritis. Patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups (CNTO 1275 63 mg and placebo). Patients will be randomly assigned to receive study
      medication up to Week 12 and will be followed through Week 36 to monitor safety and efficacy.
      Patients randomly assigned to placebo will crossover to receive CNTO 1275 63 mg at Weeks 12
      and 16. Patients randomly assigned to CNTO 1275 will receive placebo at Weeks 12 and 16 to
      maintain the blind. The duration of participation for an individual patient in the study will
      be up to 36 weeks.

    <description>ACR 20 response is an improvement of greater than or equal to 20 percentage in both tender and swollen joint count and in 3 to 5 assessments (patient's assessment of pain visual analog scale [VAS] with 0, no pain to 10, worst pain; patient's and physician's global assessment of disease activity VAS scales: overall disease activity [0, very well to 10, very poor and 0, no arthritis activity to 10, extremely active, respectively]; Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]: 20-questions on life activities [0, no difficulty to 3, inability to perform a task]; C-reactive protein[CRP]).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ is a 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area based on the worst score from the questions that pertain to that task. The HAQ score is determined by the average of the 8 scores.</description>

    <description>Number of participants achieving greater than or equal to 75 perccentage mprovement PASI at Week 12. PASI is widely used tool for the measurement of severity of psoriasis. This is a test of how bad person's psoriasis is. The combine redness, scaling, and thickness, as well as overall body involvement determine the PASI score. The scale ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst).</description>

    <description>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) from baseline at Week 12. The DLQI is a 10 item questionnaire, is designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant's quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The score ranges from 0 (better quality of life) to 30 (worse quality of life).</description>
