      Hypothesis: Early use of oral metoclopramide can hasten and improve the establishment of
      lactogenesis II in mothers after preterm and term deliveries.

      The study hopes to show that metoclopramide can be effective to establish and sustain
      Lactogenesis II for both preterm and term infants.

      Hypothesis:

      Early Use of oral metoclopramide can hasten and improve the establishment of lactogenesis II
      in mothers after preterm and term deliveries.

      Metoclopramide(Maxolon) promotes lactation by antagonizing the release of dopamine in the
      central nervous system, thereby increasing prolactin levels, and thus inducing or augmenting
      breast milk levels. While Metoclopramide has commonly been used to augment breast milk
      production and relactation, its efficacy in helping to establish lactogenesis II has never
      been studied in a controlled clinical trial. If effective, it may become a valuable tool in
      aiding the successful establishment of breastfeeding, particularly in high risk groups such
      as mothers of preterm babies.

      If shown to be an effective galactogogue, the use of metoclopramide provides an inexpensive
      and safe means of establishing and sustaining lactogenesis II, indirectly improving the
      degree and duration of breastfeeding practiced by mothers of both term and preterm infants.

      The anticipated benefits are expected to be greatest for preterm infants and their mothers.
