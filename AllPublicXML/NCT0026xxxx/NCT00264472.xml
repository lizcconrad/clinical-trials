  <brief_title>A Study of 5 Fluorouracil and the Anti-Tumor Activity of ADH300004 and 5 Fluorouracil in Subjects With Incurable Solid Tumors</brief_title>
  <official_title>A 2-Part Phase 1 Study Evaluating the Safety and Anti-Tumor Activity of ADH300004 (Eniluracil) Administered With 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), and the Pharmacokinetics of 5-FU Given as: 5.0 mg ADH300004 With Escalating Doses of 5-FU Administered Orally 3 Weeks Out of 4 in Subjects With Refractory Solid Tumors (Part 1); or 5.0 mg ADH300004 With 5 FU Administered Orally as a Split Dose for 3 Weeks Out of 4 in Subjects With Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Gastric Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Prostate Cancer, or Breast Cancer (Part 2) (Adherex Protocol Number AHX-03-104)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      5 fluorouracil (5 FU), one of the most actively investigated anti-cancer drugs, is rapidly
      inactivated by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). ADH300004 blocks DPD. This
      study will test the safety and effects of oral ADH300004 14 hours prior to oral 5 FU in
      subjects with refractory solid tumors.
