  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have a slow heart beat, or whose heart does not beat on its own, may be in need of
      an electronic device called a pacemaker. A pacemaker is implanted surgically just under the
      skin in the upper chest area. This device helps the heart beat at a regular rhythm by sending
      electrical signals (pacing) directly to the heart tissue through flexible wires called leads.
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the SelectSecure (Model 3830) lead is safe
      and effective for both sensing the heartâ€™s natural rhythm and pacing the heart when it does
      not beat on its own. This lead will be studied in both the right atrium and right ventricle.
      A previously market approved Medtronic lead model will serve as a comparison to prove the
      safety and effectiveness of the SelectSecure Model.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who are in need of a pacemaker that paces in both the right atrium and ventricle.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who are in need of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).

        Subjects who have a mechanical or diseased tricuspid valve (a structure in the heart,
        located between the right atrium and right ventricle, which allows blood to flow from the
        atrium to the ventricle).
