      After exposure to the C-POL intervention: 1) unprotected vaginal or anal sex, sex with casual
      partners, concurrent sexual relationships, and exchange of sex for drugs or money will
      decrease significantly; 2) perceived syphilis-risk for self and peer group, knowledge about
      highly relevant risk-factors, information sources and resources will increase significantly;
      and 3) syphilis morbidity will decrease significantly in the intervention community as
      compared to the comparison community.

      The C-POL in Texas project is and intervention study which sought to impact the health
      behaviors of community residents who live in zip codes that have high syphilis morbidity. The
      study is being implemented in Texas (Dallas and Houston) with residents of a housing
      developing and the surrounding community.

      The intervention model used for this study is the Popular Opinion Leader (POL) model, which
      is effective at reducing new HIV infections. The intent of this study was to determine the
      effectiveness of a diffusion model (e.g. POL) at reducing syphilis infections in affected
      communities.

      For the intervention, community members identified as popular opinion leaders were recruited
      and trained to share accurate information about syphilis transmission, symptoms, testing,
      treatment and prevention. Prior to intervention implementation and several times after,
      community members were given a survey and screened for syphilis as well as 2-3 additional
      STDs. During each assessment, cross-sections of the community members were sampled.
