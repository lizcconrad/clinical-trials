  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous work in our laboratory, and many others, has shown that body weight is regulated.
      When anyone, fat or thin, tries to maintain a reduced body weight, many systems affecting
      energy balance (skeletal muscle, neuroendocrine, and autonomic systems) conspire to slow
      metabolic rate thus favoring the regain of lost weight. Individuals with leptin deficiency
      are remarkably similar to weight-reduced individuals. Their metabolism, thyroid hormones, and
      sympathetic nervous system activity are all low despite their obesity. While administration
      of leptin to leptin-deficient humans results in substantial weight loss and increases in
      energy expenditure. However, leptin administration to leptin-sufficient humans at usual body
      weight has little or no effect on weight unless given in doses 10-20 times what would be
      considered to be in the normal physiological range. This study examines the hypothesis that
      leptin is &quot;read&quot; by various systems regulating energy balance as an indicator of how much
      energy we have stored and that the body perceives the weight-reduced state as a condition of
      relative leptin insufficiency. Within this model, restoration of leptin to levels present
      prior to weight loss should relieve much of the metabolic opposition to keeping weight off.
      Preliminary studies support this hypothesis.

      Healthy lean and overweight subjects are admiited to the General Clinical Research Center at
      Columbia University Medical College and placed on a liquid formula diet. Calories are
      adjusted until weight is stable and then subjects undergo testing of neuroendocrine,
      autonomic, and metabolic function. All subjects undergo an in-patient 10% weight reduction.
      Subjects are studied in a single blind placebo control design in which they are studied at
      usual weight and while maintaining a 10% reduced weight. At either usual weight or reduced
      state subjects undergo a single blind crossover placebo/control study in which they receive
      placebo,lepin injections while on an isocaloric diet either at usual weight or following a
      10% weight loss. Leptin injections are given in doses that restored 8AM circulating leptin
      concentrations to those present at initial body weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The failure of obesity treatments to sustain weight reduction is widely recognized. The
      central hypotheses of these studies are that: 1.) Energy and neuroendocrine homeostastic
      systems are altered during the maintenance of a reduced body weight in a manner that favors
      weight regain; 2.) These changes occur because weight-reduced individuals are in a state of
      relative leptin deficiency due to loss of body fat; and 3.) Therefore these changes
      accompanying the maintenance of a reduced body weight will be reversed if circulating leptin
      concentrations are restored to those that were present prior to weight reduction..
      Maintenance of a reduced body weight is associated with integrated autonomic and
      neuroendocrine changes that reduce energy expenditure and increase food intake in a manner
      that is similar to that seen in rodents and humans who are deficient in, or resistant to, the
      adipocyte-derived hormone leptin. Systemic leptin administration to leptin-deficient rodents
      and humans reverses the metabolic (hypometabolism, hyperphagia), autonomic (increased
      parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic nervous system tone), and neuroendocrine (increased
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, decreased hypothalamic-pituitary -thyroidal and
      -gonadal axis activity) changes that characterize the leptin-deficient state. The proposed
      studies focus on the neuroendocrine, autonomic, and metabolic changes that characterize the
      reduced-obese individual, and the effects on these phenotypes of restoration of circulating
      concentrations of leptin to levels present prior to weight loss. Healthy lean and overweight
      subjects are admiited to the General Clinical Research Center at Columbia University Medical
      College and placed on a liquid formula diet. Calories are adjusted until weight is stable and
      then subjects undergo testing of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and metabolic function. All
      subjects undergo an in-patient 10% weight reduction. Subjects are studied in a single blind
      placebo control design in which they are studied at usual weight and while maintaining a 10%
      reduced weight. At either usual weight or reduced state subjects undergo a single blind
      crossover placebo/control study in which they receive placebo,lepin injections while on an
      isocaloric diet either at usual weight or following a 10% weight loss. Leptin injections are
      given in doses that restored 8AM circulating leptin concentrations to those present at
      initial body weight. During each of these study periods, subjects will undergo detailed
      evaluation of 1.) energy expenditure (11 day differential excretion of heavy isotopes of
      water, indirect calorimetry for resting energy expenditure, non-resting energy expenditure,
      and thermic effect of feeding, time spent in physical activity); 2.) autonomic nervous system
      tone (serial blockade of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs, heart rate variability
      analyses, and urinary catecholamine excretion); 3.) hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, -adrenal
      and -gonadal, axis function; 4.) adipose tissue gene expression; 5.) other molecules (e.g.,
      adiponectin, ghrelin, PYY) that may influence neuroendocrine and metabolic function. We
      predict that leptin administration will reverse the metabolic, autonomic, and neuroendocrine
      phenotypes characterizing the weight-reduced state. The results of these studies will further
      delineate the physiology of body weight regulation and of leptin.
