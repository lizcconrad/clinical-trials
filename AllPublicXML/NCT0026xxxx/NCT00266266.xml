  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HPV DNA testing by a clinician has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting cervical
      disease. Can we prove that HPV self-testing will be sufficiently sensitive to detect disease
      in high risk population who for various reasons would not have routine pap smear screening?

      Women between the ages of 18 years to post-menopausal with documented abnormal pap smear
      atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and higher will be enrolled into the
      study. Patients will be taught how to collect vaginal samples with dacron swab and vaginal
      tampons by means of instructional video and manufacturer's instruction guide respectively.
      Physicians will perform pap smear and colposcopy. All samples will be sent to the University
      of Louisville lab for processing for HPV DNA detection by Hybrid capture 2 method.

    <time_frame>Patient will self-test immediately prior to their standard physician papsmear</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the concordance of HPV DNA self-testing device to detect disease in patients with abnormal Pap smear. Patients with a positive HPV Self-test by vaginal swab or vaginal tampon will be compared to the physician test results for concordance. Following patient self-sample collection, physician will collect cervical samples using a spatula. A self testing device which patients can use at their convenience will be beneficial in decreasing the incidence of cervical cancer in Kentucky.</description>
