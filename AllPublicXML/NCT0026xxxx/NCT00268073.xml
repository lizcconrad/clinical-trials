    <textblock>
      The records of all the patients that underwent the Norwood-Sano operation at Childrenâ€™s
      Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2004 will be
      investigated. These patients will be compared with an equal number of consecutive cases
      treated by classic Norwood stage I operation in order to determine the incidence of
      neo-aortic valve insufficiency and the clinical outcome of these patients.

    <textblock>
      Neoaortic valve insufficiency after Norwood type palliation of single ventricle patients has
      not been well studied. Patients with mild insufficiency tolerate it well; moderate to severe
      insufficiency however is poorly tolerated and can result in the death of the patient or at
      least require re-operation. Re-operation for neo-aortic insufficiency in this small size
      child is a difficult operation and the operative options are very limited. The introduction
      of the Sano modification of the Norwood procedure introduced a new set of variables due to
      the presence of a ventricular incision and possible distortion of the neo-aortic valve. It is
      therefore critical to determine the incidence of neo-aortic insufficiency and compare it to
      the standard Norwood operation, as well as to determine the clinical consequences of the
      presence of this phenomenon immediately postoperatively as well as long-term, up to
      completion of the stage II of the Norwood procedure (Glenn stage).
