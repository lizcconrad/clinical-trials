  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study endpoint -SoftScan adjunctive accuracy- will be used to test the hypothesis
      that the adjunctive combination of the SoftScan with x-ray mammography provides diagnostic
      accuracy that is significantly better than x-ray mammography alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, serially-recruited, blinded and unblinded, validation study to test that the
      adjunctive combination of the SoftScan with x-ray mammography provides diagnostic accuracy
      that is significantly better than x-ray mammography alone. Healthy volunteers and patients
      scheduled for tissue biopsy/excision of a suspicious breast lesion will be enrolled. Reader
      Studies will be performed in which interpreting investigators will perform blinded
      mammography interpretations, and reinterpretations of mammography and SoftScan
      interpretations. Diagnostic accuracy will be calculated using tissue histopathology as the
      reference standard.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Women between the ages of 20 and 80 years of age, who are either healthy or who are
        scheduled to undergo a tissue biopsy of surgical excision of a suspicious breast lesion for
        histopathologic diagnosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For the Healthy Volunteers Population,

          -  subjects with a history of minor breast procedures involving either breast;

          -  subjects with a history of major breast procedures involving either breast;

          -  subjects with a history of significant acute breast abnormalities involving either
             breast; and

          -  subjects with a history of significant chronic breast abnormalities involving either
             breast; and

        For Referred For Biopsy Population,

          -  subjects with a history of minor breast procedures involving either breast that were
             performed within 6 months prior to enrollment or which have not completed active
             healing at the time of enrollment;

          -  subjects with a history of major breast procedures involving either breast;

          -  subjects with a history of significant acute breast abnormalities involving either
             breast which have not completed active healing or resolution within 6 months prior to
             enrollment; and

          -  subjects with a history of significant chronic breast abnormalities involving either
             breast.
