      Design: Single-centre

      Indication: Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum Objectives: To determine and compare the
      efficacy of AQ treatment in young children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the rural
      and the urban study area of the Centre de Recherche en Santé de Nouna (CRSN).

      Population: Children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria (axillary
      temperature ≥ 37.5°C + ≥ 2.000 P. falciparum asexual parasites per µl blood) from the health
      centre situated in the villages of Bagala, Bourasso and Kemena and from Nouna town hospital
      outpatient department.

      Sample size: N=120

      Treatment: All children will receive a total dose of 25 mg/kg oral AQ over a period of three
      days (first and second day: 10mg/kg, third day: 5mg/kg).

      Statistical procedures: The primary analysis parameter is the proportion of clinical failures
      on day 14. Secondary parameters are the rate of clinical failures on day 28 (with and without
      PCR correction), the rate of early clinical failures, the rate of late parasitological
      failures (day 14 and day 28), and the rate of adverse events. Data will be analysed in the
      overall group of study children and for rural (n=50) and urban (n=50) study children
      separately.

      Study duration and dates: The study will be implemented in September-December 2005.
