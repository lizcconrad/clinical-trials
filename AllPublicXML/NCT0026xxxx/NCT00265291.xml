      Our goal is to study pharmacogenetics in Mexican-Americans, using depression treatments as a
      proof of the concept that pharmacogenetic approaches can be used to optimize treatment
      strategies for common and complex disorders in this population.

      This is a single site, 8-week, double-blinded, placebo lead-in trial with fluoxetine or
      desipramine. All subjects have a comprehensive psychiatric and medical assessment, and if
      enrolled, continued with two consecutive phases of the study: 1) A one-week, single-blind
      placebo lead-in phase to eliminate placebo responders. 2) Subsequent random assignment to one
      of two treatment groups: fluoxetine 10-40 mg/day or desipramine 50-200 mg/day. Given the
      proven efficacy of these antidepressant medications, a placebo lead-in period followed by
      active treatment for all patients has been utilized in order to minimize human subjects at
      risk.

        Inclusion Criteria: 1) At least 3 out of 4 grandparents born in Mexico [12]. 2) DSM-IV
        diagnosis of current, unipolar major depressive episode [13]. 3) 21-Item Hamilton
        Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) [14] score of 18 or greater with item #1 (depressed mood)
        rated 2 or greater. 4) Age between 18-70 years.

        Exclusion Criteria: 1) Any axis I disorder other than major depressive disorder (e.g.
        dementia, psychotic illness, bipolar disorder, adjustment disorder) or primary anxiety
        disorders. 2) Active medical illnesses that could be related to the ongoing depression
        (e.g. untreated hypothyroidism, recent myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident
        within the past six months, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes). 3) Current suicidal
        ideation with a plan and strong intent, or recent serious suicide attempt. 4) Pregnant or
        lactating women, or women of childbearing age not using contraception. 5) History of
        electroconvulsive therapy in the last six months. 6) Current use of medications with
        central nervous system activity which interfere with EEG activity (e.g. benzodiazepines) or
        any other antidepressant treatment within the 2 weeks prior to enrollment. 7) History of
        poor response to therapeutic treatment with desipramine or fluoxetine. 8) Illicit drug use
        and/or alcohol abuse in the last three months. 9) Current enrollment in counseling or
