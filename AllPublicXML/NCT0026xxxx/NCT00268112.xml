  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous resynchronization of dyskinetic segments of the left ventricle occurs after
      coronary bypass surgery in adults and has been shown in some children. It is, however,
      unknown what degree of dyskinesis is likely to be reversible in infants with ischemia from
      anomalous coronary arteries and what criteria would indicate that a resynchronization
      strategy of biventricular pacing might be needed.

      These questions need data from quantitative serial tissue Doppler observations of patients
      from pre-operative to late post-operative follow-up.

      We have previously studied, at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Egleston Hospital, 2
      patients with ALCAPA and one other patient is currently enrolled in a prospective study after
      recent surgery, also at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. We propose to study these 3
      patients with this rare defect concurrently with their routine echocardiographic evaluations.
      Data will then be taken off-line for analysis.

      Standard deviations of times to peak contraction velocity will be assessed for twelve cardiac
      segments. These will be reevaluated at follow up intervals after surgery on previously
      obtained echocardiograms. Those subjects in whom improvement of cardiac function, Left
      Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and mitral regurgitation is seen will be compared to
      those in whom no improvement occurs.
