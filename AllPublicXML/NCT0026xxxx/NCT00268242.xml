      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and mitoxantrone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with
      mitoxantrone works in treating patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response (CR) rate (CR and incomplete blood count recovery (CRi))
           of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse treated with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride and mitoxantrone hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate disease free and overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in
           first relapse treated with this particular chemotherapy regimen.

        -  Assess hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity associated with this regimen.

        -  Assess laboratory correlates of drug resistance in patients with relapsed acute myeloid
           leukemia.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients receiving subsequent bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 12 hours on day 1 and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 2, and 3. After completion of a single course
      of therapy, patients who achieve a complete response may receive 1 additional course of
      therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

  <why_stopped>
    If &lt;/= 5 of the initial 18 patients had a CR, the study would be stopped. Only 5 patients (21%)
    of 24 enrolled patients had a CR so the study was terminated.

    <description>Assumptions/ hypothesis: A Complete Response (CR) rate of 30% or less is unacceptable, and 50% or more is promising. A two-stage design will be used. Initially, 18 patients will be enrolled. If 5 or fewer achieve CR, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, an additional 22 patients will be accrued. Accrual was not halted while follow-up of the first 18 evaluable patients was under way. Therefore, 24 patients were enrolled. Four weeks is anticipated for observation for response. Only 5 patients (21%) achieved a CR and therefore, the study was terminated. Since response was assessed using the International Working Group criteria, a complete response was determined by Morphologic complete remission: A CR designation requires that the patient achieve the morphologic leukemia-free state and have an absolute neutrophil count of more than 1,000/μL and platelets of ≥ 100,000/μL, a cytogenic CR and a morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi).</description>

        <description>Assumptions/ hypothesis: A Complete Response (CR) rate of 30% or less is unacceptable, and 50% or more is promising. A two-stage design will be used. Initially, 18 patients will be enrolled. If 5 or fewer achieve CR, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, an additional 22 patients will be accrued. Accrual was not halted while follow-up of the first 18 evaluable patients was under way. Therefore, 24 patients were enrolled. Four weeks is anticipated for observation for response. Only 5 patients (21%) achieved a CR and therefore, the study was terminated. Since response was assessed using the International Working Group criteria, a complete response was determined by Morphologic complete remission: A CR designation requires that the patient achieve the morphologic leukemia-free state and have an absolute neutrophil count of more than 1,000/μL and platelets of ≥ 100,000/μL, a cytogenic CR and a morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi).</description>
