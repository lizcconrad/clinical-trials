      Gestational diabetes is also a strong risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus at
      a later stage of life in previous GDM woman. Among all the risk factors of diabetes mellitus,
      the experience of gestational diabetes is the strongest one. The incidence of various forms
      of diabetes in this group balances from 10 to 60% over a period from 2 to 10 years.

      The aim of this study is a comparison of the efficacy of life style modification and life
      style modification in conjunction with metformin administration, in a population of women,
      who had already experienced gestational diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most frequent metabolic disorders occurring
      during pregnancy that complicates both, the course of pregnancy and the delivery and is also
      responsible for many fetal complications. Gestational diabetes is also a strong risk factor
      for the development of diabetes mellitus at a later stage of life in previous GDM woman.
      Among all the risk factors of diabetes mellitus, the experience of gestational diabetes is
      the strongest one. The incidence of various forms of diabetes in this group balances from 10
      to 60% over a period from 2 to 10 years.

      Presently, in the literature, there are described new, more efficient methods of diabetes
      prevention in groups with a high risk of this disorder, which involve both, a modification of
      the life style and pharmacotherapy. The use of metformin in patients with a impaired glucose
      tolerance, resulted in a ca. 30% reduction of the diabetes incidence rate.

      The aim of this study is a comparison of the efficacy of life style modification and life
      style modification in conjunction with metformin administration, in a population of women,
      who had already experienced gestational diabetes.
