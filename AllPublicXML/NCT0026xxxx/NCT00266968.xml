  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease affects 1 in 100 newborn babies each year and more than 2,000,000
      Americans have a congenital heart defect. One common defect treated at Children's Healthcare
      of Atlanta at Egleston is single ventricle heart. Due to these overwhelming numbers, the use
      of diagnostic imaging technology to assess these defects and heart function is an important
      step in the evolving care of this patient group.

      The definition of single ventricle can mean a ventricle that is hypoplastic, too small, or
      completely absent. Either the right or left ventricle may be affected. There may also be
      other cardiac anomalies present. Infants with a single ventricle develop distress after birth
      when the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale close. This may happen within hours or days of
      delivery. The severity of symptoms is determined by the degree of defect. But, single
      ventricle patients will not survive without treatment. Patients with only one functioning
      ventricle can usually expect either a heart transplant or a series of palliative surgeries or
      sometimes both. Their care is very complex requiring a team of dedicated practitioners to
      manage drug therapy, medical support and surgery.

      At Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, it is standard of care for a patient with a
      single ventricle heart to undergo many non-invasive imaging studies and sometimes invasive
      studies such as heart catheterization. Results of the studies provide valuable information
      used for treatment decisions and evaluation of heart function. We propose to do a
      retrospective chart review of patient data including a review of their invasive and
      non-invasive studies.
