  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin, an
      antibiotic, compared with cefuroxime axetil, another antibiotic, in the treatment of adults
      with chronic bronchitis experiencing rapid onset of worsening of symptoms caused by bacteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multicenter study to determine the safety
      and effectiveness of 500 mg of levofloxacin (once daily for 5 - 7 days) compared with 250 mg
      of cefuroxime axetil (every 12 hours for 10 days) in adults with chronic bronchitis
      experiencing rapid onset of severe worsening of symptoms caused by bacteria. The study
      consists of 3 visits: one visit for screening and enrollment, and 2 visits for assessment of
      safety and effectiveness (one visit on Days 3 - 5 of the study and one visit [post-therapy] 5
      - 7 days after the last dose of the study drug). The total duration of patient participation
      in the study is approximately 2 weeks. The primary efficacy assessment is the clinical
      response 5 - 7 days after the last dose of study drug, (categorized as cured, improved, or
      failed) based upon changes in signs and symptoms. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse
      events, physical examination, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The study
      hypothesis is that treatment with levofloxacin is at least as effective and as well tolerated
      as treatment with cefuroxime axetil in adult patients with chronic bronchitis experiencing
      sudden worsening of symptoms caused by bacterial infection. Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once
      daily for 5 - 7 days, or cefuroxime axetil 250 mg by mouth every 12 hours for 10 days

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of chronic obstructive lung disease (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema)
             with rapid onset of worsening of symptoms caused by bacterial infection

          -  recent increase in cough

          -  change in type or amount of sputum (the mucus produced on coughing)

          -  findings during the physical examination of clinical signs and symptoms of chronic
             obstructive lung disease

          -  received previous antibiotic treatment if the previous treatment lasted for 24 hours
             or less, or if the previous treatment lasted longer than 24 hours but there was no
             improvement or stabilization of the disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Illness requiring antibiotic treatment by injection into a vein, beneath the skin, or
             into a muscle, or patient has a requirement for a second antibiotic medication taken
             orally in addition to the study drug

          -  infection due to bacteria known (prior to the start of the study) to be resistant to
             the study drugs

          -  previous allergic or serious adverse reaction to antibiotics similar to the study
             drugs

          -  diagnosis of pneumonia determined by x-ray at the start of the trial

          -  has cystic fibrosis, seizure disorders, kidney disease, or an unstable psychiatric
             condition.
