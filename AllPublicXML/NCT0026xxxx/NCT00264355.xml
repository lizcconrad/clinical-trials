  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following heart transplantation many patients develop acute renal failure in the early
      posttransplant phase and some are in need of renal replacement therapy for shorter or longer
      time. The cause of this acute renal failure is most probably multi factorial but many reports
      indicate that cyclosporine has a central role in the pathophysiology and it is generally
      recommended to lower the cyclosporine load to patients developing acute renal failure in this
      population.

      Several in vitro studies on renal cells in culture indicate that the primary metabolites of
      cyclosporine (AM1, AM9, AM4N) are less toxic to the kidney than cyclosporine itself. However,
      the secondary metabolite AM19 as well as the cyclic metabolites AM1c and AM1c9 has been
      associated with decreased renal function and nephrotoxicity renal transplant recipients.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate if the concentrations of
      secondary- and cyclic metabolites of cyclosporine (AM19, AM1c, AM1c9) is related to
      development of acute renal failure in the early posttransplant phase following heart
      transplantation.

      Secondary objectives are to investigate associations between genotypes of P-glycoprotein and
      CYP3A5 and the metabolic pattern of cyclosporine.
