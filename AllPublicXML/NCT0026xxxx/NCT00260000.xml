  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to test whether treatment with BH4-tablets can replace the protein
      restrictive diet in patients with mild PKU caused by a certain frequent mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PKU, phenylketonuria, is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder that results in mental
      retardation if not a very strict low-protein diet is started within the first weeks of life.

      The conversion of phenylalanine, phe, to tyrosine is defect, phe accumulates, leading to
      brain damage. There are different degrees of severity, reflecting the spectrum of mutant
      genes. BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin, is a co-enzym for the conversion of phe to tyrosine. It is
      known that BH4 can lower phe in some patients with milder forms of PKU.

      The main purpose is to test whether treatment with oral BH4 can replace the protein
      restrictive diet in patients with mild PKU caused by the frequent mutation Y414C in the
      phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.
