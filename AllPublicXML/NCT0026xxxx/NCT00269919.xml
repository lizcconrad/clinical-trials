    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of a long-acting
      injectable formulation of risperidone (an antipsychotic medication) and its influence on
      quality of life, in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of
      emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and
      withdrawal into the self).

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) single-arm, and
      prospective study (study following participants forward in time) of risperidone microspheres
      in participants with schizophrenia. Participants will be treated with intramuscular (into a
      muscle) injections of either 25 milligram (mg) or 37.5 mg or 50 mg of risperidone twice
      weekly, every 2 weeks for 2 years. The total duration of study will be 2 years. The efficacy
      of participants will primarily be evaluated by total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) score. Participants' quality of life and safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Score at Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale consisting of 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items) and it is designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 items are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in World Health Organization (WHO)-Quality of Life (QOL) at Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item, self-report questionnaire and short version of WHOQOL-100, consisting of 4 domains: physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relationships (3 items), and environmental health (8 items); it also contains QOL and general health items. Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life). The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. Each individual item of the WHOQOL-BREF is scored from 1=not at all to 5=completely on a response scale, which is stipulated as a 5-point ordinal scale. The scores are then transformed linearly to a scale of 0 (the worse quality of life) to 100 (the worse quality of life).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in NCFT: Rey Kim Memory Test-Korean Auditory Verbal Learning Test (KAVLT) at Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The KAVLT is a neuropsychological assessment designed to evaluate verbal memory in participants. The KAVLT is useful in evaluating the nature and severity of memory dysfunction and to track changes in memory function over time. The test is designed as a list-learning paradigm in which the participants hears a list of 15 words, and are asked to recall as many words from the list as possible. This procedure is carried out a total of 5 times. Then a second list of 15 words is presented, allowing the participants only 1 attempt to recall. Immediately following this, the participants are asked to remember as many words as possible from the first list. KAVLT consists of 2 test conditions: Delayed Recall and Delayed Recognition. The upper limit for 'words recalled' is 15, which represents better episodic memory.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The RCFT is a neuropsychological assessment designed to evaluate visual memory in participants. The RCFT is useful in evaluating the spatial perception and visual memory. The RCFT consists of 3 test conditions: Copy, Immediate Recall and Delayed Recall. At the first step, participants are given the RCFT stimulus card, and then asked to draw the same figure. Subsequently, they are instructed to draw what they remembered. Then, after a delay of 30 min, they are required to draw the same figure once again, a score of 2 points for each drawn element (a complete straight line or a circle) remembered correctly. The total score is the sum of points scored for each correctly drawn element and it ranges from 0 to 36. The maximum score indicates excellent visual memory.</description>

    <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of medication and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence medication compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score for each person at each time is the positive score minus the negative score.</description>

        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale consisting of 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items) and it is designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 items are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life). The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. Each individual item of the WHOQOL-BREF is scored from 1=not at all to 5=completely on a response scale, which is stipulated as a 5-point ordinal scale. The scores are then transformed linearly to a scale of 0 (the worse quality of life) to 100 (the worse quality of life).</description>

        <description>The KAVLT is a neuropsychological assessment designed to evaluate verbal memory in participants. The KAVLT is useful in evaluating the nature and severity of memory dysfunction and to track changes in memory function over time. The test is designed as a list-learning paradigm in which the participants hears a list of 15 words, and are asked to recall as many words from the list as possible. This procedure is carried out a total of 5 times. Then a second list of 15 words is presented, allowing the participants only 1 attempt to recall. Immediately following this, the participants are asked to remember as many words as possible from the first list. KAVLT consists of 2 test conditions: Delayed Recall and Delayed Recognition. The upper limit for ‘words recalled’ is 15, which represents better episodic memory.</description>

        <description>The RCFT is a neuropsychological assessment designed to evaluate visual memory in participants. The RCFT is useful in evaluating the spatial perception and visual memory. The RCFT consists of 3 test conditions: Copy, Immediate Recall and Delayed Recall. At the first step, participants are given the RCFT stimulus card, and then asked to draw the same figure. Subsequently, they are instructed to draw what they remembered. Then, after a delay of 30 min, they are required to draw the same figure once again, a score of 2 points for each drawn element (a complete straight line or a circle) remembered correctly. The total score is the sum of points scored for each correctly drawn element and it ranges from 0 to 36. The maximum score indicates excellent visual memory.</description>

Then, after a delay of 30 min, they are required to draw the same figure once again, a score of 2 points for each drawn element (a complete straight line or a circle) remembered correctly. The total score is the sum of points scored for each correctly drawn element and it ranges from 0 to 36. The maximum score indicates excellent visual memory.</description>

        <description>The LUNSERS is a self-report measure of antipsychotic side effects. It consists of 51 questions, 41 questions on side effects and 10 questions are of &quot;red herrings&quot; to validate the results. Each question is rated on a 4-point scale, where 0=not at all; and 4=very much. The total neuroleptic side effect score is the sum of the scores for the side effects items (i.e. all items excluding the red herrings). Total side effects score ranges from 0 to 164, where 0 to 40=low side effect rating, 41 to 80=medium side effect rating and greater than 81=high side effect rating.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Drug Attitude Inventory-10 (DAI-10) Item Scale Score at Week 96</title>
        <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of medication and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence medication compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score for each person at each time is the positive score minus the negative score.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT analysis population included all the participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication, satisfied the eligibility criteria and provided at least 1 post-baseline efficacy measurement. Here, ‘N'=the participants who were evaluated for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Total Drug Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) Score</title>
        <description>A scale used to assess the extrapyramidal symptoms attributable to antipsychotics. It consists of 9 items (8 to assess individual symptoms and 1 to assess global severity). Each item is assessed from 0 (none, normal) to 4 (severe). The total score is the sum of the 8 item scores, for a total range of 0 (normal) to 32 (severe). The items for the assessment of individual symptoms are classified into 4 categories of parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia.</description>
