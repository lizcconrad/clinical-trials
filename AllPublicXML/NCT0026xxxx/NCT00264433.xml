  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-cadherin, a protein involved in blood vessel cell binding, is increased as cancer
      progresses, and is on the surface of many tumor cells. ADH-1 blocks N-cadherin. This study
      will test the safety and effects of ADH-1 in subjects with specific incurable, solid tumors
      with a protein biomarker called N-cadherin. This study will examine the clinical activity of
      ADH-1.
