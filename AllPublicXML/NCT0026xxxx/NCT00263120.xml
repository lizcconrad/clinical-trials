    <textblock>
      The thymus is known to be the site of T cell development in humans. Due to its location in
      the chest in front of the heart, incidental thymecomy is commonly performed during
      cardiothoracic surgery, especially in infants and children, so that surgeons may gain access
      to the surgical field. This practice has been considered safe because it was thought that the
      thymus is inactive after birth. However, recent data using newly developed techniques has
      demonstrated that the thymus normally is active well into adulthood. In addition, in a
      previous study (UCLA IRB # 02-03-008-02) we have demonstrated alterations in lymphocyte (T
      cells) number in individuals who have undergone thymectomy in childhood but we do not know
      how immunity is affected. We plan to investigate if immune development or immune function
      later in life is affected by the loss of T cell production caused by thymectomy during
      cardiothoracic surgical procedures in childhood. At UCLA, a large number of patients are seen
      who have congenital heart disease and undergo surgical procedures for correction or repair
      and many children and adults are followed for many years after they have undergone surgical
      procedures. Subjects for study will be recruited from among these patients.

      We propose a study which will examine the number and activity of lymphocytes obtained from
      blood samples from child and young adult subjects who have undergone surgery in early
      childhood. We will determine if these subjects have had complete thymectomy in the past using
      CT or MRI (obtained during routine care) or, for subjects who are having cardiothoracic
      surgery, by visualization of thymic tissue during the procedure. In addition we will give
      vaccination for a common viral illness (hepatitis A) and measure immune responses to it (from
      a blood sample). As part of this study, we will ask for medical information consisting of a
      history of congenital cardiac disease and other diagnoses (such as asthma), a history of
      infections and hospitalizations, and information about immunizations. We will also ask about
      a list of specific symptoms which will give us information about the function of the immune
      system.
