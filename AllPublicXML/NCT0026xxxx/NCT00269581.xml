  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to determine if a CD-ROM computer program (called &quot;Headstrong&quot;) is
      effective in helping children cope with chronic headaches.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children, 7-12 years, with recurrent headaches are randomly assigned to an educational CD-ROM
      program or the Headstrong CD-ROM program. We anticipate that those assigned to the active
      (Headstrong) program group will have significantly greater reductions in headache frequency,
      duration, and severity and improvements in mood and quality of life.
