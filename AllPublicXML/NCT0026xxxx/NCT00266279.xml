      This phase II study will test the response rate of combined oxaliplatin and capecitabine
      treatment when administered at a given dose and schedule, in patients with Head and Neck
      cancer for which there is no curative treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal dose and schedule for the combined treatment with oxaliplatin and capecitabine
      have not been defined. The aim of this Phase II study is to determine the response rate of
      combined oxaliplatin and capecitabine treatment at a given dose and schedule in patients with
      Head and Neck cancer for which there is no curative treatment.

      The study also aims to determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility
      of toxicity of the above combination and to evaluate any changes in performance status,
      quality of life, overall survival and progression-free survival.

    <description>Among the 15 patients treated, 2 (13%) achieved partial response (PR), and 5 (33%) achieved stable disease (SD), for a Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 46% measured by RECIST criteria.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.
