  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a progressive disease that decreases the pumping action of the heart. This
      may cause a backup of fluid in the heart and may result in heart beat changes. When there are
      changes in the heart beat sometimes an implantable heart device is used to control the rate
      and rhythm of the heart beat. In certain heart failure cases, when the two lower chambers of
      the heart no longer beat in a coordinated manner, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may
      be prescribed.

      Left Ventricular Capture Management (LVCM) refers to the overall method for determining left
      ventricular thresholds (level of energy needed to effectively pace the tissue in the lower
      left chamber of the heart) by measuring, analyzing, and adjusting energy delivered from the
      CRT device to the pacing lead.

      The purpose of the Left Ventricular Capture Management Software Download Clinical Trial was
      to evaluate the accuracy of the Left Ventricular Capture Management (LVCM) feature to support
      LVCM feature approval in future cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation (CRT-D)
      devices
