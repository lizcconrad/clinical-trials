  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) is a debilitating disease that commonly leads
      to destruction of the hip joint in patients at middle age of life and often requires surgical
      intervention. Previously, we have identified the collagen type II, alpha 1 (COL2A1) gene as
      the ANFH disease gene. In this grant proposal, we will establish cell ine and animal models
      to understand the pathophysiology of ANFH, and extend our ongoing study for identifying genes
      responsible for non-familiar ANFH by looking into other interacting molecules of the pathway.

    <textblock>
      Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) is a debilitating disease that usually leads to
      destruction of the hip joint in the third to fifth decade of life (average age, 36 years).
      The disease prevalence is unknown, but it has been estimated that 10,000-20,000 new cases per
      year are diagnosed in the United State. Nearly half of the patients eventually require hip
      replacement before 40 years of age. The etiology of ANFH is unknown but previous studies
      indicated that heritable thrombophilia (increased tendency to form thrombi) and
      hypofibrinolysis (reduced ability to lyse thrombi), alcohol intake, and steroid use are risk
      factors for ANFH.

      Although the majority of idiopathic ANFH cases are sporadic, recently we identified three
      ANFH families showing autosomal dominant inheritance. By genome-wide scan, a significant
      two-point LOD score of 3.45 at ÔÅ±= 0 was obtained between one ANFH pedigree and marker D12S85
      on chromosome 12. High-resolution mapping was conducted in a second ANFH family and
      replicated the linkage to D12S368. When an age-dependent penetrance model was applied, the
      combined multipoint LOD score achieved 6.43 between D12S1663 and D12S85. Furthermore, by
      using haplotype analysis and gene-based mutation detection, we have identified the collagen
      type II, alpha 1 (COL2A1) gene, as the ANFH disease gene. Re-sequencing of the type II
      collagen (COL2A1) gene demonstrated a glycine with serine mutation in the G-X-Y repeat of
      type II collagen, in all affected individuals in three pedigrees. In the Pedigree I, a 3665G
      &gt;A mutation in exon 50 of the COL2A1 gene (Genbank accession number NM_001844) and the
      substitution resulted in a Gly1170Ser codon change (Genbank accession number NP_001835). A
      second pedigree was shown to harbor the same mutation but the mutant allele existed in a
      different haplotype background. In a third pedigree, a 2306G&gt;A mutation occurred in exon 33
      of the gene (Genbank accession number NM_001844), causing glycine to serine change at codon
      717 (Genbank accession number NP_001835).

      On this basis, we propose to study the pathophysiological mechanism(s) of inherited and
      sporadic ANFH. The main focus of this project includes: (1) Establishing cell line and animal
      models to investigate the molecular basis of ANFH pathogenesis. (2) Conducting genetic
      analysis on sporadic ANFH cases, including those who are idiopathic, alcohol consumers or
      steroid-induced. (3) Using COL2A1 gene as a target, we will design novel therapeutics and
      prediction procedures to improve the management of the ANFH patients.
