      The purpose of this trial is to improve the management of patients with potentially
      surgically curable colorectal cancer liver metastases.

      The primary objective is to determine the impact of pre-operative positron emission
      tomography (PET) on patients who have been assessed as having resectable colorectal cancer
      liver metastases by conventional imaging (computed tomography (CT) abdomen/thorax,
      colonoscopy), by determining the proportion of patients who have a change in management
      resulting from PET.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer remains a leading cause of death in men and women. A significant number of
      patients with colorectal cancer will either present with, or subsequently develop, liver
      metastases. In contrast to many other epithelial solid tumours, resection of colorectal
      cancer hepatic metastases results in long-term survival and even cure. However, despite state
      of the art CT imaging, 60-75% of patients who appear to have limited disease amenable to
      surgical resection will eventually die from extra-hepatic and recurrent hepatic metastases.
      If occult micrometastatic disease that becomes evident after liver resection could be
      detected reliably during pre-operative assessment, patients harboring more widespread disease
      could be spared a non-curative liver resection. This is one of the present challenges of
      liver surgery. PET imaging has the potential to improve the detection of both hepatic and
      extra-hepatic metastatic disease, not detected by conventional imaging modalities.

      This prospective, multicenter trial will enroll patients with colorectal cancer liver
      metastases considered resectable, based on CT scans of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis, which
      demonstrate no evidence of extra-hepatic disease. A full colonoscopy within the preceding 12
      months will ensure there is no local recurrence, or other primary cancer at the time of
      planned liver resection. These patients will be randomized to PET scan or not.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic proof of previous colorectal adenocarcinoma (not carcinoid, squamous cell
             cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or lymphoma)

          2. Contrast-enhanced spiral CT scan of the thorax, and a tri-phasic CT scan of the
             abdomen and pelvis performed within 30 days (plus up to 14 days) before randomization
             demonstrating resectable metastasis(es) that are isolated to the liver

          3. Full colonoscopy performed within the preceding 18 months showing no evidence of
             malignancy (other than a synchronous colorectal primary expected to be removed at time
             of liver resection)

          4. Age over 18 years

          6. Significant concurrent medical problems (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, active cardiac
             disease, significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) making the patient unfit
             for surgery

          7. Pregnant or lactating female

          8. Unable to lie supine for imaging with PET

             body PET within 6 months prior to randomization
