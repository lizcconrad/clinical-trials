  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multi-center, expanded access study of Iodine I 131 Tositumomab
      (BEXXAR) therapeutic regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or
      transformed low-grade non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. The primary objective is to make Iodine
      I 131 Tositumomab more broadly available to patients. Secondary endpoints will be to obtain
      additional safety and efficacy information for this treatment regimen. Post study drug
      administration follow-ups will continue for up to ten years. These will include blood-work
      and adverse event assessments for 13 weeks post dosing, patient response evaluations at Week
      13, Months 6, 12, 18, 24, and Long-Term Follow-ups every 6 months until the elapse of 5 years
      from the dosimetric dose and then annually thereafter through year 10. Thyroid function will
      be monitored annually during Long-term follow-up.

    <description>A participant was defined as a responder if he/she sustained a complete response (CR: the disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and all disease-related symptoms) or partial response (PR: greater than or equal to a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of perpendicular diameter [SPPD] determined at Baseline; no increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen; no new sites of disease). Response was evaluated by an investigator per guidelines developed by The International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</description>

    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented CR (the disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and all disease-related symptoms) or PR (greater than or equal to a 50% decrease in the SPPD determined at Baseline; no increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen; no new sites of disease) until disease progression (PD). PD is defined as greater than or equal to a 50% increase from nadir in the SPPD for all measurable disease. Lesion changes believed to represent measurement variation associated with radiographic technique should not be classified as PD. Response was evaluated by an investigator per guidelines developed by the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</description>

    <intervention_name>Iodine I 131 Tositumomab Therapeutic Regimen</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will receive unlabeled Tositumomab (450 mg) followed by Tositumomab (35 mg) which has been trace-labeled with 5 mCi of Iodine-131 (dosimetric dose). Whole body counts using a gamma camera will be obtained 3 times between Days 0 and 7 following the dosimetric dose to determine a patient-specific mCi dose of Iodine-131 calculated to deliver the desired total body dose of radiation (either 65 cGy or 75 cGy). The therapeutic dose is administered 7-14 days after the dosimetric dose. Patients will receive unlabeled Tositumomab (450 mg) followed by Tositumomab (35 mg) labeled with the patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 (median dose in previous studies was approximately 85 mCi). Patients who are obese will be dosed based upon 137% of their calculated lean body mass. Patients will be treated with thyroid blocking medication at least 24 hours prior to the dosimetric dose and continuing for 14 days following the therapeutic dose.</description>

Participants received treatment in two phases. The dosimetric dose was administered in Phase 1 as 450 milligrams (mg) of TST infused over 1 hour (preceded by the administration of oral acetaminophen and an antihistamine), followed by 5 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I-131 TST infused over 20 minutes (min), followed by a 10-min normal saline flush. The therapeutic dose, administered 7–14 days after the dosimetric dose, was administered as 450 mg of TST infused over 1 hour (preceded by the administration of oral acetaminophen and an antihistamine), followed by the appropriate activity (mCi) of Iodine I-131 TST infused over 20 min, followed by a 10-min normal saline flush.</description>

PD is defined as greater than or equal to a 50% increase from nadir in the SPPD for all measurable disease. Lesion changes believed to represent measurement variation associated with radiographic technique should not be classified as PD.

        <title>Duration of Response for Participants With Confirmed Response (CR+PR)</title>
        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented CR (the disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and all disease-related symptoms) or PR (greater than or equal to a 50% decrease in the SPPD determined at Baseline; no increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen; no new sites of disease) until disease progression (PD). PD is defined as greater than or equal to a 50% increase from nadir in the SPPD for all measurable disease. Lesion changes believed to represent measurement variation associated with radiographic technique should not be classified as PD. Response was evaluated by an investigator per guidelines developed by the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. A confirmed response (CR and PR) requires that the response be confirmed by another response (same or better) at least 4 weeks apart.</description>

The therapeutic dose, administered 7–14 days after the dosimetric dose, was administered as 450 mg of TST infused over 1 hour (preceded by the administration of oral acetaminophen and an antihistamine), followed by the appropriate activity (mCi) of Iodine I-131 TST infused over 20 min, followed by a 10-min normal saline flush.</description>
