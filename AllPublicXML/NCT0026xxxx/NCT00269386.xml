    <textblock>
      Clarithromycin may be an effective therapy in Crohn's disease. It is a broad spectrum
      antibiotic. Crohn's disease, the investigators think, is in some way related to bacteria,
      which reside in the bowel.

      Previous studies of different types of antibiotic in Crohn's disease have shown encouraging
      results. Clarithromycin alters the bacteria in the bowel and gets into cells in the bowel
      which may contain bacteria. There is some evidence that clarithromycin can stimulate the
      immune system and improve the function of cells involved in killing bacteria in the bowel.

      WHAT IS THE PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED ?

      Lack of effective cure for Crohn's disease.

      Effective symptomatic treatment of Crohn's disease can be achieved in approximately 60-80%
      using corticosteroids [1] with a similar response to enteral or intravenous feeding. The
      benefit is usually short-term however, with more than 50% relapsing within a year [2] and
      over 90% of patients with ileocaecal disease eventually requiring at least one surgical
      operation [3].

      The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown but it is commonly believed to be due in some way to
      bacteria: either as an unusual response to the normal intestinal flora or possibly to a
      specific infection such as an atypical bacterium. It is typified histologically by the
      presence of granulomata (in over 75% of cases) and closely resembles intestinal tuberculosis,
      radiologically and histologically. A search for Mycobacteria has produced conflicting results
      with one centre claiming that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis DNA can be detected in the
      majority of cases [4] but with others finding Mycobacterial DNA in only about 10% [5].
      Studies have shown that a variety of organisms including normal intestinal bacteria and
      yeasts can be grown from Crohn's disease mesenteric lymph nodes and that the lymphocytes
      within these lymph nodes are manufacturing antibodies that are directed against a broad range
      of bacterial antigens so it is a more widely held view that a wide range of micro-organisms
      invade the mucosa in Crohn's disease, possibly as a result of a breakdown in the normal
      mucosal barrier [6].

      WHAT IS THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED?

      That clarithromycin may be an effective therapy in Crohn's disease. It is a broad spectrum
      antibiotic that has particularly good penetration into macrophages [7] and may therefore be
      effective at eradicating the organisms at the centre of the granulomatous reaction in Crohn's
      disease. There is also some evidence suggesting that macrolide antibiotics can stimulate
      macrophage proliferation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis and cytocidal activitity [8].

      WHY IS A TRIAL NEEDED NOW?

      Open label studies have shown promising results with Clarithromycin. A study published in
      abstract by Present's group in New York reported a response in 7/12 (58%) whose Crohn's
      disease activity index (CDAI) fell by a mean of 130 points (range 79-130) in response to
      clarithromycin 500 mg bd for 6 weeks [9].

      HAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW BEEN CARRIED OUT AND WHAT WERE THE FINDINGS?

      A Medline search for &quot; clarithromycin and Crohn's disease&quot; yields only three responses. The
      first is the report of an open-label study of a combination of clarithromycin 250 mg bd (or
      azithromycin in 3 patients) and rifabutin 450 mg per day given for a mean of 18 months to 52
      patients by the St George's Hospital group who are the major protagonists of the
      Mycobacterium paratuberculosis hypothesis [10] . They report a response in terms of
      &quot;significant fall in Harvey Bradshaw Index&quot; in 93% but CDAI was not reported and many of the
      patients seem to have had rather modest elevations of Harvey Bradshaw index on entry. Ten of
      the patients also received a quinolone antibiotic and a further 5 received clofazimine. The
      other two are reports of clarithromycin in Mycobacterium haemophilum infection including at
      least one in a case of apparent Crohn's disease. Review of American Gastroenterological
      Association abstracts for the past three years yielded reference [9] and an Australian study
      of a triple therapy regimen for Mycobacteria that consisted of rifabutin 450 mg per day,
      clarithromycin 750 mg per day, clofazimine 2 mg per kg. Twelve patients were treated for 8-12
      months and 10/12 achieved &quot;near complete control&quot; [11].

      HOW WILL THE RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL BE USED? This trial will establish whether clarithromycin
      is effective in achieving remission in Crohn's disease and would be a significant advance in
      non-steroid treatment of active Crohn's disease. If a significant positive result is observed
      then further trials of prolonged treatment would be indicated to assess clarithromycin's
      effect on the prevention of relapse.

      WHAT ARE THE PLANNED TRIAL INTERVENTIONS? Patients will receive either (i) Clarithromycin S/R
      1g od or (ii) placebo tablets of identical size, colour and taste.

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED DURATION OF THE TREATMENT PERIOD? Clarithromycin or placebo therapy will
      continue for three months.

      WILL HEALTH SERVICE RESEARCH ISSUES BE ADDRESSED? Not Applicable

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY/DURATION OF FOLLOW UP? Patients will be reviewed after one,
      two and four weeks and then monthly for the following two months of treatment. Follow up
      thereafter will then be in the gastroenterology outpatient clinics.

      HOW WILL THE OUTCOME MEASURES BE MEASURED AT FOLLOW-UP? CDAI will be calculated at baseline
      and at each subsequent follow up from the patient's symptom scoring diary, haematocrit and
      weight. Similarly the van Hees index will be calculated and serum CRP measured. The IBD
      quality of life questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at 3 months.

      Patients will also have a diary card to record the details of any other symptoms noted during
      the trial to assess adverse effects of the trial treatment.

      WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR ALLOCATING PATIENTS TO TRIAL GROUPS?
      Randomisation will be allocated by the pharmacy department of the hospital.

      WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED METHODS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST OTHER SOURCES OF BIAS? Controls (known
      only to the Pharmacy Department) will receive placebo tablets which are identical in size
      colour and taste. Patients will be stratified according to site of disease into 3 groups:
      colonic CD only, perianal disease only and others (ileocolonic, small bowel only).

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED SAMPLE SIZE? 39 patients in each group (active treatment and placebo)
      gives a 90% power of excluding a response of 60% (p2) compared to 20% (p1) for placebo at
      p&lt;0.05 [16]. The published placebo response rate in active CD being 20%.

      WHAT IS THE PLANNED RECRUITMENT RATE? 5 patients per month

      ARE THERE LIKELY TO BE ANY PROBLEMS WITH COMPLIANCE? Compliance will be assessed by the
      number of returned tablets and assessed as good (&lt;25% returned, fair 25-50% returned and poor
      (&gt;50% returned).

      WHAT IS THE LIKELY RATE OF LOSS TO FOLLOW UP? 100% follow up should be achievable.

      HOW MANY CENTRES WILL BE INVOLVED? One

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TYPE OF ANALYSIS? For the primary outcome measure the difference in
      proportions will be calculated with associated 95% confidence intervals. Formal hypothesis
      testing of the primary outcome will then be compared by chi-square test.

      Quantitative variables will be compared using repeated measures analysis taking into account
      the distribution of each variable [17]

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY OF ANALYSIS? Once only on completion.

      ARE THERE ANY PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES? Data from patients in each stratified group will be
      examined separately but formal statistical analysis between the subgroups will use a test for
      interaction (Altman DG. Practical Statistics for Medical Research. Chapman &amp; Hall. London.
      1991). We anticipate though, that the main outcome data will be presented for all the
      patients together.

      WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH COST OF THE TRIAL? To be discussed. Part funding will be
      required for research nurse and drug trials pharmacist.

      IS THERE AN NHS SERVICE SUPPORT COST OF THIS TRIAL, AND IF SO WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED COST? The
      only NHS cost would be modest, involving only the routine testing of full blood count and CRP
      which is current practice in the monitoring of patients with relapses of inflammatory bowel
      disease.

      OVER WHAT PERIOD IS FUNDING REQUESTED? Funding is requested for a 2 year period to cover the
      primary trial.
