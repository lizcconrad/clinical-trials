      The present study evaluates the effect of oral contraceptives on lamotrigine plasma
      concentrations in a double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study in patients with
      epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lamotrigine is widely used as an antiepileptic drug in the treatment of newly onset as well
      as refractory epilepsy (1;2). Lamotrigine is unique among the antiepileptic drug since the
      major route (76%) of elimination is conjugation with glucuronic acid (glucuronidation) (3).
      This conjugation reaction is catalyzed by the uridine 5'-diphosphate
      (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs); of which the isoform UGT1A4 probably is the major
      route of metabolism in humans (3). The pathway is inhibited by valproate and induced by other
      anticonvulsants (3), and explains the effect of these drugs on lamotrgine metabolism (4).
      Other drugs that are metabolized via direct glucoronidation may interfere with the metabolism
      of lamotrigine e.g. acetaminophen (5). Estrogeneous substrates are metabolized via
      glucuronidation (6-8) and may potentially interact with the metabolism of lamotrigine. In the
      development of lamotrigine for use in epilepsy patients the effect on the oral contraceptive
      pill was studied. In contrast to other commonly used antiepileptic drugs e.g. carbamazepine
      and phenytoin(9), lamotrigine did not significantly influence the constituents of the oral
      contraceptive pill (10-12). In addition, it was initially assumed from population
      pharmacokinetic studies, that oral contraceptives did not influence the metabolism of
      lamotrigine (13).However, recent retrospective studies indicate that oral contraceptives may
      increase the metabolism of lamotrigine resulting in a significant decrease in plasma
      concentration of lamotrigine when given with oral contraceptives (14;15). This effect is
      probably related to the ethinyl estradiol content of the combined contracetive pill and no
      the progesterone content (16).

      To confirm and further extend these findings, the present study evaluates the effect of oral
      contraceptives on lamotrigine plasma concentrations in a double blind, placebo controlled,
      cross-over study in patients with epilepsy.
