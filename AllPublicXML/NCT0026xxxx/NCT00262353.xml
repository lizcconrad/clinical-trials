      Comparison of the efficacy of dialysis by conventional dialysis versus Prometheus artificial
      hepatic system
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After inclusion, patients will be dialysed with low-flux artificial kidneys. 1 week of
      dialysis exists of 3 days of dialysis. In week 4, day 2, patients will be treated once with
      the Prometheus artificial hepatic system or with high-flux dialysis. The other days low-flux
      kidneys will be used. Week 5 and 6 are a wash-out period. Week 7 is identical to week 4 but
      the other system than in week 4 is used. Blood samples are taken at regular moments in week
      3, week 4 (day 2) and week 7 (day 2).
