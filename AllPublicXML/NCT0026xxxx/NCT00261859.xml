      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced emergency
      practitioner (EP) performed brief intervention (BI), namely, the Enhanced Brief Negotiation
      Interview (E-BNI). This includes a basic BNI performed in the ED with referral to a primary
      care provider, followed by a telephone booster intervention performed by trained nurses
      1-month post ED visit. The E-BNI will be compared to the basic BNI (without booster), and
      standard care with assessments (SC-A) and without (SC-NA). In a randomized, controlled
      clinical trial 900 hazardous and harmful (HH) drinkers will be randomly assigned to one of
      the 4 conditions. We, the researchers at Yale University, will conduct cost benefit analysis
      of the interventions. Follow-up assessments, at 6 and 12-months, will be obtained via
      interactive voice response (IVR).

      A critical need exists to refine and test brief interventions (BI) for Emergency Department
      (ED) populations with hazardous and harmful (HH) drinking that can be translated into
      real-world settings; and to enhance the effects of these BIs so they can be maintained over
      time. The ED is an ideal setting for BIs, as many ED patients who exceed low-risk
      recommendations do not have contact with either alcohol treatment specialists or visit
      primary care medical practitioners. This includes a large segment of young adults ages 18-30
      whose only contact with the health care system is often an ED visit. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced Emergency Practitioner (EP) performed
      BI, namely, the Enhanced Brief Negotiation Interview (E-BNI). This includes a basic BNI
      performed in the ED with referral to a primary care provider, followed by a telephone booster
      intervention performed by trained nurses 1-month post ED visit. The E-BNI will be compared to
      the basic BNI (without booster), and standard care with assessments (SC-A) and without
      (SC-NA). In a randomized, controlled clinical trial 900 HH drinkers will be randomly assigned
      to one of the 4 conditions. We will conduct cost benefit analysis of the interventions.
      Follow-up assessments, at 6 and 12-months, will be obtained via interactive voice response
      (IVR).
