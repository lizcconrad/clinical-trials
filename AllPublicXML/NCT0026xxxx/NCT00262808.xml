      RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, may increase the number of immune
      cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from
      the side effects of chemotherapy or kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy
      after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. Sometimes, after surgery, the tumor may not
      need additional treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well GM-CSF and combination chemotherapy work in
      treating patients who are undergoing surgery for stage II or stage III colon cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of neoadjuvant and adjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) and adjuvant
           chemotherapy in patients with resectable stage II or III colon cancer.

        -  Determine the efficacy, in terms of enhanced tumor-associated macrophage response, of
           this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall survival and time to progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy and surgery: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously
           (SC) once daily beginning between days -16 and -12 and continuing until day -1. Patients
           undergo surgical resection on day 0. Patients with stage I or IV disease are removed
           from the study. All other patients proceed to adjuvant chemotherapy or observation.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy or observation: Patients with high-risk stage II or any stage III
           disease are assigned to group 1 or 2. Patients with low-risk stage II disease are
           assigned to group 3.

             -  Group 1 (adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage II disease): Patients receive
                leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and
                36. Patients also receive GM-CSF SC once daily on days 50-54. Treatment repeats
                every 56 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Group 2 (adjuvant therapy for stage III disease): Patients receive adjuvant
                chemotherapy and GM-CSF as in group 1. Alternatively, patients may receive
                oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and
                fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. These patients also receive
                GM-CSF SC once daily on days 10-14 of every fourth course. Treatment repeats every
                14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
                toxicity.

             -  Group 3 (low-risk stage II disease): Patients undergo observation only every 3
                months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
