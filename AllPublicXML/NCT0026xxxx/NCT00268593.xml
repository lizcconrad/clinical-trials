  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel (Taxotere) is an approved chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of
      androgen-independent prostate cancer. The aim of the study is to investigate whether addition
      of the investigational drug PI-88 will increase the efficacy of docetaxel in this disease.
      PI-88 inhibits cancer growth by inhibiting the development of new blood vessels and starving
      the tumour of oxygen and nutrients (anti-angiogenic). Because PI-88 and docetaxel have
      different mechanisms of action, they are expected to have increased (synergistic) activity
      when combined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a multi-centre, open-label randomised phase II study in patients with
      androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC), with a lead-in combination tolerance study. The
      aim of the lead-in phase is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PI-88
      administered either 4 days/week or 7 days/week) in combination with fixed doses of docetaxel
      (75 mg/m^2 every 21 days) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily). In the randomized phase II
      component, patients will receive PI-88 at the MTD, either 4 days/week or 7 days/week, in
      combination with docetaxel and prednisone. The patients will receive up to 10 treatment
      cycles of the combination therapy. Response to treatment will be assessed by measuring serum
      levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Other efficacy measures will include radiological
      assessment, progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life.

    <description>Recruitment was stopped due to higher than expected febrile neutropenia rate (27%). Fifty-one SAEs were reported in 33 patients, of which 7 were related to PI-88 treatment: non-neutropenic sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pulmonary embolism, febrile dyspnoea, haematuria (x2), left middle cerebral artery infarction.
Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported in &gt;5% of patients comprise dehydration, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea and thrombocytopenia.
Two patients died during the study, one due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and one due to metastatic prostate cancer.</description>

    <description>Change in VEGF trended towards prediction of survival (p = 0.056); pre-treatment and post-treatment levels of CRP were predictive of survival (p = 0.026, and p = 0.005 respectively) but the change in CRP was not (p = 0.999). IL-6 pretreatment levels were not predictive (p = 0.5111) but post-treatment (p = 0.0008) and change (p = 0.0020) were.
These data need to interpreted with caution due to the small patient numbers involved.</description>
