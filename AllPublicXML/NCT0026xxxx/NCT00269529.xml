  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare two different kinds of pain treatment after total knee replacement
      (operation with artificial knee joint): 1) a large local injection in and around the knee,
      supplemented with injection the day after, or 2) the department's conventional pain treatment
      consisting of continuous nerve block in the groin.

    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty is moderate to severe and can be difficult
      to treat. The current use of femoral nerve block by ropivacain pump for 48 hours provides
      considerable analgesia, but patients often experience slight motor block, inhibiting
      rehabilitation, and pain in the posterior part of the knee, innervated by the sciatic nerve.
      This study compares femoral nerve block to a new technique, where ropivacaine, ketorolac and
      adrenalin is used to infiltrate the tissue in and around the knee joint during surgery, and
      is injected by an intraarticular catheter at 10 pm on the day of surgery and again at 10 am
      the day after. Data of pain scores, analgesia consumption, adverse effects and mobilisation
      is collected for the first four postoperative days.
