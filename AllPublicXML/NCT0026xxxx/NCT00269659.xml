  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A left bundle branch block (LBBB) is related to abnormal cardiac conduction and mechanical
      asynchrony and is associated with hypertension and coronary artery disease. Improved
      evaluation of left ventricular (LV) mechanical asynchrony is needed, because of the
      increasing number of patients with a LBBB and heart failure. A variety of patterns of
      mechanical activation can be observed in LBBB patients.

      Novel imaging modalities such as tissue Doppler imaging, real-time 3D echocardiography and
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging provide information about regional and global LV
      function in healthy subjects, patients without a LBBB with heart failure, patients with a
      LBBB without heart failure, and patients with a LBBB with heart failure.

      The investigators want to evaluate the different patient groups with the novel imaging
      modalities and they want to compare the novel imaging modalities with each other.

      The investigators hypothesized that, between the groups, differences concerning regional and
      global LV function are measurable.

      Each novel imaging technique has its own advantages and limitations but are comparable in
      measuring regional and global LV function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within a time period of 3 years we evaluate different groups of patients and measure regional
      and global cardiac function.

      Therefore, we developed an echocardiography screening-protocol in which we use conventional
      2D echocardiography and conventional Doppler echocardiography, extended with tissue Doppler
      imaging and real-time 3D echo acquisitions.

      In a limited group of patients we perform a specially designed cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance imaging protocol which uses artificially induced grid-lines to evaluate regional
      and global cardiac function.

      Patients are referred to our hospital because of evaluation of their LBBB and or heart
      failure. We ask them if they would like to undergo the echocardiography and the
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.

      After a year we want to repeat the measurements in a small group of the patients to
      re-evaluate regional and global cardiac function.

      All patients should have a sinus rhythm and adequate acoustic windows. Patients should not
      have contraindications for cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.
