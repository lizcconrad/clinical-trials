  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to conduct a feasibility study of yoga as an
      adjunctive therapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 15 military
      personnel at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) in Washington, DC. Participants will
      complete 10 weeks of yoga training, in addition to the continuing their usual and customary
      care for PTSD at WRAMC. The style of yoga chosen for this study, Yoga Nidra, uses deep
      relaxation, deep breathing and meditation to systematically reduce physical, emotional,
      mental, and even subconscious tension. After a diagnostic mental health assessment at
      baseline, participants will attend a total of 18 classes taught over a 10-week period and
      will practice daily at home using a compact disk provided by the instructor. Baseline
      measures will include the Patient Health Questionnaire, PD-HAT Trauma Questions, PTSD Symptom
      Scale - Interview, Fear of Loss of Vigilance Scale, and expectation of efficacy. The primary
      outcome measure will be the PTSD Checklist. Changes in health status, locus of control, and
      pain will be assessed over the course of the study. An additional goal of this study is to
      gather preliminary data on the anticipated effect size and feasibility of conducting a larger
      clinical study of the adjunctive use of yoga for the treatment of PTSD symptoms in enlisted
      military personnel.
