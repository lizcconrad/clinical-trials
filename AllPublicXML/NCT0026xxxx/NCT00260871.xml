    <textblock>
      Lung adenocarcinoma in Chinese females is hypothesized to be determined by both genetic and
      environmental factors. In this grant proposal, we propose to map the loci of susceptibility
      genes of female lung adenocarcinoma based on multiplex families recruited in Taiwan. We focus
      on a unique pathological type of a unique population in order to reduce heterogeneity of the
      genetic background. Compared with western women, female Chinese population has a high
      prevalence of lung adenocarcinoma. Our reasoning is that if we focus on a specific sub-type,
      which has a familial basis, we will increase the probability of identifying genes associated
      with female lung adenocarcinoma. The primary goal of this study is to identify the genetic
      and environmental determinants of female lung adenocarcinoma, and study the relationship
      between gene polymorphisms and clinical manifestation profiling of lung cancer.

      This research proposal intends to integrate epidemiologists, biostatisticians, clinicians,
      molecular biologists/geneticists to identify susceptible genes for lung cancer, especially
      for female lung adenocarcinoma, and to study the relationship between gene polymorphisms and
      clinical outcomes of lung cancer patients. Our objective is to find gene markers for
      developing useful screening tools for the high risk group in order to prevent or early detect
      lung cancer, especially female lung adenocarcinoma.

      The specific aims of this subproject include:

        1. Establish and maintain the research network that will recruit and follow up the subjects
           and families for the GEFLAC study; keeping control of the progress of the study.

        2. Coordinate all the subprojects such as integrating genotyping data with clinical data
           and environment data.

        3. Continue to employ the candidate gene approach to examine the contribution of specific
           genes to the lung cancer.

        4. Generate genotyping data for candidate genes in the exploring stage and prioritize SNPs
           of candidate genes for large scale studies.

        5. Identify susceptible genes/candidate genes to develop multiplex PCR for screening.
