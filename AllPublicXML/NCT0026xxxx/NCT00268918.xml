      -  Patients will come to the clinic once a week to receive study treatment. To help reduce
           the chance of an allergic reaction patients will take Decadron tablets orally the night
           before, the morning of and the evening of receiving chemotherapy.

        -  The lead-in schedule of dosing is as follows: Day 1: Taxotere intravenously; Day 4:
           PTK787 orally; Day 14: Taxotere and PTK787.

        -  After the lead-in schedule, a cycle will consist of 28 days. PTK787 will be given orally
           once a day without interruption. Taxotere will be given on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Day
           22.

        -  Before each dose of Taxotere, blood tests, urine tests, and a physical exam will be
           done. A radiological evaluation will be done every two months. If the patients tumor
           remains stable or shrinks in size, they may continue to stay on the study.

        -  Patients should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice during this study.
