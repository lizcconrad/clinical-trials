  <brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of DX-88 to Treat Acute Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study (72 Patients, Randomized 1:1) Followed by a Repeat-dosing Phase to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of DX-88 (Ecallantide; Recombinant Plasma Kallikrein Inhibitor) for the Treatment of Acute Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a subcutaneous dose of DX-88 (ecallantide; an
      investigational product) is safe and relieves symptoms of HAE in patients suffering from
      moderate to severe acute attacks of HAE.

    <measure>Treatment Outcome Score at 4 Hours Post-Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours post-dose (DOUBLE-BLIND PART)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Outcome Score (TOS) is a validated, comprehensive measure of symptom response to treatment. At 4 hours , patient assessment of response characterized by their change from baseline in symptom severity and collected by anatomic site of attack involvement, was recorded on a categorical scale (significant improvement [100] to significant worsening [-100]). The response at each anatomic site was weighted by baseline severity and then the weighted scores across all involved sites were averaged to calculate the TOS. Clinically meaningful improvement was indicated by a TOS of 30 or higher.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) Score at 4 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 hours post-dose (DOUBLE-BLIND PART)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score is a validated, comprehensive point-in-time measure of symptom severity. At baseline and 4 hours, patients rated the severity on a categorical scale (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for symptoms at each affected anatomical location. Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score. A decrease in MSCS score reflected an improvement in symptoms; clinically meaningful improvement (minimally important difference) was indicated by a reduction in the score of 0.30 or more.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Significant Improvement in Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours post-dose (DOUBLE-BLIND PART)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall response assessment is a patient-reported assessment of global response to therapy. Patients are asked to perform an overall response assessment at regular intervals, relative to baseline. Patients were asked &quot;overall how are you feeling&quot; compared to how they felt before study drug. Answer options were &quot;a lot worse&quot;, &quot;a little worse&quot;, &quot;same&quot;, &quot;a little better&quot; or &quot;a lot better or resolved&quot;. Significant improvement was the first time that the patient responded to the assessment as &quot;a little better or resolved&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Symptom Complexes of Treated Attack at Baseline(DOUBLE-BLIND PART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported severity of symptom complexes at baseline, by symptom complex and treatment group. Patients were to have at least one symptom complex that was moderate or severe. Patients could present with multiple symptom complexes, some of which could be mild. Mild=noticeable but do not impact daily living activities; Moderate=treatment or intervention is highly desirable and activities of daily living are impacted; Severe=require treatment or intervention due to inability to perform activities of daily living. The results are for number of patients with symptom complexes including mild, moderate and severe, provided the patients have at least one symptom complex that was moderate or severe</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) Score at 4 Hours Post-dose</title>
        <description>Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score is a validated, comprehensive point-in-time measure of symptom severity. At baseline and 4 hours, patients rated the severity on a categorical scale (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for symptoms at each affected anatomical location. Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score. A decrease in MSCS score reflected an improvement in symptoms; clinically meaningful improvement (minimally important difference) was indicated by a reduction in the score of 0.30 or more.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) Score at 4 Hours Post-dose Over Multiple Treatment Episodes</title>
        <description>The Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score is a validated, comprehensive point-in-time measure of symptom severity. At baseline and 4 hours, patients rated the severity on a categorical scale (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for symptoms at each affected anatomical location. Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score. A decrease in MSCS score reflected an improvement in symptoms; clinically meaningful improvement was indicated by a reduction in the score of 0.30 or more.</description>

Patients were asked &quot;overall how are you feeling&quot; compared to how they felt before study drug. Answer options were &quot;a lot worse&quot;, &quot;a little worse&quot;, &quot;same&quot;, &quot;a little better&quot; or &quot;a lot better or resolved&quot;. Significant improvement was the first time that the patient responded to the assessment as &quot;a little better or resolved&quot;.</description>
