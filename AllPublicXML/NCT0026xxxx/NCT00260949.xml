    <textblock>
      There are two ways in which surgeons repair rotator cuff tears. An open method involves
      making an incision (cut) 5-6 inches in length in the skin and repairing the tear with the
      skin open, while the arthroscopic method involves making small holes in the skin and using a
      guiding camera and special equipment to repair the tear. This clinical study is being
      conducted to study the rate of re-tear (one year following surgery) of rotator cuffs that
      have been repaired using the arthroscopic technique.

    <textblock>
      While many studies have researched re-tear rate for rotator cuff tears following open repair,
      to date there have been no studies evaluating re-tear rate following arthroscopic surgery.
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is less invasive and exposes the patient to fewer risks than
      open surgery. Once this pilot study is completed the next step will be to compare the rate of
      re-tear, as assessed via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) between the two techniques. If the
      rate of re-tear is lower following arthroscopic surgery this will provide validation for use
      of the arthroscopic technique. If, however, the rate of re-tear is higher using the
      arthroscopic technique, then use of this technique is not justified.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Diagnosis of rotator cuff tear which will involve one of the following:1) history
             of shoulder pain or weakness2) ability to illicit pain or weakness with one of the
             following signs: tenderness of the rotator cuff insertion, palpable crepitus of the
             subacromial bursa or a palpable defect of the cuff insertion, impingement signs and
             weakness of the rotator cuff musculature3) radiological evidence of rotator cuff tear
             from ultrasound, arthrogram or MRI2. Failed non-operative treatment3. Size of tear of
             less than 5 cm and involving 2 or fewer tendons

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical:1. Tear as defined by significant muscular wasting, inability to actively
             forward-flex (strength grade 2/5 or worse), positive drop sign or hornblowers 2.
             Significant tenderness of acromioclavicular or sternoclavicular joints on affected
             side3. Presence of comorbid shoulder instability or evidence of SLAP lesion4. Previous
             surgery on affected shoulderRadiological:1. Bony abnormality on standardized series of
             x-rays consisting of a minimum of an antero-posterior view, lateral &amp;#8220;Y&amp;#8221;
             view in the scapular plane, and an axillary view.2. Presence of massive cuff tear on
             MRI or ultrasound (defined as &amp;gt; 5 cm or greater than 2 tendons
             torn).Arthroscopic:1. Presence of massive cuff tear as defined above on arthroscopic
             examination of the joint 2. Presence of comorbid conditions: Bankart lesion, SLAP
             lesion3. Inability to complete the repair arthroscopically (eg. partial repair by
             marginal convergence without direct repair to bone)Other:Patients who have any
             contraindication to MRI (including claustrophobia, intracranial aneurism clip, cardiac
             pacemaker, middle ear prosthesis, metallic heart valve prosthesis, prior metal
             fragment in eye (intraocular lens implant) etc.
