      -  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of modafinil in the
           treatment of opioid induced sedation as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).

        -  The secondary objective is to estimate the frequency and severity of toxicity associated
           with Modafinil (400mg) in patients with opioid induced sedation.

      Sedation is a common side effect of opioid analgesics. In patients where this remains a dose
      limiting toxicity, stimulants (caffeine, methylphenidate, ephedrine, amphetamine) have been
      the primary class of agents used to counteract sedation. Modafinil is a novel stimulant that
      is FDA approved for the treatment of narcolepsy and has a very different side effect profile
      than traditional stimulants. The potential role of this agent in the treatment of opioid
      induced sedation remains undefined. This study, which utilizes a prospective, randomized,
      blinded, cross-over design, will collect daily information on sedation (Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale), pain, opioid consumption, and adverse effects in 90 patients suffering from opioid
      induced sedation within the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.
