    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying eosinophil growth,
      survival, migration, and function and to investigate and further characterize the
      pathophysiology of, clinical manifestations of, and spectrum of disease severity of
      eosinophilic inflammation in humans.
