    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of a topical gel
      formulation of nitroglycerin, in comparison to a matching placebo, for patients with moderate
      to severe primary Raynaud's phenomenon or patients with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to
      autoimmune diseases, such as scleroderma.
