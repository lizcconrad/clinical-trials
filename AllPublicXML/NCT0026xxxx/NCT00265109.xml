  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness of a medication (Levetiracetam) for
      people with body dysmorphic disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a perceived defect in appearance (e.g., a &quot;large&quot; nose or
      facial &quot;scarring&quot;), is a relatively common disorder that causes marked distress and
      impairment in functioning. Recent data suggests that adults with BDD may respond to serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SRIs); however, response to SRIs is often only partial. About one third
      of patients do not respond to an SRI. Furthermore, patients may stop taking SRIs because of
      side effects (e.g., sexual side effects). For these reasons, additional monotherapy and SRI
      augmentation strategies are greatly needed.

      Levetiracetam is primarily used as an antiseizure medication and has a wider safety margin
      than other antiepileptics. Preliminary scientific studies may suggest that it may be helpful
      for certain psychiatric symptoms and disorders. In the present study we propose to obtain
      pilot data on 1) levetiracetam monotherapy and 2) levetiracetam augmentation of SRIs in
      patients with BDD.

    <description>The BDD-YBOCS, a reliable and valid 12-item semi-structured clinician-administered scale assessed BDD severity during the past week. 38 items are rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms); range=0-48.

    <description>The initial levetiracetam dose will be 250 mg/day, which will be increased to 250 mg BID after 1 week. The dose will then be increased by 500 mg/day each week (given in BID dosing) to a maximum of 3,000 mg/day. The dose will be raised more slowly or the maximum dose will not be reached if response occurs at a lower dose or side effects are problematic. Subjects who are unable to tolerate at least 500 mg a day of levetiracetam will be withdrawn from the study.</description>

          <title>Open-Label Levetiracetam</title>
          <description>All 17 participants in the study received Levetiracetam. The initial dose was 250 mg/day, which was increased to 250 mg BID after 1 week. The dose was then increased by 500 mg/day each week (given in BID dosing) to a maximum of 3,000 mg/day. The dose was raised more slowly or the maximum dose was not reached if response occurred at a lower dose or side effects were problematic.</description>
