      The purpose of the study is to evaluate an intravenous (by injection) investigational
      medication to treat moderate to severe inflammatory, nonstricturing, nonpenetrating Crohn's
      disease. The research is being conducted at up to 5 clinical research sites in the US and
      Europe and is open to both men and women ages 18 to 70 years old. Participants in the study
      will have a number of visits to a research site up to 17 months. All study-related care and
      medication is provided to qualified participants at no cost: this includes all visits,
      examinations and laboratory work.

      Visilizumab is a humanized antibody (antibodies are proteins that are normally made by the
      immune system to help defend the body from infections and other foreign substances) that is
      directed against T cells. Visilizumab selectively attacks problematic T cells and, in doing
      so, it may prevent them from causing inflammation. Visilizumab has also been observed to have
      a suppressive effect on the body's immune system (system in the body that reacts to foreign
      or occasionally one's own proteins).
