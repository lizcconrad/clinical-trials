  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      “Health” includes physical and mental aspects. The evaluation of “Mental Health” contains
      four domains: psychophysical health, perceived security of the living world, meaning and
      worth of life, satisfaction of family-social interaction.

      We have established a Taiwan Mental Health Index scale based on literature review and
      experts’ opinions in 2002. The reliability and validity were assessed to be satisfactory.
      This TMHI scale has been applied in nation-wide mental health surveys of 2002, 2003, and
      2004.

      In order to evaluate the effect of mental health promotion activities, this research project
      will adopt this TMHI scale as the assessment tool. 300 people will be recruited for study
      after signing the informed consent. The general population sample of 1076 subjects recruited
      in 2004, will be as the comparison sample. The difference in 4 dimensions of MHI will be
      analyzed between these two study groups. The 300 study subjects will be subcategorized into
      two groups of low and high attendance groups. The difference in MHI between groups will also
      be statistically examined using independent t-test. The statistical signification is set at
      α=0.05.

      This study result will be as the reference for setting up effective mental health promotion
      program for general public.
