    <textblock>
      Community members within the treatment city will report: 1)engaging in fewer sexual risk
      practices; 2)significantly higher condom use; 3) significantly higher rates of STD care
      seeking (including STD screening behaviors); 4) fewer having STDs in the past 6 months; 5)
      significantly higher awareness scores regarding syphilis and other STDs, as compared with
      those in the comparison city.

      The C-POL in Alabama project is and intervention study which sought to impact the health
      behaviors of community residents who live in zip codes that have high syphilis morbidity. The
      study is being implemented in Birmingham and Montgomery with shelter clients.

      The intervention model used for this study is the Popular Opinion Leader (POL) model, which
      is effective at reducing new HIV infections. The intent of this study was to determine the
      effectiveness of a diffusion model (e.g. POL) at reducing syphilis infections in affected
      communities.

      For the intervention, community members identified as popular opinion leaders were recruited
      and trained to share accurate information about syphilis transmission, symptoms, testing,
      treatment and prevention. Prior to intervention implementation and several times after,
      community members were given a survey and screened for syphilis as well as 2-3 additional
      STDs. During each assessment, cross-sections of the community members were sampled.
