  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abciximab, an
      anti-platelet therapy, versus placebo in patients with unstable angina who are not responding
      to standard medical therapy and who are eligible for coronary angioplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      abciximab, an anti-platelet therapy, in patients with unstable angina who are not responding
      to standard medical therapy and who are eligible for coronary angioplasty. The primary
      outcomes of the study include any of the following within 30 days: the number of deaths from
      any cause, myocardial infarctions or the number of recurrent ischemic events requiring urgent
      intervention (such as a coronary artery bypass surgery, repeat coronary angioplasty, coronary
      stent placement, or intra-aortic balloon pump). Please see attached results.

      Patients will be treated with abciximab or matching placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with refractory angina as evidenced by at least one episode of ischemia
             (chest pain and/or ST-T changes) despite bed rest and at least 2 hours of treatment
             with oral or intravenous nitrates and intravenous heparin, or persistent newly
             developed negative T-waves occurring or continuing after at least 2 hours of treatment
             with oral or intravenous nitrates and intravenous heparin

          -  Having clinical signs and symptoms of angina at rest or minimal exertion with dynamic
             ST-segment and/or T-wave changes

          -  Having an episode of chest pain within 48 hours prior to the start of study agent
             administration

          -  Having a culprit lesion in a single native coronary vessel suitable for angioplasty on
             the qualifying angiogram

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction, unless CK has returned to less
             than twice the upper limit of normal

          -  Having features of ongoing ischemia that would require immediate intervention, or had
             a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within the past 24 hours

          -  Having an unprotected occlusion of the main left coronary artery &gt; 50%, a culprit
             lesion located in a venous or arterial bypass graft, or recent bleeding or a condition
             associated with increased bleeding risk

          -  Receiving concurrent administration of oral anticoagulants at the time of study entry,
             administration of intravenous dextran (prior to or planned for use during
             angioplasty), or planned administration of thrombolytic agent prior to or during
             angioplasty

          -  Having persistent hypertension at admission despite treatment, or a platelet count
             less than 100,000 per millimeter cubed
