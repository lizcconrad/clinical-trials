      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with irinotecan may
      kill more tumors cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of bevacizumab and how well giving
      bevacizumab together with irinotecan works in treating patients with recurrent or refractory
      gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride in patients with
           recurrent or refractory grade 3 or 4 malignant gliomas.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the activity of this regimen, in terms of progression-free survival, in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride every 2 weeks. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 68 patients will be accrued for this study.
