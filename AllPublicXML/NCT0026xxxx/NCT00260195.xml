      This study will develop a program to help school children deal with violence-related trauma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of children who have been indirectly or directly exposed to violence has
      dramatically increased in the last decade. The emotional and behavioral consequences of
      violence exposure can be particularly devastating to children. Interventions are needed that
      can reduce symptoms related to traumas already experienced and enhance children's skills for
      handling extreme stress that might be experienced in the future. The Cognitive-Behavioral
      Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS) program was developed between 1998 and 2001 to
      help children in the Los Angeles school district deal with traumatic events. Although
      promising, the program required a school-based mental health clinician for implementation.
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a program adapted for the Los Angeles CBITS
      program that can be used by school staff in a middle school setting. The adapted CBITS
      program will be compared to a wait list to determine which is more effective in reducing
      trauma-related stress and depression among sixth grade students.

      Students who have experienced violence-related trauma will be randomly assigned to receive
      either 10 weekly sessions of group cognitive behavioral therapy or to wait 3 months.
      Self-report scales and interviews will be used to assess the emotional states of participants
      at study entry and study completion. No follow-up visits will be required.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Symptoms over the past two weeks were assessed at baseline, after intervention for the SSET group (10 weeks), and after all receive intervention (20 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>We used the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS; Foa,Treadwell, Johnson, &amp; Feeny, 2001), to assess PTSD symptoms for both screening into the program and for use in examining child outcomes over time. This scale has been used in school aged children as young as 8 and has shown good convergent and discriminant validity and high reliability (Foa et al., 2001). In our earlier work, scale internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89; Jaycox et al., 2002). In this study, we use it as a continuous scale as designed, and also use cut-points to determine eligibility for the study as in prior work (Kataoka et al., 2003; Stein et al., 2003), requiring a total score of 11 or greater, indicating moderate levels of current PTSD symptoms. A high score indicates more symptoms, and total scores can range from 0 to 51.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Symptoms over the past two weeks were assessed at baseline, after intervention for the SSET group (10 weeks), and after all receive intervention (20 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1981) This 27-item measure assesses children's cognitive, affective, and behavioral depressive symptoms. The scale has high internal consistency, moderate test-retest reliability, and correlates in the expected direction with measures of related constructs (e.g., self-esteem, negative attributions, and hopelessness; Kendall, Cantwell, &amp; Kazdin, 1989). Normative data are available (Finch, Saylor, &amp; Edwards, 1985). We used a 26-item version of the scale that omits an item about suicidal ideation. Higher scores indicate more symptoms, and total scores can range from 0 to 52.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Report of Behavioral Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>Problems over the prior month were assessed at baseline, after intervention for the SSET group (10 weeks), and after all receive intervention (20 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire—Parent Report, and Teacher Report (SDQ, Goodman, 1997; Goodman, Meltzer, &amp; Bailey, 1998) This questionnaire contains 25 items, 20 assessing problem areas (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and peer relationship problems), 5 assessing prosocial behavior, and items that tap functional impairment related to these problems (Goodman, 1999). Higher scores indicate more problems, with total scores for problem areas ranging from 0 to 40.</description>

      <recruitment_details>We recruited and screened 6th and 7th grade students in two schools over two school years (2005-2006 and 2006-2007) in Los Angeles Unified School District.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There are 3 steps in enrollment: consent for screening, screening, consent for participation for those who screened positive. 383 students were screened, 193 screened positive, 78 consented for the project (active parental consent and child assent). 2 students withdrew from the school prior groups and thus did not participate further.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms</title>
        <description>We used the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS; Foa,Treadwell, Johnson, &amp; Feeny, 2001), to assess PTSD symptoms for both screening into the program and for use in examining child outcomes over time. This scale has been used in school aged children as young as 8 and has shown good convergent and discriminant validity and high reliability (Foa et al., 2001). In our earlier work, scale internal consistency was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89; Jaycox et al., 2002). In this study, we use it as a continuous scale as designed, and also use cut-points to determine eligibility for the study as in prior work (Kataoka et al., 2003; Stein et al., 2003), requiring a total score of 11 or greater, indicating moderate levels of current PTSD symptoms. A high score indicates more symptoms, and total scores can range from 0 to 51.</description>
        <time_frame>Symptoms over the past two weeks were assessed at baseline, after intervention for the SSET group (10 weeks), and after all receive intervention (20 weeks).</time_frame>

        <title>Depressive Symptoms</title>
        <description>Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1981) This 27-item measure assesses children’s cognitive, affective, and behavioral depressive symptoms. The scale has high internal consistency, moderate test-retest reliability, and correlates in the expected direction with measures of related constructs (e.g., self-esteem, negative attributions, and hopelessness; Kendall, Cantwell, &amp; Kazdin, 1989). Normative data are available (Finch, Saylor, &amp; Edwards, 1985). We used a 26-item version of the scale that omits an item about suicidal ideation. Higher scores indicate more symptoms, and total scores can range from 0 to 52.</description>
