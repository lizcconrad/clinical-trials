  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety of 40 mg MEDI-517, with a
      control of aluminum hydroxide, when given to healthy adult women who have evidence of HPV-16
      and/or HPV-18 DNA detected in cervical brushings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unless previously surgically sterilized, agrees to use an effective method of birth
             control (e.g., abstinence, intrauterine contraceptive device, oral contraceptives,
             diaphragm or condom in combination with contraceptive jelly, cream or foam, Norplant®
             or DepoProvera®) beginning 30 days before the first study injection and continuing
             through 60 days after the final study injection

          -  Healthy by medical history and physical examination

          -  Cervical specimen positive for HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 DNA using the Digene Hybrid
             Capture® II HPV test within 21 days of study entry

          -  Cervical cytology by Pap smear that is either normal or no greater than ASCUS or
             AGCUS, using the Cytyc ThinPrep® Pap Test, within 21 days of study entry (a normal Pap
             smear must also be adequate for interpretation; a Pap smear that is normal but
             inadequate for interpretation must be repeated). Those volunteers with ASCUS or AGCUS
             must have had a clinical evaluation by colposcopy within the previous month which
             showed no evidence of CIN or SIL.

          -  No evidence of anogenital HPV lesions or no physical findings suggestive of other
             gynecologic pathogens on pelvic examination within 21 days of study entry

          -  Agrees to no other experimental therapy or vaccines until 30 days after the last study
             injection

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the volunteer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute illness or fever (oral temperature ³99.5°F [37.5°C]) at start of the study

          -  History or clinical manifestations of significant medical or psychiatric disorder

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medication (inhaled and topical corticosteroids are
             permitted) within the previous 90 days or history of immunodeficiency

          -  History of cancer

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 2 years

          -  At screening (must be within 21 days of study entry) any of the following: hemoglobin
             &lt;11 gm/dL; white blood cell count &lt;4000/mm3; platelet count &lt;120,000/mm3; AST, ALT,
             creatinine &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal for the laboratory in question; other abnormal
             laboratory values in the screening panel which in the opinion of the principal
             investigator are judged to be clinically significant

          -  Receipt of immunoglobulin or blood products within 90 days prior to study entry

          -  History of Pap smear more severe than ASCUS or AGCUS

          -  Positive tests for hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV-1
             antibody

          -  Any prior receipt of any vaccine or therapy (experimental or otherwise) for treatment
             or prophylaxis of genital warts or other papillomavirus related condition. Any
             treatment of genital warts or other papillomavirus related condition within six months
             of randomization (local therapy for common skin and/or plantar warts is allowed)

          -  Prior receipt of any vaccine containing monophosphoryl lipid A or SBAS4 adjuvant (no
             vaccines currently licensed contain these)

          -  Receipt of any experimental vaccine within 90 days prior to entry into this study

          -  Receipt of any experimental drug therapy within 30 days or five half-lives of the
             experimental drug (if the half-life is known), whichever is longer
