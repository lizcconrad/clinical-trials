    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the PROMETA pharmacotherapy compared
      to placebo for initiating abstinence and for preventing relapse to methamphetamine use in
      treatment-seeking individuals meeting criteria for methamphetamine abuse. It is hypothesized
      that individuals assigned to receive the PROMETA pharmacotherapy, compared to placebo, will
      demonstrate significantly fewer and less intense withdrawal symptoms, more days abstinent
      from methamphetamine use, and fewer relapses to methamphetamine use as assessed by
      self-report of drug use verified by urine samples.

      Using a double-blind placebo design, the effectiveness of the Prometa protocol for
      methamphetamine dependence will be investigated as compared to a placebo condition. The
      procedure utilizes a combination of medications delivered both orally and by infusion in a
      controlled medical setting. Participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication
      or placebo condition, and will receive medications for 40 days, including two inpatient
      hospitalization phases of three days each. All participants will also receive once-weekly
      psychosocial cognitive-behavioral therapy throughout the 106 day study duration. A variety of
      data will be collected throughout the study, including psychological, cognitive, medical, and
      laboratory assessments.

    <description>During the Infusion periods, participants in the placebo condition will receive pre-treatment with hydroxyzine (50mg) followed by placebo medications administered both orally and through infusion, as well as a second dose of hydroxyzine (50mg), delivered at the same rate and delivery system to match the active condition. All participants may receive daily multivitamins as determined appropriate by the study physician. Multivitamins are not considered active medications for the PROMETA pharmacotherapy, but may be provided to participants in both conditions at the same rates and delivery methods for the duration of the study. Because participants are treatment-seeking and use of a placebo condition is warranted, all participants will be provided with once weekly, manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy sessions during all outpatient periods of the study.</description>

    <description>During the infusion periods, participants assigned to the PROMETA pharmacotherapy condition will receive pre-treatment with hydroxyzine (50mg) followed by intravenous flumazenil (2mg) over a 2-hour period. Before bedtime, patients will again take 50mg of hydroxyzine orally, as well as 300mg of oral gabapentin (participants will titrate up their dosage of gabapentin each day - 300mg on day 0, 600mg on day 1, 900mg on day 2). All participants may receive daily multivitamins as determined appropriate by the study physician. Multivitamins are not considered active medications for the PROMETA pharmacotherapy, but may be provided to participants in both conditions at the same rates and delivery methods for the duration of the study. Because participants are treatment-seeking and use of a placebo condition is warranted, all participants will be provided with once weekly, manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy sessions during all outpatient periods of the study.</description>
