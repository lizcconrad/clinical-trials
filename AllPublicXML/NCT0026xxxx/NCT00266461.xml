  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI), a transient impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) motility, commonly
      occurs in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery and contributes to postoperative
      morbidity, including delayed enteral nutrition, increased patient discomfort, and prolonged
      hospitalization. POI appears to be have many causes, with activation of inhibitory reflexes,
      inflammatory responses, and the effects of anesthesia and analgesics all playing roles.
      However, there is no approved pharmacological therapy for the treatment and prevention of
      POI.

      Daikenchuto (TU-100) is an herbal formulation consisting of Asian ginseng, Zanthoxylum fruit
      (Sichuan pepper), ginger, and malt sugar, which was originally described in Jin kui yao lue,
      the classical medical textbook written in ancient China in the third century by Zhang Zhong
      Jing. Since it was introduced to Japan, Daikenchuto has been used in the treatment of
      abdominal pain and a feeling of coldness in the abdomen.

      TSUMURA Daikenchuto Extract Granules, Product Code TU-100, is a modern herbal product
      manufactured in the dosage form of granules by Tsumura &amp; Co. The current Tsumura product,
      TU-100, was approved for manufacture as a prescription drug in 1986 by the Japanese Ministry
      of Health and Welfare and has been sold commercially as a prescription Kampo (a generic term
      for the system of traditional medicine that was developed in Japan after being introduced
      from China in the fourth century) drug in Japan for many years. The drug product proposed for
      use in the clinical studies is identical to the drug currently sold in Japan. In addition,
      all three botanical components and maltose syrup powder are considered as food substances and
      are currently part of the United States food supply.

      The purpose of this study evaluate the tolerability, efficacy and safety of TU-100 for the
      treatment of postoperative ileus (POI) in patients undergoing laparotomy for large bowel
      resection

      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label study designed to evaluate the tolerability and
      efficacy of TU-100 for the treatment of POI in patients undergoing laparotomy for large bowel
      resection. It will be conducted at multiple centers in the United States. A total of 24
      patients will be enrolled in the study. Patient participation in the study will last for up
      to 32 days (from Screening to postoperative day 10 [POD 10] or until the time when a
      discharge order is written for the patient, whichever comes first), with follow-up safety
      assessments to occur 7 and 14 days after the last dose of study medication.
