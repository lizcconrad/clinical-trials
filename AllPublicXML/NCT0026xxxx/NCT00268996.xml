    <measure>Mean Circulating High Sensitivity C- Reactive Protein (Hs-CRP) Levels at Week 52.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>hs-CRP is a pentameric protein that is rapidly upregulated in response to inflammation and tissue damage and assessed as circulating biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) data was reported. Only data from 3 months onwards was carried forward. hs-CRP has a skewed distribution and values were log transformed before analysis. The statistics was calculated on the log transformed data and back transformed. The adjusted geometric means of hs-CRP levels at Week 52 were reported. The levels were analyzed using analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA), with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) status, pooled country and treatment included as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Density of Rotterdam Classification (ROC) Grade III/IV Strain Spots/10 Millimeter (mm) Within the Region of Interest (ROI) on IVUS Grey Scale Based Palpography at the End of Week 52.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The ROC grade III/IV strain spots per 10 millimetre (mm) within the ROI on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) grey scale based palpography were assessed and change from Baseline at end of 52 was reported. Change from Baseline was calculated as the density of spots at the end of study minus the density of spots recorded at Baseline. If either value was considered missing then the change from Baseline value was missing for the participant. Between treatment group comparisons of change from Baseline were analyzed using ANCOVA adjusting for ACS status, pooled country, Baseline value, matched segment length and treatment. Adjusted means and associated standard errors for each treatment group were presented. The baseline value for each participant was defined as the last value prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

        <title>Mean Circulating High Sensitivity C- Reactive Protein (Hs-CRP) Levels at Week 52.</title>
        <description>hs-CRP is a pentameric protein that is rapidly upregulated in response to inflammation and tissue damage and assessed as circulating biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) data was reported. Only data from 3 months onwards was carried forward. hs-CRP has a skewed distribution and values were log transformed before analysis. The statistics was calculated on the log transformed data and back transformed. The adjusted geometric means of hs-CRP levels at Week 52 were reported. The levels were analyzed using analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA), with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) status, pooled country and treatment included as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Density of Rotterdam Classification (ROC) Grade III/IV Strain Spots/10 Millimeter (mm) Within the Region of Interest (ROI) on IVUS Grey Scale Based Palpography at the End of Week 52.</title>
        <description>The ROC grade III/IV strain spots per 10 millimetre (mm) within the ROI on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) grey scale based palpography were assessed and change from Baseline at end of 52 was reported. Change from Baseline was calculated as the density of spots at the end of study minus the density of spots recorded at Baseline. If either value was considered missing then the change from Baseline value was missing for the participant. Between treatment group comparisons of change from Baseline were analyzed using ANCOVA adjusting for ACS status, pooled country, Baseline value, matched segment length and treatment. Adjusted means and associated standard errors for each treatment group were presented. The baseline value for each participant was defined as the last value prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

        <title>Mean Interlukin 6 (IL-6) Levels as Circulating Biomarkers Associated With Inflammatory Burden at Week 26 and Week 52</title>
        <description>Blood was collected at baseline, Week 4, 13, 26 and 52 for evaluation of biomarkers. Mean IL-6 levels as circulating biomarkers associated with inflammatory burden at Week 26 and Week 52 were assessed and reported. LOCF data was reported. Only data from 3 months onwards was carried forward. IL-6 had a skewed distribution and values were log transformed before analysis. The statistics was calculated on the log transformed data and back transformed. The adjusted geometric means of IL-6 levels at Week 26 and 52 were reported. The levels were analyzed using ANCOVA, with ACS status, pooled country and treatment included as covariates.</description>

        <description>Blood was collected at baseline, Week 4, 13, 26 and 52 for evaluation of biomarkers. Mean sCD40L levels as circulating biomarker associated with inflammatory burden at Week 26 and Week 52 were assessed and reported. sCD40L had a skewed distribution and values were log transformed before analysis. The statistics was calculated on the log transformed data and back transformed. The adjusted geometric means of sCD40L levels at Week 26 and 52 were reported.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vessel Volume and Lumen Volume as IVUS-Grey Scale Assessments at Week 52.</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in vessel volume and lumen volume calculated for each IVUS grey scale assessment recorded. Vessel volume (i.e., coronary remodelling) defined by the leading edge of echogenic adventitia/external elastic membrane (EEM) and calculated as, mean vessel area multiplied mean of vessel length at Baseline and Follow-up. Lumen volume was circumscribed by the leading edge of intima/plaque and calculated as mean lumen area multiplied by mean lumen length at Baseline and Follow-up. The baseline value for each participant was defined as the last value prior to the first dose of study drug. Change from baseline was calculated as vessel volume or lumen volume at Week 52 minus baseline value.</description>

The baseline value for each participant was defined as the last value prior to the first dose of study drug. Change from baseline was calculated as mean area of the parameter (plaque/vessel/lumen) at Week 52 minus baseline value. The data was reported based on observed cases. Data analyzed using ANCOVA, with ACS status, pooled country, baseline value, matched segment length and treatment included as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fibrous Tissue Volume and Fibro-fatty Volume as IVUS-VH Assessments at Week 52</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in fibrous tissue volume and fibro-fatty volume were derived from IVUS system at each IVUS grey scale assessment recorded. Fibrous tissue volume was calculated as mean fibro-fatty area multiplied by mean of Baseline and Follow-up length. Fibro-fatty volume was calculated as mean fibrous area multiplied by mean of Baseline and Follow-up length.
The baseline value for each participant was defined as the last value prior to the first dose of study drug. Change from baseline was calculated as mean Fibrous tissue volume or Fibro-fatty volume at Week 52 minus baseline value. The data was reported based on observed cases. Data analyzed using ANCOVA, with ACS status, pooled country, baseline value , matched segment length and treatment included as covariates.</description>
