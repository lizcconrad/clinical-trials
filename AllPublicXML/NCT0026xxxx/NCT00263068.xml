  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label trial to assess safety and tolerability of rotigotine (SPM
      936) in subjects with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), administered at an optimal
      dose for up to 1 year. Subjects who successfully completed the Maintenance Period and the
      Taper Period of SP792 are allowed to enroll in this trial.

      All subjects will begin the Titration Period at a daily dosage of 1.125mg rotigotine (2.5cm2
      patch). Subjects will be up-titrated at 7-day intervals in 1.125mg (2.5cm2 increments,
      initial titration step only) and 2.25mg intervals (5cm2) increments to a maximum dose of
      6.75mg/day (15cm2) rotigotine. The maximum length of titration is 28 days (Â±3 days), although
      not all subjects will require 28 days to reach their optimal dose.

      A subject's dose may be increased or decreased, as needed by the investigator to maintain a
      subject's effective dose during the Maintenance Period. A Taper Period is provided to allow
      for safe, gradual withdrawal from trial medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has an ongoing serious adverse event from SP792 that is assessed to be related
             to the trial medication by the investigator and/or the sponsor.

          -  Subject is pregnant, nursing, or is a woman of child-bearing potential who is not
             surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or does not consistently use 2 combined
             effective methods of contraception, including at least 1 barrier method, unless
             sexually abstinent.

          -  Subject has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, can jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to participate
             in this trial.
