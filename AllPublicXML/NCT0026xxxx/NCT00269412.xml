    <textblock>
      This is placebo-controlled study of three rifaximin doses in patients with DIBS. Subjects
      will be randomized to receive daily doses of placebo BID, rifaximin 275 mg BID, rifaximin 550
      mg BID, or 1100 mg BID for 14 days. These four groups will subsequently receive an additional
      two weeks of placebo for a total of 4 weeks of treatment. A fifth group of subjects will
      receive rifaximin 550 mg BID for a period of 28 days. Subjects who successfully respond to
      treatment at the end of the 28-day Treatment Phase will be followed in a Post-treatment Phase
      that includes study visits during Weeks 6, 8, 12 and 16. Subjects who relapse during the
      Post-treatment Phase will be discontinued from the study.

      While IBS is one of the most common chronic medical conditions the etiology of IBS is
      unknown. Although not a life-threatening illness, IBS is considered to be a serious condition
      that has a substantial impact on a subject's day-to-day function. IBS is characterized by
      abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, including diarrhea, constipation, or alternating
      diarrhea and constipation. Symptoms are typically intermittent but may be continuous.
