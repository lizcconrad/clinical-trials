      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of inhaled ASM8 for the treatment of allergen-induced asthma.
      Individuals with stable, mild to moderate allergic asthma by American Thoracic Society (ATS)
      criteria (1), with a history of episodic wheeze and shortness of breath, will be eligible for
      enrolment. The study is divided into 2 parts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part 1: Men and women 18 to 65 years of age; generally good health; mild to moderate,
             stable, allergic asthma as defined by ATS criteria (1); history of episodic wheeze and
             shortness of breath; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at baseline ≥70% of
             the predicted value; able to comprehend and follow all required study procedures;
             willing and able to sign an informed consent form.

        Part 2: Methacholine challenge at baseline (PC20 ≤16 mg/mL); positive skin-prick test to
        common aeroallergens (cat, dust mite, grass, pollen) and positive allergen-induced early
        and late airway bronchoconstriction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Part 1 and Part 2: Significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness; known
             coagulopathy, worsening of asthma or respiratory infection in the preceding 6 weeks;
             use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids within the last 28 days, antihistamines,
             immunosuppressives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or anticoagulants
             (intermittent doses of short-acting β2-agonist are allowed); use of medications that
             may interact with ASM8; investigational drug use within 30 days; any clinically
             significant abnormality on screening laboratory determinations; current tobacco use in
             previous 3 months or 10 pack-years; pregnant or lactating women; women actively
             seeking pregnancy or who are not using adequate contraception; history of serious
             adverse effect (SAE) or hypersensitivity to any drug; 20% decrease in FEV1 or FVC with
             baseline saline in methacholine challenge during screening.
