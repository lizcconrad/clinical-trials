  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) on immune function and cardiovascular disease risk
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a controlled, double-blinded human intervention study the effects of fish oil versus
      control (olive oil) and of a high versus low consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      are investigated. Sixty-seventy healthy men will be randomized to oil capsules and to
      substitute their dietary fats with one of two types of oil and butter-product that we
      provide. Outcome variables are ex vivo cytokine production in full blood and isolated immune
      cells after 24 h of stimulation with bacteria or bacterial components, blood pressure and
      arterial function, plasma concentrations of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, C-reactive protein
      and a number of other markers of endothelial function and cardiovascular risk.

      The hypotheses are that both increased intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (from fish
      oil) and a low consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids increase incorporation of
      docosahexanoic acid in immune cell membranes and that this decreases the inflammatory
      response and potential and improve overall cardiovascular disease risk.

      The mechanistic aspects of this will be further explored by in vitro studies with monocytes
      cultured in the presence of varying amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
