      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
      on hearing in post-menopausal women.

      Background: Female hormone influences on the development and aging of the auditory system are
      not completely understood. The present study retrospectively analyzed and compared hearing
      abilities among post-menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), treated with
      estrogen and progesterone (E+P); estrogen alone (E), and a third (control - NHRT) group,
      matched for age, who did not receive any HRT.

      Methods: 126 subjects, (60-86 yr), N=32, E+P; N=31, E; N= 63, NHRT; matched for age and
      health status participated. All had relatively healthy medical histories, absence of
      significant noise exposure, middle ear problems, major surgeries or current/heavy smoking.
      Hearing tests included pure tone audiometry (PTA), tympanometry, distortion-product
      otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and
      hearing-in-noise-test (HINT). The latter is a test for speech perception in background noise:
      the major complaint of hearing-impaired persons.
