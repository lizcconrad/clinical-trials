  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Strongest Families (formerly Family Help Program)is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the Strongest Families distance intervention compared to usual or standard
      care that is typically provided to children with mild to moderate Attention
      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. This is a single-centre trial based at the IWK Health Centre.
      The primary outcome is change in diagnosis.

      The purpose of the Strongest Families (formerly Family Help Program): is to deliver, primary
      care mental health services to children and their families in the comfort and privacy of
      their own home. Approximately 60 children (8-12 years of age)suffering from mild to moderate
      (but clinically significant) symptoms of pediatric Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
      will be randomized.

      The intervention is delivered from a distance, using educational materials (manuals,
      video-tapes, audio-tapes) and telephone consultation with a trained paraprofessional &quot;coach&quot;
      who is supervised by a licensed health care professional. The telephone coach delivers
      consistent care based on written protocols, with on-going evaluation by a professional team.

      Fifty percent of the eligible participants will receive Strongest Families (formerly Family
      Help Program): telephone-based treatment and 50% will be referred back to their family
      physician to receive standard care as determined by that physician. Those receiving standard
      care will be evaluated for outcome results and then compared to the Strongest Families
      treated participants. It is anticipated that Strongest Families treatment will be proven to
      be as or more effective than standard care.
