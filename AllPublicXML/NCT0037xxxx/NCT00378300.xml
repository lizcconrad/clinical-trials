  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the clinical effects of taking probiotics in patients
      who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. There has been several studies showing
      improvement in the severity of atopic dermatitis after taking probiotics. The mechanism of
      this improvement is currently unknown. We propose that probiotics improve atopic dermatitis
      by stimulating, or increasing, the activity of a special type of cell called the T Regulatory
      cell--which can suppress the activity of allergic disease.

      The central hypothesis of this study is that a subset of commercially available probiotic
      formulations will ameliorate moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children by inducing the
      development of T Regulatory (Treg) cells. We specifically hypothesize that the probiotic
      mixture that induces Treg activity in vitro, will also improve the severity of atopic
      dermatitis in a specific patient by inducing Treg activity in vivo.

        1. We will determine whether probiotic mixtures are better able to ameliorate the severity
           of atopic dermatitis when compared to patients treated with placebo. We will conduct a
           4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate
           the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the clinical severity of atopic dermatitis as
           assessed by our primary outcome measure, the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index.
           We specifically hypothesize that probiotics will clinically improve the disease.

        2. We will assess whether probiotic mixtures induce the development of T regulatory cells
           in patients with atopic dermatitis.

      A. We will measure the relative levels of Tregs in peripheral blood before and after
      probiotic or placebo administration in order to assess whether the probiotic mixtures alter
      Treg development in vivo, and whether these changes correlate with improvement in clinical
      scores. Primary outcomes will be measurements of gene expression and absolute increases in
      cell population. We specifically hypothesize that probiotics will increase Treg activity.

      B. We will also determine if all patients' Tregs have in vitro responses to probiotics. This
      data will be used to correlate whether clinical responders in the study also have strong in
      vitro responses.
