      This is a study of prophylactic Vs preemptive oral valganciclovir for management of
      cytomegalovirus infection in adult renal transplant recipients looking at clinical and
      pharmacoeconomic outcomes. Patients at risk for CMV (D+/R-, D+/R+, D-/R+) were randomized to
      prophylaxis (valganciclovir 900 mg qd for 100 days, n=49) or preemptive therapy (900 mg bid
      for 21 days, n=49) for CMV DNAemia (CMV DNA level &gt;2000 copies/ml in â‰¥ 1 whole blood
      specimens by quantitative PCR done weekly for 16 weeks then at months 5, 6, 9, and 12.
      Clinical and virologic outcomes were measured and pharmacoeconomic outcomes will be analyzed
