  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine and compare the effects of Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), etidronate, HRT
      plus etidronate and no treatment over 5 years in the prevention and treatment of
      glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and fractures in post-menopausal women with asthma.

    <textblock>
      Multicentre trial involving 13 hospitals in United Kingdom, with patients entered by 17
      Consultant Chest Physicians. Consenting patients were randomised in a central office to
      either HRT, etidronate, HRT plus etidronate or no treatment. Information on the progress of
      the patients was requested by the co-ordinating office annually for 5 years after entry to
      the trial. Outcomes were measured as new symptomatic fractures,new or worsening morphometric
      fractures of the thoraco-lumbar spine and changes in bone mineral density.
