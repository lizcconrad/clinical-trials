      RATIONALE: Placing a stent in the esophagus may lessen swallowing difficulties and improve
      quality of life in patients with malignant dysphagia caused by esophageal cancer or
      gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying self-expanding plastic stents to see how
      well they work compared with self-expanding metal stents in treating patients with malignant
      dysphagia caused by esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess differences from baseline in health-related quality of life of patients with
           malignant dysphagia due to cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction
           palliated with self-expanding plastic stents (SEPS) compared to those who receive
           self-expanding metal stents (SEMS).

      Secondary

        -  Perform a cost-effective analysis of each type of stent by independent evaluation of the
           rates of SEPS-related and SEMS-related morbidity that necessitates repeat endoscopic
           interventions and/or additional healthcare costs in these patients.

        -  Analyze effective palliation (degree and duration of improvement of dysphagia) in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the individual rates of complication associated with each type of esophageal
           stent in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo placement of a self-expanding metal stent on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo placement of a self-expanding plastic stent on day 1.
           Health-related quality of life is assessed at baseline, 30 days, and 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.
