  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with recurrent
      or persistent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the activity of sunitinib malate, in terms of rate of progression-free survival for
      ≥ 6 months and objective tumor response, in patients with recurrent or persistent
      leiomyosarcoma of the uterus who have received 1 or 2 prior cytotoxic therapies.

      II. Determine the frequency and severity of adverse events.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
