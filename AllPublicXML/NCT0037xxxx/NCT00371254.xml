        <title>Percentage Change in Tumor Biomarkers</title>
        <description>Tumor markers are indicators of tumor activity which may be used to predict clinical benefit and circulating biomarkers may reveal key mechanisms of action. Tissue staining was performed for caveolin, phospho-caveolin, EphA2 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) markers using immunohistochemistry assays.</description>

        <title>Profiling of Messenger-ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Expression: mRNA Signal Intensity</title>
        <description>Pharmacogenomic analysis included the assessment of the relationship between clinical benefit and mRNA expression levels and between clinical benefit and protein phosphorylation. Tumor mRNA expression was analyzed in all available tissues. mRNA was extracted from 96 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) samples, amplified, and fluorescently labeled. Gene expression profiling was conducted using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 DNA microarrays. mRNA expression is reported as quantile normalized RMA values.</description>
