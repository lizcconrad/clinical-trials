  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study will test the following hypotheses in patients with stage I-II low
      grade marginal zone (MZ) lymphoma:

        -  Involved Field Radiotherapy will produce a complete response rate of &gt; 90%

        -  Radiotherapy will be associated with a locoregional progression of &lt; 20% after 10 years

        -  Death from MZ lymphoma will occur in &lt; 40% of patients within 10 years of radiotherapy

      This study secondary objectives are:

        -  To collect information on the prevalence of H. pylori in non-gastric MALT lymphoma

        -  To estimate rates of acute and late toxicity of radiotherapy
    </textblock>

      Aims of the study :

        -  To conduct the first multicentre prospective trial of radiotherapy (RT) in stage I-II
           Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL)

        -  To prospectively identify causal factors for MZL, including infection and inflammatory
           disease

      This study will be the first large trial of any form of therapy for stage I-II, non-gastric
      marginal zone lymphoma. There is an enormous deficit in the literature with respect to this
      fascinating but relatively recently-recognised entity. MZL is commonly associated with
      underlying inflammatory or infective disorders and it is clear, at least in some cases with
      infection by organisms called Helicobacter pylori and Chlamydia psitacci, that the
      inflammatory condition can actually cause the lymphoma. The role of H. pylori infection has
      not been well studied in non gastric MZL in large prospective studies, despite anecdotal
      reports of regression of non gastric MZL after H. pylori eradication. There have been reports
      of responses to doxycycline (antibacterial) therapy in patients with evidence of chlamydial
      infection (C. psitacci) in MZL of the tissues around the eye. This association has not been
      well studied in any large prospective study and no long-term data for doxycycline therapy
      exist. Management of stage I-II MZL is variable and often ad-hoc in Australia, despite
      significant retrospective evidence to support radiotherapy (RT) as the curative treatment
      modality of choice. In this TROG/ALLG joint study, 100 patients will be recruited over 5
      years. All patients will undergo breath tests or endoscopy to detect H. pylori infection.
      Ocular MZL specimens will be sent to Italy to test for C. psitacci. Patients will receive
      highly standardised treatment with RT. This study will definitively document the efficacy and
      safety of RT in stage I and II non-gastric MZL and will include patients with stage IV
      disease limited to paired-organs, as this disease shows a tendency to home in exclusively on
      particular organs, such as salivary glands.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of at least 18 years old with histologically documented non-gastric marginal
             zone lymphoma.

          -  Disease limited to stages I and II after adequate staging (see Appendix II), patients
             with stage IV with extranodal disease confined to paired organs (e.g. salivary glands)
             and including any local extension of this disease into adjacent tissues. Patients with
             involved lymph nodes on the same side of the diaphragm in addition to paired organ
             involvement are also eligible, provided all involved tumour sites, nodal and
             extranodal, can be irradiated to 30 Gy within the tolerance of the relevant normal
             tissues. If paired organ involvement was regarded as a single extranodal site (rather
             than 2 separate sites and hence stage IV), eligible patients would then be regarded as
             having stage IE or IIE disease. Patients with wider dissemination (bone marrow, liver
             etc) are ineligible.

          -  Anticipated life expectancy &gt; 2 years

          -  Given written informed consent

          -  Been assessed by a radiation oncologist

          -  Agree to undergo breath testing for H. pylori and/or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to
             exclude active infection with helicobacter pylori

          -  Must be available for long-term follow up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Splenic marginal zone lymphoma

          -  Received previous locoregional radiotherapy

          -  A medical contraindication to radiotherapy

          -  Any previous or concurrent malignancy other than curatively treated non-melanoma skin
             cancer, level 1 malignant melanoma, or in situ cervical cancer, unless disease and
             treatment-free for 5 years

          -  Such extensive involvement of the thorax that treatment with radiotherapy alone would
             be hazardous because of excessive lung irradiation, even if a shrinking field
             technique were employed

          -  Suspected or confirmed pregnancy

          -  Transformation to large cell lymphoma or other aggressive histology

          -  Disease that is widely disseminated (bone marrow, liver etc)
