  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find an optimal dose of atropine for preventing the rapid
      progression of myopia in children by comparing the efficacy, safety and functional impact of
      binocular treatment with 0.5%, 0.1% and 0.01% atropine and to develop a treatment regimen for
      the routine management of childhood myopia.

      A Randomised, Double-Masked Study to Compare The Safety and Efficacy of Bilateral 0.5%, 0.1%
      &amp; 0.01% Atropine Treatment In Controlling Progression of Myopia In Children

      Study Duration and Visit Schedule Total of 5 years with 15 scheduled visits.

        1. Phase I: 2 years with 8 scheduled visits

        2. Phase II: 3 years with 7 scheduled visits

      STUDY DESIGN This study consists of 2 phases, each with a different design. Phase I is a
      double-masked single-centre clinical trial wherein 400 children aged 6-12 years, with myopia
      of -2.00 D or worse in each eye, and from whom assent and parental/guardian consent have been
      obtained, will be randomised to receive 0.5% atropine, 0.1% atropine or 0.01% atropine once
      nightly in both eyes. Participants will be assigned to treatment in the ratio of 2:2:1,
      respectively. Each child will receive treatment for a period of 2 years during which they
      will be reviewed every 4 months.

      Phase II is an open-label study wherein all children will continue to be followed-up
      regularly for changes in their refractive error after stopping atropine treatment. Those
      children who demonstrate myopia progression of -0.5 D or more, at least on one eye after a
      minimum of 8 months washout period will restart atropine treatment in both eyes. The
      appropriate dose will be determined by analysis of the data from Phase I of the study.
      Treatment will be for a further 2 years and all children, including those not receiving
      treatment, will be reviewed every 6 months.
