      This study will examine whether DMSA, an oral chelating agent that removes mercury and other
      metals from the body, is beneficial for children with autism. DMSA is commonly used to treat
      autism, although it has never been tested in a controlled study and there is no proof that it
      helps children with the disorder. Support for its use is based on single-case reports of
      benefits of chelation with DMSA. This study will help determine whether or not DMSA is useful
      for treating autism.

      Children between 4 and 10 years of age with autism spectrum disorder who weigh at least 33
      pounds, who have detectable, but not toxic, levels of mercury or lead in the blood, and who
      have not previously received chelation therapy may be eligible for this study.

      Participants complete a medical history, behavioral and psychological assessment and physical
      examination. Blood, hair, urine and stool samples are collected for testing.

      Because DMSA can remove minerals the body needs, such as zinc and iron, as well as the toxic
      lead and mercury, participants take a daily multivitamin supplement starting 1 month before
      beginning chelation therapy and continuing for the duration of treatment. After 1 month of
      the supplementation regimen, the children are assigned to receive DMSA or placebo for 12
      weeks, divided into six 2-week cycles. They take the assigned drug 3 times a day on days 1, 2
      and 3 of each cycle and continue the multivitamin every day.

      The children are seen in the clinic immediately before and after the first, third and sixth
      cycles. At each checkup, the parent or guardian answers a set of questions about the child's
      autism symptoms, physical health and medication side effects. Blood, urine and stool samples
      are collected for laboratory testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chelation of metals is widely used in the community to treat individuals with Autism Spectrum
      Disorder (ASD), with some surveys estimating that 1 in 12 children with autism have undergone
      chelation. This widespread use reflects the hypothesis that many cases of ASD are caused by
      exposure to thimerosal, an ethylmercury-based compound used previously in the US as a vaccine
      preservative for routine childhood immunizations. The prevalent use of chelation therapy
      stands in stark contrast with the lack of scientific or clinical evidence of efficacy, and
      creates a public health imperative for empiric data. Thus we propose a controlled trial of
      the effects of chelation on the core behavioral symptoms and overall functioning of children
      with ASD. The present investigation is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study of
      the oral chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; succimer) among 120
      children, ages four to ten years, who meet criteria for ASD. Pre- and post-treatment
      behavioral ratings will be used to evaluate the efficacy of chelation. In addition, children
      will undergo comprehensive medical history, physical examination and laboratory analyses.

      Our objective is to quantify differences in behavioral functioning between the chelation
      treatment group and the placebo control group. Analysis of mercury levels before and during
      the course of treatment will be used to confirm the expected DMSA-induced excretion of
      mercury and to identify differences among children in the extent of excretion. Our primary
      hypothesis is that, on average and relative to the control group, children with ASD who
      undergo chelation with DMSA will show greater improvements in communication and social
      behavior.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, four to ten years of age.

          -  Meets research criteria for ASD (specifically, autism, Asperger Disorder, or Pervasive
             Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified).

          -  Detectable (greater than 0.1 microgram per deciliter) levels of blood lead and/or
             blood mercury.

          -  Each legal guardian must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all
             required tests and examinations. Each legal guardian must understand the nature of the
             study and must provide written consent to study protocol.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  History of allergic reaction to sulfur or thiol-containing substances

          -  History of previous chelation therapy for autism

          -  History of uncontrolled epilepsy

          -  Weight less than 15 kg at screening

          -  Presence of a chronic medical condition that might interfere with study participation
             in which study participation would be contraindicated or in which there may be
             clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory results.

          -  Level of lead above 10 microgram per d, or level of mercury over 44 microgram per
             deciliter (toxic levels that require intervention with chelation and preclude placebo
             assignment) or other evidence of heavy metal toxicity.
