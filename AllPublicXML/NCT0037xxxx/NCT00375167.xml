      The present study will determine if Spaniol and colleague's (1994) Recovery Workbook group
      intervention is an effective clinical tool to move a person with SMI along in their journey
      of recovery. The primary outcome measurements of this study will be the participants'
      perceived level of empowerment, hope and optimism, knowledge of recovery, and life
      satisfaction. This kind of information would add to the current body of knowledge about how
      principles of recovery can be used in psychoeducational programs used by outpatient community
      mental health services.

      ABSTRACT:

      Objective: Adopting the principles of recovery into the mental health field has been a
      growing area for discussion at many different levels of care. The present study will
      determine if Spaniol and colleague's (1994) Recovery Workbook group intervention can be used
      as an effective clinical tool to move a person with a severe mental illness along in their
      journey of recovery. The primary outcome measurements of this study will be the participants'
      perceived level of empowerment, hope and optimism, knowledge of recovery, and life
      satisfaction. Method: The study will be a multicenter, prospective, single-blinded,
      randomized control trial. Sixty participants will be recruited from three Assertive Community
      Treatment Teams (ACTT) in Kingston, Ontario and individuals will be randomized to either the
      control or intervention arm of the study. The control arm of the study will receive their
      regular services from ACTT. The intervention arm will participate in a 10-week
      psychoeducational group program in addition to receiving their regular services from ACTT.
      Results: Analysis will be performed by intention to treat, based on total scores of four
      assessments which will be performed at the trial commencement and termination.
