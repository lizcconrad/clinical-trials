    <textblock>
      CRASH 2 is a large pragmatic randomised placebo controlled trial of the effects of the early
      administration of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid on death, vascular events and
      transfusion requirements. Adults with trauma who are within 8 hours of injury and have either
      significant haemorrhage, or who are considered to be at risk of significant haemorrhage, are
      eligible if the responsible doctor is for any reason substantially uncertain whether or not
      to use an antifibrinolytic agent. Numbered drug or placebo packs will be available in each
      participating emergency department. Randomisation will involve calling a 24-hour freecall
      randomisation service. The call should last only a minute or two and at the end of it the
      randomisation service will specify which numbered treatment pack to use. For hospitals where
      telephone randomisation is not feasible, randomisation will be by taking the next
      consecutively numbered treatment pack. No extra tests are required but a short form must be
      completed one month later or on discharge or on death (whichever occurs first).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All trauma patients with ongoing significant haemorrhage (systolic blood pressure less than
        90 mmHg and/or heart rate more than 110 beats per minute), or who are considered to be at
        risk of significant haemorrhage, and are within 8 hours of the injury, are eligible for
        trial entry if they appear to be at least 16 years old. Although entry is allowed up to 8
        hours from injury, the earlier that patients can be treated the better.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The fundamental eligibility criterion is the responsible doctor's 'uncertainty' as to
        whether or not to use an antifibrinolytic agent in a particular adult with traumatic
        haemorrhage. Patients for whom the responsible doctor considers there is a clear indication
        for antifibrinolytic therapy should not be randomised. Likewise, patients for whom there is
        considered to be a clear contraindication to antifibrinolytic therapy (such as, perhaps,
        those who have clinical evidence of a thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation)
        should not be randomised. Where the responsible doctor is substantially uncertain as to
        whether or not to use an antifibrinolytic, all these patients are eligible for
        randomisation and should be considered for the trial. There are no other pre-specified
        exclusion criteria
