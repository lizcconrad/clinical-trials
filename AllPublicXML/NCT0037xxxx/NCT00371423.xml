    <textblock>
      TAXUS ATLAS Direct Stent is a global, multi-center, single-arm, noninferiority trial
      comparing results from patients in whom the TAXUS Liberté stent was directly implanted
      (direct stenting) versus results from patients in whom implantation with the TAXUS Liberté
      stent was preceded by balloon angioplasty (pre-dilatation). The Control group consists of
      patients in the main TAXUS ATLAS trial, in which pre-dilatation was mandatory. The primary
      objective is to compare outcomes of direct stenting with balloon catheter pre-dilatation. The
      primary hypothesis is that late outcomes with direct stenting of the TAXUS™ Liberté
      Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System will be non-inferior to conventional implantation
      with balloon catheter pre-dilatation
