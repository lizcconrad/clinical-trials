  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of an increased frequency of octreotide acetate
      injections or an increase in dose in partially responsive acromegalic patients with
      persistently uncontrolled disease.

    <measure>Change in Tumor Volume From Screening to End of Study (Week 24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to end of study (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>A pre-treatment magnetic resonance image (MRI) assessment of the pituitary area was required within 12 weeks prior to Screening as a baseline evaluation. A second MRI was performed at the end of the study (Week 24). All MRIs were performed according to protocol-defined guidelines. The tumor volume (mm^3) was calculated from measurements obtained in 3 axes from the MRI images.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12 and end of study (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator asked the participant to score the following symptoms of acromegaly: Headache, perspiration, paresthesia, fatigue, osteoarthralgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome on a 5-point scale (0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe, but not disabling; 4=severe and disabling). The percentage of asymptomatic participants, ie, with a score of 0 for all symptoms, was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Acromegaly Quality of Life (AcroQoL) Questionnaire Physical Scale Score at End of Study (Week 24)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The AcroQoL contains 8 items on Physical aspects. Participants were asked to rate each item on a 1-5 Likert scale measuring either the frequency of occurrence (always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never) or the degree of agreement (completely agree, moderately agree, neither agree nor disagree, moderately disagree, completely disagree). The score on the physical scale can range from 8-40. A higher score indicates better Quality of Life.</description>

    <description>The AcroQoL contains 14 items on Psychological aspects. Participants were asked to rate each item on a 1-5 Likert scale measuring either the frequency of occurrence (always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never) or the degree of agreement (completely agree, moderately agree, neither agree nor disagree, moderately disagree, completely disagree). The score on the psychological scale ranges from 14-70. A higher score indicates better Quality of Life.</description>

            <description>Participants received octreotide 30 mg every 21 days intramuscularly (im) for 6 months, a total of 8 doses. At each study visit, octreotide was administered only after completion of all scheduled efficacy and safety evaluations for that visit. Octreotide was injected im into the right or left gluteal regions. The injections were initially administered by a trained and authorized member of the investigational team. When no study visit at the investigational site was required, the injections were given by a trained nurse or the family doctor.</description>

          <title>Acromegaly Quality of Life (AcroQoL) Questionnaire Psychological Scale Score at End of Study (Week 24)</title>
          <description>The AcroQoL contains 14 items on Psychological aspects. Participants were asked to rate each item on a 1-5 Likert scale measuring either the frequency of occurrence (always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never) or the degree of agreement (completely agree, moderately agree, neither agree nor disagree, moderately disagree, completely disagree). The score on the psychological scale ranges from 14-70. A higher score indicates better Quality of Life.</description>
