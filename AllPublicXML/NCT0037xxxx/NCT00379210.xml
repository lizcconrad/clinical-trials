      The purpose of this study is to examine behavioral and neural changes resulting from
      Mindfulness Meditation Training (MMT), and to use this knowledge in advancing our
      understanding of the mechanisms of attention.

    <textblock>
      Mindfulness Meditation Training (MMT) has been used successfully to decrease stress, pain,
      and adverse health symptoms in a varied subject population. MMT has been described as &quot;paying
      attention in a particular way.&quot; Although attention is a key component of meditation, little
      is known about the cognitive and neural changes within the human attention system that result
      from MMT. In this study, we examine the effects of MMT on the human attention system using
      neurobehavioral measures. Here MMT comprises participation in a
      Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR) course, while the comparison group participates in
      a nutrition education course, both 8 weeks long. We compare the performance and neural
      activity of these groups both before and after participation in the course.

    <description>Meditation training group-- received Mindfulness Based Stress Management from the Penn Program for Stress Management.
The meditation practice initially emphasized attention to a single focus. For most concentrative exercises, this focus was the breath. The sensations of breathing were to be examined closely, and when attention wandered it was to be redirected back to the breath. In other exercises, the focus of attention was to be directed to sensations within specific body parts (body scan exercise) and sensations of walking (walking meditation). During the 5th week of classes, the mindfulness training was expanded to include some explicit training in receptive attention.</description>

    <description>Nutrition education group
An active comparison condition involving nutrition education was offered. This course matched the mindfulness course in all dimensions including course duration, homework, psychosocial support, and teacher expertise. The course was taught by a nurse who had expertise in nutrition and offered a program described in the book, Nutrition for Life by Lisa Hark.</description>

            <groups_desc>Statistical tests are evaluated at an alpha level of 0.05 (corrected, when appropriate, for multiple comparisons). Analyses are performed on both response latency and accuracy on behavioral data. For latency analyses, mean response times for correct trials are calculated for each subject. Repeated-measures ANOVA are used for omnibus tests; paired t-tests are used for individual planned contrasts, with Bonferroni-corrected significance levels to maintain a .05 alpha level</groups_desc>
