    <textblock>
      This research is being done to look at the effects of an experimental drug, ranibizumab, for
      the treatment of a condition called &quot;idiopathic parafoveal telangiectasia&quot; or IPT. IPT is
      caused by swelling in the retina (the light sensitive tissue in the back of the eye) due to
      leaky blood vessels in this area. Swelling in the retina can lead to blurry vision.

      This study is a randomized, interventional case series. A total of 10 patients, seen in the
      Retina Division of the Wilmer Eye Institute, will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized to
      either 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Patients with IPT with
      macular edema documented on optical coherence tomography (OCT) but no choroidal
      neovascularization will be eligible for this study. Exclusion criteria will include other
      forms of retinopathy, active intraocular inflammation, history of poor vision due to
      conditions other than IPT in either eye, and known hypersensitivity to humanized monoclonal
      antibodies.

      After obtaining informed consent, the patient will undergo baseline assessment including
      best-corrected Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity, ocular
      examination, color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and OCT. If both eyes are
      eligible, the study participant and investigator will choose which eye to be considered the
      study eye. The study eye will be assigned at random to receive an intravitreal dose of
      ranibizumab (0.3 mg/0.05 ml or 0.5 mg/0.05 ml) at the baseline, 1 month, and 2 month visits.
      Further monthly injections are at the discretion of the examiner, and may be withheld if
      there is lack of continued improvement (defined as lack of improvement of at least 5 letters
      on an eye chart compared with 2 previous consecutive visits or lack of decrease of the
      retinal center point thickness of at least 50 microns compared with 2 previous consecutive
      visits) or complete success (defined as visual acuity of 20/20 or better or retinal center
      point thickness &lt;225 microns).
