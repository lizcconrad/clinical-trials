  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a new platform in non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation to improve
      survival by harnessing the immunologic potential of donor T-cells to induce and maintain
      long-term remissions in patients with hematologic malignancies without undue toxicity. This
      study involves is the first study in humans directed at optimizing the graft vs leukemia
      effect by infusing activated T-cells from healthy donors prophylactically, months after
      recovery from the initial transplant. Investigators are studying whether the activation of
      donor cells prior to infusion will enhance the patient's ability to &quot;seek and destroy&quot;
      residual malignant cells while also helping the immune system to fight infection without
      increasing the immune reaction against the host.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Disease related Parameters The following categories of patients with High Risk Acute
        Myelogenous Leukemia, MDS, or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in first or second complete
        remission, age less than 70 years old, who would be offered a traditional allogeneic stem
        cell transplant but are ineligible for, or unwilling to undergo, Allo SCT, will be eligible
        for this study.

        High Risk AML in CR1 is defined as having one of the following:

          -  Intermediate or Poor risk cytogenetics at presentation; Extramedullary involvement
             (other than CNS); High WBC at presentation (&gt;20,000); AML evolving out of
             Myelodysplasia, regardless of cytogenetics M3 in CR2 only

          -  Patients with residual myelodysplasia after induction chemotherapy for AML

          -  Patients who require a second course of induction chemotherapy to achieve remission
             status are felt to be inherently at high risk and will be considered eligible for this
             study

        MDS-Patients deemed to have high risk MDS based on IPSS of &gt;1.5 are eligible for this
        study. Patients must have less than 5% blasts at time of study entry and may receive
        induction chemotherapy prior to transplant.

        High Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia pts in CR1 3.1.4 CR2 (including AML,M3) patients:
        Patients with AML or ALL who have relapsed and have received salvage chemotherapy at the
        discretion of their primary physician and meet criteria for CR2 are eligible

        Not a candidate for standard myeloablative conditioning with allotransplantation. Patients
        are typically ineligible for standard allo SCT because of age greater than 50, or because
        of co-morbid disease that precludes myeloablative conditioning (such as coronary artery
        disease or cardiomyopathy, poor pulmonary function, or other medical disorders that, in the
        opinion of the patients transplant physician, would result in unacceptable toxicity from
        standard myeloablative conditioning with allogeneic transplantation).

        Patient-related Parameters:

          -  Patients must have a healthy histocompatible donor (A, B and DR match); either sibling
             or unrelated volunteer identified through the NMDP

          -  Age between 18 and 70 years old

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  Patients must have acceptable organ function: - total bilirubin &lt;2.0 - AST and ALT &lt; 3
             x normal, unless increases are thought to be either from non-hepatic causes (i.e
             hemolysis) or related to underlying disease (such as liver involvement with leukemia);
             creatinine &lt;2.0 or creatinine clearance &gt;40 ml/min (calculated or collected); Cardiac:
             An ejection fraction &gt;40% on MUGA or echocardiogram; Pulmonary: corrected DLCO &gt;50%

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects:

          -  Patients may not have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to
             entering the study. Patients must have recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients may not have uncontrolled or untreated central nervous system involvement

          -  Patients may not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  HIV positive patients are excluded

          -  The effects of these chemotherapy agents are likely to be harmful to a developing
             human fetus. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the chemotherapy is potentially
             teratogenic or has abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             chemotherapy, patients who are breastfeeding should discontinue breastfeeding or will
             be excluded from this trial

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with chemotherapy, patients who are breastfeeding
             should discontinue breastfeeding or will be excluded from this trial

        Donors:

          -  Sibling donors will be evaluated according to the standard practice of the University
             of Pennsylvania Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Program

          -  Unrelated donor evaluations and consent will be performed by an NMDP donor center
             according to standard guidelines and procedures.
