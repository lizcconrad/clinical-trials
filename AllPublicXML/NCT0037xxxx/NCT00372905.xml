  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Radiolabeled monoclonal
      antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, can find cancer cells and carry
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving bortezomib together
      with rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan may kill more cancer cells.

      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given
      together with rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and to see how well they work
      in treating patients with relapsed or refractory follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II study.

      Phase I:

      - Induction therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22, rituximab IV on days 8 and 15, and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes
      on day 15.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      - Consolidation therapy: Beginning 6-7 weeks after completing induction therapy, patients
      receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Phase II: Patients receive induction therapy and consolidation therapy as in phase I, with
      bortezomib administered at the MTD determined in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
