      This study was designed to evaluate a variable dosing regimen with intravitreal ranibizumab
      for the treatment of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the
      Prospective OCT Imaging of Patients with Neovascular AMD Treated with Intra-Ocular
      Ranibizumab (PrONTO) study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this 2-year open-label, prospective, single-center, uncontrolled, investigator sponsored
      clinical study, neovascular AMD patients with subfoveal CNV (N=40) and a central retinal
      thickness of at least 300 µm as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were enrolled
      to receive 3 consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (0.5 mg). Thereafter,
      retreatment with ranibizumab was performed if one of the following changes were observed
      between visits: a loss of 5 letters in conjunction with fluid in the macula as detected by
      OCT, an increase in OCT central retinal thickness of at least 100 μm, new onset classic CNV,
      new macular hemorrhage, or persistent macular fluid following an injection of ranibizumab at
      the prior study visit.
