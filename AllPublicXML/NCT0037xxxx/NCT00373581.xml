  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if vigabatrin will decrease cocaine
      self-administration, cardiovascular effects, subjective effects and craving compared to
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two recent open label clinical trials have reported that the anticonvulsant, gamma vinyl-GABA
      (GVG; vigabatrin), decreases relapse to cocaine use (Brodie et al., 2003, 2005). Vigabatrin
      increases neural GABA levels by irreversibly inhibiting the primary GABA degradation enzyme,
      GABA-transaminase; the hypothesized mechanism by which vigabatrin decreases cocaine relapse
      is by increasing GABA levels, thereby decreasing the effects of cocaine and
      cocaine-associated environmental cues on extracellular dopamine concentrations in the
      mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway (Morgan and Dewey, 1998). We are proposing to use our model
      of repeated dose cocaine self-administration to assess the interaction between vigabatrin and
      smoked cocaine under controlled laboratory conditions. This 57-day outpatient/inpatient
      /outpatient/inpatient protocol will evaluate the effects of vigabatrin maintenance (0, 3
      g/day) on cocaine craving, subjective effects, and self-administration using a
      within-subjects design. Non-treatment seeking cocaine-dependent volunteers will be maintained
      outpatient for 14 days of vigabatrin maintenance prior to beginning each inpatient study
      phase. During the inpatient phases, volunteers will live on a hospital clinical research unit
      and will participate in laboratory sessions in which they will have the opportunity to
      purchase doses of smoked cocaine (0, 12, 25, 50 mg; $5/administration). In addition to
      measuring cocaine self-administration, we will measure the cardiovascular and subjective
      effects of repeated cocaine administration and cocaine craving under each vigabatrin
      maintenance condition. Determining vigabatrin's effects on a range of smoked cocaine doses
      will provide essential data on the mechanism of the vigabatrin-cocaine interaction.
