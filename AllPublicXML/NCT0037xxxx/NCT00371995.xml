  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) are approved drugs for visceral
      leishmaniasis. In this study both drugs will be given in a sequential manner. AmBisome will
      be given on day 1, followed by Miltefosine for 14 days. Final Cure will be evaluated at six
      months.

      Methodology Multicenter trial, eligible patients will be treated with Liposomal amphotericin
      B (5 mg/kg) on day 1 and then with miltefosine capsules for 14 days (days 2-15).

      At two weeks after the end of treatment the initial cure (clinical and parasitological cure)
      and the clinical response will be determined. If initial cure is observed, a patient will be
      evaluated after a 6 months (after end of treatment) follow up period for final clinical cure.

      Number of patients planned Total number of patients planned: 150 patients at both centers
      combined. 75 pediatric (2-11 years); 75 adult (12-65 years).

      Lack of suitability for the trial:

        -  Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL)

        -  Concomitant treatment with other anti-leishmanial drugs

        -  Any condition which compromises ability to comply with the study procedures

      Administrative reasons:

        -  Any condition or situation that compromises compliance with study procedures including
           follow-up visit Study medication, dose and mode of administration Liposomal amphotericin
           B administered intravenously as single dose on day 1, Dosage: 5 mg/kg.

      Miltefosine administered orally (50 mg capsules) for 14 days (on days 2-15)

      Dosage:

        1. weighing â‰¥ 25 kg: 100 mg miltefosine daily as one capsule (50 mg) in the morning and one
           capsule in the evening, after meals for 14 days.

        2. weighing &lt; 25 kg: 50 mg miltefosine daily as one capsule (50 mg) in the morning, after
           meals for 14 days. Parameter for evaluation

             -  Final cure rate (initial parasite cure and clinical assessment at six month EOT)

             -  Initial parasitological cure rate (based on splenic aspirates or Bone marrow
                aspirate)

             -  Clinical response at end of treatment (clinical assessment)

             -  Adverse events

      Statistical methods

        -  Calculation of cure rate with 95% and 90% lower confidence limit according to Clopper
           Pearson

        -  Calculation of overall incidence of adverse events
