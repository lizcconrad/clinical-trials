  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of thyroid cancer patients with suspicion of recurrent disease based on
      rising/detectable levels of thyroglobulin (Tg) involves imaging with iodine-123 whole body
      scintigraphy (I-123 WBS) and F-18 FDG PET/CT. However, the disease is not always detected.
      The use of another iodine isotope (I-124) with positron emitting characteristics for PET/CT
      may allow better identification of recurrent disease, thus allowing for more patients to be
      treated with I-131 as a curative attempt.

      rising/detectable levels of thyroglobulin (Tg) involves imaging with iodine-123 whole body

      may allow better identification of recurrent disease, thus allowing for more patients to be
      treated with I-131 as a curative attempt.

      Conducting this study we hope to find whether I-124 PET/CT allows for detection of more
      lesions in patients with suspected recurrent thyroid cancer than the current standard of care
      represented by I-123 WBS and F-18 FDG PET/CT.
