    <textblock>
      This one-year pilot study has two specific aims: 1. to determine the feasibility of
      conducting a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture and the relaxation response for
      substance abuse among homeless veterans who are in a domiciliary care program, and 2. to
      collect and analyze pilot data to estimate the effect size for planning a future larger study
      to fully test the hypothesis of the effectiveness of acupuncture and the RR in reducing
      cravings for substances (alcohol and drugs), and the corollary effects on quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance abuse is one of the most important risk factors for homelessness. A high proportion
      of the US homeless population are veterans, in large part due to the high prevalence of
      substance abuse among veterans. Thus, effective substance abuse treatment in veterans is
      essential to preventing homelessness, as well as reintegrating those already homeless.
      Traditional substance abuse therapies have shown inconsistent effectiveness, suggesting a
      need for alternative therapies. Acupuncture and the relaxation response (RR) are two commonly
      used complementary and alternative medicine modalities that have shown benefit in some
      studies. However, they have not been studied in homeless veterans who have completed
      detoxification treatment and are in early remission. Acupuncture and the RR share common
      features, yet have distinct differences. Acupuncture has to be administered by
      acupuncturists, while RR elicitation is a self-care strategy that can be learned and
      practiced anytime and anywhere. We propose a pilot study to determine the feasibility of
      conducting a three-arm randomized controlled trial on veterans in the Bedford Domiciliary
      Care for Homeless Veterans program and to collect pilot data for planning future larger
      studies to test the effectiveness of acupuncture and the RR in reducing substance craving and
      improving anxiety and quality of life.
