      Malnutrition of elder orthopaedic patients leads to weight loss and loss of fat free mass.
      Changes in the individual’s nutritional status and body composition may adversely affect the
      patient’s postoperative level of activity.

      Aim. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to report changes in postoperative weight, FFM
      and functions vital to daily living in a group of elder orthopaedic patients that were
      actively involved in their nutritional care during the hospital stay.

      and functions vital to daily living in a group of elder orthopaedic patients that were
      actively involved in their nutritional care during the hospital stay.

      Method. The study comprises 253 patients aged 65+ and admitted either for hip- or knee
      replacement or with a fractured hip. Following a quasi-experimental design, 142 patients were
      allocated to the control group and 109 patients to the intervention group. The intervention
      programme focused on patients’ involvement in their nutritional care. Body composition by bio
      impedance and functional status by a standard chart were assessed at admission and four
      months postoperatively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 65 and above admitted either for elective hip- or knee replacement or acute with
             a fractured hip were allocated to the study. Patients included in the study were to
             stay in hospital for more than 7 days and agree on coming to the outpatient clinic for
             a follow-up four months after surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who refused to participate, patients were not able to understand the
             instructions,or received dietary treatment due to DM. Patients who suffered from
             cancer, gastrointestinal disorders or were undergoing steroid treatment. In addition,
             patients who were unable to participate due to serious heart disorders; or were
             transferred to intensive or cardiac units after surgery and did not return to the
             ward.
