  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of motexafin gadolinium (study
      drug) to standard treatment with docetaxel will improve the response rate in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical data suggest that MGd has activity in NSCLC and that the combination
      of MGd and docetaxel may be more effective that docetaxel alone. In this trial, patients will
      receive 10 mg/kg MGd followed by 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks. This dosing regimen was well
      tolerated in the Phase I dose escalation trial. A Simon 2-stage trial design will be used; if
      at least 4 out of 39 evaluable patients in the first stage of the trial demonstrate objective
      clinical response, the study will proceed to Stage 2, where an additional 22 evaluable
      patients will be enrolled following the same treatment regimen and assessment schedule as in
      Stage 1. Patients with stable disease, CR, or PR will continue dosing up to 12 cycles and
      will be followed for response every 6 weeks until PD, death, or end of study.
