  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of an investigational
      drug, V3381, for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic (DPN) pain (pain in one's
      feet and legs, or even in one's hands and arms, sometimes experienced by people with
      diabetes). An investigational drug is one that is not approved by the United States Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) and/or Health Canada.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP) is pain in your feet and legs, or even in your
      hands and arms, sometimes experienced by people with diabetes. Neuropathic pain syndromes are
      much more common than is perhaps generally recognized. Approximately 1% of the population in
      western countries suffers from neuropathic pain. Some clinical conditions are associated with
      a relatively high incidence of neuropathic pain. Approximately 15% of patients with diabetic
      neuropathy have persistent neuropathic pain in the feet, legs and hands.
