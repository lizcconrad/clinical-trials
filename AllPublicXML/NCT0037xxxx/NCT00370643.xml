      The purpose of the study is to seek if there is difference to state glucose level in
      80-120mg/dl or 200mg/dl in patients submitted to open heart surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycaemia in the intensive care unit and perioperative period has been accused to be one
      of the causes of worse clinical outcome. It is known that in open heart surgeries the glucose
      level must be set less than 200mg/dl, but new trials had set the glucose level lower than
      that: 140mg/dl in some studies and even lower (80-110mg/dl). Our trial had the intention to
      seek if there is difference setting glucose level in 2 different ones would modifies clinical
      outcome.
