  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial we test the hypothesis that a probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus
      and Lactobacillus rhamnosus is an effective therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the recent years there has been an increasing interest in the relationship between the
      gastrointestinal flora and gut function. Several studies have shown promising results for the
      use of probiotics in patient with inflammatory bowel disease.

      In this trial approximately 100 patients with ulcerative colitis will receive treatment with
      probiotic or placebo for 8 to 10 months as adjuvant therapy.

      The trial is double-blind, randomised and controlled.
