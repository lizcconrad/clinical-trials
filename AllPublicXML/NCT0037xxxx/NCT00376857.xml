  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was the aim of the present study to prospectively compare the functional and morphological
      outcome of idiopathic epiretinal membrane surgery with and without the assistance of
      Indocyanine green (ICG). The main outcome measure was improvement of best-corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA). This was treated as an open question and we had no hypothesis which of the two
      therapies was superior.
