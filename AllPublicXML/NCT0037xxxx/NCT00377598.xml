    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TAK-583, once daily (QD), in
      relieving pain in subjects with postherpetic neuralgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postherpetic neuralgia is defined as neuropathic pain still present 3 months following
      healing of the herpes zoster rash. Symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia may include a complex
      combination of symptoms, including a deep aching, shooting or burning pain, sensory deficits,
      hyperalgesia, allodynia, paresthesia, and dysesthesia. Postherpetic neuralgia is more common
      in the elderly, and it can have a debilitating effect on a patient. The most commonly
      prescribed treatments are tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants, however these
      treatments are effective in approximately half of subjects and may also have undesirable side
      effects (eg, dizziness and somnolence).

      TAK-583 is a synthetic compound under development by Takeda Global Research &amp; Development
      Center, Inc. as a treatment for neuropathic pain and for delaying the progression of diabetic
      neuropathy.

      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 11 Weeks. Multiple
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine
      collection, vital signs, body height and weight, physical examinations and
      electrocardiograms.
