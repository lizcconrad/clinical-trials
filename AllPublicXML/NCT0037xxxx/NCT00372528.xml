    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to allow continued access to pregabalin to Canadian
      subjects who participated in global pregabalin epilepsy studies 1008-010; 1008-035; 1008-114
      and 1008-164 and to continue to study the long term safety of pregabalin administered as
      adjunctive therapy at dosages from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day in Canadian subjects with
      refractory partial seizures.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This study was terminated on April 8, 2011 as Pfizer Canada could no longer supply study drug.
    No efficacy or safety concerns factored into this decision.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 6 thereafter every 6 months up to Month 54 or End of Study (EOS) and follow-up (30 days after last dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Seizures were episodes of disturbed brain activity that cause changes in attention or behavior. The different types of seizures observed were complex partial, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic, simple partial and others. Mean number of seizures were calculated between each study visit.</description>

          <description>Seizures were episodes of disturbed brain activity that cause changes in attention or behavior. The different types of seizures observed were complex partial, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic, simple partial and others. Mean number of seizures were calculated between each study visit.</description>
          <population>SAS included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study medication in the open label period. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.
