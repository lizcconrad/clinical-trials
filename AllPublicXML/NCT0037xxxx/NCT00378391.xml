    <textblock>
      EUROTRANSFER Registry is a prospective, international, web-based European Registry on
      Patients with ST-Elevation MI Transferred for Mechanical Reperfusion (PCI) with a Special
      Focus on Upstream Use of Abciximab.

      This registry is designed to collect data on approximately 1800 patients during a 12 month
      enrollment period in up to 20 interventional cardiology centres with hospital transfer
      networks from all over Europe.

      Analysis of this registry should allow to monitor transfer timelines of patients arriving to
      the cath-lab from the regional hospital with or without upstream start of abciximab and
      scheduled for mechanical reperfusion (PCI) as well as to monitor regional differences across
      Europe in regard to the impact that time of various stages of the treatment chain may have on
      clinical outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PATIENTS:

          -  All consecutive STEMI patients &gt;=18years arriving to the Cath Lab hospital (invasive
             facility center) from transfer.

               -  Transfer with respect to this registry is defined as patients that reach the Cath
                  Lab hospital:

                    1. transferred from a surrounding regional community hospitals that the Cath
                       Lab hospital has an established referral pattern with or

                    2. after being picked–up by an ambulance which is equipped/staffed to provide
                       specific medical therapy (like prehospital thrombolysis or upstream
                       abciximab). Usually these have a physician or specifically trained nurse on
                       board.

                       CENTRES:

               -  Provide 24 hour/7 days on duty PCI service.

               -  Has an established regional hospital referral network with &gt;=8 patients/month
                  arriving from transfer (as defined above).

               -  A rate of &gt;=10% of these transfer patients who receive upstream abciximab before
                  or during transfer to the Cath Lab hospital. Start of abciximab in the ER or CCU
                  of the Cath Lab hospital will not be considered as upstream start of abciximab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who arrive to the Cath Lab from other pathways than those specified above (a.
             and b.), e.g. those who come by ambulances that do not provide specific medical
             therapy or arrive directly to the ER of the Cath Lab hospital by own feet/car will not
             be included in this registry.

          -  Patients from controlled clinical trials shall be included as long as their actual
             treatment is fully known. Thus, participants from randomized trials with blinded
             treatment cannot be included in this registry.
