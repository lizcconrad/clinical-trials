  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a pre-discharge videotape introducing the
      concept and benefit of a Cardiac Rehabiliation &amp; Secondary Prevention (CRSP) program will
      increase intent to participate in a CRSP program in post myocardial infarction, unstable
      angina, coronary artery bypass surgery, or coronary angioplasty patients.

    <textblock>
      There is compelling evidence that a comprehensive CR program comprising the delivery of
      lifestyle modifying education will reduce mortality, morbidity and improve quality of life in
      patients following myocardial infarction, unstable angina, angioplasty or coronary artery
      bypass. However less than 20% of eligible patients participate in CRSP programs. This study
      will look at a method of potentially improving enrollment and adherence to a CRSP program.
      Patients will be randomized into two groups. One group will complete a survey and view a
      videotape introducing the concept of a CRSP program. The second group will be requested to
      complete a survey only, but will not be exposed to the videotape. It is expected that the
      patients who view the videotape will be more likely to express intent to participate in CRSP
      versus those patients who do not view the videotape.
