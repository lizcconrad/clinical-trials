    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to compare the effects of twice-daily exenatide and twice-daily
      placebo on weight loss. This trial will evaluate overweight and obese subjects with type 2
      diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin, sulfonylurea, or metformin plus
      a sulfonylurea. Subjects will be treated with exenatide or placebo in addition to their
      current oral antidiabetes agent regimen and participate in a lifestyle modification program.

HOMA-B is a computer solved model used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees beta-cell deficiency. HOMA-B allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of deficient beta cell function to the fasting hyperglycemia. HOMA-B is measured as a percent of the normal population (normal beta cell function = 100%, which is used as a reference in the calculation). The higher the percent the better for the participant.</description>

HOMA-S is a computer solved model used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of insulin sensitivity. HOMA-S allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin sensitivity to the fasting hyperglycemia. HOMA-S is measured as a percent of the normal population (normal insulin sensitivity = 100%, which is used as a reference in the calculation).

HOMA-B is a computer solved model used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees beta-cell deficiency. HOMA-B allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of deficient beta cell function to the fasting hyperglycemia. HOMA-B is measured as a percent of the normal population (normal beta cell function = 100%, which is used as a reference in the calculation). The higher the percent the better for the participant.</description>
