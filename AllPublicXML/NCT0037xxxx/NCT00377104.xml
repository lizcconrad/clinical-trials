    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of flavopiridol in treating
      patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as alvocidib, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of
      flavopiridol (alvocidib) as consolidation chemotherapy after cytoreduction chemotherapy in
      patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and cellular pharmacodynamics of flavopiridol in these
      patients.

      II. Determine the complete response (CR) and overall response rate (CR and partial response)
      of patients treated with flavopiridol.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive alvocidib intravenously (IV) over
      30 minutes (loading dose), followed by alvocidib IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.

      Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients
      are treated at the MTD (i.e., recommended phase II dose). Patients undergo blood collection
      at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and cytokine studies (levels of
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6, -11, and -16) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA). Interphase cytogenetics, p53 mutational status, p53/ATM function, V_H
      mutational status, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) overexpression, and
      single nucleotide polymorphisms are also examined.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 months and then every 3
      months for 5 years.

    <description>The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 will be used to characterize toxicity. If no patients experience dose-limiting toxicity, dose escalation will occur. If 1 patient has a dose limiting toxicity, 3 additional patients will be enrolled at that dose. If fewer than 2 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity, then the next highest dose level will be used for the subsequent cohort of 3 patients. If at any dose level two or more of the six patients experience a dose limiting toxicity, 3 additional patients will be treated at the previous dose level.</description>

    <description>Cytokine studies will be examined by standard ELISA assays to determine if increase IL-6 correlates with hypotension, hypoxemia, and tachycardia observed following treatment and to identify the source of production of this cytokine. We will examine interphase cytogenetics, p53 mutational status, p53/ATM functional assay, VH mutational status, and ZAP-70 over-expression.</description>
