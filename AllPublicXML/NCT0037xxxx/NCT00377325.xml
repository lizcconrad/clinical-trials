    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether lower doses of cyclosporine can cause fewer side effects and
      still produce the same beneficial results that are seen with a standard cyclosporine dose
      regimen when treating individuals with moderate to severe psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. It is believed to be caused by an
      overactive immune system that speeds the growth of skin cells. This abnormal skin growth
      results in patches of inflamed skin, which can itch, crack, and bleed. Cyclosporine is an
      immunosuppressant drug that is used in more severe cases of psoriasis to slow down the growth
      of skin cells. However, cyclosporine use is associated with several side effects, including
      kidney damage, high blood pressure, and skin sensitivity. This study will evaluate whether
      lower doses of cyclosporine can cause fewer side effects and still produce the same
      beneficial results that are seen with the standard administration of cyclosporine.

      Participants in this study will receive treatment with cyclosporine for up to 30 weeks. Study
      visits will occur every 2 weeks and will include a physical exam, a psoriasis symptom
      evaluation, blood collection, and various questionnaires on quality-of-life issues.
      Participants will be followed for 2 years.
