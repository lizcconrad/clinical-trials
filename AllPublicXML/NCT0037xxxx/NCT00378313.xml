  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether locally advanced breast cancer
      responds (by shrinking, by not progressing or by being destroyed) to combined chemotherapy
      (gemcitabine, epirubicin and paclitaxel) given before surgery to patients with locally
      advanced breast cancer. This study will also evaluate the toxicity of the chemotherapy
      combination to patients and will determine survival and progression-free survival 2 years
      after treatment. Also, the study will look at whether there are molecular and genetic changes
      in the tumor tissue that match the tumor's response to the chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Primary chemotherapy has had an established role in locally advanced breast cancer. Studies
      have shown that the combination of chemotherapeutic agents is superior to single therapeutic
      agent in overall response rate and progression free survival. The inclusion of the most
      active drugs in combination regimens can improve the percentage of patients achieving a
      pathological complete response (pCR). The chemotherapy agents gemcitabine, epirubicin, and
      paclitaxel have been used individually to treat breast cancer. While use of the combination
      of these three drugs has been studied in the metastatic setting, the combination has not been
      evaluated in locally advanced disease. In this study the combination of the three agents
      gemcitabine, epirubicin, and paclitaxel [Taxol] will be administered to patients with locally
      advanced breast cancer prior to surgery; pathologic response will be determined at the time
      of surgery. The main objective of this study is to determine the pathological response rate
      for these patients. Also because prior studies have suggested that only a specific subset of
      tumors responds to a specific chemotherapeutic agent and that this subset is determined by
      the gene expression profile of each tumor, preoperative therapy protocols such as this
      provide an ideal setting to identify gene expression pattern and gene copy number changes
      that may predict response to a specific therapy using high-throughput assay methods and
      RNAlater. Therefore, this study will also look at the feasibility of tissue collection and
      analysis in identifying predictive markers of complete pathological response.

          -  Consent for the collection of biopsy tissue in RNAlater solution

          -  Biopsy specimens that were obtained by core biopsy or incisional biopsy and placed in
             RNAlater solution

          -  Breast cancer that is:

               -  unilateral

               -  diagnosed histologically as invasive breast cancer without evidence of metastatic
                  disease (except for stage IV with positive supraclavicular nodes only)

               -  stage IIB, IIIA (T0-3N2), IIIB (T4N0-3 or T0-3N3), or IV (by involvement of
                  positive supraclavicular nodes only). (Patients with clinical evidence of
                  inflammatory breast cancer or superficial lesions must have a measurable mass in
                  the breast or lymph nodes.)

               -  measurable by physical exam, mammography, sonogram, CT scan, MRI, or x-ray

          -  Nonmalignant systemic disease that would keep the patient from being given the
