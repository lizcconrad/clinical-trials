  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main risk of aortic aneurysms is rupture that leads to a high risk of death. A preventive
      surgical treatment is thus needed. In order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated
      with conventional surgery, an endovascular approach (insertion of an endovascular stent
      graft)is now widely favored. The main problem of this procedure is the occurrence of
      endoleaks (persistence of a communication between the aneurysm and the aorta). A new approach
      is proposed to prevent these endoleaks. The principle is to draw blood from the patient,
      separate the blood from the platelets, and reinject both platelet rich plasma (PRP) and
      autologous thrombin, in order to form a platelet gel (PRP + autologous thrombin). Before
      studying the efficacy of this technique, its safety of use and feasibility must be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      The main risk of aortic aneurysms is rupture. Onset is usually sudden, leading to the death
      of the patient in 80% to 90% of cases. The elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms,
      therefore, seems to be a priority. In order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated
      with conventional surgery, an endovascular approach (insertion of an endovascular stent graft
      using the endovascular aneurysm repair procedure) is now widely favored. The main problem,
      during follow-up of patients wearing an endovascular stent graft, is the occurrence of
      endoleaks resulting in retrograde filling of the aneurysm sac. The ideal is to prevent these
      endoleaks either by new developments in endovascular stent grafts or by using adjuvant
      therapy during the procedure. The principle is to draw blood from the patient, separate the
      blood from the platelets, and reinject it into two separate catheters, one with platelet rich
      plasma (PRP) and the other with autologous thrombin, in order to form a platelet gel (PRP +
      autologous thrombin). Before studying the efficacy of this technique, its safety of use and
      feasibility must be evaluated.
