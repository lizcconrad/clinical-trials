  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of an electronic data capture system
      (EDCS) in a rheumatology clinical practice setting and to assess the impact of this system on
      patient satisfaction with patient-physician interaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter observational study to assess the impact of the EDCS in a
      rheumatology clinical practice setting on patient satisfaction with patient-physician
      communication using the Health Tracker electronic data capture system . Patients will be
      randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the Health Tracker-user or non-user groups, respectively.
      The primary outcomes of this study will be the impact that information gathered and analyzed
      by an electronic data capture system has on patient satisfaction with arthritis care and
      patient physician interactions in clinical practice. Patient satisfaction will be assessed
      using a questionnaire developed specifically for this study.

      This study does not involve the use of any investigational drugs, and the protocol does not
      mandate the treatment regimen patients will receive. Physicians will prescribe antirheumatic
      medications in accordance with usual clinical practice. The planned duration of subject
      participation is 12 months
