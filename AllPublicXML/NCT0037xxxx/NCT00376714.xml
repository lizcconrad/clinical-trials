  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK233705 is a high-affinity specific muscarinic receptor (mAChR) antagonist which is being
      developed for once daily treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The long
      duration of action of GSK233705 when administered via inhalation in animal models supports
      the potential for use as a once-daily bronchodilator for chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease.

          -  Subject has FEV1 greater than or equal to 80% of predicted normal for height, age and
             gender after inhalation of 200 µg salbutamol.

          -  Response to ipratropium bromide defined as:

          -  Either: An increase in FEV1 of =12% and =150 mL at 2 h following inhalation of 80 ug
             of ipratropium bromide at the screening visit

          -  or: a documented increase in FEV1 of =12% and =150 mL at 2 h following inhalation of
             80 ug of ipratropium bromide within 6 months of screening and an increase in FEV1 of
             &gt;6% and &gt;100ml 2h following inhalation of 80 ug of ipratropium bromide at the
             screening visit (in order to allow for potential fluctuations in the response to
             ipratropium bromide in patients known to be responders to ipratropium bromide).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Subject is available to complete all study measurements and procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive pregnancy test.

          -  Subject has FEV1 greater than or equal to 40% of predicted after inhalation of
             salbutamol.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Where participation in study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL
             within a 56 day period

          -  The subject has donated a unit of blood within 30 days of screening, or, intends to
             donate during the study.

          -  Subject has claustrophobia that may be aggravated by entering the plethysmography
             cabinet.

          -  The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to ipratropium bromide, tiotropium
             bromide, atropine and any of its derivatives or milk protein/lactose.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible,
