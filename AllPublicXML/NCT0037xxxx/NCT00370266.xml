  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intraocular injection of triamcinolone is
      effective in the treatment of macular edema in acute branch retinal vein occlusion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal triamcinolone has recently been shown to have beneficial effect on chronic
      macular edema due to vein occlusion and preventive effect on neovascularization.
      Hypothetically, prevention of macular derangement by reducing the amount of edema from early
      phase after occlusion until restoration of collaterals seems to be helpful in these eyes. To
      our knowledge, no prospective randomized clinical trial, considering both macular changes and
      preventive effect on neovascularization has been published for intravitreal triamcinolone in
      acute branch retinal vein occlusion.
