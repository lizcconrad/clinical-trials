      To assess whether the anti-inflammatory effects of rosiglitazone result in improvements in
      Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms in patients for whom their existing Disease Modifying
      Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) treatment does not give adequate relief.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Rheumatoid Arthritis insufficiently controlled by existing disease-modifying
             anti-rheumatic drugs

          -  Subjects will have at least 6 swollen joints plus 2 of the following: 6 tender joints
             (of 28 joints); early morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes; ESR greater or
             equal to 28mm/h

          -  must be receiving a stable dose of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic therapy for at
             least 2 months prior to participating in the study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Women who are lactating, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant during the course of
             the study including 30 days following conclusion of study medication

          -  Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;165 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;95 mmHg
             while receiving optimal antihypertensive therapy

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality identified on the screening physical exam,
             laboratory tests, or ECG, which in the judgement of the Investigator makes the subject
             unsuitable for inclusion in the study

          -  a history of alcohol abuse within the past 3 years or consumes &gt;3 units per day for
             males and &gt;2 units per day for females or has a history of cirrhosis or stigmata of
             chronic liver disease

          -  a history of liver disease or has alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) levels &gt;2.5 times upper limit of normal and total bilirubin
             levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (unless associated with
             predominantly indirect bilirubin or Gilbert's syndrome) at screening

          -  using glucocorticoid at doses &gt;10 mg/day currently or within the last 3 months or may
             be expected to do so during the course of the study

          -  The subject's dose of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors or glucocorticoids has changed at any
             time during the past 2 weeks prior to screening or may be expected to change during
             the course of the study

          -  The subject's dose or treatment with a statin has changed at any time during the past
             3 months prior to screening or may be expected to change during the course of the
             study

          -  a history of renal disease or has serum creatinine = 132mol/L for males and =130mol

             percutaneous coronary intervention, vascular surgery, acute coronary syndrome [non
             Q-wave myocardial infarction, Q-wave myocardial infarction, unstable angina) or

          -  Concurrent or past medical history of congestive heart failure or pulmonary oedema

          -  A presence of severe peripheral oedema or a medically serious fluid-related event

          -  has significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal or
             immunological conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or GSK medical
             monitor, places the subject at an unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial

          -  a history of malignancy in the last 5 years, except for surgically cured basal cell
             carcinoma (&gt;2 years prior to first dosing)

          -  The subject is at risk of non-compliance in following directions or adhering to study
             restrictions

          -  a history of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the physician
