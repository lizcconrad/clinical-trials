  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proper staging of Lung cancer is of paramount concern when determining a treatment regime.
      Currently the assessment of surgical candidacy is performed with the staging process, mainly
      the mediastinoscopy. A mediastinoscopy has the ability to access samples of the paratracheal
      lymph node stations (Levels 2R, 2L, 3, 4R, 4L), as well as the anterior subcarinal lymph node
      station (Level 7). In comparison, the EBUS-TBNA technique is a real-time procedure that has
      the potential to access the same paratracheal and subcarinal lymph node stations associated
      with the mediastinoscopy, but also extending out to the hilar lymph nodes (Levels 10 and 11).
      Because of the possibility of extended sampling range and a reduction in procedural
      invasiveness, EBUS-TBNA may represent a more efficient patient centered alternative to
      mediastinoscopy in the staging of lung cancer patients. Additionally, patients who are have
      lymph nodes in the N2 region frequently undergo chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy prior to
      surgery. Assessment of the lymph nodes after chemo/radiation is done using CT scans, as
      re-mediastinoscopy is a technically difficult procedure. These patients may benefit from
      EBUS-TBNA.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A) Age 18 years or older B) Patients with confirmed or suspected non-small cell lung cancer
        who require a mediastinoscopy as part of their staging investigations of the mediastinum to
        determine suitability for lung cancer resection will be considered for the trial.

        C) Patients with undiagnosed enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum suspicious for lung
        cancer in which a tissue diagnosis is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A) Patients who are deemed on clinical grounds not to be medically fit for a bronchoscopy
        or a mediastinoscopy or who are not suitable for definitive surgical resection by
        thoracotomy will be excluded.

        B) Patients who have verified stage IV disease or who are not appropriate for lung cancer
        resection by virtue of direct invasion of mediastinal structures or large parts of the
        chest wall.

        C) Known small cell lung cancer. D) Patients where there is a high clinical suspicion of
        lymphoma. E) Inability to give informed consent.
