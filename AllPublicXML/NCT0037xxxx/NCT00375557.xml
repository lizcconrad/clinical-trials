    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine whether Divalproex ER or one of the atypical antipsychotics
      is more effective improving dementia related behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia,
      and evaluate the impact of such improvements on other clinical domains, such as quality of
      life, functional status.

      This clinical trial will be open label, flexible dose study of Divalproex ER vs Quetiapine
      for 6 weeks. Patients will be randomized to Divalproex ER vs Quetiapine outpatient /
      inpatient. The schedule of visits will include a screening, a baseline and 3 treatment visits
      / assessment. The End of Study/Early Termination visit will conclude the Trial. The safety
      follow-up visit will be scheduled only for the patients with unresolved Adverse Events
      detected prior or at the End of Study/Early Termination visit.
