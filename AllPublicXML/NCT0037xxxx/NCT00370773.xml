  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will systematically evaluate the programming parameters of the Precision Spinal
      Cord Stimulation Device to optimally relieve pain while minimizing any uncomfortable side
      effects.

      This study will investigate the efficacy of subthreshold intraspinal nerve root stimulation
      (INRS) in treating back pain. The efficacy of this strategy will be tested against dorsal
      column stimulation (DCS), the commonly-accepted technique for spinal cord stimulation. DCS
      will be tested at subthreshold and suprathreshold (perceptible) amplitudes. A substudy will
      involve patients who prefer suprathreshold DCS over INRS and subthreshold DCS. Its purpose is
      to systematically assess the pain relief afforded by a number of programs with different
      pulse widths. The overall purpose of this study is to investigate methods of making pain
      relief via electrical stimulation more comfortable by either using subthreshold amplitudes or
      by adjusting the pulse width of perceptible stimulation to a more pleasing range.
