  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether Botox A (injected into the bladder muscle) can
      improve symptoms of urge incontinence that has not improved with usual medical treatments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who suffer with urge incontinence may not get relief with usual medical treatment (such
      as medications or behavioral techniques). We plan to enroll women with refractory urge
      incontinence in centers across the US. Study participants will undergo cystoscopy (telescope
      look into the bladder) and injection of either Botox A or placebo. If symptoms are not
      adequately relieved, subjects participants will receive a second injection that is Botox A.
      Participants are interviewed monthly by study personnel to determine symptoms and health
      status.

    <measure>Time to recurrence of detrusor overactivity incontinence symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To allow sufficient time for the onset of action of botulinum toxin A, the earliest outcome measurement was 60 days after injection. Failure was defined as a patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I) score of 4 or greater, the commencement of any new treatment at any time after the first injection or increased intensity of previously established treatment for DOI.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in incontinence episode frequency by bladder diary</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 mos after first injection., but no less than 1 mo after second injection</time_frame>
    <description>based on the 3-day bladder diary completed pre-intervention and at 4 weeks post injection. A successful within-subject outcome will be defined as &gt;75% reduction in the frequency of urge incontinence episodes compared to the baseline frequency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incontinence-related and health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 mos after first injection, but no less than 1 mo after second injection.</time_frame>
    <description>measured by the Urinary Distress Inventory subscale of the PFDI/PFIQ, the PISQ, and SF-36 administered at 4 weeks after the initial injection and either prior to any re-treatment or at the completion of study participation, whichever is earlier.</description>
