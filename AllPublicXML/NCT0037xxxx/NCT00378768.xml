      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as antithymocyte globulin, may stimulate the immune
      system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antithymocyte globulin works in treating
      patients undergoing stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate at 4 weeks in patients with multiple myeloma treated with
           anti-thymocyte globulin at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to undergoing conditioning therapy
           for allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug, in terms of formation of antirabbit antibodies, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 6 hours on day 1 and over 4 hours on days 3
      and 5. Treatment begins 4 to 6 weeks prior to undergoing conditioning therapy for autologous
      or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
