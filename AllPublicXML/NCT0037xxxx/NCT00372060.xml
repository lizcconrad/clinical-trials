      <recruitment_details>Phase III.
Date of first patient in: 22 August 2006. Date of last patient's last visit for Period I: 1 May 2007.
Date of last patient's last visit for Period II: 5 February 2008. Number of randomized patients: 134.
The study was conducted at 32 centers in Japan.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following a screening period of at least 4 weeks and a 2 or 8-week observation period, patients who were on pioglitazone monotherapy for at least 8 weeks and met all other entry criteria were randomized to receive: sitagliptin/sitagliptin or placebo/sitagliptin.
The starting dose of sitagliptin was 50 mg for all patients.</pre_assignment_details>
