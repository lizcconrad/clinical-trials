      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of SH U04722 in patients with solid
      tumor cancers. In addition, this study will identify the recommended dose and administration
      schedule of SH U04722 for phase II development in Japanese cancer patients, evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic profile of SH U04722 and gather preliminary data on the effectiveness of SH
      U04722 in patients with solid tumors.
