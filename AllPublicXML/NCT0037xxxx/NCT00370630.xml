  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we intend to evaluate and compare the outcomes of intravitreal avastin versus
      avastin and triamcinolone on improving the visual acuity and macular edema and late
      complications of CRVO like NVI and NVG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder with potentially
      complications like reduced vision resulting from extensive intraretinal hemorrhage, retinal
      ischemia and persistent macular edema and neovascular glaucoma secondary to iris
      neovascularization. Macular edema is a common cause of severe visual loss in both branch
      retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Natural history data
      indicate that CRVO patients presenting with poor visual acuity (_20/200) have an 80% chance
      of being left with visual acuity less than 20/200 at final visit, whether the CRVO is
      ischemic or nonischemic at presentation. Treatments that target the secondary effects of
      venous occlusion, such as grid laser photocoagulation for macular edema and prophylactic
      panretinal laser photocoagulation for nonperfused CRVO, were shown to be ineffective in
      improving visual acuity in the Central Vein Occlusion Study (CVOS). Although panretinal
      photocoagulation is advocated for reducing the risk of neovascular glaucoma in patients with
      ischemic CRVO, recent clinical trials have failed to demonstrate any significant benefit with
      laser photocoagulation in the treatment of macular edema due to CRVO. A number of other
      treatment options are sometimes used in cases of CRVO, such as oral corticosteroids,
      intravitreal steroids, vitrectomy, hemodilution, intravitreal tissue plasminogen activator,
      hyperbaric oxygen, and laser or surgical chorioretinal anastomosis. Studies demonstrating the
      effectiveness of these treatments are inconclusive, although some benefits have been
      suggested in recent reports. In recent studies the benefit of antiVEGF agents in improving
      the macular edema due to CRVO have been shown. In this study we are going to compare the
      effect of intravitreal antiVEGF (Avastin) with combination of Avastin and Triamcinolon in
      improving the visual acuity and macular thickness in patients with recent (Less than 6
      months) CRVO.
