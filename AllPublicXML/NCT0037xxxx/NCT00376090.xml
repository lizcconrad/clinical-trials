    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and the immune responses to the HIV
      vaccine candidate, MVA-CMDR. This vaccine was designed to induce immune responses to three
      HIV &quot;passenger&quot; genes encoded with the viral vector, MVA.

          -  White cell count: 3,000 - 11,000 cells/mm3

          -  Platelets: 125,000 - 450,000 per mm3

          -  Normal cardiac enzyme level at second Screening Visit

          -  Urinalysis (UA) for protein and blood: negative or trace.

          -  Normal liver function tests to include ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, GGT (&lt; 1.25x
             institutional upper limits of normal) and CPK (&lt; 480) and creatinine (&lt; 1.25 mg/dL)

          -  Negative serology for HIV infection

          -  Any female volunteer must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at the
             screening visit as well as immediately prior to each vaccine/placebo vaccination, as
             well as verbal assurance that adequate birth control measures have been followed for
             60 days prior to the first vaccine/placebo vaccination and will continue to be
             followed for at least 3months after the final vaccine/placebo vaccination. This means
             using any of the following methods: Birth control drugs that prevent pregnancy given
             by pills, shots or placed under the skin, Male or female condoms with or without a
             cream or gel that kills sperm, diaphragm or cervical cap with a cream or gel that
             kills sperm, or Abstinence

             including mitral valve prolapse, or other heart conditions under the care of a doctor.

          -  Has ECG on Screening Visit 2 with clinical significant findings, or features that
             would interfere with the assessment of myo/pericarditis (as determined by the contract
             ECG Lab) including any of the following: conduction disturbance (atrioventricular or
             intraventricular condition, left or right bundle branch block, AB block of any degree

             atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, frequent atrial or ventricular ectopy (e.g. frequent
             premature atrial contractions, 2 premature ventricular contractions in a row), ST
             elevation consistent with ischemia, or evidence of past or evolving myocardial
             infarction

          -  Has history of seizure disorder, immunodeficiency, chronic illness, autoimmune
             disease, diabetes mellitus active malignancy or use of immunosuppressive medications.

             participation in the study.

          -  Has received any live attenuated vaccine within 60 days of study entry.
