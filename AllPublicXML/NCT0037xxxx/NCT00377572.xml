    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if adding omalizumab to standard asthma treatment
      results in a safer, more effective, and longer lasting asthma treatment strategy than
      standard treatment alone, in inner-city children with mild to severe asthma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing a medication called omalizumab for the treatment of asthma.
      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is produced when one is exposed to allergens and it can cause
      inflammation in the lungs. Omalizumab can reduce inflammation and asthma attacks by blocking
      IgE. Unlike other medications for asthma, omalizumab is not an inhaler medication or pill.
      Instead, omalizumab is dissolved in a liquid and given by injection.

      Studies indicate that people living in the inner-city areas are more likely to be exposed to
      indoor allergens that are difficult to avoid than people living in other areas. The purpose
      of this study is to find out if adding omalizumab to standard asthma treatment results in a
      safer, more effective, and longer lasting asthma treatment strategy than standard treatment
      alone.

      This study will recruit inner-city children and adolescents with moderate to severe allergic
      asthma. This study will last about 1.5 to 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either omalizumab or placebo injections once every 2 or 4 weeks. The injection
      schedule will be determined based on the participant's weight and total IgE. Both groups will
      receive standardized specialist care and basic asthma education including environmental
      control measures. Participants must have some form of health care insurance to cover the
      costs of asthma controller medications prescribed during the study.

      Participants will complete a series of questionnaires about topics including perceived
      stress, home environment, physical activity, diet and nutrition, smoking habits, and quality
      of life. At study entry and monthly throughout the study, participants will complete
      questionnaires about their asthma symptoms and medical resource utilization. Some visits will
      include a physical examination, vital signs measurement, lung function tests, asthma
      medication evaluation, and an asthma action plan. Blood collection is required up to eight
      times during the study for safety labs.

    <measure>Child Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12-60: 12 months of assessments starting 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) is a validated tool to assess overall asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients ages 4 to 11 years. Scores can range from 0 to 27. A score of 19 or less is indicative of asthma that is not well controlled. The minimally important difference in C-ACT scores is not defined. C-ACT scores were available as an outcome measure in 236 of the 419 participants, 118 of whom were in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm. Data represent an average of those collected in the time period (weeks 12-60), where at least one value was available in this assessment period and at baseline for a participant.</description>

    <measure>Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12-60: 12 months of assessments starting 12 weeks after the initiation of study treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a validated tool to assess overall asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients &gt;= 12 years of age. It is a questionnaire comprised of 5 questions assessing: asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, and the impact of asthma on everyday functioning. All questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, with a higher score indicating better control. All scores were added together to calculate a total score. Total scores can range from 5 to 25. A score of 19 or less is indicative of asthma that is not well controlled. The minimally important difference for ACT is 3 points. ACT scores as an outcome measure were available in 150 of the 419 participants, 77 of whom were in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm. Data represent an average of those collected in the time period (weeks 12-60), where at least one value was available in this assessment period and at baseline for a participant.</description>

    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) % Predicted</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12-60: 12 months of assessments starting 12 weeks after the initiation of study treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is air volume exhaled in 1 second during spirometry. For the trial, mild asthma is defined as pre-bronchodilator FEV1 â‰¥80% predicted, requiring no/low-moderate dose of inhaled glucocorticoids; moderate asthma and severe asthma, respectively, as pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;80% predicted requiring the same glucocorticoids as mild asthma and FEV1 &lt;80% predicted requiring high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids (with/without continuous oral glucocorticoids) or uncontrolled despite treatment. FEV1 % of predicted is FEV1 converted to a percentage of normal, based on height, weight, and race. FEV1 percent predicted data as an outcome measure were available in 363 of the 419 participants, 190 of whom were in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm. Data represent an average of those collected in the time period (weeks 12-60), where at least one value was available in this assessment period and at baseline for a participant.</description>

    <measure>FEV1/FVC Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12-60: 12 months of assessments starting 12 weeks after the initiation of study treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The FEV1 (forced expiratory volume 1))/ FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio is used to evaluate airways obstructions since pure restrictive ventilatory defects cause an equal reduction in the FEV1 and the FVC. An FEV1/FVC ratio below 80% indicates airflow obstruction. Normal FEV1/FVC: 8 - 19 years of age=85%.
FEV1/FVC ratio data as an outcome measure were available in 363 of the 419 participants, 190 of whom were in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm. Data represent an average of those collected in the time period (weeks 12-60), where at least one value was available in this assessment period and at baseline for a participant.</description>

          <description>The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) is a validated tool to assess overall asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients ages 4 to 11 years. Scores can range from 0 to 27. A score of 19 or less is indicative of asthma that is not well controlled. The minimally important difference in C-ACT scores is not defined. C-ACT scores were available and relevant for 253 of 419 (60%) study participants. Of the 253, 123 were from the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm.</description>

          <title>Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score</title>
          <description>The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a validated tool to assess asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients &gt;= 12 yrs old. It is comprised of 5 questions assessing symptoms, use of rescue medications, and the impact of asthma on everyday functioning. All questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (higher score indicating better control). Total scores can range from 5-25. A score of &lt;= 19 is indicative of not well-controlled asthma. The minimally important difference is 3 points. Scores were available for 166 of 419 participants (85 from the Omalizumab + Conventional Therapy arm).</description>

          <title>Maximum Number of Asthma Symptom Days (Previous 2 Weeks)</title>
          <description>Maximum symptom days was calculated as the largest of the following variables at the baseline visit: number of days with wheezing, chest tightness, or cough; number of nights of sleep disturbance; and number of days when activities were affected. This symptom scale ranges from 0 to 14 days per a 2-week look-back period. A higher score reflected a greater number of asthma symptoms.</description>

          <description>The FEV1 (forced expiratory volume 1))/ FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio is used to evaluate airways obstructions since pure restrictive ventilatory defects cause an equal reduction in the FEV1 and the FVC. An FEV1/FVC ratio below 80% indicates airflow obstruction. Normal FEV1/FVC: 8 â€“ 19 years of age=85%.
Baseline FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 percent predicted data were available in 398 of the 419 participants. Of the 398, 204 were enrolled in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm.</description>

        <description>The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) is a validated tool to assess overall asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients ages 4 to 11 years. Scores can range from 0 to 27. A score of 19 or less is indicative of asthma that is not well controlled. The minimally important difference in C-ACT scores is not defined. C-ACT scores were available as an outcome measure in 236 of the 419 participants, 118 of whom were in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm. Data represent an average of those collected in the time period (weeks 12-60), where at least one value was available in this assessment period and at baseline for a participant.</description>

C-ACT scores were available as an outcome measure in 236 of the 419 participants, 118 of whom were in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm. Data represent an average of those collected in the time period (weeks 12-60), where at least one value was available in this assessment period and at baseline for a participant.</description>

        <title>Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score</title>
        <description>The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a validated tool to assess overall asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients &gt;= 12 years of age. It is a questionnaire comprised of 5 questions assessing: asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, and the impact of asthma on everyday functioning. All questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, with a higher score indicating better control. All scores were added together to calculate a total score. Total scores can range from 5 to 25. A score of 19 or less is indicative of asthma that is not well controlled. The minimally important difference for ACT is 3 points. ACT scores as an outcome measure were available in 150 of the 419 participants, 77 of whom were in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm. Data represent an average of those collected in the time period (weeks 12-60), where at least one value was available in this assessment period and at baseline for a participant.</description>

        <description>Treatment steps were established, per the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 guidelines. Steps 1-2 apply to mild asthma, 3 to moderate asthma, and 4-6 to severe asthma. At Step 0, the recommendation is for no asthma-control medication or albuterol as needed; at 1, budesonide 180 mcg once a day; at 2, budesonide 180 mcg twice a day; at 3, budesonide 360 mcg twice a day; at 4, fluticasoneâ€“salmeterol (Advair, GlaxoSmithKline) 250 mcg fluticasone and 50 mcg salmeterol twice a day; at 5, Advair 250 mcg and 50 mcg twice a day plus montelukast once a day; and at 6, Advair 500 mcg and 50 mcg twice a day plus montelukast once a day. (The doses for montelukast are 5 mg per day for those &lt;=14 years old and 10 mg per day for those &gt;=15 years.) Data represent an average of those in the time period, where at &gt;/= 1 value was available in this period and at baseline for a participant; results are model predicted numbers (e.g.,odds ratios converted to percentages).</description>

        <title>Asthma Caregiverâ€™s Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) Overall Score</title>
        <description>Asthma-Specific Quality of Life (QOL) Measure . The PACQLQ is a validated tool that measures limitations and anxieties faced by primary caregivers of children with asthma. Scores are calculated as the mean score within two domains of questions (re: activity limitation and emotional function) and overall scores represent the mean across all questions. The use of the PACQLQ is valid for use in the caretakers of children ages 7 to 17 years of age. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. Minimum possible score is 1 (maximum impairment); maximum possible score is 7 (no impairment). The range of actual scores were a minimum of 2.4 and a maximum of 7.
Method: Caretaker self-report. PACQLQ scores were available for 320 of 419 (76%) of study participant caretakers (159 in the Omalizumab (Xolair) + Conventional Therapy arm).</description>
