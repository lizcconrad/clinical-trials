    <textblock>
      This study is in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis(SAR)and will compare the effect
      versus placebo of repeat doses of intranasal GSK256066 using the Vienna Challenge Chamber.
      GSK256066 is a potent and highly selective phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, currently in
      development by GSK for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma and COPD.

      Subjects will be selected on the basis that they display a defined moderate response to the
      pre-determined dose used. Opportunity to assess the efficacy of compounds versus placebo at
      maximal and trough plasma concentrations.

      This study aims to explore the actions of repeat doses of intranasal GSK256066 in patients
      with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis in the Vienna Challenge Chamber compared to placebo.

      12-lead ECG, vital signs and adverse event enquiries will be made throughout the study. Nasal
      examination, symptom scores (TNSS), nasal lavage, nasal scrape and allergen challenge
      assessments will also be performed at various time points throughout the study.

             illness or disease as determined by their medical history

          -  Body mass index less than 29.0 kg/mÂ² with weight range of 55.0kg (females 50kg) to
             95.0kg inclusive.

          -  History of seasonal allergic rhinitis

          -  Exhibit a moderate response to 1500 grass pollen grains/m3 after 2h in the Vienna
             Challenge Chamber

          -  Positive skin prick test for grass pollen at or within the 12 months preceding the
             screening visit.

          -  Positive RAST for grass pollen at or within the 12 months preceding the screening
             visit.

          -  Current non-smokers who have not used any tobacco products in the 6 months preceding
             the screening visit with a pack history of less than 10 pack years.

          -  Baseline FEV1 80% predicted and a baseline FEV1(maximum recorded value)/FVC(maximum
             recorded value) 70% predicted

          -  No conditions or factors which would make the subject unlikely to be able to stay in
             the chamber for 6 hours.

          -  Capable of giving informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and
             restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  Available to complete all study measurements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  On examination the subject is found to have any structural nasal abnormalities or
             nasal polyposis, a history of frequent nosebleeds, recent nasal surgery or recent or
             ongoing upper respiratory tract infection which in the Responsible Physician's opinion

             or not, including steroids, vitamins, and herbal remedies Paracetamol and occasional
