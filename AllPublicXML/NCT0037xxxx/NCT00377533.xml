  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently available wheelchairs are often fitted with conventional rear anti-tip devices
      (C-RADs) to prevent wheelchair rear tips. The limitations of C-RADs have provided an
      incentive for the design of rear anti-tip devices that permit more rear tip without
      compromising safety (Arc-RADs).

      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that caregivers handling occupied
      wheelchairs equipped with Arc-RADs have higher success rates on RAD-relevant skills than
      caregivers handling wheelchairs equipped with C-RADs.
