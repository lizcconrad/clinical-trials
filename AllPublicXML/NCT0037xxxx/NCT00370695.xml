    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using
      the Precision implantable neurostimulation device for chronic and intractable back pain in
      subjects who are not candidates for surgery or who have chosen to seek alternative therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of symptoms of chronic back pain and/or lumbar radiculopathy is often difficult
      and inadequate. Current treatment options include pharmacological treatments, physical
      therapy, nerve blocks, surgical interruption of the pain pathway, or back surgery. Many
      patients either do not have adequate pain management with conventional treatments or are not
      able to tolerate the treatments due to significant side effects. Similarly, many patients are
      either not candidates for surgical interventions, or are unwilling to undergo such
      procedures. Spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective treatment for patients with
      pain following a failed back surgery, and this study will investigate spinal cord stimulation
      as a treatment option for the treatment of chronic back pain in patients who have never had
      back surgery. A successful study outcome will establish spinal cord stimulation as a
      less-invasive treatment option to be considered prior to surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have chronic and intractable neuropathic back pain and/or lumbar radiculopathy of
             moderate to severe intensity and have elected Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) as next
             line of treatment.

          -  Be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Be an appropriate candidate for the surgical procedures required for SCS implant.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with all study related procedures and visits.

          -  Be capable of reading and understanding patient information materials and giving
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had any back or spine surgery.

          -  Have any evidence of neurologic instability or any anatomic problem of the spine that
             requires surgery.

          -  Have any other chronic pain conditions likely to confound evaluation of study
             endpoints.

          -  Are a current substance abuser (including alcohol and illicit drugs).

          -  Have a significant psychiatric disorder.

          -  Have a condition currently requiring or likely to require the use of MRI or diathermy.

          -  Have an active implantable device.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant in the next year.

          -  Have participated in any drug or device trial in the last 4 weeks or plan to
             participate in any other study during the year.
