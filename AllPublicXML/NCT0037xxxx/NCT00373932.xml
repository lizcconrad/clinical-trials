  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
      efficacy of an exercise persistence intervention for patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) following pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise, a cornerstone of PR, is effective in improving dyspnea, functioning, and health
      related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with COPD. However, these improvements gradually
      dissipate following program completion. There are currently few successful interventions that
      support patients' persistence with community-based exercise after PR and that have closely
      monitored the potentially negative impact that COPD exacerbations have on exercise behaviors.
      Emerging technologies such as wirelessly enabled personal digital assistants (PDA) may
      provide an innovative means to support exercise persistence through real-time collaborative
      monitoring of exercise and signs and symptoms of COPD exacerbations and reinforcement to
      enhance exercise self-efficacy. Patient graduates of two PR programs who have COPD (n=20)
      will first undergo a 2-week run-in prior to being randomized to either the MOBILE (Mobilizing
      Support for Long-term Exercise) intervention or attention control for 6 months.
