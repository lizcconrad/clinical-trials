      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Thalidomide for treatment of disseminated MALT
      Lymphoma or at relapse following helicobacter pylori (HP) - eradication or chemotherapy or
      radiation.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectivity and the safety of thalidomide in
      patients with disseminated MALT lymphoma or at relapse following HP-eradication, or
      chemotherapy or radiation. It is a phase II prospective single arm study with a target sample
      size of 16 patients. Thalidomide is given orally at an initial dose of 100 mg for a maximum
      duration of 6 months.
