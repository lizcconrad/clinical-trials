  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue fever, caused by dengue viruses, is a major health problem in the tropical and
      subtropical regions of the world. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of and
      immune response to a new dengue virus vaccine in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses, which cause dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome, are a major cause of
      morbidity and mortality in several of the world's tropical and subtropical regions. The
      rDEN3/4delta30(ME) vaccine is a live attenuated dengue virus vaccine that may be protective
      against dengue virus serotype 3 (DEN3). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of the rDEN3/4delta30(ME) vaccine in healthy adults.

      This study will last 40 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of three
      doses of rDEN3/4delta30(ME) or placebo. Participants in Group 1 will receive the middle dose
      of rDEN3/4delta30(ME) or placebo at study entry. Group 2a will begin enrollment after the
      immunogenicity review of all participants in Group 1. Participants in Group 2a will receive
      the highest dose of rDEN4delta30(ME) or placebo at study entry. Group 2b will begin
      enrollment after the immunogenicity review of all participants in Group 2a. Participants in
      Group 2b will receive the lowest dose of rDEN4delta30(ME) or placebo.

      After vaccination, participants in all groups will be followed closely every other day for
      the first 16 days of the study. Participants will take their temperature three times a day
      through Day 16 and record each measurement in a diary. After Day 16, participants will have
      study visits on Days 21, 28, 42, and 180; a physical exam and blood collection will occur at
      all visits. Some participants may be asked to join a skin biopsy substudy.
