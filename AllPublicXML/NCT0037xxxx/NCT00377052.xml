      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may help gemcitabine work
      better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with gemcitabine
      works in treating patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy (response rate) of bortezomib and gemcitabine hydrochloride in
           patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter until relapse/progression.
