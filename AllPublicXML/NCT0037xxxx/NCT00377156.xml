      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause
      less damage to normal tissue. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiation therapy is more effective with or without
      whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying stereotactic radiation therapy and
      whole-brain radiation therapy to see how well they work compared with stereotactic radiation
      therapy alone in treating patients with brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with 1 to 3 cerebral metastases treated with
           stereotactic radiosurgery with vs without whole-brain radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare time to CNS (brain) failure in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life, duration of functional independence, and long-term
           neurocognitive status of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare post-treatment toxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (18 to 59 vs 60 and over), extracranial disease (controlled for ≤ 3 months vs controlled for
      &gt; 3 months), and number of brain metastases (1 vs 2 vs 3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo SRS as in arm I. Within 14 days, patients then undergo
           whole-brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2.5 weeks.

      Quality of life, functional independence, and neurocognitive status are assessed at baseline,
      at the beginning of each treatment, at weeks 6 and 12, and then at 6, 9, 12, 16, 24 , 36, 48,
      and 60 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 238 patients will be accrued for this protocol.

    <measure>Neurocognitive Progression as Measured by the Number of Participants With Cognitive Deterioration by 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post radiosurgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was cognitive deterioration (progression), defined as a decline of greater than 1 SD from baseline on at least 1 of 7 cognitive tests (all tests are standardized based on published norms and transformed so that higher values represent improved cognition) at the 3-month post-SRS evaluation. The number of participants who experienced cognitive deterioration by 3 months is reported for each arm below. For primary analysis of the 3-month cognitive deterioration endpoint, the Fisher exact 2-group binomial test was used to compare the proportion of evaluable patients with 3-month cognitive deterioration between the 2 groups.</description>

    <measure>Overall Quality of Life, as Measured by Mean Change From Baseline [3 Month]</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 3-Month Evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain, for which the range is from 0 to 200 and higher scores indicate better QOL. The Quality of Life (QOL) scores were transformed to a 0- to 100-point scale (with 100 being most favorable), in which a 10-point change was considered clinically significant. Intergroup changes in QOL scores were compared using a 2-sample t test.</description>

    <measure>Long-Term Neurocognitive Status (Long-Term Cognitive Status), as Measured by Percentage of Long-term Survivors With Cognitive Deterioration at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Long-Term Neurocognitive Status
&gt; To ascertain in patients with one to three brain metastases whether there is better long-term neurocognitive status in patients who receive SRS alone (Arm A) compared to patients who receive SRS combined with WBRT (Arm B). Long-term survival status is defined as evaluable patients who survived for at least 12 months and had at least one cognitive assessment on or after 365 days.</description>

The number of participants who experienced cognitive deterioration by 3 months is reported for each arm below. For primary analysis of the 3-month cognitive deterioration endpoint, the Fisher exact 2-group binomial test was used to compare the proportion of evaluable patients with 3-month cognitive deterioration between the 2 groups.</description>

        <title>Long-Term Neurocognitive Status (Long-Term Cognitive Status), as Measured by Percentage of Long-term Survivors With Cognitive Deterioration at 12 Months</title>
        <description>Long-Term Neurocognitive Status &gt; To ascertain in patients with one to three brain metastases whether there is better long-term neurocognitive status in patients who receive SRS alone (Arm A) compared to patients who receive SRS combined with WBRT (Arm B). Long-term survival status is defined as evaluable patients who survived for at least 12 months and had at least one cognitive assessment on or after 365 days.</description>
