      The purpose of this study is to determine whether zoledronic acid given intravenously every 6
      months can prevent reduction in bone mineral density in women with early stage breast cancer
      receiving adjuvant therapy with the aromatase inhibitor drug letrozole, after having received
      adjuvant tamoxifen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of hormone receptor positive
      metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women.It has more recently been approved for use
      in many countries as adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer; and is often used in an
      adjuvant regimen following 2-3 years of tamoxifen treatment or as an extended adjuvant
      therapy after up to 5 years of tamoxifen. Letrozole inhibits the conversion of androgens to
      estrogens in vitro and in vivo. Plasma levels of estradiol and related estrogen compounds in
      postmenopausal patients receiving letrozole are suppressed up to 95% from baseline and are
      often undetectable.The estrogen deprivation in women receiving letrozole may cause increased
      bone resorption and bone loss.Studies comparing tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, in
      adjuvant therapy have shown an increase fracture rate, and decreased bone mineral density in
      patients receiving aromatase inhibitors. Zoledronic acid is an intravenously administered
      bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption. Intravenous bisphosphonates are
      effective in reducing the rate of skeletal complications, including fractures, in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer and other tumors when given every few weeks. Small clinical
      trials have given some evidence that osteoporosis can be effectively treated by one or two
      doses of intravenous zoledronic acid per year. This study will determine the effect of giving
      zoledronic acid every 6 months on the bone mineral density of patients receiving letrozole as
      adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer after having received adjuvant tamoxifen for at
      least 2.5 years. Patients will be randomized to receive zoledronic acid either at the start
      of letrozole therapy or when bone mineral density T score drops below - 2 standard deviation
      or at the occurrence of a non-trauma related fracture.
