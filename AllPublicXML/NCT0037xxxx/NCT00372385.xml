SAE: medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to the study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event. &quot;Study drug&quot; includes all investigational agents (including placebo, if applicable) administered during the course of the study.</description>
