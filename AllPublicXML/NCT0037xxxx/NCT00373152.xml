      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor
      cells. Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may help in learning
      how well radiofrequency ablation works to kill breast cancer cells and help doctors predict
      whether breast cancer cells remain after treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well MRI works in predicting tumor response
      after radiofrequency ablation in women with invasive breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can induce complete tumor necrosis in women
           with invasive breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether breast MRI can accurately predict residual cancer and tumor necrosis
           in patients treated with RFA.

        -  Determine the toxicity of RFA in these patients.

        -  Determine the cosmetic outcome after RFA in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, nonrandomized study.

      Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) using gadopentetate dimeglumine.
      Within the next few days, patients undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) over approximately
      20-30 minutes. Patients then undergo a second DCE-MRI 3 to 21 days after RFA, followed by
      definitive surgery (standard mastectomy or lumpectomy).

      Pathologic confirmation of the post-ablation DCE-MRI findings is performed within 1 to 21
      days after the second MRI. Tumor cell viability and proliferative activity are assessed by
      immunohistochemical and biomarker analysis.

    <description>as rated by EORTC QLQ-C30. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. The rating system includes evaluation of breast size and shape, skin tone, nipple shape and location, appearance of the surgical scar, and overall cosmetic results. With the exception of evaluation of the surgical scar, all ratings are based on a comparison of the treated breast with the untreated breast. Patients will also rate the cosmetic outcome as excellent-good-fair-poor.</description>

    <description>RFA is accomplished by placing a multi-array needle within a tumor. The tines of the needle are advanced and opened like an inverted umbrella. High frequency, alternating current moves from the tip of an electrode into the surrounding tissue. Oscillating ions generate frictional heat within the tumor. Cell death occurs at sustained temperatures above 45-50 degrees C. The multi-array configuration creates an egg-shaped ablation zone up to 5 cm in diameter.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of invasive breast cancer - the following information must be known based on
             the needle core biopsy: tumor grade, hormone receptor status, and HER2/neu status.
             Patients with a previous history of either ipsilateral or contralateral excisional
             biopsy are not excluded. However, patients are excluded if an excisional biopsy was
             used to diagnose the current breast cancer.

        Note: Subjects undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy will not be excluded from this
        research study. It is not expected that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) will interfere with
        the SLN procedure because other studies have demonstrated the accuracy of sentinel node
        staging after excisional biopsy. The axillary staging in these subjects will be noted.

          -  Tumor size &lt; 2 centimeters by mammogram or ultrasound, with ultrasound being the
             preferred method of evaluation. Measurements by physical exam should also be recorded.
             If mammogram and ultrasound are discordant, then the imaging modality that determines
             the largest tumor size will be used to determine eligibility.

          -  Ultrasound measurements: Distance from tumor to skin must be &gt; 1 cm; distance from
             tumor to chest wall must be &gt; 1 cm. The RFA procedure, which burns the tumor, may also
             burn the skin or muscle if it is too close (&lt; 1cm).

          -  Laboratory values within 2 weeks of registration: platelet count ≥ 50,000; INR ≤ 1.6;
             serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60 ml/min/m^2

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Women must not be pregnant due to MR scanning of pregnant women is not FDA approved.
             All females of childbearing potential must have a urine study within 2 weeks prior to
             registration to rule out. Breast feeding must be discontinued prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects for whom neo-adjuvant therapy is planned will be excluded from this study

          -  Patients with history of severe asthma and/or allergies will be excluded to avoid
             potential adverse reactions to the MRI contrast agent (Gd-DTPA)

          -  Patients with pacemakers, any ferromagnetic implants or other ferromagnetic objects
             will be excluded

          -  Patients with obesity (&gt;250 pounds) will be excluded due to the limited diameter of
             the magnet bore tube

          -  Patients with history of severe claustrophobia will be excluded

        Patient must give written informed consent indicating the investigational nature of the
        study and its potential risks
