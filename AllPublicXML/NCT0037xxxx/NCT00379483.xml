  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 1-year randomized Phase IIa core trial followed by a prolongation of 5 to 9 months was
      conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of deferasirox in patients aged â‰¥ 18 years
      with transfusion-dependent iron overload.

      The objective of this extension study is to assess the long-term safety of deferasirox and to
      provide treatment in patients with transfusional iron overload.
