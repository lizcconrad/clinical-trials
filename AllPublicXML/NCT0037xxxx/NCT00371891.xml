  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidetector Computed Tomographic Coronary Angiography (MDCTCA) has been recently
      demonstrated to be accurate and may be used as a potential alternative to conventional
      invasive coronary angiography, which requires cardiac catheterization, for the diagnosis of
      coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study is to see if MDCTCA can identify
      significant coronary artery disease as good as or better than conventional coronary
      angiography (CICA). The study is designed to enroll 900 subjects and is being conducted in 6
      hospitals in Ontario. Subjects scheduled for conventional cardiac catheterization and
      coronary angiography will receive an additional test using MDCTCA. The information gathered
      during the MDCTCA will be compared to the results of the scheduled conventional invasive
      coronary angiogram.
