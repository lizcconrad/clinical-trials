      This study will examine and compare brain activity in people with focal hand dystonia (FHD)
      and healthy volunteers to obtain further knowledge about the underlying cause of FHD.
      Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause abnormal postures while trying to
      perform a movement; FHD affects the hands and fine finger movements. During fine finger
      movement, the brain controls muscles in a process called surround inhibition. This process
      may be impaired in people with hand dystonia, leading to uncontrolled overactivity in muscles
      and impairing motor function.

      Healthy volunteers and patients with FHD over 18 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates are screened with a physical and neurological examination.

      In a series of three experiments conducted during a single clinic visit, participants undergo
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while performing a finger movement. A wire coil is
      placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil,
      creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small
      electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. The stimulation may cause muscle, hand or
      arm twitching, or may affect movement or reflexes. During the stimulation, the subject is
      asked to contract one finger.

      In addition to TMS, subjects have surface electromyography. For this test, they sit in a
      chair with their hands placed on a pillow on their lap. The electrical activity of three
      muscles in the right hand is recorded by electrodes (small metal disks) taped to the skin
      over the muscles.

      OBJECTIVE:

      In sensory systems, a neural mechanism called surround inhibition (SI) sharpens sensation by
      creating an inhibitory zone around the central core of activation. This principle was
      described for the visual system first, but there is evidence for similar mechanisms in the
      primary motor cortex (M1) involved in movement generation and control, especially in precise
      motor tasks. Dystonia is generally regarded as a motor execution abnormality due to a
      dysfunction in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical motor loop. Using transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS), recent findings point to highly task-specific impairment of motor cortical
      inhibition in patients with focal hand dystonia (FHD).

      The goal for this research proposal is to understand the underlying physiology as it relates
      to different inhibitory pathways on movement generation and control. To achieve this goal,
      different modes of voluntary contractions will be examined in healthy controls and patients
      with FHD with the prospect of having new options for treatment.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      We intend to study 100 adult patients with FHD and 100 healthy volunteers on an outpatient
      basis.

      DESIGN:

      Participants will perform a contraction of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). At
      rest, before EMG-onset (premotor), during phasic and tonic contraction single TMS pulses
      (Experiment 1) or double TMS pulses (Experiment 2) will be applied over the primary motor
      cortex to assess activation-induced changes in cortical excitability in the abductor pollicis
      brevis muscle (APB), which is not activated. Additionally the influence of visual feedback on
      short intracortical inhibition (SICI) will be tested in Experiment 3. In Experiment 4-8
      interhemispheric (IHI), ventral and dorso-lateral premotor-motor intracortical inhibition
      will be assessed.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcome measure for Experiment 1 will be the difference in MEP peak-to-peak
      amplitude between all motor conditions.

      The primary outcome measure for Experiment 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 will be the difference in
      normalized MEP peak-to-peak amplitude between all motor conditions in FHD patients and
      healthy volunteers.

      In Experiments 1 and 2, the change in MEP peak-to-peak amplitude between different force
      levels (10% versus 20%) will be a second outcome parameter.

      The primary outcome parameter for Experiment 3 will be change in MEP peak-to-peak between
      patients and healthy volunteers during tonic contraction with and without visual feedback.

      In Experiment 4, Hmax/Mmax ratio will be the primary outcome parameter.
