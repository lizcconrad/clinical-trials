  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HOME-trial is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of metformin HCL in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      intensively treated with insulin on the quality of the metabolic control of diabetes, the
      daily dose of insulin, the lipid profile, the blood pressure, the incidence / progression of
      microvascular and macrovascular complications, and on the qualify of life (Diabetes Health
      Profile). Early results had been published in Diabetes Care, December 2002, pages 2133-2140.
