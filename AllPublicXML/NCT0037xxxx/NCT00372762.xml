  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with NYHA FC II-III heart failure will be randomized in a cross-over fashion to 8
      weeks of bumetanide versus furosemide therapy (equipotent dose), to test whether bumetanide
      therapy has a superior effect on insulin resistance compared to furosemide. Patients will be
      subject to a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) with minimal model
      (MINMOD) analysis to assess insulin resistance and to a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) to assess
      functional capacity; patient recruitment and retention success, as well as medication
      adherence, will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with a
      worse functional capacity and more severe symptoms of heart failure. The majority of HF
      patients take furosemide on at least a daily basis for symptom relief. Bumetanide is a loop
      diuretic with a similar therapeutic diuretic effect to furosemide. There is evidence from
      observational and small comparative trials that bumetanide has a significantly less
      deleterious effect on indirect measures of insulin resistance compared with furosemide.
      However, a formal comparison between the 2 drugs using rigorous measures of insulin
      resistance has never been conducted in patients with HF. If bumetanide can be demonstrated to
      have a similar diuretic and a superior (less deleterious) effect on insulin resistance in
      patients with HF, the potential exists for bumetanide to have a significantly reduced
      morbidity in patients with heart failure compared to furosemide. In order to prepare for such
      a study, the variance of the MINMOD-derived insulin resistance from the FSIGT (26), in this
      group of patient needs to be determined along with the feasibility of conducting such a
      study. Functional capacity will be determined by duplicate 6-minute walk tests.
