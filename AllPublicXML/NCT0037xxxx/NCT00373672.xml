    <textblock>
      This is a six week, double blind,placebo controlled study for patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder treated with an atypical antipsychotic for at least two months.
      Subjects will be randomized to take armodafinil (Nuvigil) or placebo along with their current
      antipsychotic and tested at baseline and week 6 for differences in memory, attention and
      problem-solving ability. Changes in weight during the six week study will also be tracked.
