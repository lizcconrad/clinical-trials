        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Previous anthracycline containing chemotherapy

          -  Presence of a certain protein on the cell surface (c-kit (CD117) and /or
             PDGF-receptor)

          -  Preferably tumor samples should be taken within 6 weeks of study entry. Most recent
             primary tumor tissue has to be available for analysis

          -  Acceptable health status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]-performance status

        Exclusion criteria: (for the second-line therapy)

          -  Patient with Grade III/IV cardiac problems (i.e., congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction within 6 months of study) and with severe and/or uncontrolled medical
             disease (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal disease, or active uncontrolled
             infection).

          -  Patient has a known brain metastasis, chronic liver disease (i.e., chronic active
             hepatitis, and cirrhosis) and diagnosis of (HIV) infection.

          -  Patient received chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry, unless the disease
             is rapidly progressing.

          -  Patient previously received radiotherapy to â‰¥ 25 % of the bone marrow and had a major
             surgery within 2 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Patient received either Vinorelbine or Imatinib in previous treatment regimens
