  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is associated with recurrent epistaxis in 90% of
      cases. Good response to hormone treatment has been documented, although its use remains
      controversial. A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with estrogen treatment did not show
      any benefit over placebo. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of an
      antiestrogenic agent, TAMOXIFEN, in the treatment of HHT-associated epistaxis. The study will
      include up to 60 patients, over 18 years old.

      Patients with HHT-related epistaxis who will attend our center will randomly be assigned to 6
      months of treatment with either Tab. tamoxifen 20 mg once daily or placebo. The group will
      included both men and women over the age of 18 years.

      A detailed medical history will be taken at presentation. All patients will be examined by an
      otolaryngologist before and during the trial to assess the nasal condition and telangiectases
      and blood clots in the airway, nasal and oral cavity, and body skin. Blood will be collected
      for blood count and measurement of clotting time and liver function at onset of the trial and
      once monthly during treatment. Patients will be requested to complete a daily chart
      describing the course of their epistaxis, and female patients will be referred for
      gynecologic follow-up, including ultrasound. Evaluations will be conducted once a month
      throughout the treatment period.

      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Rabin Medical Center. All patients will
      sign a consent form.
