  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blinded multicenter cohort study of Finnish children aged 2 to
      24 months. The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of two 7-valent pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccines (PncCRM and PncOMPC) parallelly, both vaccines compared with the same
      control vaccine (hepatitis B vaccine).

      The primary endpoint was culture-confirmed pneumococcal acute otitis media (AOM) episodes due
      to all serotypes included in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the primary hypothesis
      was that, compared to the control vaccine group, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine would
      protect infants from culture confirmed AOM caused by pneumococcal serotypes in the vaccine.
      The efficacy of the two vaccines against any pneumococcal AOM and any AOM was also evaluated.

      The children were vaccinated with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or the control vaccine
      at the age of 2, 4, 6 and 12 months and followed at study clinics established specifically
      for the purpose from 2 to 24 months of age. Whenever AOM was diagnosed during the follow-up,
      middle ear fluid was aspirated for bacterial culture.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  infants coming to their own child health center before the age of 13 weeks, and judged
             to be in good health on the basis of medical history and physical examination

          -  family living permanently in Tampere, Kangasala or Nokia

          -  at least one of the parents/guardians is able to communicate fluently in Finnish

          -  written informed consent obtained from a parent/guardian prior to enrollment in the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccines used in the study,

          -  known or suspected impairment of immunologic function,

          -  history of invasive pneumococcal disease,

          -  prior vaccination with any pneumococcal vaccine,

          -  prior vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine,

          -  contraindications to routine childhood immunizations

          -  any medical condition in which, in the opinion of the investigator, the study
             procedures or vaccinations might cause risk to the health or endanger the well-being
             of the child
