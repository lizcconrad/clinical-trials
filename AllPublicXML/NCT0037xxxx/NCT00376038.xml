  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK189075 is intended for use as a single treatment or in combination with other treatments
      for tye 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin is widely used in Europe and the USA for the
      treatment of T2DM. This study will evaluate the effect of GSK189075 on metformin levels in
      the blood in T2DM subjects. The rationale is to look for any safety problems that may result
      when the 2 drugs are given together.
