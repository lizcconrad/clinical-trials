  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient transfer between sites of care is regular practice during an episode of care in our
      current health care system. Yet inter-site transfer is associated with lapses in care quality
      that adversely affect patient outcomes. A common iatrogenic harm precipitated at the time of
      transfer is harm from drug prescribing, or adverse drug events (ADEs). In this study we will
      evaluate a medication reconciliation tool developed to help providers make effective
      prescribing decisions at the time of transfer between VA sites of care (Improved Prescribing
      after Transfer (IPT)). We will evaluate the quantitative effectiveness of the tool in
      reducing transition drug risk and ADEs. We additionally will conduct focus group discussions
      and cognitive task analysis among end-users to better understand how providers make
      drug-prescribing decisions at the time of transfer and to assess factors influencing
      effective use of the tool.

      This is a 2-phase study in which we will employ mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to
      conduct an evaluation of the IPT tool while improving our understanding of provider
      prescribing decisions at the time of patient transfer. In Phase 1 we will conduct a 5-month
      controlled trial among all admissions to 2 units at J.J. Peters (Bronx) VA Medical Center. We
      will compare IPT with usual care, and compare physician and pharmacist forms of IPT
      implementation with regard to, as primary outcome, transition drug risk, and, as secondary
      outcomes, ADEs, provider prescribing-decisions, and hospital utilization. In Phase 2, which
      will run concurrently with Phase 1, we will perform cognitive task analysis to examine
      providers' decision-making and to map IPT tool functions while providers interface with the
      tool, and perform focus group interviews with representative IPT users to identify factors
      that facilitate or hinder adoption. Results of cognitive analysis and focus groups will be
      used to identify tool deficiencies to consider for redesign.
