    <textblock>
      Lead poisoning remains a common disease among children despite successful public health
      efforts that reduced its prevalence.Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that
      lead-poisoning children (BLLs:100-440µg/L) who were given DMSA and multi-nutrients would have
      a greater fall than children of other groups at 12 weeks of follow-up.
