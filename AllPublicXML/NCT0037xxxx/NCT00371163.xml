      Spongiotic dermatitis is the histopathologic diagnosis commonly issued by dermatopathologists
      that encompasses atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and other forms of eczematous
      dermatitis.

      The information obtained will assist in development of diagnostic methods for differentiation
      of the types of spongiotic dermatitis. This study also has the potential to lead to the
      dissection of pathologic pathways involved in these diseases and development of novel
      therapeutic agents.

      Spongiotic dermatitis is the histopathologic diagnosis commonly issued by dermatopathologists
      that encompasses atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and other forms of eczematous
      dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease characterized by
      pruritic, scaly, red, eczematous skin lesions, and a personal or family history of atopy.
      Patients affected by atopic dermatitis experience significant morbidity from extreme
      pruritus, recurrent cutaneous infections, and extensive and/or disfiguring skin lesions.
      Allergic contact dermatitis typically manifests as pruritus and vesicular or eczematous
      lesions associated with direct exposure to environmental haptenic allergens.

      The specific aims of this research are:

        1. Identification of genes differentially expressed in atopic dermatitis, contact
           dermatitis, and psoriasis by microarray analyses.

        2. Confirmation of protein expression profiles in atopic and contact dermatitis, and
           psoriasis by immunohistochemical analyses.

        3. Identification of disease-specific potential diagnostic markers in plasma and PBMC.

      The information obtained will assist in development of diagnostic methods for differentiation
      of the types of spongiotic dermatitis. This study also has the potential to lead to the
      dissection of pathologic pathways involved in these diseases and development of novel
      therapeutic agents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Atopic Dermatitis: Subjects will be identified based on the Hanifin criteria of atopic
             dermatitis. Subjects will be adults with a history of atopic dermatitis since
             childhood, who continue to have symptoms and signs of atopic dermatitis. They must
             have active lesions and should not be on systemic therapy.

          2. Contact Dermatitis: Subjects will be adults with history of contact dermatitis to
             common allergens. They will undergo patch testing to common allergens and the sites of
             positive reactions will be considered as lesional skin.

          3. Psoriasis: Subjects will be adults with chronic disease, who have active skin lesions
             with a characteristic morphology.

        Subjects will be asked to discontinue topical medications at least to parts of the skin
        where biopsies will be taken, one week prior to biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on systemic treatment of their skin diseases within the past one month.

          -  A history of significant neurologic, hepatic, renal, endocrine, cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or metabolic diseases.

          -  Abnormal hepatic function or renal function (creatinine or BUN is &gt; 1.2 times the
             upper level of the normal range for the laboratory where the testing is done).

          -  Abnormal blood counts (WBC &lt; 4 x 103/mm3; platelet &lt; 100 x 103/mm3; hemoglobin &lt;
             11g/dl).

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Known hepatitis or HIV.

          -  Pregnant women (as determined by serum pregnancy test).

          -  Significant allergic or adverse reaction to local anesthetics.

          -  Blood clotting disorder.

          -  Faintness or vasovagal reaction with blood draws or procedures.
