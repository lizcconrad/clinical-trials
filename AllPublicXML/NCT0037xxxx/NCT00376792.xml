      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      docetaxel after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. Sometimes, after
      surgery, the tumor may not need more treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation
      may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether giving docetaxel after surgery is more
      effective than observation in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying docetaxel to see how well it works
      compared with observation in treating patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy for
      prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in patients with
           margin-positive tumors after undergoing radical prostatectomy for high-grade prostate
           cancer treated with docetaxel versus observation.

      Secondary

        -  Compare PSA doubling time in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of these patients.

        -  Compare overall and metastasis-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center and tumor stage (pT2 vs pT3). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
           days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, directly after and 6 months after completing study
      treatment, and then annually thereafter.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation until PSA progression (defined as PSA ≥ 0.5 ng/mL)
           Quality of life is assessed at baseline, week 19, and annually thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 396 patients will be accrued for this study.
