      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of radiation over a specific period of
      time that Orthopaedic Surgeons are exposed to while using the mini c-arm fluoroscopy machine.
      The amount of radiation that the Surgeons will be exposed to will be recorded by a ring
      dosimeter located on the Surgeons' hand, and two badge dosimeters (one above the scrub
      collar, and one underneath a lead gown at waist level).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        This study will only enroll the Surgeons of the Vanderbilt Hand and Upper Extremity Center.
        There will be no inclusion/exclusion criteria for the type of surgery that will be
        monitored, nor the patients that are having surgery. If a mini c-arm fluoroscopy is used
        the amount of radiation received by the Surgeon's hand for that surgery will be monitored
        by a gas-sterilized radiation ring dosimeter. The amount of scatter radiation the Surgeon
        will be exposed to will be recorded by a badge dosimeter located on the Surgeon's scrub
        collar, and one badge dosimeter that will be located under the required lead gown worn by
        the Surgeon.
