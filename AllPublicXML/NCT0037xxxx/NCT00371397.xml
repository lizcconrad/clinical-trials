      This study is designed to examine the effects of hatha yoga on autonomic, immune, and
      endocrine function. The data from both inexperienced and experienced groups will help us
      better understand how longer-term practice of yoga may be beneficial. The study consists of
      one 3-hour screening session and three 6-hour activity sessions with 30 minute follow-up
      appointments the following morning scheduled 2 - 4 weeks apart. Each participant will
      complete the 3 activity sessions, which will consist of either yoga, mild movement, or a
      neutral activity (watching a videotape), in randomly assigned order. Thus, both novices and
      experts will participate in 3 activity sessions each (yoga, movement control, video control).
      The order in which each participant goes through the activity sessions is counterbalanced.
      Data for each activity session will be aggregated by group (i.e. novice or expert). We will
      measure responses to tape stripping to assess skin barrier repair, and evaluate responses to
      computer tasks, self-report measures, and a battery of unobtrusive behavioral measures. We
      will also collect blood and saliva samples to measure immune and endocrine outcomes.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Detectable C-Reactive Protein (CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>8:30 a.m. at each of the three visits, scheduled at least 2 weeks apart</time_frame>
    <description>High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assessed once at baseline, at each of the three visits. The hsCRP assay was performed using chemiluminescence methodology with the Immulite 1000 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Los Angeles, Ca.) The lowest level of detection is .3 mg/dL. 43% of the values were below this lower bound, thus hsCRP was dichotomized as undetectable/detectable.</description>

    <measure>Skin Barrier Repair: Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL)</measure>
    <time_frame>11:50, 12:50 at each of the three visits, scheduled at least 2 weeks apart</time_frame>
    <description>Cellophane tape stripping, a common dermatological paradigm for studying restoration of the skin barrier, was used to examine whether the time necessary for recovery from minor physical insults varied by condition or yoga expertise. Measurement of the rate of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) through human skin provides a noninvasive method to monitor changes in the skin's barrier function. TEWL was measured twice during the session using a computerized evaporimetry instrument, the DermaLab® (CyberDERM, Media, PA), and barrier recovery was calculated.</description>

    <description>Iyengar yoga, the form of hatha yoga used in this study, emphasizes the use of props to help students achieve precise postures safely and comfortably according to their particular body types and needs. The yoga activity sessions were directed by four experienced yoga teachers following a script. The poses used were (in order) Supta Baddha Konasana (Reclining Bound Angle Pose), Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog), Supported Uttanasana (Intense Forward Stretch), Parsvotanasana (Intense Side Stretch Pose), Prasarita Padottanansana (Wide-Legged Forward Bend), Janu Sirsasana (Head to Knee Pose), Bharadvajasana (Simple Seated Twist Pose), Viparita Karani (Restful Inversion), Supported Setu Bandha Sarvanagasana (Bridge Pose), and Savasana (Corpse Pose). Blood draws occurred during the last two minutes of Supta Baddha Konasana (pose held 10 minutes), Viparita Karani (10 minutes), and Savasana (15 minutes).</description>

    <description>Walking on a treadmill at .5 miles per hour was used to control for general physical movement/cardiovascular expenditure because it best approximated the heart rates during the restorative yoga session. To match the lower heart rate, women also rested supine on a bed for several minutes after walking, before and after getting their blood drawn.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Detectable C-Reactive Protein (CRP)</title>
        <description>High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assessed once at baseline, at each of the three visits. The hsCRP assay was performed using chemiluminescence methodology with the Immulite 1000 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Los Angeles, Ca.) The lowest level of detection is .3 mg/dL. 43% of the values were below this lower bound, thus hsCRP was dichotomized as undetectable/detectable.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Detectable C-Reactive Protein (CRP)</title>
          <description>High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assessed once at baseline, at each of the three visits. The hsCRP assay was performed using chemiluminescence methodology with the Immulite 1000 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Los Angeles, Ca.) The lowest level of detection is .3 mg/dL. 43% of the values were below this lower bound, thus hsCRP was dichotomized as undetectable/detectable.</description>

        <title>Skin Barrier Repair: Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL)</title>
        <description>Cellophane tape stripping, a common dermatological paradigm for studying restoration of the skin barrier, was used to examine whether the time necessary for recovery from minor physical insults varied by condition or yoga expertise. Measurement of the rate of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) through human skin provides a noninvasive method to monitor changes in the skin’s barrier function. TEWL was measured twice during the session using a computerized evaporimetry instrument, the DermaLab® (CyberDERM, Media, PA), and barrier recovery was calculated.</description>
