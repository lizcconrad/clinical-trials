      This study is being undertaken to: 1. assess the safety of fluorouracil cream for the
      treatment of actinic keratoses (&quot;AKs&quot;) on other common skin surface areas (e.g., posterior
      scalp, ears, neck, lips, arms and hands); 2. collect additional post-treatment safety data on
      fluorouracil cream applied to the face (including anterior scalp, if applicable); 3. assess
      the incidence of recurrence of AKs on the face; and 4. assess the need for re-treatment with
      fluorouracil cream to the face.

        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to
        allow patients and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace
        the advice of a personal physician or health professional.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must give written informed consent;

          -  Patients must have at least 5 visible and/or palpable AKs on the posterior scalp,
             ears, neck, lips, arms and/or hands (across all other body sites) and an additional 5
             visible and/or palpable AKs on the face (including anterior scalp, if applicable);

          -  Female patients must be post-menopausal for at least one year, or have had a
             hysterectomy, or have had a tubal ligation, or use oral/systemic contraceptives, an
             intrauterine device (IUD) or Norplant starting at least 28 days prior to study entry
             and throughout the study. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test prior to the first application of test medication

          -  Patients must be compliant and willing to return to the study site for designated
             follow-up visits.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Pregnant or lactating females;

          -  Patients with a current skin condition on the face, scalp, ears, neck, lips, arms
             and/or hands that could confound the study, including basal cell and squamous cell
             carcinomas;

          -  Patients with a known allergy to any ingredients of the test drug formulations;

          -  Patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme deficiency;

          -  Patients whose activities involve excessive or prolonged exposure to sunlight;

          -  Patients who use a tanning parlor;

          -  Patients treated with other topical agents for the treatment of actinic keratosis in
             the designated treatment area within 5 months prior to the start of the study are
             prohibited;

          -  Patients who have had liquid nitrogen treatment for AKs within 4 weeks prior to study
             start in the designated treatment area;

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse.
