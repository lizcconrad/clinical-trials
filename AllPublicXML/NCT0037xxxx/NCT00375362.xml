  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo general anestheesia for total knee arthroplasty pften have sever
      postoperative pain which hinders their rehabilitation. Nitroglycerin patches have been found
      to cause alleviation of pain especially when used in conjuction with morphine. Therefore we
      propose placement of a nitroglycerin patch after total kneee arthroplasty surgery and see how
      it affects pain scores or causes less nedd for morphine after surgery.

      Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty will be randomized into two groups: control and
      placebo.

      Eache patient will undergo total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia. Both groups will
      get the same anesthetic protocal. At the end of surgery, before awakening patients will
      recieve either a nitroglycerin or placebo patch on their back. Both the participant and the
      investigator will be blinded to the group assisignment. At the end of surgery both groups
      will recieve morphine for postoperative pain. In the recovery room they will be given patient
      controlled analgesia with morphine. An investigator blinded to study assisignment will record
      pain scores, sedation scores, nauseau and vomiting. Patients will be given patient controlled
      analgesia for 24 hours and they will be followed for pain levels, morphine use, sedation and
      nauseau levels. The nitroderm or placebo patch will be removed after 24 hours.
