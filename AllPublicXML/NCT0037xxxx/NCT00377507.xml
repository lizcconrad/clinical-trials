      The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of catechin mouth-washing on the removal
      of intraoral bacteria in the elderly

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catechins are the major components of tea flavonoids and recent in vitro experimental studies
      have revealed that tea catechin extracts induce bactericidal effects. However, a limited
      number of studies have been conducted on the clinical effects of tea catechin against
      bacterial infection and also the effects in the elderly is unclear. Based on these
      backgrounds, we designed a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the effects of
      catechin mouth washing on oral pathogenic bacterial detected in the elderly.
