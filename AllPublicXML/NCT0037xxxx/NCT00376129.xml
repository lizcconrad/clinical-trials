      Protocol Title: Open-label,single center study to evaluate the savety and efficacy of an
      intramuscular 12 week-course of Alefacept in patients with atopic dermatitis.

      Study Phase: II

      Study Design: Open-label, single center Primary Study Objective: to determine the safety and
      efficacy of one course of Alefasept when administered as a 15 mg intramuscular ( IM)
      injektion to patients with atopic dermatitis

      Secondary Study Objective: to investigate key immunological parameters involved in the
      pathology of this common skin disease to interpret the clinical findings

      Number of patients: 10

      Study Population: Male and female patients, at least 18 years of age with atopic dermatitis,
      aktive inflammation, a severity score of 6-9 according to Langeland and Rajika and an EASI of
      &gt;20

      Treatment Groups: Alefacept will be administered as a 15 mg IM injection once a week for 12
      weeks, followed by a 12-week follow-up period.

    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic eczematous skin disease,wich often begins early in
      infancy and runs a course of remissions and exacerbations. T-lymphocytes play a prominent
      role in this skin disease. they represent the majority of skin-infiltrating cells and
      patients suffering from AD also have increased levels of activated circulating T cells and
      increased levels of markers of lymphocyte activation such as L-selectin and IL-2R.
