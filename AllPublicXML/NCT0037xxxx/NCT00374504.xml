      The aim of this study is to evaluate a possible correlation between predictive precesarean
      section pain and development of postcaesarean section pain using the PM.

      Patients and Methods 46 healthy pregnant women scheduled for elective cesarean section is
      included after informed consent. The standard operation procedures included spinal
      anesthesia, paracetamol 1 g 8 hourly, diclofenac 50 mg 8 hourly and oxycontine 10 mg x 2.
      Morphine was used for break-through pain.

      Before cesarian section the threshold for sensory and pain were measured 3 times, and the
      average was used for analyses. After cesarian section a blinded midwife assess the pain at
      rest and during mobilization every 12th hours over 2 days score.

      Data was analyzed using AUC and non-parametric test, P &lt; 0,05.
