    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is a deadly cancer that is typically hard to diagnose and treat. The currently
      used blood marker for the clinical diagnosis of liver cancer is alpha-feto protein (AFP),
      which misses 40-60% of patients with liver cancer because it lacks sufficient specificity and
      sensitivity. The purpose of this study is to identify blood markers that have the ability to
      diagnose liver cancer with improved accuracy, so that it can be used alone or in conjunction
      with AFP. The aim of this study is to identify new blood markers of liver cancer that can be
      used to increase the rate of accurate diagnosis of this malignancy.
