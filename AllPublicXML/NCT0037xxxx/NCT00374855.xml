  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that LY518674, administered for
      6 weeks to patients with mild hypertension, reduces Systolic Blood Pressure, compared with
      placebo.

    <measure>To test the hypothesis that LY518674, administered for 6 weeks to patients with mild hypertension, reduces 24-hour mean ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure, compared with placebo.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the duration and consistency of the reduction in BP over the course of a day, relative to placebo, after 6 weeks of treatment with LY518674 when taken once daily</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the population dose, exposure, and time response relationships of LY518674 for lowering the mean SBP and DBP during the 8 hour awake period, using ABPM during a 6 week treatment and following cessation of dosing</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the effect of LY518674 on CBPM SBP and DBP with that of placebo</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the percentage of responders to LY518674, relative to placebo, as defined by patients who achieve target BP goals of CBPM SBP &lt;140 mm Hg and/or DBP 90 mm Hg, or a CBPM SBP decrease of at least 10 mm Hg</measure>
