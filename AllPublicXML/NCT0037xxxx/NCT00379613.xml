  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of sugammadex when this compound
      is administered during deep neuromuscular block. Sugammadex is administered shortly (5
      minutes) after administration of a high dose (1.2 mg/kg) of the neuromuscular blocking agent
      rocuronium . Under these circumstance the neuromuscular block is deep. The safety and
      pharmacokinetics of sugammadex are also studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ASA 1 - 2 between the ages of 18 and 64, inclusive

          -  Scheduled for surgical procedures with an anticipated duration of anesthesia of at
             least 90 minutes, without further need for muscle relaxation other than for intubation

          -  Scheduled for surgery in supine position

          -  Given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects in whom a difficult intubation because of anatomical malformations was
             expected

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have neuromuscular disorders impairing neuromuscular
             block (NMB) and/or significant renal dysfunction

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have a (family) history of malignant hyperthermia

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have an allergy to narcotics, muscle relaxants or other
             medication used during general anesthesia

          -  Subjects receiving medication known to interfere with neuromuscular blocking agents
             such as anticonvulsants and Mg2+

          -  Subjects who had already participated in CT 19.4.205

          -  Subjects who had participated in another clinical trial, not pre-approved by NV
             Organon, within 30 days of entering into CT 19.4.205

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant: in females pregnancy was to be excluded both from
             medical history and by an hCG test within 24 hours before surgery except in females
             who were not of childbearing potential i.e. at least 2 years postmenopausal or
             underwent tubal ligation or an hysterectomy

          -  Females of childbearing potential not using an acceptable method of birth control:
             condom or diaphragm with spermicide, vasectomized partner (&gt;6 months), IUD, abstinence

          -  Subjects giving breast-feeding
