  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm crossover study will evaluate patient reported preference for either once monthly
      Boniva (150mg p.o.) or once weekly risedronate (35mg p.o.). Patients with post-menopausal
      osteoporosis will be randomized to receive Boniva for 3 calendar months or risedronate for 12
      weeks; they will then cross over to receive the alternative treatment for a further 12
      weeks/3 months. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample
      size is 100-500 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Preferred Ibandronate Monthly Dosing to Risedronate Weekly Dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who had taken at least one dose of each study medication were asked to answer a Preference Questionnaire (answered by patients before any study procedures took place at the 6 month visit or at the early termination visit). The questionnaire included three questions on the preferred dosing schedule, and one question asking which schedule was more convenient. No assistance was allowed in completing the questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Found Once-monthly Ibandronate to be More Convenient Than Once-weekly Risedronate</measure>
    <time_frame>within 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who had taken at least one dose of each study medication were asked to answer a Preference Questionnaire (answered by patients before any study procedures took place at the 6 month visit or at the early termination visit).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were given a diary in which to record their upper GI events during the first 12 weeks of treatment. The diary was to be completed weekly and the occurrence of symptoms and their intensity recorded using a pre-defined list.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Bone Resorption and Bone Formation Markers, Serum C-telopeptide of α-chain of Type I Collagen (CTX) and Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>During the conduct of this study, it came to the attention of the sponsor that mislabeling of blood samples for the analysis of the bone turnover markers, serum CTX and BSAP, had occurred at more than half of the 44 clinical trial sites. As a result of this mislabeling, the bone turnover marker samples could not be assigned correctly to the two time points at which they were collected (samples collected at baseline and those collected at the crossover visit which occurred after 3 months following the start of trial treatment). Thus, the results of bone turnover markers could not be reliably assessed. Therefore, summary tables showing the mean and median change from baseline for both serum CTX and BSAP for patients randomized to Sequence A (3 months of ibandronate followed by 12 weeks of risedronate) or Sequence B (12 weeks of risedronate followed by 3 months of ibandronate) are not presented, as a valid interpretation of the data cannot be made.</description>

          <description>Patients who had taken at least one dose of each study medication were asked to answer a Preference Questionnaire (answered by patients before any study procedures took place at the 6 month visit or at the early termination visit). The questionnaire included three questions on the preferred dosing schedule, and one question asking which schedule was more convenient. No assistance was allowed in completing the questionnaire.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Bone Resorption and Bone Formation Markers, Serum C-telopeptide of α-chain of Type I Collagen (CTX) and Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP)</title>
        <description>During the conduct of this study, it came to the attention of the sponsor that mislabeling of blood samples for the analysis of the bone turnover markers, serum CTX and BSAP, had occurred at more than half of the 44 clinical trial sites. As a result of this mislabeling, the bone turnover marker samples could not be assigned correctly to the two time points at which they were collected (samples collected at baseline and those collected at the crossover visit which occurred after 3 months following the start of trial treatment). Thus, the results of bone turnover markers could not be reliably assessed. Therefore, summary tables showing the mean and median change from baseline for both serum CTX and BSAP for patients randomized to Sequence A (3 months of ibandronate followed by 12 weeks of risedronate) or Sequence B (12 weeks of risedronate followed by 3 months of ibandronate) are not presented, as a valid interpretation of the data cannot be made.</description>
