      Objective: To determine and compare the effect of low dose estrogen combined hormonal
      contraceptives and progestin-only contraceptives on lactation.

      The subjects will be drawn from a healthy obstetric population in each center, where possible
      preliminary contact during antenatal period. At the postpartum visit, subjects that express
      their wish for a hormonal contraceptive method will be offered enrollment. After obtaining an
      informed consent the participants will be allocated according to their free wish to either
      receive a combined preparation containing 0.02 mg ethylestradiol and 0.15 mg desogestrel
      (Mercilon, Organon) or a progestin only pill containing 0.075 mg desogestrel (Cerazette,
      Organon). Demographic, habits and perinatal data will be collected and stored to analysis.

      Frequency and methods of observation: All women will be followed at 6 (baseline), 9 and 12
      weeks post - partum. Instruction will be given as to recording information on intercurrent
      disease, frequency of nursing and use of complementary formula supplements. Maternal BMI
      calculation ( weight/height2) will be obtained at first visit.

      The objective is to compare the capacity of the breast to secrete milk under standard
      conditions and evaluate the influence of different hormonal contraception means. Thus samples
      will be collected at 6 weeks (enrollment) and the 9 and 12 weeks visits. An Egnell pump will
      be used for a maximum of 20 minutes form from both breasts, simulating a regular breast
      feeding. A total of 10 ml aliquot will be taken for composition analysis and the rest will be
      offered to the infant. The milk volume/feeding will be estimated and expressed in ml/feeding
      and multiplied by the number of feedings reported.

      Outcome variables: Milk volume, infant growth at each visit and biochemical markers of milk
      analysis : lipid, casein and carbohydrate content
