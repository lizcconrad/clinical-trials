  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines two new malaria vaccines (FP9-PP and MVA-PP) in healthy human volunteers
      to determine their safety and ability to induce a measurable immune response against malaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria infection kills over 2 million people each year. It is a major problem for those who
      live in endemic areas and for travellers. There is clearly a great need for a safe effective
      malaria vaccine.

      The purpose of this study is to test two candidate malaria vaccines (FP9-PP and MVA-PP) in
      different concentrations and combinations. These live viral vectors encode a ’polyprotein’ of
      six fused malaria antigens expressed at liver and blood stages of the malaria parasite
      lifecycle. MVA-PP uses the Modified Virus Ankara vector, a weakened form of the smallpox
      vaccine, vaccinia. FP9-PP uses a highly attenuated avian pox virus (FP9) as the vector
      instead. The two vaccines will be used in combination in a ’prime boost’ strategy to enhance
      the response of the cellular immune system.

      This study will:

        1. Examine safety

        2. Examine immunogenicity

        3. Provide a subgroup of vaccinated volunteers to test clinical efficacy in the following
           malaria challenge study (VAC027.2)
