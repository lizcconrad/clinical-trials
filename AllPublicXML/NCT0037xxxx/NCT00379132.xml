  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the ability of intravenously (IV)administered
      131-I-labeled TM-601 (chlorotoxin) to provide tumor-specific localization(via radiographic
      imaging) in patients with recurrent or refractory primary solid tumors with evidence of
      metastatic involvement. (Refractory tumors are non-responsive to standard treatment.) The
      safety and tolerability of IV administered 131-I-TM-601 in this patient population will be
      evaluated as part of this study.

      This is a multi-center, open label, non-randomized, sequential, within-patient
      dose-escalation study in patients with recurrent or refractory primary solid tumors with
      metastatic involvement (including brain metastases). Patients will be administered 1 to 3
      (Test Doses A, B and Dose C) escalating doses of 131-I-TM-601 by intravenous (IV)
      administration, with dosimetry (imaging-based evaluation of the dose reaching the target
      sites) conducted prior to and following administration of each dose. Whole body dosimetry on
      critical structures including, but not limited to, bone marrow, bladder, brain, liver, and
      thyroid will be determined. The preliminary results from Test Dose Levels (A and/or B) for
      each patient will be analyzed prior to treating patients with Dose C.

      Patients will be followed until 28 days following the final dose, with a complete clinical
      assessment and imaging evaluations at the final follow-up visit.

    <description>Patients will be administered 1 - 3 (Test Doses A, B, and Dose C) escalating doses of 131I-TM601 by intravenous (IV) administration. Each dose will be administered as a single administration, scheduled at one-week intervals.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or refractory primary solid tumor malignancy.
             Primary tumor cell type is one of the following: breast, non-small cell lung,
             melanoma, colorectal, prostatic adenocarcinoma (hormone refractory) or glioma. Note:
             Patients with a primary solid tumor cell type not listed above, meeting all other
             selection criteria may be considered eligible, on a case by case basis

          -  Demonstration of distant metastatic involvement as seen with standard clinical
             non-invasive imaging techniques (CT/MRI) or on biopsy. Note: on a case-by-case basis,
             patients with a locally recurrent, unresectable (inoperable) tumor may be considered
             for inclusion

          -  Refractory to standard curative treatment

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Baseline Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 60-100%

          -  Life expectancy, based on investigator judgement, of greater than 3 months

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function (as defined in protocol)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, refrain from
             nursing, and must agree to use appropriate contraception for the duration of the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas
             or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Patients who have not sufficiently recovered from adverse events due to previously
             administered agents

          -  Concurrent treatment with investigational or commercial agents or therapies
             administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy, including
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biological response modifiers, or palliative
             radiotherapy. Possible exceptions (at the discretion of the investigator) are for
             hormonal therapy for breast and prostate cancer, hematologic, analgesic,
             biphosphonate, and any other form of supportive therapy.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to 131-I-labeled chlorotoxin (e.g. iodine or iodine-containing drugs)

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.
