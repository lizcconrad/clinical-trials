    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well education with or without physical therapy
      intervention works in preventing lymphedema in women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer
      who are undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (surgery to remove lymph nodes found in the
      armpit region). Lymphedema is a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and
      causes swelling in an arm or leg if lymph vessels are blocked, damaged, or removed by
      surgery. A personalized physical therapy intervention and education materials may be better
      than education materials alone in preventing lymphedema in women with breast cancer who are
      undergoing axillary lymph node dissection.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test, in a group randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of this program versus
      education only in reducing the incidence of lymphedema.

      II. To compare the severity of lymphedema, in terms of changes in arm circumference at the
      site of greatest difference as a continuous variable between the two interventions.

      III. To assess the agreement between patients' self-report of swelling (mild, moderate, and
      severe) and the extent of circumferential measurement difference between the treated side and
      the contralateral arm at the site of greatest difference.

      IV. To compare the health-related quality of life (Factional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Breast [FACT-B]+4 score) between the two interventions.

      V. To characterize adherence to lymphedema prevention exercises, lymphedema knowledge, and
      range of motion.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Six weeks after surgery, patients receive a brief initial post-operative care session
      describing lymphedema risk and prevention through oral instruction and written materials.
      Patients complete physical assessments and questionnaires at 6 weeks and at 6, 12, and 18
      months. Patients are also contacted by telephone at 9 and 15 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive lymphedema education and complete physical assessments and
      questionnaires as in Arm I. Patients also complete a personalized physical therapy
      intervention, receive a refrigerator magnet, and a 15-minute video that reinforces
      information and exercises.

    <description>To compare the health-related quality of life (FACT-B+4 score) between the two interventions. The change between baseline and month 18 for the total plus 4 score will be reported here. The total plus 4 score is an average of the physical, social, emotional, functional, FACT-G, and additional concerns sub-scales. Each sub-scale has questions ranging from 1-5. Once the average of all subscales is taken, the total plus 4 score is converted into a score out of 100. 100 being the best, 0 being the worst.</description>

          -  Newly diagnosed with stage I-III cancer of the female breast

          -  No prior history of carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), ductal
             carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or invasive breast cancer

             * Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies are eligible as long as they
             have completed treatment and are 5 years post-diagnosis; patients with basal cell and
             squamous cell cancer of the skin are eligible

          -  Neoadjuvant therapy

               -  Patients scheduled to receive any type of radiation therapy to the breast or
                  axilla are eligible; however, they must be registered to this study with
                  pre-surgery measures taken prior to receiving neoadjuvant therapy

               -  Patients scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are also eligible;
                  however, they must be registered to this study with pre-surgery measurements
                  taken prior to receiving neoadjuvant therapy

               -  Patients receiving no neoadjuvant therapy are eligible

          -  May be enrolled on other treatment trials; however, patients enrolled on surgery
             trials where only one treatment arm is full axillary node dissection are not eligible;
             NOTE: Patients enrolled on American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)-Z1071
             are eligible to participate in this study; patients concurrently enrolled on this
             study and ACOSOG-Z1071, may not also be enrolled on the ACOSOG-Z1071 lymphedema
             sub-study

          -  No documented cardiac conduction disturbances, unstable angina, dementia, or any other
             chronic disease which, in the opinion of the treating physician, significantly

             arms are ineligible; patients who undergo these treatments (i.e., surgery and/or
             radiation) on the contralateral arm after registration to Step 2 are still eligible to
             remain in the study; however, it should be documented appropriately on form C-1628 at

        <description>To compare the health-related quality of life (FACT-B+4 score) between the two interventions. The change between baseline and month 18 for the total plus 4 score will be reported here. The total plus 4 score is an average of the physical, social, emotional, functional, FACT-G, and additional concerns sub-scales. Each sub-scale has questions ranging from 1-5. Once the average of all subscales is taken, the total plus 4 score is converted into a score out of 100. 100 being the best, 0 being the worst.</description>

          <title>Health-related Quality of Life as Assessed by FACT-B +4 Score</title>
          <description>To compare the health-related quality of life (FACT-B+4 score) between the two interventions. The change between baseline and month 18 for the total plus 4 score will be reported here. The total plus 4 score is an average of the physical, social, emotional, functional, FACT-G, and additional concerns sub-scales. Each sub-scale has questions ranging from 1-5. Once the average of all subscales is taken, the total plus 4 score is converted into a score out of 100. 100 being the best, 0 being the worst.</description>
