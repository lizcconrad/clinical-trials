      RATIONALE: Studying changes in thymus function in patients who have been undergoing androgen
      blockade therapy for prostate cancer may help doctors learn more about how well patients will
      respond to treatment, may help in planning cancer treatment, and may help the study of cancer
      in the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effect of androgen blockade therapy on thymus
      function in older patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy for localized prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine if inhibition of sex steroid action is associated with increased thymic size
           in older patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy for localized adenocarcinoma
           of the prostate.

        -  Determine if inhibition of sex steroid action is associated with an increase in the
           absolute number or percentage of circulating &quot;naive&quot; phenotype T cells, and/or an
           increase in the frequency of T-cell receptor excision circles in peripheral blood cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, single-blind, cohort study. Patients are stratified
      according to hormonal therapy after surgery (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo CT scan of the thymus. Blood samples are analyzed by flow cytometry to
      determine phenotype of T cells.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Underwent prior radical prostatectomy as local definitive therapy for prostate cancer

          -  Meets criteria for 1 of the following strata:

               -  Has received ≥ 9 months of androgen blockade therapy (either single-agent
                  luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone or combined androgen blockade) for
                  serologic progression after surgery

                    -  Serologic progression defined as a rising prostate-specific antigen, which
                       has risen serially on two determinations (from baseline) ≥ 1 week apart, and
                       no objective evidence of metastatic disease

                    -  Prior radiotherapy for serologic progression allowed

               -  Did not receive any form of androgen blockade therapy within the past 9 months

          -  No metastatic disease by abdominal/pelvic CT scan and whole-body scan

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Able to tolerate CT scanning in the supine position

          -  No prior medical condition known to have effects on the thymus, including myasthenia
             gravis, lymphoma, hyperthyroidism, or cachexia

          -  No autoimmune disorders

          -  No acute illness, including active infection requiring antibiotics

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  See Disease Characteristics

          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy

          -  No prior immunological therapy

          -  No prior single-agent antiandrogen (e.g., high-dose bicalutamide)

          -  No prior or concurrent 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride), PC-SPES, or
             estrogen-containing nutraceuticals

          -  No concurrent systemic steroid therapy (topical steroids allowed)
