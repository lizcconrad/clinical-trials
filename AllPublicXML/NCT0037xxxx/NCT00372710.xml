  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zoledronic acid selectively binds to bone and protects it from being metastasized by tumor
      cells. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid when added to standard
      therapies in breast cancer patients with metastatic bone lesions.
