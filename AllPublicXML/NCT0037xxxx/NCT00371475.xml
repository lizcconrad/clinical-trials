    <textblock>
      TAXUS ATLAS is a global, multi-center, single-arm, non-inferiority trial comparing results
      from patients treated with the TAXUS Liberté 38 mm stent to an historical TAXUS Express
      control. The control group is a case-matched, blended, long lesion subset population of TAXUS
      Express patients from the TAXUS IV and TAXUS V de novo clinical trials. The objective of the
      study is to evaluate clinical outcomes of TAXUS Liberté-SR 38 mm stent in de novo lesions and
      to assess the non-inferiority of TAXUS Liberté versus TAXUS Express. The TAXUS Liberté-SR
      stent is hypothesized to have comparable safety and efficacy to the TAXUS Express stent.
