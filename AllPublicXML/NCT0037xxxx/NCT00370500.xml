      BACKGROUND:

      Epigenetic modifications such as DNA-methylation and histone acetylation are known to be
      involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Aim of the present study is to investigate

        1. whether differences in the methylation pattern of the promoters of dopaminergic genes
           exist between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls and

        2. whether treatment with the second generation antipsychotic quetiapine leads to changes
           in the methylation pattern of those genes in patients suffering from schizophrenia.

      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:

      50 male patients and 50 male controls are to be enrolled into the study. Patients will be
      treated with quetiapine for 3 weeks. Blood samples will be drawn before treatment and after
      three weeks to measure DNA-methylation status. Clinical characterisation includes PANSS,
      AIMS, BDI. Healthy probands will not be treated.

        Inclusion criteria:

        For inclusion in the study subjects must fulfil all of the following criteria:

          1. Provision of written informed consent

          2. A diagnosis of schizophrenia by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-
             Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)

          3. Able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study

          4. Age 18 - 65 years

        Exclusion criteria:

        Any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study:

          1. Any DSM-IV Axis I disorder not defined in the inclusion criteria

          2. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an imminent risk of suicide or
             a danger to self or others

          3. Known intolerance or lack of response to quetiapine fumarate, as judged by the
             investigator

          4. Use of any of the following cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors in the 14 days preceding
             enrolment including but not limited to: ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole,
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir,
             fluvoxamine and saquinavir

          5. Use of any of the following cytochrome P450 inducers in the 14 days preceding
             enrollment including but not limited to: phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates,
             rifampin, St. John's Wort, and glucocorticoids

          6. Administration of a depot antipsychotic injection within one dosing interval (for the
             depot) before inclusion

          7. Substance or alcohol dependence at enrolment (except dependence in full remission, and
             except for caffeine or nicotine dependence), as defined by DSM-IV criteria

          8. Opiates, amphetamine, barbiturate, cocaine, cannabis, or hallucinogen abuse by DSM-IV
             criteria within 4 weeks prior to enrolment

          9. Medical conditions that would affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, or
             excretion of study treatment

         10. Unstable or inadequately treated medical illness (e.g. diabetes, angina pectoris,
             hypertension) as judged by the investigator

         11. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study

         12. Previous enrolment in the present study.

         13. Participation in another drug trial within 4 weeks prior enrolment into this study or
             longer in accordance with local requirements

         14. Actual treatment with clozapine or clozapine treatment during the previous three
             month. Other antipsychotic drugs will be allowed, if intake can be terminated during
             the two day wash out period.

         15. Previous history of major head injuries or neurological disorders

         16. Intake of homocysteine lowering vitamins (folate, B12, B6)

         17. Renal failure

         18. Intake of nutritional derivatives which influence epigenetic patterns (butyrate from
             milk products, tea polyphenol or epigallo-catechin-3-gallate which inhibits DNMT)
