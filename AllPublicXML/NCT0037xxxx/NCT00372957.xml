    <measure>DPP-IV Activity Weighted Mean AUCs at Baseline (Day -1) and Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) and Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>For analysis of DPP-IV activity, approximately 2 mL of whole blood was collected into a vacuum tube containing EDTA2K and centrifuged at approximately 4 degree Celsius, at approximately 2500 rpm for 15 minutes. Samples were stored in a freezer at -70 degree Celsius or lower. Double-delta represented active treatment within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants, subtracted from placebo within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants. AUC with respect to these time interval was calculated using linear trapezoidal rule by sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments (using observed times). Weighted mean was then determined by dividing AUC by observed length of collection interval (time of last assessment - time of first assessment in hr). Double-delta analysis has been presented in analysis. Unit of measure: Nano mole per minute per milliliter (nmol/min/mL).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to post-study screen (Follow-up [7 days after the last dose of study medication])</time_frame>
    <description>AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is serious corresponding to those listed in above definition.</description>

        <description>For analysis of DPP-IV activity, approximately 2 mL of whole blood was collected into a vacuum tube containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA2K) and centrifuged at approximately 4 degree Celsius, at approximately 2500 revolution per minute (rpm) for 15 minutes. Samples were stored in a freezer at -70 degree Celsius or lower. DPP-IV inhibition was estimated by using the percent change from pre-dose of DPP-IV activity. DPP-IV inhibition was done at pre-dose, 0.5 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr and 24 hr.</description>

        <title>DPP-IV Activity Weighted Mean AUCs at Baseline (Day -1) and Day 7</title>
        <description>For analysis of DPP-IV activity, approximately 2 mL of whole blood was collected into a vacuum tube containing EDTA2K and centrifuged at approximately 4 degree Celsius, at approximately 2500 rpm for 15 minutes. Samples were stored in a freezer at -70 degree Celsius or lower. Double-delta represented active treatment within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants, subtracted from placebo within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants. AUC with respect to these time interval was calculated using linear trapezoidal rule by sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments (using observed times). Weighted mean was then determined by dividing AUC by observed length of collection interval (time of last assessment – time of first assessment in hr). Double-delta analysis has been presented in analysis. Unit of measure: Nano mole per minute per milliliter (nmol/min/mL).</description>

        <title>Active Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Weighted Mean AUCs at Baseline (Day -1) and Day 7</title>
        <description>For the analysis of active GLP-1 concentrations, approximately 3 mL of whole blood was collected into a vacuum tube containing DPP-IV inhibitor, and then centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge at approximately 4 degree Celsius, at approximately 2500 rpm for 15 minutes. Samples were stored in a freezer at -70 degree Celsius or lower. Double-delta represented the active treatment within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants, subtracted from placebo within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants. AUC with respect to these time interval was calculated using linear trapezoidal rule by sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments (using observed times). Weighted mean was then determined by dividing AUC by observed length of collection interval (time of last assessment – time of first assessment in hr). Double-delta analysis for weighted mean AUCs has been presented in the statistical analysis section.</description>

        <title>Glucagon Weighted Mean AUCs at Baseline (Day -1) and Day 7</title>
        <description>For the analysis of plasma glucagons concentrations, approximately 2 mL of whole blood was collected into a vacuum tube containing aprotinin, and then centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge at approximately 4 degree Celsius, at approximately 2500 rpm for 15 minutes. Samples were stored in a freezer at -70 degree Celsius or lower. Double-delta represented the active treatment within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants, subtracted from placebo within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants. AUC with respect to these time interval was calculated using linear trapezoidal rule by sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments (using observed times). Weighted mean was then determined by dividing AUC by observed length of collection interval (time of last assessment – time of first assessment in hr). Double-delta analysis for weighted mean AUCs has been presented in the statistical analysis section.</description>

          <title>C-peptide Weighted Mean AUCs at Baseline (Day -1) and Day 7</title>
          <description>For the analysis of plasma C-peptide concentrations, approximately 2 mL of whole blood was collected into a vacuum tube containing EDTA2Na, and then centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge at approximately 4 degree Celsius, at approximately 2500 rpm for 15 minutes. Samples were stored in a freezer at -70 degree Celsius or lower. Double-delta represented the active treatment within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants, subtracted from placebo within participant change from Baseline summarized across participants. AUC with respect to these time interval was calculated using linear trapezoidal rule by sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments (using observed times). Weighted mean was then determined by dividing AUC by observed length of collection interval (time of last assessment – time of first assessment in hr). Double-delta analysis for weighted mean AUCs has been presented in the statistical analysis section.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is serious corresponding to those listed in above definition.</description>
