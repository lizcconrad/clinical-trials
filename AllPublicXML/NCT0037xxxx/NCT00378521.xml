      The Purpose of this clinical study is to determine, in a controlled fashion, the response to
      two dosage strengths of a topical gel formulation of Nitroglycerin, MQX-503, in the
      determination of changes in finger blood flow and skin temperature in the fingers of patients
      with moderate to severe primary Raynaud's phenomenon and with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary
      to autoimmune diseases, such as scleroderma. The dosage strength response in the treatment of
      the symptoms (pain, tingling, numbness) will also be monitored.
