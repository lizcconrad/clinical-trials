  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the experimental drug AdhAQP1 can increase salivary flow in
      patients whose parotid glands have been exposed to therapeutic radiation for treatment of
      head and neck cancer. Radiation may damage the parotid glands (salivary glands located under
      the skin in front of the ear), leading to dry mouth, infections, excessive tooth decay, mouth
      sores, difficulty swallowing and pain. AdhAQP1 contains the human aquaporin-1 gene, which
      codes for a protein that works to transport water across cells, and a virus that normally can
      cause colds in humans, but is modified to render it ineffective. In animal experiments,
      AdhAQP1 has increased saliva production for a short time.

      Patients between 18 years of age or older who received radiation treatment for head and neck
      cancer at least 5 years before enrolling in this study, who have no evidence of recurrent
      tumor, who have dry mouth and who secrete abnormally low levels of saliva from the parotid
      glands may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history,
      physical examination, blood, urine and saliva tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), chest x-ray,
      MRI exam, gallium scan (a nuclear medicine test to look for inflammation in the salivary
      glands), technetium pertechnetate scan (a nuclear medicine test to examine salivary gland
      function), parotid sialogram (x-ray of parotid gland), PET and CT scans to look for signs of
      tumor and a skin biopsy to collect skin cells for use in immunological tests.

      Participants have a salt and sugar solution infused through a catheter (plastic tube) into
      both parotid glands. After 10 minutes, the solution drains into the mouth and is swallowed.
      Saliva is collected from the parotid glands at 6 and 24 hours after administration of the
      salt and sugar solution. Ten to 14 days later, patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical
      Center for up to 4 days for the following tests and procedures:

        -  On the first day, administration, through a catheter, of the study drug AdhAQP1 into one
           parotid gland.

        -  Monitoring over the next 3 days for changes in patients' ability to produce saliva. This
           includes medical examinations and several blood, urine and saliva collections.

        -  Technetium scan on day 2.

        -  Gallium scan on day 2.

      Patients return to NIH for follow-up visits at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the AdhAQP1
      infusion and then 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months for a medical examination and blood, urine and
      saliva collections. Gallium, technetium and MRI scans are repeated at several of the
      follow-up visits, and sialograms are done at 6 and 12 months. Chest x-ray and EKG are
      repeated at 4 and 6 months.

      The treatment of most head and neck cancer patients includes ionizing radiation (IR).
      Salivary glands in the IR field suffer irreversible damage. There is no conventional
      treatment available to correct this condition. Our research group has been developing the
      AdhAQP1 recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral (rAd5) vector based on the hypothesis that a
      replication deficient rAd5 vector is capable of safely transferring the human aquaporin-1
      (hAQP1) cDNA to parotid glands of adult patients with IR-induced salivary hypofunction,
      resulting in an elevated salivary output, albeit transiently. Salivary glands have proven to
      be valuable gene transfer targets in numerous pre-clinical animal model studies. hAQP1, the
      archetypal water channel, is a plasma membrane protein that facilitates water movement across
      lipid bilayers. Rat and minipig studies have clearly shown that the AdhAQP1 strategy for
      restoring salivary flow to IR-damaged salivary glands is effective, and studies in rats,
      non-human primates and minipigs have shown that AdhAQP1 and similar rAd5 vectors are without
      significant untoward effects after salivary gland delivery. The purpose of this clinical
      protocol is to test the safety of AdhAQP1, with some measures of efficacy, in adult patients
      with established IR-induced parotid gland hypofunction. The targeted tissue site for the
      AdhAQP1 vector in the proposed study is a single parotid gland. In this Phase 1
      dose-escalation study, safety will be evaluated using conventional clinical and immunological
      parameters. The primary outcome measure for biological efficacy will be parotid gland
      salivary output.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. 18 years of age or older.

               2. Capable of providing informed consent.

               3. History of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, having received &gt;45Gy to
                  the parotid gland(s) due to primary or neck radiation.

               4. Abnormal parotid gland function in the targeted parotid gland as judged by
                  absence of unstimulated parotid salivary flow and a stimulated parotid salivary
                  flow in the targeted parotid gland &lt;0.2 mL/min/gland after 2% citrate
                  stimulation.

               5. Abnormal (99m)TcO4 scintiscan (reduced or absent uptake of (99m)TcO4) for the
                  targeted parotid gland in the following circumstance: A (99m)TcO4 scintiscan will
                  only be performed and used to determine eligibility if the isotope is available.
                  If the isotope is not available, this inclusion criterion is not applicable.

               6. Abnormal sialogram (an altered ductal network with sialectasis) for the targeted
                  parotid gland.

               7. No current evidence of malignancy by otolaryngology assessment, including a
                  clinical history, nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, and negative CT or PET scan (e.g.
                  reference 58).

               8. Absence of shedding wild type adenovirus in the saliva sample collected from the
                  targeted gland at the pre-dose visit 1. Specifically, an aliquot of the pre-dose
                  visit 1 saliva sample from the target parotid gland will be used to infect A549
                  cells to test for the presence of shedding WT Ad virus. If infectious virus
                  emerges during the subsequent 7-10 day follow-up period, then the participant
                  will no longer be eligible for treatment and will be withdrawn from the study.
                  However, if no cytopathic effects are observed over a 7-10 day period, the
                  participant may be treated provided all other eligibility criteria are met. If
                  stimulated saliva cannot be collected at the pre-dose visit 1, this inclusion
                  criterion is not applicable.

               9. Must be disease-free for at least 5 years, with the disease-free interval
                  calculated from date of last cancer treatment (i.e., date of last radiation,
                  chemotherapy or surgery) to date of pre-dose visit 1.

              10. Willingness to practice the required birth control method (&quot;barrier&quot;
                  contraception, i.e., condoms, diaphragm) until AdhAQP1 is no longer detectable in
                  their serum or saliva. Women who cannot bear children (post menopausal or due to
                  a surgical intervention) also will be required to practice barrier birth control
                  methods until AdhAQP1 is no longer detectable in their serum or saliva.

              11. Able to stay at the NIH hospital for the period of time necessary to complete
                  each on-site phase of the protocol.

              12. No history of allergies to any medications or agents to be used in this protocol.

              13. On stable doses of medications (greater than or equal to 2 months from the
                  pre-dose visit 1) for any underlying medical conditions.

             at least 1 week before planned AdhAQP1 administration (Day 1).

          5. Evidence of active substance or alcohol abuse or history of substance or alcohol abuse
             within two years of pre-dose visit 1.
