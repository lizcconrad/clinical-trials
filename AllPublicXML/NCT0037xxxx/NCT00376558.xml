      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with the greatest loss of dopamine
      transmission due to cocaine dependence at pre-treatment PET and MRI scans will be those who
      fail to respond to substance abuse treatment. This study will also determine whether patients
      who do respond to treatment will experience a recovery of dopamine function. This study
      includes free brain imaging and behavioral intervention. Compensation provided for the brain
      scans.

      Previous studies have shown that cocaine dependence is associated with a decrease in dopamine
      release in response to a psychostimulant challenge. We have recently completed a study
      demonstrating that this loss of pre-synaptic dopamine function is associated with the choice
      to self-administer cocaine in the presence of an alternative reinforcer. This finding
      consistent with animal models of reinforcement and which show that dopamine transmission
      serves to modulate reward based behavior, and in this case, allows for a more adaptive
      response to be made in the presence of a competing reinforcer.

      The previous study was performed in non-treatment seeking cocaine dependent subjects using an
      inpatient laboratory model to measure the choice for cocaine. Thus, the goal of the present
      proposal is to investigate this association in a more realistic setting where cocaine
      dependent out patients face the choice between using cocaine and the alternative reinforcers
      presented to them in a therapeutic setting. The Community Reinforcement Approach with voucher
      incentives is a treatment for cocaine dependence that has been shown success in a number of
      controlled studies. Since the basis of this therapy is to reduce the reinforcing value of
      cocaine by increasing the density of alternative, healthy reinforcers, we have chosen to
      correlate outcome from this treatment with measures of presynaptic dopamine function. We
      propose to scan cocaine dependent patients with [11C]raclopride and oral methylphenidate in
      order to measure dopamine release. Patients will be scanned before treatment and at 12 weeks
      into therapy. We predict that the patients with the greatest loss of dopamine transmission at
      the pre-treatment scan will be those who fail to respond to treatment. Furthermore, we
      hypothesize that the patients who do respond to treatment will experience a recovery of
      dopamine function, measured at the post-treatment scan.

      In addition, subjects enrolled in this study will undergo functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (fMRI) and spectroscopy studies in order to asses differences in neuronal integrity,
      learning, and impulse control.

    <description>The relationship between Methylphenidate-induced Dopamine Release in the Striatum (Measured by Displacement of [11C]-Raclopride by Oral Methylphenidate) and Treatment Response (Measured Using Community Reinforcement Approach and Contingency Management) was studied. Dopamine Function was assessed by evaluation of endogenous Dopamine release over the course of treatment (i.e., at 3 months as compared to baseline). Endogenous Dopamine release is inversely related to the change in binding potential (delta BPND) of [11C]raclopride, in that a negative delta BPND, or increased displacement of [11C]raclopride, reflects an increase in the release of endogenous dopamine over the course of treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Binding Potential of [11C]Raclopride</title>
        <description>The relationship between Methylphenidate-induced Dopamine Release in the Striatum (Measured by Displacement of [11C]-Raclopride by Oral Methylphenidate) and Treatment Response (Measured Using Community Reinforcement Approach and Contingency Management) was studied. Dopamine Function was assessed by evaluation of endogenous Dopamine release over the course of treatment (i.e., at 3 months as compared to baseline). Endogenous Dopamine release is inversely related to the change in binding potential (delta BPND) of [11C]raclopride, in that a negative delta BPND, or increased displacement of [11C]raclopride, reflects an increase in the release of endogenous dopamine over the course of treatment.</description>

However, treatment data for all 25 cocaine users was used.</population>

            <description>Participants receive voucher points for each urine sample that tested negative for benzoylecgonine. Failure to submit a scheduled sample was treated as cocaine +. Voucher points have a monetary value that can be redeemed for goods/services that are approved by the therapist. Points ($0.25) were acquired on an escalating schedule that started at 10 points for the 1st cocaine-free sample, and each subsequent cocaine-free sample increased the value by 5 points. A bonus of 40 points ($10.00) for every 3 consecutive negative sample. Abstinence was confirmed by onsite urine test (Abuscreen On-Trak system, Roche Diagnostics). Missed clinic visits and urine samples that are considered + reset the points to the initial $2.50 value and the escalation schedule resume. Submission of 5 consecutive - samples after a + urine returns the voucher points to the value prior to reset. Points earned are never lost. A maximum of $997.50 is earned for submitting negative samples at all treatment visits.</description>
