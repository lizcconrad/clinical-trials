  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects about 1 in 14,000 people
      in the United States. As the most commonly identified genetic cause of obesity, PWS is often
      confused with Early-onset Morbid Obesity (EMO). Individuals with EMO show some signs of PWS,
      but clinically do not have PWS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical
      features and genetic basis of PWS and EMO, and to determine how these conditions affect a
      person throughout a lifetime.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PWS is a complex neurobehavioral syndrome. Clinical features include obesity, increased
      appetite, low muscle tone, cognitive impairment, distinct behavioral features, hypogonadism,
      and neonatal failure-to-thrive. It is the most commonly recognized genetic cause of obesity;
      however, many obese children do not in fact have PWS. These individuals are therefore
      diagnosed with EMO, a condition that shares features with PWS. The development of new
      advances and strategies for treating PWS and EMO requires a thorough understanding of the
      conditions at both the clinical and molecular levels. One goal of this study is to collect
      long-term data on individuals with PWS and EMO in order to gain a better understanding of the
      natural progression of the conditions, from the neonatal period well into adulthood. Specific
      to PWS, this study will establish a genotype-phenotype correlation among the different
      sub-types and will evaluate the effects of growth hormone treatment on disease progression.
      Lastly, the study will compare PWS with EMO in terms of clinical features and genetic basis.

      Participation in this natural history study will entail an initial evaluation, followed by
      yearly study visits until the age of 3 and then every 2 years thereafter. Each study visit
      will last between 3 and 4 hours, and will include a physical exam (including a DEXA scan to
      determine body composition), psychological testing, an interview with the study physician,
      and an evaluation of the participant's diet history. In addition, blood tests will be
      completed for genetic testing and photos will be taken to evaluate disease progression.
      Cognitive and behavioral assessments will also be conducted and will last between 10 and 30
      minutes.
