  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of the
      bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination in relapsed or relapsed and refractory
      multiple myeloma. Each of these drugs are approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration,
      but have not been approved in the combination for treating patients in this setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Participants took the study medication in the clinic on Cycle 1 day 1. Each treatment
           cycle lasted three weeks. They took the lenalidomide (capsules) every day for the first
           two weeks only (days 1-14). They took dexamethasone (tablets) on Day 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9,
           11 and 12 and came to the outpatient treatment center for intravenous bortezomib on Day
           1, 4, 8 and 11. The third week of the cycle was a rest period and the participant did
           not take any study medication.

        -  Certain tests and procedures were performed throughout each treatment cycle at
           definitive time periods. These tests included: medical history update,
           physical/neurological examination, skeletal survey (x-rays or scan), blood samples,
           urine samples, optional bone marrow aspiration/tissue biopsy, 12-lead ECG, and MRI/CT
           (if needed).

        -  It was expected that participants were going to complete at least 8 cycles of the study,
           which adds up to 168 days. If the participant completed the first 8 cycles, had stable
           or responding disease and had not experienced bad side effects, they were allowed to
           continue treatment on a maintenance schedule, detailed in the protocol, at the study
           doctor's discretion.

        <description>Response assessed by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) criteria, modified to include nCR and VGPR from the international uniform response criteria (IMWG).
Progressive disease (PD) required one or more of the following:
&gt;25% increased in serum monoclonal paraprotein (must also be an absolute increase of at least 5 g/L and confirmed on a repeat investigation) &gt;25% increased in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion (must also be an absolute increase of at least 200 mg/24 h and confirmed on a repeat investigation) &gt;25% increased in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or on trephine biopsy (must also be an absolute increase of at least 10%) Definite increase in the size of existing lytic bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas.
Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas (not including compression fracture).
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt;11.5 mg/dL or 2.8 mmol/L not attributable to any other cause).</description>

Beyond cycle 8, responding patients and those with stable disease (SD) could receive maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance therapy comprised bortezomib and lenalidomide at the doses tolerated on completion of cycle 8, with lenalidomide on days 1 through 14 and using an amended schedule of weekly bortezomib (days 1 and 8) and dexamethasone 10 mg on days 1, 2, 8, and 9.</description>
