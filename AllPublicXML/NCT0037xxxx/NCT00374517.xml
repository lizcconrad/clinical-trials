  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a drug called pimonidazole hydrochloride shows areas of low
      oxygen in tuberculosis (TB)-infected lungs. Pimonidazole is a &quot;low oxygen marker,&quot; an agent
      designed to find areas in the body that are not getting enough oxygen. If it is found that TB
      grows where oxygen is low, these results may help doctors decide what medicines would be most
      effective for treating TB.

      Patients 20 years of age or older who are scheduled for lung surgery at the National Masan
      Tuberculosis Hospital in Masan, Korea to treat their TB may be eligible for this study.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Blood draw before surgery to test for hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses.

        -  Pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant.

        -  Infusion of pimonidazole through a vein in the arm 24 hours before surgery. A part of
           the patient's lung is removed during surgery. This tissue is examined under a microscope
           for evidence of pimonidazole, which would indicate low oxygen.

        -  Blood sample collection during surgery and on the 7th and 14th days after surgery to
           check liver function.

      The purpose of this Phase II clinical trial is to establish whether pulmonary tuberculous
      lesions are hypoxic or contain hypoxic microenvironments using an in vivo hypoxia-imaging
      marker, pimonidazole hydrochloride, in subjects undergoing lung resection surgery for
      treatment-refractory pulmonary tuberculosis.

      The study population will be drawn from subjects undergoing treatment at the National Masan
      Tuberculosis Hospital (NMTH), Masan, Republic of Korea. Subjects who are scheduled for
      partial lung resection surgery for treatment refractory TB will be eligible for this study.
      Selected subjects will be those who demonstrate one or more radiographic abnormalities
      associated with pulmonary tuberculosis (e.g., cavities, nodules, consolidation, fibrosis, or
      calcified lesions).

      Subjects undergoing elective pulmonary resection will receive a single preoperative IV dose
      of pimonidazole 0.5 g/m(2) in 100 mL of normal saline, infused over 20 minutes 18 to 24 hours
      prior to surgery. The resected tissue will be analyzed to look at the following: 1) the
      degree of pimonidazole-adduct formation in tissue specimens with different histopathologic
      presentations; 2) the number of acid-fast bacilli in tissue sections, smears, or cultures
      prepared from homogenized lesions from distinct gross anatomic and histopathologic types in
      relation to the extent of tissue hypoxia, and; 3) comparison of lesions labeling with
      pimonidazole with the presence of human cellular and bacterial markers expected to be
      expressed under oxygen-limiting conditions. NIAID study investigators will have no input of
      any kind in selecting subjects for surgery, or in determining the kind or extent of surgical
      resection. Subjects will be on study from a few days before surgery until approximately 8
      weeks after their surgery.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Males and females age 20 and above.

        Subjects with treatment-refractory pulmonary TB (i.e., who remain sputum AFB smear positive
        and/or culture positive or who are sputum negative yet non-responsive by radiographic and
        clinical measures) (including MDR-TB) scheduled for elective pulmonary resection.

        Subjects who demonstrate one or more radiographic abnormalities associated with pulmonary
        tuberculosis (i.e., cavities, nodules, consolidation, fibrosis, or calcified lesions).

        Ability and willingness to utilize contraceptives (such as latex condom, diaphragm,
        cervical cap, IUD, hormonal contraception, tubal ligation, or vasectomy) from the time of
        consent to one month after the treatment period (both men and women).
