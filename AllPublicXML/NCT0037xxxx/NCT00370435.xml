  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of GW274150, an iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor to
      investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      population (greater than 50 years). Safety, tolerability and PK of GW274150 in an adult and
      elderly population have not yet been determined. Therefore this study is designed to ensure
      that 90mg GW274150 will be safe and well-tolerated in this adult and elderly RA patient
      population on methotrexate. The assessments will include pharmacokinetics (PK), liver
      function tests and creatinine clearance.

      This study will provide confidence that a single 90mg dose of GW274150 results in exposure in
      RA subjects similar to that expected from healthy volunteers and asthmatics.
