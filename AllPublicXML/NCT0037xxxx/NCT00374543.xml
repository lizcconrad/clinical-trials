    <textblock>
      This study proposes to examine the potential safety and efficacy of ziprasidone for patients
      with anxiety and bipolar disorder on anxiety outcomes, bipolar symptoms, and on measures of
      quality of life and resilience.

      This study would be the first prospective, placebo-controlled study to our knowledge of any
      pharmacotherapy strategy for the treatment of comorbid generalized anxiety (or any comorbid
      anxiety) in patients with bipolar disorder. Our hypotheses are:

        1. Ziprasidone flexibly dosed from 40 to 160 mg/day will reduce anxiety symptoms
           significantly more than placebo in patients with bipolar disorder who have a full or
           subsyndromal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

        2. Ziprasidone will be well tolerated in patients with generalized anxiety based on the
           incidence of treatment emergent adverse effects during 8 weeks of therapy, and based on
           a lack of worsening of bipolar depression, mania or hypomania compared to placebo.

        3. Treatment with ziprasidone will have a significantly greater positive impact on measures
           of quality of life and resilience than placebo.

    <description>The 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (Hamilton, 1959) was developed to assess anxiety in a clinical population. It is considered a measure of general anxiety across anxiety disorders, in addition to being a gold standard measure for GAD.

    <description>A secondary categorical outcome of response will be defined as a Clinical Global Impression Improvement Score (CGI-I) of 1 or 2.

    <description>Ziprasidone will be dosed on a twice daily (BID) basis, with flexible dosing based on tolerability, with a total daily dose in the range of 40 to 160 mg/day, for 8 weeks. This time period reflects the rapid onset of effect seen in studies of atypical antipsychotics, but allows time for a potentially longer response for some anxiety symptoms.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Numerous attempts were made to increase enrollment since study inception. Researchers made use of Radio, Internet and print ads, as well as weekly Internet postings. Researchers also circulated an IRB-approved GAD checklist in a Bipolar Clinic waiting area in order to increase enrollment and recruit a clinically relevant sample.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of thirteen individuals signed consent, but only three were randomized to the study arms. The other ten participants were excluded from the study for meeting various exclusion criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</title>
          <description>The 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (Hamilton, 1959) was developed to assess anxiety in a clinical population. It is considered a measure of general anxiety across anxiety disorders, in addition to being a gold standard measure for GAD.
Due to study termination, there are not results for primary and secondary outcome measures.</description>
          <population>Zero participants were analyzed because recruitment was very low. Due to this, we felt any analysis done would not be usable for accurate analyses.</population>
