  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are neoplasias from post-thymic T-cells at different
      stages of differentiation and are a heterogeneous group of malignancies which present with
      different morphological patterns, phenotypes, and clinical presentations.

      These tumours have a striking epidemiological distribution with a lower incidence in Western
      countries than in Asia. In Korea, PTCLs including T- or natural killer (NK)-cell lymphomas
      constitute approximately 25 to 35% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This incidence is quite
      similar to that of other Eastern Asian countries, including Japan, Hong Kong, and China.

      Recent studies suggest that the T-cell phenotype is an independent significant prognostic
      factor, with PTCLs having one of the lowest overall survival and failure-free survival rates.
      Based on the investigator's experience, the overall complete remission rate was 61.2% (95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 48.5-72.8%) and the 5-year probability of failure-free survival was
      33.5%. Median survival of all patients was 45 months (range 0-64+ months) and the 5-year
      probability of survival was 36.2%. Rassidakis et al. reported that expression of
      pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BCL-XS, may explain the poor response of many types of PTCL to
      standard chemotherapy.

      To overcome such poor outcome, the optimal therapy for PTCLs remains to be defined. However,
      because of the rarity of the disease in Western countries, only a few trials have been
      reported.

      Bortezomib (Velcade) is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid, and a reversible inhibitor of the
      chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteosome. Bortezomib may induce tumor cell apoptosis
      or decreased bcl-2 associated drug resistance. Through phase II studies, single agent
      bortezomib in patients with relapsed indolent and mantle cell lymphomas showed its activity.
      And also preliminary data indicate that bortezomib can be safely administered in combination
      with dose adjusted etoposide, prednisolone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin
      (EPOCH) chemotherapy. Therefore, it can be possible to improve the poor outcome of patients
      with PTCLs by a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone
      (CHOP) with bortezomib as a first-line therapy.

      Primary Hypothesis: Based on the clinical trials and experimental data, bortezomib can
      overcome pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BCL-XS induced drug resistance.
