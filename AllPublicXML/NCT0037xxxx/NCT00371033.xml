      Primary Objectives

        1. To compare six (6) weeks of treatment with pregabalin versus placebo in CP/CPPS
           participants with respect to the primary endpoint in the NIH-CPSI

        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of six (6) weeks of pregabalin in CP/CPPS
           participants

      Design

      Eligible participants will receive either pregabalin or placebo, randomly assigned at a ratio
      of 2:1. Study treatment will be for 6 weeks with dose starting at 150mg going up to 300mg and
      finally to 600mg daily, to maximum tolerated dose. Participants will be advised to take the
      study medication 3 times per day. There are 3 clinic visits and 2 telephone contacts.
      Participants will be offered optional active treatment for an additional 6 weeks at the end
      of the first 6 weeks. For those participating in both phases there are a total of 4 clinic
      visits and 5 telephone contacts.
