  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of AZD6244 (ARRY-142886)versus
      capecitabine in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed
      first-line therapy with gemcitabine. Following baseline assessments, a minimum of 64 patients
      in approximately 5-6 centers from the US will be treated with either AZD6244 or capecitabine.
      Treatment will be continued for as long as the patients receive clinical benefit. The status
      of all patients will be checked (whether they are still taking treatment or not)
      approximately 3 months after the last patient has entered the study.

    <time_frame>Data cut off for this analysis was 5th April 2008.</time_frame>
    <description>The TTD (days) was calculated as the interval from date of randomisation to date of patient death (from any cause). Patients who had not died at the time of the final analysis were censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive. Median TTD in days is presented here.</description>
