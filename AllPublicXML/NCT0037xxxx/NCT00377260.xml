  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether or not all children with ear infections (acute
      otitis media or AOM) should be treated with antibiotics. The study will compare two treatment
      strategies, &quot;watchful waiting&quot; or treatment with antibiotics, to determine which is more
      appropriate for children with AOM. About 268 children in Pittsburgh, between the ages of 6-23
      months, with AOM will be enrolled in the study. They will be treated either with Augmentin
      (an antibiotic) or placebo for 10 days and closely followed for about 1 month. Parents will
      be asked to write information about their child in a Patient Diary. A general physical exam,
      including an ear exam, will be performed 4 times during the study. A mucus sample will be
      collected from the back of each child's nose. Parents will be asked questions during phone
      calls and at every visit. If a child has not improved or has worsened, the investigators will
      prescribe a different antibiotic that is known to kill resistant germs.

      The purpose of this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical
      trial is to determine the efficacy of antimicrobials in young children with acute otitis
      media (AOM). The primary objectives are to compare time to resolution of symptoms (initial
      and sustained) in children receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate (90/6.4mg/kg/day in 2 divided
      doses for 10 days) to children receiving placebo (in 2 divided doses for 10 days), and to
      compare the weighted average AOM-Severity of Symptoms (AOM-SOS) scores in the two groups
      during days 1-7. The secondary objectives are to: evaluate the clinical efficacy of
      amoxicillin-clavulanate vs. placebo at the on-therapy visit (Day 4-5, and at least 72 hours
      after initial dose of study medication); evaluate the clinical efficacy of
      amoxicillin-clavulanate vs. placebo at the end-of-therapy visit (Day 10-12); compare AOM-SOS
      and AOM-Faces scales between treatment groups during each of the first 7 days of therapy and
      at all study visits; compare the proportion of children in each treatment group who develop
      worsening symptoms before having received 72 hours of study medication; compare the two
      treatment groups regarding the quantity of analgesic medication administered by children's
      parents; compare the incidence of adverse events accompanying the two treatment regimens;
      compare the effects of amoxicillin-clavulanate vs. placebo on the overall proportion of
      children with nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization with AOM pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H.
      influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pyogenes), and on the proportion of children with NP
      colonization with penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae; compare the 2 treatment groups
      regarding tympanometric outcomes at the on-therapy (Day 4-5), end-of-therapy (Day 10-12) and
      follow-up (Day 21-25) visits, using an algorithm that permits estimation of the probability
      of middle ear effusion given any particular tympanographic configuration; compare direct and
      indirect medical costs between the two treatment groups; and compare parental satisfaction
      with therapy between the two treatment groups. Participants will include 268 children, aged 6
      to 23 months, diagnosed with acute otitis media in Western Pennsylvania. These participants
      will be recruited into the study at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP), Pittsburgh, PA,
      and Armstrong Pediatrics (Children's Community Pediatrics: an affiliate of CHP) in
      Kittanning, PA. Subjects will be randomized to receive either amoxicillin-clavulanate or
      placebo twice daily for 10 days. Parents of the subject will be asked to track symptom
      status, medication use (study medication and acetaminophen), fever and diarrhea in a study
      memory aid. Study procedures will include a medical history, vital signs, weight, clinical
      information regarding signs and symptoms of infection, nasopharyngeal specimens, and a
      physical exam including tympanometry. Each child will be examined three additional times: 4-5
      days after starting the medicine, study day 10-12 and 21-25 days after enrolling in the
      study. During these visits, study staff will review the child's symptoms and examine the
      child's ears. The study staff will also obtain a nasopharyngeal culture in order to look for
      resistant bacteria and to make appropriate changes in antibiotic treatment. Daily telephone
      assessments will be made by study staff on days 2, 3, and 4 of therapy to make sure the child
      is getting better. The study staff will see a child anytime a parent feels their child has
      not improved or has worsened.

    <measure>The Weighted Average Acute Otitis Media - Severity of Symptom (AOM-SOS) Score, According to Treatment Assignment</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first 7 days of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The AOM-SOS score is derived from parent scoring each of 7 symptoms (ear tugging, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, diminished activity, diminished appetite &amp; fever) associated with AOM as 0, 1 or 2 (none, a little, a lot). The AOM-SOS was administered twice daily the first 3 days of follow-up, then daily for 4 additional days. Symptom burden for each child is determined by calculating the weighted average of symptom scores post-enrollment over the first 7 days of therapy. Scores are weighted by 1/k, where k is the number of post-enrollment assessments taken on that day.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Children were recruited over 3 respiratory seasons, beginning on 11/31/2006 with the last enrollment on 3/31/2009. There were 2 enrollment sites, as well as referrals from private pediatricians. One site was a large private practice; the other was a large hospital based practice. This was for generalizability.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There were 2 children who signed consents but were not randomized. One parent withdrew consent and one child, referred from an outside practice, was found to not be eligible.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Mean Estimated Probability of Middle Ear Effusion</title>
          <description>For tympanograms with values for height, middle-ear air pressure, and gradient width, the probability of Middle Ear Effusion (MEE) was estimated by applying an algorithm developed by Smith et al. If the tympanogram was flat and had no printed values for the 3 fields, the probability of MEE was estimated to be .802 based on the proportion of ears with flat graphs that were found otoscopically, by Smith et al, to have MEE.</description>

[tugging/rubbing/holding ears; crying more; irritable/fussy; difficulty sleeping; less playful/active; eating less; fever or warm to touch. The parent rates these symptoms as No (0 points), A little (1 point) or A lot (2 points). Children must have at least 3 points to qualify, so the minimum score is 3, the maximum is 14.</description>

        <title>The Probability of Middle Ear Effusion, Based on an Algorithm That Estimates the Probability of Middle Ear Effusion From an Interpretable Tympanographic Configuration, at the On-therapy Visit According to Treatment Assignment</title>
        <description>For tympanograms with values for height, middle-ear air pressure, and gradient width, the probability of Middle Ear Effusion (MEE) was estimated by applying an algorithm developed by Smith et al. If the tympanogram was flat and had no printed values for the 3 fields, the probability of MEE was estimated to be .802 based on the proportion of ears with flat graphs that were found otoscopically, by Smith et al, to have MEE.</description>

        <title>The Probability of Middle Ear Effusion, Based on an Algorithm That Estimates the Probability of Middle Ear Effusion From an Interpretable Tympanographic Configuration, at the Follow-up Visit According to Treatment Assignment</title>
        <description>For tympanograms with values for height, middle-ear air pressure, and gradient width, the probability of Middle Ear Effusion (MEE) was estimated by applying an algorithm developed by Smith et al. If the tympanogram was flat and had no printed values for the 3 fields, the probability of MEE was estimated to be .802 based on the proportion of ears with flat graphs that were found otoscopically, by Smith et al, to have MEE.</description>

        <description>Time to resolution of symptoms is defined as the time from randomization until a child's AOM-SOS score reaches 0 or 1. The parent rated each of 7 symptoms (ear tugging, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, diminished activity, diminished appetite &amp; fever) as 0, 1 or 2 (none, a little, a lot) and recorded the ratings in a diary following enrollment on Day 1, twice daily Days 2 and 3, then once daily Days 4-7. Each set of ratings was summed to obtain an AOM-SOS score. The maximum possible score was 14 and the minimum was 0. A score &gt;=3 was required to be enrolled in the study.</description>

        <description>Time to resolution of symptoms is defined as the time from randomization until a child's AOM-SOS score reaches &lt;= 1 on two consecutive occasions. The parent rated each of 7 symptoms (ear tugging, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, diminished activity, diminished appetite &amp; fever) as 0, 1 or 2 (none, a little, a lot) &amp; recorded the ratings in a diary following enrollment on Day 1, twice daily Days 2 &amp; 3, &amp; once daily Days 4-7. Each set of ratings was summed to obtain an AOM-SOS score. The maximum possible was 14 and the minimum 0. A score &gt;=3 was required to be enrolled in the study.</description>

        <title>The Weighted Average Acute Otitis Media - Severity of Symptom (AOM-SOS) Score, According to Treatment Assignment</title>
        <description>The AOM-SOS score is derived from parent scoring each of 7 symptoms (ear tugging, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, diminished activity, diminished appetite &amp; fever) associated with AOM as 0, 1 or 2 (none, a little, a lot). The AOM-SOS was administered twice daily the first 3 days of follow-up, then daily for 4 additional days. Symptom burden for each child is determined by calculating the weighted average of symptom scores post-enrollment over the first 7 days of therapy. Scores are weighted by 1/k, where k is the number of post-enrollment assessments taken on that day.</description>
        <time_frame>During the first 7 days of therapy</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was ITT. The number of participants equals the number of children with at least one AOM-SOS score post-enrollment in the first 7 days of therapy. The score was based on diaries completed at home by the child's parent.</population>
