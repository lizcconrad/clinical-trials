  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was designed in an attempt to prospectively evaluate in a randomized
      fashion whether further cytotoxic dose intensification, as delivered with two sequential
      autologous stem-cell transplantations, improved the outcome of younger patients with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma in comparison with a single autologous transplantation.

      Following demonstration that single autologous transplantation for the treatment of younger
      patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma prolonged overall survival in comparison with
      conventional chemotherapy, double autologous transplantation was tested, initially in
      refractory myeloma and subsequently to include also patients with newly diagnosed disease. To
      explore the role of double autologous stem-cell transplantation as part of up-front therapy
      for multiple myeloma, in 1996 we launched a prospective, randomized trial comparing a single
      course of stem-cell-supported melphalan with the same regimen followed, after three to six
      months, by a second autologous transplantation in support of melphalan and busulfan. The
      study was designed to detect a 15 percent increase in complete or near complete response rate
      with double transplants compared to a single transplantation. With a 2-sided significance
      level α = 0.05 and a power 1-β = 0.80, 162 patients were required in each treatment arm of
      the study to detect a statistically significant increase in complete or near complete
      response rate from 30% in the single-transplant arm to 45% in the double-transplant arm.
      Primary study endpoint was the complete or near complete response rate. Secondary study
      endpoints were relapse-free survival, event-free survival and overall survival. The
      recruitment target was 324 patients.
