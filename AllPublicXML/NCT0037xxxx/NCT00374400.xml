      The purpose of the protocol is to increase the number of living donor transplants by
      eliminating immune incompatibilities between donors and recipients through paired donation.

      To increase the number of patients transplanted by paired donation by establishment of
      regional paired donation programs.

      To develop educational programs for potential living donors and their recipient, as well as
      the opportunity for transplant professionals to increase acceptance of the PDC to maximize
      the opportunity for organ donation.

      To identify and evaluate ethical and psychological factors that may influence the effects of
      paired donation on living kidney donation.
