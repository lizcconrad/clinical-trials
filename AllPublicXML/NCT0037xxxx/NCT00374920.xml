  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar affective disorder is one of the most common, severe, and persistent mental
      illnesses. It is characterized by periods of deep, prolonged, and profound depressions that
      alternate with periods of excessively elevated and/or irritable mood (mania). The
      pathophysiology of bipolar disorder is complex, and can include an inheritable component,
      administration of antidepressant medications, behavioral sensitization processes, and
      neuronal calcium dysregulation that leads to apoptosis of critical brain circuitry that
      regulates emotion. Addressing the dysregulation in calcium levels in the central nervous
      system by administering compounds such as MEM 1003 may have the potential for altering the
      cyclical course or progression of bipolar disorder.

      MEM 1003 is the (+)-enantiomer of a dihydropyridine that has been optimized for central
      nervous system activity. It inhibits L-type Ca2+ channels and within the anticipated human
      dosing range has more benign cardiovascular effects than other DHP L-Type calcium channel
      modulators.
