  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a theory based, online tailored
      intervention on stimulating safe-sex practices among men who have sex with men (MSM). Our
      hypothesis was that a tailored internet intervention would be more effective in stimulating
      safe-sex practices of gay men than a non-tailored internet intervention when compared to a
      waiting-list control group.

      Relationships are a high-risk setting for HIV-infection. This trial aimed at testing the
      efficacy of an online theory-based tailored intervention for preparing single MSM to practice
      safe sex with future steady partners—labeling it the ‘cognitive vaccine approach’.

      The target was the promotion of negotiated safety (NS): steady partners testing for HIV and
      reaching agreements to either be monogamous or to only have safe sex outside the relationship
      in order to have safe unprotected anal intercourse with each other. The intervention content
      was based on the information, motivation, behavioral-skills model and the intervention was
      tailored according to knowledge, motivation, and skill-related deficiencies of each
      participant. Condom use was promoted as the default alternative for NS. Using an online
      randomized controlled trial we examined the effects of a tailored versus non-tailored version
      of the intervention. The cognitive effect (i.e. response efficacy, intentions, and perceived
      behavioral control (PBC) was measured directly after the intervention and, after 6-months,
      the behavioral effect (i.e. NS and condom use) via e-mail follow-up.
