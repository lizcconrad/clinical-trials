      Three-arm, parallel, double-blind, masked observer, randomized, PB-Saline controlled clinical
      trial. In order to avoid problems in the interpretation of the final results due to disparate
      enrollment from various centers, the number of patients enrolled per site will be the same
      per site. Study patients will be randomized to receive either 20 mg sodium hyaluronate, 3
      i.a. sodium hyaluronate injections, followed by 2 PBSaline mock i.a. injections or 5 i.a.
      PB-Saline control injections. One investigator will administer the injection and the joint
      assessor will be blinded to the study. The anterior or posterior approach for the shoulder
      injection will be used.

        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to
        allow patients and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace
        the advice of a personal physician or health professional.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients with chronic shoulder pain with all of the following: of at least 6 months,
             but not greater than 5 years duration without clinically significant improvement in
             shoulder pain over the past one month, and present at least 50% of the days during the
             previous month.

          2. Patients who have failed conventional therapy including but not limited to the
             following: NSAIDs; one or more i.a. or local peri-articular steroid injections and
             physiotherapy (a minimum of one month of previous physiotherapy treatment is required.

          3. At screening, patients on chronic analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication should have a
             VAS pain score of &gt;/= 30 mm and &lt;/= 90 mm indicating a lack of adequate and sustained
             response to previous and current therapies. At screening, patients not on chronic
             analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication should have a VAS pain score of &gt;/= 40 mm and
             &lt;/= 90 mm. If bilateral shoulder pain is present, the investigator will use the more
             painful shoulder.

          4. At baseline, after all analgesic/anti-inflammatory medications have been discontinued
             for 2 weeks, patients should have a VAS pain score of &gt;/= 40 mm and &lt;/= 90 mm.

          5. Patients with a limitation of shoulder motion in at least 1 direction at screening and
             baseline for the following active range of motions: Abduction with scapula fixed must
             be &lt;/= 80°; internal rotation in abduction must be ,/= 55°, and/or external rotation
             in abduction must be 180°. These limitations of shoulder motion are in comparison to
             normal expected ranges.

          6. Patients with a retained active Range Of Motion (&quot;ROM&quot;) &gt;/= 30 percent in all
             directions at screening and baseline to rule out frozen shoulder. The ROM should be:
             &gt;/= 30° for abduction with scapula fixed, &gt;/= 30° external rotation, and &gt;/= 20° for
             internal rotation.

          7. Patients with at least one of the following conditions as examined and determined by
             Investigator: Osteoarthritis of the Glenohumeral Joint (OA), Rotator cuff tear
             (complete or partial), Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder.

          8. Patients who are able to complete efficacy measurement questionnaires.

          9. Patients who are willing to discontinue all NSAIDs or other analgesic medication taken
             for their shoulder pain at least 2 weeks prior to baseline evaluation, with the
             exception of acetaminophen 500-1000 mg (1-2 tablets) q.i.d., p.r.n. (maximum 8 tablets
             or 4 grams per day) which would be sole rescue medication. Acetaminophen must not be
             taken within 24 hours of any visits or valuations. Patients must also be willing to
             abstain from any i.a. or peri-articular injections for the shoulder during the course
             of the trial, except for the assigned study product.
