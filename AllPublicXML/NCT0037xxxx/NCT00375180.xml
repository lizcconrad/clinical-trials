      intake and nutrition status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer patients often have difficulty meeting their nutritional needs while
      undergoing radiation therapy (RT) and/or chemotherapy (RTchemo). Tumor locations and side
      effects of RT or RTchemo, including dry mouth, mouth sores, difficulty chewing and
      swallowing, changes in taste and smell, and loss of appetite, lead to poor food intake and
      weight loss. The investigators hope to learn more about how side-effects of RT or RTchemo
      affect food intake and nutrition status.
