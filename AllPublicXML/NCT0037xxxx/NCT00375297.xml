      This prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) study, assessed the efficacy of
      sildenafil in women with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant-associated sexual
      dysfunction (SRI-AASD) following the same protocol which previously established efficacy in
      men with SRI-AASD.

      This prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) study, assessed the efficacy of
      sildenafil in women with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant-associated sexual
      dysfunction (SRI-AASD) following the same protocol which previously established efficacy in
      men with SRI-AASD. Women (n=100) with MDD-remission and SRI-AASD were randomized to receive
      sildenafil (50-100mg) or placebo for 8 weeks, followed by 8-weeks open-label extension.
      Sexual function was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF),
      with positive response defined as a score &lt;3, and UNM-SFI, ASEX, SFQ-FSD sexual function
      questionnaires. Depression was monitored using the HAM-D17.
      Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-gonadal hormones were measured at baseline and DB-endpoint.

        Inclusion Criteria:S Subjects will be females only, ages 18 to 50 years.

          -  Subjects have been taking an SSRI, venlafaxine, nefazodone, or tri/hetero cyclic
             antidepressant for treatment of depression for at least 8 weeks, are currently at a
             stable dose of the antidepressant for at least 4 weeks, and have been consistently
             experiencing arousal dysfunction [inability to attain or maintain until completion of
             sexual activity an adequate lubrication swelling response of sexual excitement] or
             orgasmic dysfunction [delayed orgasm/anorgasmia following a normal sexual excitement
             phase] that interferes with sexual functioning for at least 4 weeks.

          -  Subjects must currently be euthymic (HAM-D&lt;10) and without significant anxiety
             symptoms (HAM-A&lt;10).

          -  Subjects must have had no sexual dysfunction prior to taking an antidepressant and
             there must be a clear temporal relationship of the sexual dysfunction to the
             antidepressant treatment. [Note - sexual dysfunction occurring as a symptom of the
             depressive disorder for which AD treatment was initiated is not considered to be a
             pre-existing condition in this definition].

          -  Subjects must meet at least one of the following criteria:

               1. Inability to have an orgasm (anorgasmia), according to patient opinion.

               2. Clinically significant orgasm delay with masturbation or intercourse that
                  according to patient opinion:

                    1. represents a meaningful delay compared with the subject’s usual time to
                       achieve orgasm in response to sexual stimulation prior to antidepressant
                       medication and

                    2. interferes with subject’s sexual function.

               3. Inability to attain or maintain until completion of sexual activity an adequate
                  lubrication swelling response of sexual excitement that according to patient
                  opinion interferes with subject’s sexual function compared to prior to
                  antidepressant medication.

          -  Subjects must experience at least one of the above criterion items (#1-3) with
             distress and or disability.

          -  Subjects must be having or had been having some form of regular sexual activity (i.e.,
             masturbation, oral sex, intercourse) at least twice monthly prior to the
             antidepressant treatment and are willing to continue efforts at sexual activity at
             least once weekly for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects must be in good general physical health.

          -  Subjects must have given informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary or prior diagnosis of a sexual disorder (other than the side effect of the
             antidepressant drug or symptom of major depression).

          -  Vaginal, clitoral, or other sexual organ anatomical deformities.

          -  Post-hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy without at least six months of
             postoperative normal sexual function preceding depression and antidepressant
             treatment.

          -  Any uncontrolled psychiatric disorder.

          -  Alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within past twelve months.

          -  Using or likely to use any nitrate or nitric oxide donors in any form (oral,
             sublingual, buccal, transdermal, inhalational, or aerosol).

          -  Hamilton Depression and/or Anxiety Scale score [either] &gt; 10.

          -  Blood pressure outside 90/50 or 170/100.

          -  Use of investigational drugs within prior 3 months or during study.

          -  Current use of other drugs for antidepressant induced sexual dysfunction.

          -  Hormone replacement therapy unless patient has been on stable dose of hormone therapy
             for at least 3 months prior to the antidepressant treatment and had no sexual
             dysfunction while on the same hormone therapy regimen, and there is no change in the
             hormone replacement therapy during the study.

          -  Pregnancy, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Child bearing potential subjects unwilling and/or not prepared and/or who are judged
             unreliable to use an acceptable and verifiable form of contraception during the study
             (these include IUD, double barrier or hormonal methods of birth control).

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality of the screening physical examination or safety
             laboratory test results.

          -  Subjects whose sexual partners are suffering from and/or receiving treatment for
             sexual dysfunction.

          -  eceiving psychosexual or other therapy for sexual dysfunction and not willing to
             discontinue that treatment at screening.

          -  Amenorrhea for greater than 1 year.

          -  Subjects whose sexual dysfunction is considered to be situational, i.e. limited to
             certain types of situations, stimulation, or partners.

          -  Subjects not attempting some form of regular sexual activity at least twice monthly
             and at least once weekly during study visit intervals for the duration of the entire
