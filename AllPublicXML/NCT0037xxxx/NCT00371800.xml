      the purpose of this study is to determine if cinnamon improves glucose control among
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Widespread achievement of glucose control remains an elusive goal for adolescents with Type 1
      diabetes. Previous research has suggested that cinnamon may be effective at improving glucose
      control in type 2 diabetes. To date, no research has investigated the effect of cinnamon on
      type 1 diabetics. If the addition of a simple, natural, pill to a standard insulin regimen
      can significantly improve glucose control, the clinical implications would be substantial.

      Comparison: Using a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 72 adolescent type
      I diabetics were treated with cinnamon (1 gram/day) or an equivalent appearing placebo for 90
      days. HbA1c, total daily insulin intake, and adverse events were recorded and compared
      between groups.
