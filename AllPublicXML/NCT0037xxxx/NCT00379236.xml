          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Short Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36) General Health(GH) Score at Week 26</title>
          <description>The SF-36 questionnaire yields a score for each domain of health. All domains are scored on a scale from 0 (negative health) to 100 (positive health), with 100 representing the best possible health state. This table summarizes the change from baseline in participants' general health scores. The questionnaire is completed by participants.</description>
