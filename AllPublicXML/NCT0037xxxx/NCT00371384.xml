      Americans are increasingly seeking care from massage therapists for relief of chronic back
      pain. However, while initial studies suggest that massage is beneficial for back pain, we
      have no information about which of the many types of massage is most helpful. We will be
      conducting a study that compares two distinct therapeutic massage protocols with each other
      and with usual care for treating chronic back pain. This study is designed to determine which
      of these massage protocols will be most effective in reducing pain and increasing
      functionality in people with low back pain. 399 Group Health members with non-specific low
      back pain lasting at least 3 months will be randomized to one of the two massage groups or to
      a control group that receives no treatment beyond their usual care. Massage therapists will
      provide each participant with 10 treatments over 10 weeks. The primary outcomes, function and
      bothersomeness of low back pain, will be assessed before treatment begins and 10, 26 and 52
      weeks after randomization by interviewers who do not know which treatment the participant
      received. The results of this study will clarify the value of two different types of massage
      for treating one of the most common, challenging, and expensive health problems plaguing
      developed countries. The findings will help physicians make informed and confident referrals,
      consumers and insurers make safe and cost-effective choices, and massage schools make
      responsible curriculum decisions.
