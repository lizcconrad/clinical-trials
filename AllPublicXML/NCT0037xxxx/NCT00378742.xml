  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect blood and DNA samples from patients with inherited eye diseases to be
      used in research to identify genetic factors responsible for these conditions. In recent
      years, nearly 500 genes that contribute to inherited eye diseases have been identified.
      Disease-causing mutations are associated with many eye diseases, including glaucoma,
      cataracts, strabismus, corneal dystrophies and a number of forms of retinal degenerations. As
      a result, gene-based therapies are being pursued to treat eye genetic diseases that were once
      considered untreatable.

      The National Ophthalmic Genotyping Network (eyeGENE ) is creating a national tissue
      repository to further advance genetic research on inherited eye disease, while at the same
      time providing clinically-useful information back to patients and physicians who request it..
      Physicians in collaborating institutions will recruit patients to participate in the study.
      Patients will provide a blood sample and undergo a standard eye examination. The blood sample
      and clinical information will then be sent to the NEI for testing, processing and storing in
      the tissue repository. Patients are given the option to receive results back and/or to be
      re-contacted in the event of future clinical studies. Information supplied to the testing
      laboratories includes a unique identification number, the patient gender, and the patient
      date of birth. The stored samples will be made available to researchers along with
      information about the patient's disease, but without patient identifiers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Molecular genetics has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of
      inherited eye diseases. Progress in research on inherited eye disease would be augmented by
      the availability of patient DNA coupled to robust, anonymous phenotypic information. The
      National Ophthalmic Genotyping and Phenotyping Network (eyeGENE ) has been created to answer
      this need. We propose the creation of a national DNA and blood repository for inherited eye
      disease. These samples will be gathered from clinical centers around the nation and will be
      coupled to anonymous, phenotypic descriptors. If requested, a portion of the sample submitted
      by a clinician will be used for appropriate, CLIA-certified molecular diagnostics that can be
      used in patient care. Once a sufficient repository is created, researchers will be able to
      request aliquots for their laboratory experiments. Participants will be provided the option
      to be re-contacted if an approved clinical study for which they might qualify is offered.
      Researchers will be able to request aliquots for their laboratory experiments or ask the
      eyeGENE Coordinating Center to re-contact participants to inform them about the possibility
      to participate in a clinical study

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To participate in this protocol:

        1a. The participant must present with characteristics that meet minimal clinical criteria
        established by eyeGENE, as determined by the referring clinician.

        OR

        1b. The participant must be a relative of an affected participant if analysis would help
        with the interpretation of an affected participant's test results or to obtain some useful
        information as decided by the eyeGENE Research Study Group.

        2. The participant must be willing and able to provide a suitable blood sample.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Severe systemic disease that compromise the ability of the referring clinician to
             obtain an adequate eye examination.

          -  Any disease or condition that makes it unsafe for a subject to provide a blood sample
             of at least 5 ml for children and at least 15ml for adults.

          -  Inability to cooperate with phlebotomy and clinical examination.

          -  Those with impaired decision-making capability who do not have a legally-authorized
             representative.

          -  If clinical criteria information, consent forms, or a blood sample can not be provided
             by the doctor or participant after one year of submitting a blood sample to eyeGENE .
