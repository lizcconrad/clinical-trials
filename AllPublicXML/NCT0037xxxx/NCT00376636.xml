    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to investigate the effect of the oral renin inhibitor SPP635 on blood
      pressure in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renin-Angiotensin system blockade is a well established target for treatment of high blood
      pressure. Blocking the system at the initial step, however, is a rather new concept that
      could only be implemented very recently through the availability of novel, oral, renin
      inhibitors. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of a novel oral renin inhibitor,
      SPP635.
