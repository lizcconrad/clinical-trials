  <brief_title>Effects On Dihydrotestosterone Regulated Gene Expression In Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Or Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Open-label, Parallel-group Study, to Assess the Pharmocodynamic Effect on Dihydrotestosterone Regulated Gene Expression, Longitudinally and in a Dose Dependent Manner, of 0.5mg and 3.5mg Dutasteride Administered Orally Once Daily, for One Year in Men With Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and During a Two Month Period Between Baseline and Radical Prostatectomy in Men With Biopsy-proven, Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dutasteride is used in the treatment of benign prostate enlargement (BPH).It inhibits
      conversion of testosterone (T) into the more potent dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to stop
      prostate (and possibly prostate cancer) growth. DHT regulates the expression of certain genes
      in the prostate. The pharmacodynamics of DHT reduction in the prostate were never
      investigated until now, as every measurement would require prostate tissue retrieval, which
      is medically and ethically unacceptable. A recently developed test is able to quantitatively
      measure gene expression in prostate-borne cells, in urine sediments after prostate massage.
      By measuring this gene expression in patients using dutasteride, it has become possible to
      assess the pharmacodynamics of gene expression reduction, which is representative for the
      pharmacodynamics of DHT reduction. Repeated prostate tissue sampling has therefore become
      unnecessary. This newly gained knowledge will lead to a better understanding of the action of
      dutasteride and will possibly help improve treatment of symptomatic BPH (Benign Prostatic
      Hyperplasia) and PrCa (Prostate Cancer)in the future.

      A randomized, open-label, parallel-group pilot study, to assess the pharmacodynamic effect on
      dihydrotestosterone regulated gene expression, longitudinally and in a dose dependent manner,
      of 0.5mg or 3.5mg dutasteride administered orally once daily, for three months in men with
      symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia or during the period between baseline and radical
      prostatectomy in men with biopsy-proven, clinically localized prostate cancer.
