    <measure>Difference Between the Number of Newly Active Lesions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Per Three Months During the 6-month Treatment Period and the Number of Newly Active Lesions During 3-month Pre-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>after 6 months of treatment as compared to 3-month pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy variable was calculated by subtracting the number of newly active lesions during the 3-month pre-treatment period from the cumulative number of newly active lesions during the 6-month treatment period divided by 2 (number of newly active lesions per three months, new lesion frequency per 3 months)</description>

    <time_frame>after 6 months of treatment as compared to 3-month pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary endpoint (component of the primary endpoint) was calculated by subtracting the number of new Gd-enhancing lesions during the 3-month pre-treatment period from the cumulative number of new Gd-enhancing lesions during the 6-month treatment period divided by 2 (number of new Gd-enhancing lesions per three months)</description>

    <description>This secondary endpoint (component of the primary endpoint) was calculated by subtracting the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions during the 3-month pre-treatment period from the cumulative number of new or enlarging T2 lesions during the 6-month treatment period divided by 2 (number of new T2 lesions per three months) based on non-enhancing lesions on T1 weighted scans</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Relapses: Relapse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (axillary temperature more than (&gt;) 37.5 degree celsius / 99.5 degree fahrenheit) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by a documented report from a physician or by objective assessment. The relapse rate was calculated on an annualized basis. Annualized relapse rate is the average number of relapses in a year calculated by negative binomial regression as the sum of confirmed relapses of all subjects in the group divided by the sum of the number of days on study of all subjects in the group and multiplied by 365.25.</description>

    <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (axillary temperature &gt;37.5 degree celsius / 99.5 degree fahrenheit) or known infection.

    <measure>Assessment of Relapses: Relapse Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (axillary temperature &gt;37.5 degree celsius / 99.5 degree fahrenheit) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by a documented report from a physician or by objective assessment. A major relapse was defined based on changes on EDSS with the following additional criteria to be met: objective neurological impairment, correlating with the subject's reported symptoms, defined as either increase in at least one of the functional systems of the EDSS score or increase of the total EDSS score. Relapses which did not meet the criteria of major relapses were considered as non-major.</description>

    <measure>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment on Day 1, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is a scale based on the standardized neurological examination which comprised of optic, brain stem/cranial nerves, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, vegetative, and cerebral functions, as well as walking ability. The EDSS scores range from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (dead). A score of 2 to 3 indicates minimal to moderate disability.</description>

A score of 2 to 3 indicates minimal to moderate disability.

          <description>The EDSS is a scale based on the standardized neurological examination which comprised of optic, brain stem/cranial nerves, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, vegetative, and cerebral functions, as well as walking ability. The EDSS scores range from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (dead). A score of 2 to 3 indicates minimal to moderate disability.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Relapses: Relapse Rate</title>
        <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (axillary temperature more than (&gt;) 37.5 degree celsius / 99.5 degree fahrenheit) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by a documented report from a physician or by objective assessment. The relapse rate was calculated on an annualized basis. Annualized relapse rate is the average number of relapses in a year calculated by negative binomial regression as the sum of confirmed relapses of all subjects in the group divided by the sum of the number of days on study of all subjects in the group and multiplied by 365.25.</description>

The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (axillary temperature &gt;37.5 degree celsius / 99.5 degree fahrenheit) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by a documented report from a physician or by objective assessment. A major relapse was defined based on changes on EDSS with the following additional criteria to be met: objective neurological impairment, correlating with the subject’s reported symptoms, defined as either increase in at least one of the functional systems of the EDSS score or increase of the total EDSS score. Relapses which did not meet the criteria of major relapses were considered as non-major.</description>

          <title>Assessment of Relapses: Relapse Severity</title>
          <description>A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (axillary temperature &gt;37.5 degree celsius / 99.5 degree fahrenheit) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by a documented report from a physician or by objective assessment. A major relapse was defined based on changes on EDSS with the following additional criteria to be met: objective neurological impairment, correlating with the subject’s reported symptoms, defined as either increase in at least one of the functional systems of the EDSS score or increase of the total EDSS score. Relapses which did not meet the criteria of major relapses were considered as non-major.</description>

        <description>The EDSS is a scale based on the standardized neurological examination which comprised of optic, brain stem/cranial nerves, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, vegetative, and cerebral functions, as well as walking ability. The EDSS scores range from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (dead). A score of 2 to 3 indicates minimal to moderate disability.</description>
