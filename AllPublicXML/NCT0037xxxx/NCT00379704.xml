  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue factor is the main activator of coagulation cascades. Excessive tissue factor
      expression is made responsible of thrombosis in a number of clinical situations including
      thrombosis in contact with atherosclerotic plaques. Recent work showed that tissue factor
      gene expression in adipose tissue was significantly increased in obese versus lean mice.

      The main objective of this study is to show that tissue factor expression is increased in
      human adipose tissue obtained from obese subjects and to identify its main tissular origin by
      comparing abdominal and subcutaneous adipose tissue.

      The secondary objectives are to identify the cell origin of tissue factor (adipocytes versus
      stromal cells) and to analyze the relation ship between blood tissue factor and (i) tissue
      factor expressed by adipose tissue, (ii) the amount of subcutaneous and profound adipose
      tissue, and (iii) coagulation activation markers.
