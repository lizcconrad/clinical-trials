      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acyclovir is effective in suppressing HIV
      viral load in women infected with both HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) who are
      starting HIV treatment for the first time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women coinfected with HIV and HSV-2 experience more genital herpes outbreaks than women
      infected only with HSV-2. Frequent or recurrent herpes outbreaks in women infected with HIV
      can lead to an increase in both HIV plasma viral load and cervical shedding of HIV. Some
      preliminary clinical studies have shown that acyclovir treatment for the management of HSV-2
      infection can help lower HIV viral load in patients coinfected with both HIV and HSV-2.
      Supplementing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HSV-2 treatment in patients
      coinfected with both HIV and HSV-2 may help strengthen the effects of HAART by more
      effectively lowering plasma and genital HIV viral load. This study will determine whether
      HSV-2 treatment with acyclovir is effective in controlling HIV plasma viral load and cervical
      shedding of HIV in women starting on HAART as per Peruvian guidelines.

      This study will last 24 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups.
      Group 1 participants will receive twice-daily 800 mg of acyclovir for 24 weeks. Group 2
      participants will receive twice-daily placebo for 24 weeks. Both groups will receive HAART
      from the Peruvian Ministry of Health. There will be 15 visits during this study. Medical
      history; a physical exam; blood collection; family planning counseling; and cervical,
      vaginal, and vulvar swab collection will begin prior to study entry and will occur at all
      study visits.
