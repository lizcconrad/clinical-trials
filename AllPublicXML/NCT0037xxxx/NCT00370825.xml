    <textblock>
      In this sequential design four arm study one arm is a reference arm but the three arms will
      consist an of initial dose of liposomal amphotericin B on first day followed by miltefosine.
      Both the drugs will be used in different doses. Reference arm will consist only a single dose
      of amBisome at 5 mg/kg. After the end of treatment, the post treatment assessment will be
      done on day 16 (initial cure) and six months (final cure). Safety parameters will be
      evaluated on day 0, 8 and 16. An arm with an efficacy of less than 75% will be closed. There
      will be periodical assessment of study results after completion of 5 patients in each arm.
