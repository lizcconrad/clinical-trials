      This clinical trial studies sodium fluorine-18 (18F NaF)/fluorine-18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting
      skeletal metastases in patients with stage III-IV breast cancer or stage II-IV prostate
      cancer. 18F NaF and 18F FDG are radioactive substances that are absorbed by cancerous cells
      and allow for the cancer to be found using diagnostic procedures such as PET/MRI. PET/MRI is
      a procedure that combines detailed pictures of areas inside the body from PET and MRI scans
      and may help find and diagnose skeletal metastases in patients with breast or prostate
      cancer. It is not yet known whether 18F NaF/18F FDG PET/MRI is better than standard imaging
      methods in detecting skeletal metastases.
