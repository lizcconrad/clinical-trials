  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient Navigation is a Supportive Care Intervention that addresses barriers to quality
      standard care by providing individualized assistance to patients and families. The NCI is
      conducting several research programs to test the effectiveness of this approach. The expected
      outcomes of patient navigation through the cancer care system include:

        -  Timely, definitive diagnosis following an abnormal test

        -  Timely treatment following positive diagnosis

        -  Patient satisfaction with the diagnostic and care system experience

      The goal of our local project is to provide Tampa Bay with a culturally appropriate Patient
      Navigator Program that will decrease delay in diagnosis and delivery of cancer care in an
      acceptable and cost-effective manner leading to lower cancer mortality among our underserved
      populations. We will partner with community health centers in the Tampa Bay area to provide
      an avenue for patients who have received an abnormal screening for breast and colorectal
      cancer to easier pilot the course of the healthcare system. The populations served by this
      program will include African-Americans, Hispanics and rural Whites who are medically
      underserved due to lack of insurance, documentation issues and a variety of other barriers to
      health care.

      The primary outcome to be tested with this program is the time it takes for patients with an
      abnormality to receive a definitive diagnosis. Secondary outcomes such as patient
      satisfaction and cost-effectiveness will also be measured. This program occurs in three
      phases. In Phase I, the aim is to work closely with our key community partners to conduct
      formative research for the development of an acceptable, appealing, and appropriate Patient
      Navigator Program. The aim for Phase II is to conduct a group randomized controlled trial by
      having participating clinics randomly assigned to an intervention or control clinic. The
      outcomes from this phase in the project will be assessed through chart reviews, patient
      satisfaction surveys and other survey methods. In Phase III a comprehensive evaluation on the
      program will be produced and disseminated nationally.
