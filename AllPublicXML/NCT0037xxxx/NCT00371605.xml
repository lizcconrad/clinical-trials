    <textblock>
      A fixed-dosing regimen of voriconazole is routinely used as prophylaxis against aspergillosis
      in liver transplant patients admitted to the transplant intensive care unit at UPMC. We
      hypothesize that use of a fixed-dosing regimen of voriconazole will lead to a large degree of
      variability in drug exposure among liver transplant patients due to: 1) variability in
      absorption and elimination caused by physiological characteristics unique to this patient
      population 2) its non-linear pharmacokinetics and 3) the potential for polymorphism in the
      genes that encode for cytochrome P-450 enzymes that metabolize voriconazole. This is a pilot
      clinical pharmacokinetic evaluation that will: 1) characterize the plasma concentration
      versus time profile of voriconazole in liver transplant patients receiving a fixed-dosing
      regimen to assess for extremes in systemic exposure 2) determine the oral bioavailability of
      voriconazole in liver transplant patients 3) assess for functionally significant allelic
      variation of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes that metabolize voriconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and
      CYP3A4/5) in both recipient blood and allograft tissue that may contribute extremes in
      systemic exposure among liver transplant patients. This evaluation will allow for an
      assessment of the adequacy of the prophylactic regimen in achieving therapeutic drug
      concentrations in all subjects. Additionally, the utility of genotyping as a clinical tool to
      identify patients at risk for extremes in voriconazole exposure will be evaluated. The
      characterization of the pharmacokinetics in liver transplant patients may be utilized to
      define an optimal therapeutic regimen that will be individualized to target specific
      concentrations to maximize efficacy and minimize side-effects.

      All liver transplant patients receiving voriconazole prophylaxis are eligible to participate
      in this study. We propose a single-center, observational study in 15 liver transplant
      patients who are admitted to the ICU and receiving voriconazole prophylaxis as part of
      standard care. Each patient will undergo blood sampling (27 mL) on one occasion
      (Pharmacokinetic Study I), while receiving oral voriconazole. A small portion of blood (1 mL)
      collected during this blood sampling period will be retained for genotyping (specific aim
      III).

      Voriconazole prophylaxis is most often administered to liver transplant patients via the oral
      route (200 mg twice daily). However, circumstances may arise necessitating the administration
      of intravenous doses of voriconazole for a subset of patients, as part of their standard
      care. . Thus, these patients will undergo blood sampling on a maximum two additional
      occasions: 1) surrounding an intravenous dose dose (27 mL) 2) surrounding an oral dose (27
      mL) .

      The amount of voriconazole present in the blood samples will be measured via high pressure
      liquid chromatography. Individual plasma concentration time profiles will be determined
      following oral and intravenous dosing, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates will
      be derived via population and individual pharmacokinetic data analysis.

      The use, dose, and frequency of the medication voriconazole is up to the clinical staff. We
      will not be altering the delivery, dose or use of the drug. Therefore we cannot provide you
      with the requested information because it will all depend on the clinical team. We are not
      intervening to enroll subjects. Subjects will only be enrolled if they are placed on
      voriconazole and they agreed to participate.

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive male or female liver transplant recipients, 18 years old, who are
             initiated on the voriconazole prophylactic regimen by their transplant physician as
             part of their standard care, will be eligible for inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Transplant recipients receiving voriconazole to treat an active fungal infection will
             be excluded. Transplant recipients that are concurrently receiving medications that
             are documented to affect voriconazole pharmacokinetics will be excluded. The agents
             included, but may not be limited to the following; carbamazepine, phenytoin,
             omeprazole, rifabutin, rifampin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, St. John's
