      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of
      peginesatide for the maintenance of hemoglobin in participants with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) who had received at least 24 weeks of peginesatide treatment in an earlier study.

    <textblock>
      Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease is due to several factors, primarily the
      inability of the diseased kidneys to produce adequate amounts of endogenous erythropoietin.
      Ancillary factors include the shortened lifespan of red blood cells, iron and other
      nutritional deficiencies, infection, and inflammation. The presence and severity of anemia
      are related to the duration and extent of kidney failure. Anemia is associated with increased
      mortality, increased likelihood of hospitalization, reduced cognitive function, and increased
      left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.

      Erythropoiesis stimulating agents have been established as a treatment for anemia in subjects
      with chronic kidney disease, and have improved the management of anemia over alternatives
      such as transfusion. Peginesatide is a parenteral formulation developed for the treatment of
      anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Peginesatide binds to and activates the human
      erythropoietin receptor, and stimulates erythropoiesis in human red cell precursors in a
      manner similar to other known erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).

      Study participants had received at least 24 weeks of peginesatide dosing in a previous
      Affymax-sponsored study (NCT00228449) and were to receive doses of peginesatide for
      approximately 54 months. However, the Sponsor ended the study early.

    <description>Participants received the same initial peginesatide dose as was administered at the end of the previous peginesatide treatment study (NCT00228449) in which the participant was enrolled. The median first dose at study start was 0.087 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) with an interquartile range of 0.064 to 0.123 mg/kg. Each participant was to receive peginesatide as an injection administered intravenously once every 4 weeks for approximately 54 months in this trial.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is informed of the investigational nature of this study and has given
             written, witnessed informed consent in accordance with institutional, local, and
             national guidelines

          -  Males or females ≥ 18 years of age. Pre-menopausal females (with the exception of
             those who are surgically sterile) must have a negative pregnancy test at screening;
             those who are sexually active must practice a highly effective method of birth control
             for at least 4 weeks prior to study drug administration, and must be willing to
             continue contraception until at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Participant who has received at least 24 weeks of peginesatide dosing in a previous
             Affymax-sponsored study

          -  One hemoglobin value of &gt; 10.0 g/dL in the 4 weeks prior to study drug administration

          -  Known intolerance to peginesatide or pegylated products

          -  History of antibodies to any erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) or history of pure
             red cell aplasia (PRCA)

          -  High likelihood of early withdrawal or interruption of the study (e.g., participant
             suffers from any clinically significant medical disease or condition that may, in the
             Investigator's opinion, interfere with safety, assessment, or follow-up of the
             participant)

          -  Anticipated life expectancy &lt; 18 months

          -  Receipt of any ESA other than peginesatide at any time after participant enrollment in
             the previous Affymax-sponsored study
