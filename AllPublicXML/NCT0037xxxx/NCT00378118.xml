    <textblock>
      Blood is the most commonly used specimen to test for HIV. In the past 20 years, use of saliva
      as an alternative specimen for HIV testing has been explored. Today, very sensitive tests
      have been formulated and have been used for diagnosing HIV in adults and older children.
      OraQuick, a rapid test, is one such example. It is a devise that can be used to collect as
      well test the saliva.

      Most studies done on the use of saliva have been carried out in adults and have produced very
      good results. However very few such studies have been done in children, especially infants.
      In adults, use of saliva has also highlighted the advantages of ease of collection and
      increased acceptability of testing.

      HYPOTHESIS OraQuick rapid test can detect antiHIV antibodies as well as the Abbott determine
      test and oral fluid testing is more acceptable than blood testing.

      BACKGROUND Serological identification of antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in
      blood is the most widely used method to screen for HIV infection. Use of oral fluid as an
      alternative to blood sample has been studies the past 20 years and extremely sensitive tests
      that are able to detect the very low quantities of antibodies found in oral fluid have been
      formulated and are currently being used. OraQuick rapid test, a combination, collection and
      testing device that uses both blood and oral fluid was approved for used by the U.S.A, FDA in
      2002 and has been tested in adults and older children.

      The value of oral fluid in screening for HIV infection in adults is now well established and
      has been used extensively in field survey and epidemiologic studies. However, these methods
      have not been studied in children in whom differences in test performance might be expected.
      Studies in adults have also highlighted the advantages of oral fluid testing, such as ease of
      collection and high degree of acceptability of testing. This would make oral fluid testing a
      good alternative for HIV screening in infants, a challenging population in which venipuncture
      is often difficult or unacceptable.
