    <textblock>
      The trial aimed to examine the effects of supplementation with antioxidants and folinic acid
      on the health, growth and psychomotor development of children with Down syndrome. 156
      children with Trisomy 21, less than 7 months of age were recruited and randomised into four
      groups to receive antioxidants, folinic acid, a combination of antioxidants and folinic acid
      or a placebo. Blinded outcome assessment was carried out 18 months later.Blood and urine
      samples were also taken around 12 months of age to examine metabolic effects of
      supplementation.
