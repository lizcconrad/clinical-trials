      Hypothesis: Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) decreases function of the lining of the blood
      vessels in normal humans.

      This study is designed to explore how hypoglycemia affects the function of the blood vessel
      lining. This will be determined by measuring blood flow to the arm before and after occlusion
      of flow. Blood vessel function will be measured before induction of hypoglycemia, during
      insulin induced hypoglycemia, and after recovery from hypoglycemia. A second study will be
      done but without hypoglycemia.

      Purpose: The purpose of the research is to learn more about how low blood sugar (low blood
      glucose or hypoglycemia) affects the way the blood vessels work in healthy people. Subjects
      who participate in this research project must be in good health and taking no medications.

      Methods: A screening visit to the Clinical Research Center of the Ohio State University will
      be used to assess eligibility to participate. The main study consists of two visits to the
      Clinical Research Center that occur two to four weeks apart. Each of these visits will
      involve a procedure known as an insulin clamp. This involves giving insulin and sugar water
      into a vein. The amount of sugar given varies to keep the blood sugar at a predetermined
      level. For one of the two visits the blood sugar will be low and the other it will be normal.
      The function of the blood vessels will be measured three times during each study by measuring
      blood flow before and after stopping blood flow to the arm for 5 min.
