  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CDA is a combination of chlorproguanil, dapsone and artesunate, being developed in a
      public-private partnership with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), World Health
      Organisation (WHO-TDR) and academic partners from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
      Medicine, University of Liverpool and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine as a
      treatment for acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.

      The combination of chlorproguanil HCl (CPG) and dapsone (DDS) as chlorproguanil-dapsone has
      already been shown to be efficacious against P.falciparum in adults and children in
      Sub-Sahara Africa. The addition of artesunate to LAPDAP has been demonstrated to increase the
      parasite kill rate as demonstrated in the phase II study, and reduce the chance of any
      parasites escaping treatment over the 3-day course. The addition of artesunate is also
      anticipated to have the population benefit of protection against the development of resistant
      strains of P.falciparum, although it will not be possible to demonstrate this in a clinical
      trial. One further population benefit of the artemisinin drugs are their ability to suppress
      the sexual forms of the parasite (gametocytes), which should reduce infectivity after
      antimalarial treatment and potentially lower transmission rates with widespread use,
      including the spread of any parasites resistant to the partner drug.

      The aims of this phase III study are to compare the efficacy of a fixed ratio combination
      tablet of CDA to chlorproguanil-dapsone, and collect supporting safety data. This will be a
      multi-centre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised trial, in children, adolescents and
      adults, with chlorproguanil-dapsone as a comparator.
