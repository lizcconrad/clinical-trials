  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine
      and cisplatin in high risk NPC patients with residual EBV DNA following primary radiotherapy
      with or without concurrent cisplatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The standard treatment for nasopharynx cancer is a course of radiotherapy with or
           without concurrent chemotherapy. This will cure about 80% of patients. For the 20% who
           developed recurrence or metastases, the prognosis is poor.

        -  Elevated EBV-DNA in plasma at end of radiotherapy has been shown to predict disease
           recurrence and may be a marker of subclinical residual disease.

        -  This study aims to test whether adjuvant treatment with 6 cycles of a modern
           chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine and cisplatin combination) can improve the survival of
           these high risk patients of nasopharynx cancer who have elevated EBV-DNA after
           completion of their radiotherapy.

             understanding that consent may be withdrawn at any time without prejudice.

          2. A histological diagnosis of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) must have been established at
             some time and the investigator must review and confirm the diagnosis prior to

             primary RT or chemo-RT

          6. No clinical evidence of persistent loco-regional disease after primary treatment

          7. Performance status of ECOG grade 0 or 1.

             duration of the study and must be neither pregnant nor breast-feeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypercalcaemia: calcium &gt;= 2.7 mmol/L (10.8 mg/dL).

             treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin).

          3. More that 12 weeks after completion of primary radiotherapy.

          4. Had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy.

          5. Other serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study (at the
             discretion of the investigator).

          6. Have serious active infection.
