  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well temsirolimus works in treating patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall activity (as defined by complete response [CR] + partial response
      [PR] + stable disease [SD] for &gt;= 24 weeks) of a weekly 25 mg intravenous dose of
      temsirolimus in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To compare the activity of temsirolimus in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer whose primary tumors have mutations in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase,
      catalytic, alpha (PIK3CA) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene with those whose
      tumors do not have a mutation in the PIK3CA gene.

      III. To examine correlations between antitumor activity of temsirolimus and alterations in
      expression of genes in the PI3K pathway in primary tumor biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes weekly. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0 was used for response evaluation. Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks.
Evaluation of target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)-- At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Stable Disease (SD)-- Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started;
Evaluation of non-target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD)-- Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent
             breast cancer not amenable to local therapy (surgery and radiation)
             (histologic/cytologic confirmation of recurrence preferred, but not required)

          -  Either the primary or metastatic tumor must be positive for estrogen receptor (&gt;= 1%
             by immunohistochemical staining) and/or progesterone receptor (&gt;= 1% by
             immunohistochemical staining) and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2neu)
             (3+ immunohistochemical staining or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]
             positive)

          -  Patients must have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined as at least one
             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to
             be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral
             computed tomography (CT) scan

          -  There are no limitations on the number of prior therapy regimens; however, patients
             who have had prior exposure to rapamycin or any other mechanistic target of rapamycin
             (mTOR) inhibitor are excluded from the trial

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =&lt; 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 2.0 times normal institutional ULN

          -  Cholesterol =&lt; 350 mg/dL (fasting)

          -  Triglycerides =&lt; 400 mg/dL (fasting)

          -  Albumin &gt;= 3.3 mg/dL

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately; women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             prior to treatment on study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with temsirolimus

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  As a primary reason for this study is to demonstrate a relationship between drug
             activity and tumor molecular phenotype, tissue for correlative studies must be
             available and the subject must agree the use of tissue for these studies

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be off of hormonal agents used for the treatment of breast cancer for
             one week with the exception that premenopausal women who have been on a
             gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and subsequently progressed may, at the
             discretion of the treating physician, continue on the GnRH agonist

               -  Patients should have recovered from the adverse effects of prior chemotherapy; in
                  general, this will mean that the patient would have been due or overdue for the
                  next dose of the prior regimen: three weeks should have elapsed for a regimen
                  administered once every three weeks, etc

               -  Radiotherapy should have been completed

               -  Three weeks should have elapsed since prior therapy with monoclonal antibodies,
                  because they have a long half-life

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or herbal preparations;
             patients may not be taking corticosteroids except in low doses as replacement for
             adrenal insufficiency or for short -term (less than 5 days) use for other reasons

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are not permitted on study unless the metastases
             have been controlled by prior surgery or radiotherapy, and the patient has been
             neurologically stable and off of steroids for at least 4 weeks

          -  Patients cannot be receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (enzyme-inducing
             antiepileptic drugs [EIAEDs]; e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) nor any
             other cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inducer such as
             rifampin or St. John's wort, as these may decrease temsirolimus levels; use of agents
             that potently inhibit CYP3A (and hence may raise temsirolimus levels), such as
             ketoconazole, is discouraged, but not specifically prohibited; CCI-779 can inhibit
             cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6), and may decrease
             metabolism (and increase drug levels) of drugs that are substrates for CYP2D6, such as
             codeine; the appropriateness of use of such agents is left to physician discretion; if
             there is any doubt about eligibility based on concomitant medication, the study chair,
             Dr Fleming, should be contacted; all concomitant medications must be recorded

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to macrolide antibiotics (such as
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin) are not eligible for this trial

          <description>Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0 was used for response evaluation. Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks.
Evaluation of target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)-- At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Stable Disease (SD)-- Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started;
Evaluation of non-target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD)-- Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits</description>
