  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes to taste and smell have been reported in head and neck cancer patients who undergo
      radiation and chemotherapy. This may cause food to be unappealing and can lead to a reduced
      food intake. Thsi study will increase our understanding of taste and smell changes and how it
      relates to food and taste preferences.
