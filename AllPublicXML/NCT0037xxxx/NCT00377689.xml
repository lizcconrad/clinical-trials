  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a 5-week intervention program targeted at improving
      balance and functional skills for people with stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many people with stroke experience a deterioration in balance and a functional decline due to
      hemiplegic muscle strength. This tend to restrict the persons activity in daily life and also
      leads to a low falls self efficacy.

      High intensity exercise have shown to be effective for improving strength and balance for
      older people in general living in residential care facilities. It is interesting to see if
      this high intensity exercise also is applicable in the older stroke population.

      Comparison: An intervention group receives three training sessions per week and one theory
      session per week during 5 weeks, compared to a control group that receives one theory session
      per week during 5 weeks.
