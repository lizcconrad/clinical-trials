  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week outpatient study for patients with schizophrenia who are on Clozapine, but
      continue to experience symptoms. The purpose of this project is to find out if small doses of
      pimozide (an antipsychotic medication, taken by mouth) will be helpful in reducing symptoms
      (such as hearing voices, having trouble in organizing your thoughts, lack of interest in life
      events and social activities), compared to placebo (an inactive substance, &quot;sugar pill&quot;),
      when added to clozapine in patients with schizophrenia.

      The participant will be asked to come in once a week to meet with the research staff and
      study doctor. The participant will continue to see your regular clinician during this study
      for all normal appointments. The participant will remain on your current medications
      throughout the study. During the study you will be randomly selected to be put on a small
      dose of Pimozide or placebo.

      If you choose to participate, you will first have screening tests to find out if you are
      eligible. The study physician will do a number of tests including a physical examination, a
      routine medical history, lab tests for blood and urine, and EKG (to monitor your heart) and
      interviews about your physical and mental health.

      At each visit you will complete an EKG (to monitor your heart), vital signs, and discuss how
      you are feeling with the research staff and doctor. Once a month, we will also conduct a
      slightly longer interview with you about your symptoms and draw one tube of blood to check
      your Clozapine level. At the beginning and end of the study, you will do some pencil and
      paper games called &quot;Neurocognitive tests&quot;.

      If you are interested in participating in this study, we will go over it in greater detail
      with you, including the possible benefits and risks associated with participating. We will
      make sure you understand the study before you begin. This study is completely voluntary,
      which means that you can choose to stop participating in the study at any time.

    <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is an 18‐item instrument. The items are anchored on a 7‐point scale (higher rating: greater severity). Total scores range from 18 to 126 (higher score: greater severity). The instrument covers areas including: somatic concerns, anxiety, emotional withdrawal, conceptual disorganization, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, grandiosity, depressive mood, hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, blunted affect, excitement and disorientation.</description>

    <description>The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) is a rating scale to measure negative symptoms in schizophrenia. The scale has 25 items (20 individual and 5 global) rated on scale of 0‐5 (higher rating: greater severity). SANS is split into 5 domains, and within each domain separate symptoms are rated from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). Domains include: Affective Flattening or Blunting, Alogia, Avolition - Apathy, Anhedonia - Asociality, Attention. The total range of the SANS is from 0 to 120.</description>

    <description>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as fast as possible while still maintaining accuracy. ( Arnett, James A.; Seth S. Labovitz (1995). &quot;Effect of physical layout in performance of the Trail Making Test&quot;. Psychological Assessment 7 (2): 220-221. doi:10.1037/1040-3590.7.2.220. Retrieved 2012-02-22.)
Part A is used primarily to examine cognitive processing speed. Part B, in which the subject alternates between numbers and letters, is used to examine executive functioning.

The scale has 25 items (20 individual and 5 global) rated on scale of 0‐5 (higher rating: greater severity). SANS is split into 5 domains, and within each domain separate symptoms are rated from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). Domains include: Affective Flattening or Blunting, Alogia, Avolition - Apathy, Anhedonia - Asociality, Attention. The total range of the SANS is from 0 to 120.</description>

          <title>Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)</title>
          <description>The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) is a rating scale to measure negative symptoms in schizophrenia. The scale has 25 items (20 individual and 5 global) rated on scale of 0‐5 (higher rating: greater severity). SANS is split into 5 domains, and within each domain separate symptoms are rated from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). Domains include: Affective Flattening or Blunting, Alogia, Avolition - Apathy, Anhedonia - Asociality, Attention. The total range of the SANS is from 0 to 120.</description>

        <title>Trail Making Test: Trail A</title>
        <description>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as fast as possible while still maintaining accuracy. ( Arnett, James A.; Seth S. Labovitz (1995). &quot;Effect of physical layout in performance of the Trail Making Test&quot;. Psychological Assessment 7 (2): 220–221. doi:10.1037/1040-3590.7.2.220. Retrieved 2012-02-22.)
Part A is used primarily to examine cognitive processing speed. Part B, in which the subject alternates between numbers and letters, is used to examine executive functioning.

        <title>Trail Making Test: Trail B</title>
        <description>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as fast as possible while still maintaining accuracy. ( Arnett, James A.; Seth S.
