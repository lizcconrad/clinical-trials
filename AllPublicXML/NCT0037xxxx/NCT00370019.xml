      This study will determine whether giving estrogen replacement therapy through an estradiol
      patch can improve ovulation rates in women with spontaneous premature ovarian failure. The
      ovaries are glands in women that produce female hormones and normally release an egg once a
      month. In women with spontaneous premature ovarian failure, the ovaries stop working too
      soon. Women with this disorder have abnormally high levels of leuteinizing hormone (LH) in
      their blood, which impedes normal ovulation. In some women, estrogen replacement can suppress
      LH levels to the normal range.

      Women between 18 and 40 years of age with premature ovarian failure may be eligible for this
      4-month study. Participants receive either standard hormone replacement therapy, consisting
      of an estradiol patch and progestin tablets, or placebo. The placebo group receives patches
      and tablets that look the same as those for the group with active treatment but they contain
      no hormone. All participants wear the patch every day and take the tablets the first 12 days
      of each month. In addition to taking the study drug, participants have blood drawn once a
      week for the 16 weeks of the study.

      At the end of the trial, women who were in the placebo group are offered the opportunity to
      receive the estrogen patch and progestin therapy for another 16 weeks and continue the blood
      tests to determine if they ovulate on this treatment.

    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a life altering and distressing diagnosis for women due to
      associated infertility. Despite having amenorrhea and markedly elevated serum gonadotropin
      levels, approximately 50% of women with 46XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure have
      ovarian follicles that function intermittently. These follicles are faced with high serum LH
      levels. Normally, women have their LH levels in the range of 3-14 u/L except in the
      preovulatory stage, when it rises above 20 u/L. At that level it works on LH receptors on the
      granulosa cells and transforms the follicle in the corpus leutium. In POF, continuous high
      level of LH prematurely lutienizes growing follicles and thereby causes follicle dysfunction.
      We have shown by histological examination that inappropriate luteinization is a major
      mechanism of Graffian follicle dysfunction in these women.

      We have found that approximately 50% women with premature ovarian failure have LH levels in
      the normal range while they are taking 100 mcg per day of our standardized transdermal
      estradiol therapy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with karyotypically normal spontaneous premature ovarian failure (as defined by
        screening protocol 91-CH-0127), i.e. women who have at least 4 months of amenorrhea, two
        FSH levels above 40 mIU/mL, or in the menopausal range, at least one month apart, and a
        normal 46, XX karyotype, diagnosed with premature ovarian failure prior to the age of 40
        who are between the age of 18 and 40 years will be candidates.

        Patients will be screened under the protocol 91-CH-0127 (Ovarian follicle function in
        patients with karyotypically normal spontaneous premature ovarian failure).

             therapy, chemotherapy, use of other therapies to induce ovulation such as clomiphene
             citrate and other assisted reproductive technologies.(At present there are no proven
             ways to improve ovulation rate in these women)
