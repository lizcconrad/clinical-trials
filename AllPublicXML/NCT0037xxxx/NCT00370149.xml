  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to determine if a therapeutic difference exists between
      central venous catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampin and conventional catheters
      not impregnated with antibiotics when used in children at high risk for bloodstream
      infections (CABSI) after cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard central venous catheter (CVC) is now commonly used for infants, children, and
      adults. The antibiotic-coated CVC is a newer CVC gaining popularity for use in adults. The
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) support use of
      the antibiotic-coated CVC for adult patients. But the FDA and CDC have not yet endorsed use
      of the antibiotic-coated CVC for infants and children due to lack of research on this CVC in
      infants and children.

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited and consented during pre-operative visits at Riley Hospital between September 2006 and May 2010.
