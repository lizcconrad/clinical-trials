  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural evolution of severe central retinal vein occlusion with low visual acuity is very
      poor. A randomized clinical trial will compare troxerutin and platelet anti-aggregating
      agents (drug treatment) versus surgery and drug treatment. Surgery will include vitrectomy
      and radial optic neurotomy. The primary outcome will be vision measured 6 months after
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) is the second most frequently retinal vascular disease
      causing loss of vision, after diabetic retinopathy. No treatment of CRVO has clearly
      demonstrated beneficial and long lasting visual results. Commonly used treatment options are
      platelet anti-aggregating agents, correcting rheologic factors with troxerutin and isovolumic
      hemodilution. Surgical treatment of CRVO has recently been proposed (2001) and has been
      studied in numerous non comparative pilot studies. Limited but encouraging results motivate
      our randomised controlled trial. We will evaluate at 6 months visual acuity after surgery
      associating pars plana vitrectomy and radial optic neurotomy, in patients with central vein
      occlusion and bad vision, associated with the correction of rheologic factors.
