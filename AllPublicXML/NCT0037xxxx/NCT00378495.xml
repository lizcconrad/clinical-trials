        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed (untreated) visceral leishmaniasis with symptomatic disease and
             visualization of amastigotes in tissue samples or a positive culture.

               -  Age: Group 1: 2 to 12 years; Group 2: 13 to 60 years

               -  Sex: male and female patients eligible (no effort to be made to balance the study
                  for gender)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria

        Safety concerns:

          -  Thrombocyte count &lt;30 x 109/l;

          -  Leukocyte count &lt;1 x 109/l;

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;5 g/100 ml;

          -  ASAT, ALAT, AP &gt;3 times upper limit of normal range;

          -  Serum creatinine or BUN &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal range;

          -  Evidence of serious underlying disease (cardiac, renal, hepatic or pulmonary);

          -  Immunodeficiency or antibody to HIV;

          -  Severe protein and/or caloric malnutrition (Kwashiorkor, Marasmus);

          -  Any non-compensated or uncontrolled condition;

          -  Lactation, pregnancy (to be determined by adequate test) or inadequate contraception

        Lack of suitability for the trial:

          -  Negative bone marrow aspirate (smear);

          -  Any history of prior anti-leishmania therapy;

          -  Any condition which compromises ability to comply with the study procedures;

          -  Concomitant serious infection other than visceral leishmaniasis (this would include
             evidence of other conditions associated with splenomegaly such as schistosomiasis or
             malaria).

        Administrative reasons:
