             and HBV-sAg, then an expert will be consulted as to patient eligibility based on the
             patient's infectious status

          -  females who are pregnant or nursing or of childbearing potential who are unwilling to

          -  any illness which might affect patient's survival over the study follow up period or
             any illness which, in the investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy

          -  ICDs implanted less than 6 months prior to cellular implantation procedure. ICDs
             reprogrammed during the course of treatment and stable for less than 3 months.
             Patients fitted w/a Bi-V pacer are excluded.
