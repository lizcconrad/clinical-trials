  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the insulin sensitizing effects of
      rosiglitazone were accompanied by changes in 11ß-HSD1 expression and activity in different
      tissues. Furthermore the metabolic and hormonal effects of PPAR gamma stimulation by
      rosiglitazone will be analysed in several tissues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (R) increases insulin sensitivity, which is comparable to
      the effects of a reduction in 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity in
      animal models. We therefore aimed to investigate whether rosiglitazone-induced insulin
      sensitivity is associated with changes in 11β-HSD1 activity in different tissues in subjects
      suffering from impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore the metabolic and hormonal effects of
      PPAR gamma stimulation by rosiglitazone will be analysed in those tissue samples.
