      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving
      chemotherapy and a monoclonal antibody before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving epirubicin and cyclophosphamide
      followed by docetaxel and trastuzumab works in treating women with HER2-positive stage IIIB,
      stage IIIC, or stage IV primary breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the pathological complete response in women with HER2-positive stage IIIB-IV
           breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide
           followed by docetaxel and trastuzumab (Herceptin®).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the recurrence-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide in weeks 1-3. Treatment with
      epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses. Patients
      then receive docetaxel in week 13 and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in weeks 13-15. Treatment with
      docetaxel and trastuzumab repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses.

      Patients then undergo appropriate surgery. After surgery, patients with hormone
      receptor-positive disease receive trastuzumab once weekly and either tamoxifen with or
      without a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist or an aromatase inhibitor. Treatment
      continues for 40 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
