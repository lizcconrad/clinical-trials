  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, an oral nutrition supplement has been developed that take into consideration:
      the nutritional requirements, treatment side-effects and taste preferences of head and neck
      cancer patients; the acceptance of a supplement when experiencing radiation therapy
      side-effects; and the taste preferences of head and neck cancer patients which may affect the
      supplement intake. We hope to increase dietary intake during the last 2 weeks of radiation
      therapy.
