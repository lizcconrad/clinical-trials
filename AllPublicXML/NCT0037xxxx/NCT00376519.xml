      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and total-body
      irradiation before a donor umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of
      cancer or abnormal cells and prepares the patient's bone marrow for the stem cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem
      cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer or
      abnormal cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T-regulatory
      cells before the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted cells
      from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine
      and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of umbilical cord
      blood T-regulatory cell infusion followed by donor umbilical cord blood transplant in
      treating patients with high-risk leukemia or other hematologic diseases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived CD4- and
           CD25-positive T-regulatory (Treg) cell infusion followed by double unrelated donor UCB
           transplantation in patients with high-risk leukemia or other hematologic diseases.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the speed of neutrophil and platelet recovery at day 42 in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of &quot;double chimerism&quot; (e.g., engraftment of both UCB units) at
           day 21 in these patients.

        -  Determine the risk of severe grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day
           100 in these patients.

        -  Determine the risk of chronic GVHD at 1 year post transplantation in these patients.

        -  Determine the probability of survival at 100 days and 1 year post transplantation in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of CD4- and CD25-positive umbilical
      cord blood (UCB)-derived T-regulatory cells (Treg).

        -  Preparative therapy: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1
           hour on days -9 to -7 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -8 and -7 (1 hour
           after fludarabine infusion). Patients then undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) twice
           daily on days -5 to -2.

        -  UCB-derived Treg infusion: Patients receive UCB-derived Treg cells IV on day -1.

        -  Double unrelated donor UCB transplantation: Patients undergo double unrelated donor UCB
           transplantation by IV infusion on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2
           hours or orally 2 or 3 times daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 100,
           followed by a taper to day 180, in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive
           mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) orally or IV twice daily on days -3 to 30 or 7 days after
           engraftment, whichever is later, in the absence of acute GVHD*. If no donor engraftment
           occurs, MMF may be continued at the discretion of the attending physician.

      NOTE: *If the patient has acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy, MMF may be stopped 7 days
      after GVHD is controlled (e.g., resolution of skin rash, vomiting, and diarrhea).

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCB-derived Treg cells until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicity within 48 hours of
      Treg cell infusion. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.
