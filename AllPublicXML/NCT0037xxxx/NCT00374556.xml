  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate the effects of a sleeping pill (eszopiclone,
      Lunesta)in patients with arthritis of the knee who also suffer from chronic insomnia. This
      study will test whether Lunesta improves sleep, pain sensitivity, and daytime symptoms in
      patients with knee pain.

    <description>The ISI is made up of 7 questions, each possible of earning a score of 0-4, making the total range 0-28, where 0 indicates no severity/no problem with sleep and therefore no insomnia, or 28, being very severe with the highest level of insomnia</description>

    <time_frame>Mean of baseline, 6 week follow-up and 12 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>PPTh:a somedic algometer's 1cm2 rubber probe was placed over muscle belly, with pressure increasing steadily at constant rate (30kPA/Sec), until subject indicated that s/he &quot;first felt pain.&quot; PPTh ratings were obtained on right brachioradialis &amp; right trapezius in a random order (average was taken from both areas at each time point). During each cold pressor task, participants immersed contralateral hand (left) up to wrist, in a circulating cold water bath maintained at 4°C. 20 seconds after commencing hand immersion, PPTh was re-assessed on either right brachioradialis or right trapezius (the same site as baseline assessment). After PPTh assessment, participants removed hands from water. DNIC was measured as the % change in PPTh during cold pressor, relative to baseline PPTh [i.e., (mean PPTh during cold pressor / mean PPTh prior to cold pressor)*100]. Increase in PPTh during cold pressor (i.e., percentage scores above 100) reflects normal functioning of pain-inhibitory processes.</description>

    <description>TS :maximum windup pain rating - first windup pain rating (0-100). Contact heat stimuli at non tissue damaging temperatures were delivered using computer driven, peltier-element-based stimulator (Medoc, TSA II), with a 9 cm2 probe applied to left forearm. In order to assess temporal summation, three sequences of 10 heat pulses each (with stimulus temperatures of 46 degrees C, 48 degrees C, and 50 degrees C, in random order) were applied to left dorsal forearm. The thermode remains in fixed position during administration of 10 heat pulses that constitute a sequence. Within each sequence, successive thermal pulses at a given temperature are delivered for a duration of approximately 0.5 sec each, with a 2.5-sec inter-pulse interval. The rate of rise &amp; fall of the thermode temp. is set at the device max .of 10 degrees C / S. Subjects verbally rate the perceived intensity of each thermal pulse on a 0-100 rating scale &amp; may terminate the procedure at any time.100=max tolerable intensity</description>

    <time_frame>Mean of baseline, 6 week follow-up and 12 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A Somedic algometer was used to assess pressure pain threshold (PPTh) similar to previous studies. The algometer's 1cm2 rubber probe was placed over the muscle belly, with the pressure increased steadily at a constant rate (30kPA/Sec), until the subject indicated that s/he &quot;first felt pain.&quot; PPTh was assessed 2 times each, bilaterally, at (in a randomized order) the masseter muscle trapezius muscle, and at the proximal third of the brachioradialis muscle (forearm). The scores from each location were averaged for each participant at that respective time point. The same site was never stimulated consecutively. At least 90 s were maintained between successive stimuli</description>

        <title>TST as Assessed by Actigraphy</title>
        <description>Subjects wore a Mini Mitter Actiwatch for two continuous weeks at each assessment periods to provide an objective index compared to the assessments made by daily sleep journal. Device is lightweight and worn on non-dominant wrist and contains and omni-directional accelerometer. The accelerometer records the occurrence and degree of motion with a minimal resultant force of .01g. Data are stored as activity counts within a specified epoch. TST recorded by device = total minutes spent asleep</description>

        <title>Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC) Index Scores</title>
        <description>PPTh:a somedic algometer’s 1cm2 rubber probe was placed over muscle belly, with pressure increasing steadily at constant rate (30kPA/Sec), until subject indicated that s/he “first felt pain.” PPTh ratings were obtained on right brachioradialis &amp; right trapezius in a random order (average was taken from both areas at each time point). During each cold pressor task, participants immersed contralateral hand (left) up to wrist, in a circulating cold water bath maintained at 4°C. 20 seconds after commencing hand immersion, PPTh was re-assessed on either right brachioradialis or right trapezius (the same site as baseline assessment). After PPTh assessment, participants removed hands from water. DNIC was measured as the % change in PPTh during cold pressor, relative to baseline PPTh [i.e., (mean PPTh during cold pressor / mean PPTh prior to cold pressor)*100]. Increase in PPTh during cold pressor (i.e., percentage scores above 100) reflects normal functioning of pain-inhibitory processes.</description>

Contact heat stimuli at non tissue damaging temperatures were delivered using computer driven, peltier-element-based stimulator (Medoc, TSA II), with a 9 cm2 probe applied to left forearm. In order to assess temporal summation, three sequences of 10 heat pulses each (with stimulus temperatures of 46 degrees C, 48 degrees C, and 50 degrees C, in random order) were applied to left dorsal forearm. The thermode remains in fixed position during administration of 10 heat pulses that constitute a sequence. Within each sequence, successive thermal pulses at a given temperature are delivered for a duration of approximately 0.5 sec each, with a 2.5-sec inter-pulse interval. The rate of rise &amp; fall of the thermode temp. is set at the device max .of 10 degrees C / S.

        <title>Heat Pain Threshold</title>
        <description>Contact heat stimuli at non tissue damaging temperatures were delivered using computer driven, peltier-element-based stimulator (Medoc, TSA II), with a 9 cm2 probe applied to the left forearm. The thermode was affixed snugly via Velcro straps to ensure even skin contact and repositioned to an adjacent site after each trial to minimize sensitizationHPTh was assessed on the left ventral forearm using an ascending method of limits paradigm; from a non-painful 32°C baseline, the temperature was steadily increased at 0.5°C/sec. Two trials of heat pain threshold were conducted. Averages of both trials are presented from respective time point below. Subjects push a button when the stimulus “first feels painful” The temperature (degrees Celsius) at the time button is pushed is automatically recorded.</description>

        <description>A Somedic algometer was used to assess pressure pain threshold (PPTh) similar to previous studies. The algometer’s 1cm2 rubber probe was placed over the muscle belly, with the pressure increased steadily at a constant rate (30kPA/Sec), until the subject indicated that s/he “first felt pain.” PPTh was assessed 2 times each, bilaterally, at (in a randomized order) the masseter muscle trapezius muscle, and at the proximal third of the brachioradialis muscle (forearm). The scores from each location were averaged for each participant at that respective time point. The same site was never stimulated consecutively. At least 90 s were maintained between successive stimuli</description>

          <description>The WOMAC is a quality of scale life made up of three domains, pain, stiffness, and disability which each comprising of 5, 2, and 7 questions, respectively. A VAS was used for each subscale. Disability was assessed on a VAS of 0-100, with 0 being absolutely no disability and 100 being maximum disability.</description>
