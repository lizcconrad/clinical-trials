  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol is a dose-finding and toxicity study in preparation of a randomised
      study comparing current standard treatment CSA/prednisolone with the new combination
      CSA/prednisolone/everolimus.

      The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of treatment with
      everolimus in combination with CSA/prednisolone in patients with aGVHD after allogeneic HSCT.
      This evaluation takes into account the following parameters:

        -  Feasibility of oral application everolimus

        -  Daily dose needed to reach the targeted plasma level everolimus

        -  Time to reach the targeted plasma level of everolimusSecondary objectivesThe study will
           evaluate the toxicity and safety of the treatment with ever-olimus/CSA/prednisolone with
           regard to

        -  Incidence and severity of treatment induced toxic events

        -  Incidence, severity and seriousness of adverse events

        -  Treatment induced morbidity

        -  Treatment induced 1-year-mortality Furthermore the study will collect data about

        -  Efficacy of everolimus/CSA/prednisolone on aGVHD

        -  Drug interactions between everolimus and CSA
