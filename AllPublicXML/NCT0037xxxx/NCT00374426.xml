      To study the effectiveness of sertraline (Zoloft) in treating depression in adults with
      diabetes. The study will also determine whether depressed diabetic patients who have
      successfully responded to sertraline (Zoloft) are more likely to have depression recur if the
      sertraline (Zoloft) is discontinued.

      Part A: Prevention of Depression Recurrence in Diabetes

        1. To determine the efficacy of maintenance antidepressant medication in preventing or
           delaying recur-rence of major depression in diabetes.

        2. To determine the relationship of sustained depression remission to social, occupational,
           and global func-tioning, and to quality of life and compliance with diabetes treatment.

        3. To determine clinical features predictive of depression recurrence in diabetes.

      Part B. Longitudinal Study of the Interrelationship of Glycemic Control and Depression

        1. To determine the effects of depression remission and recurrence on glycemic control.

        2. To determine the efficacy of maintenance antidepressant medication in producing
           sustained benefits in glycemic control.

        3. To determine the interrelationship of daily mood with blood glucose and the effect of
           maintenance treatment on this relationship.
