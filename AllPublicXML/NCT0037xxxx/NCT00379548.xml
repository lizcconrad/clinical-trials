  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that Asian Americans compared to Caucasians, will be at higher risk of
      developing a pro-inflammatory state that may contribute to the development of heart disease
      and diabetes when they change from a traditional Asian diet to a typical Western diet. These
      inflammatory responses will be reflected by the activation of monocytes as measured by
      protein kinase C (PKC), a known activator of monocytes.

      We also hypothesize that the changes of these inflammatory responses in the gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) will reflect similar changes of these markers in the plasma and
      monocytes.

      Specific aims:

        1. To compare the inflammatory responses (primarily PKC activation in monocytes), between
           Far-East Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans, when they change from a traditional
           Asian diet to a typical American diet.

        2. To correlate the biochemical changes of inflammatory responses in the plasma and
           monocytes with those in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF).
