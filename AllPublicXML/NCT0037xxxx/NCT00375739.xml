      The purpose of this study is to determine whether topical application of PEP005 is safe for
      the treatment of actinic keratoses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratoses (AK) is a common skin condition characterized by rough, scaly patches or
      sores on the top layer of the skin which if left untreated can progress to skin cancer.
      Current treatments can cause scarring and hypopigmentation, be inconvenient, or require long
      treatment duration. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of AK lesions is thus
      being researched.
