  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) has a negative effect on patientsâ€™ daily functioning. No
      study has so far investigated the effect of treatment related improvement in cognitive
      functions on health related quality-of-life (HRQOL). This study was carried out to determine
      the influence of treatment on psychomotor performance and on HRQOL in patients with MHE.

      The mean number of abnormal NP tests decreased significantly in patients in treated group
      compared with patients in untreated group MANOVA for time and treatment, P =.001). Mean total
      SIP score improved among patients in the treated group after 3 months compared with patients
      in untreated group after 3 months (MANOVA for time and treatment, P=.002). Improvement in
      HRQOL was related to the improvement in psychometry. In conclusion, treatment with lactulose
      improves both cognitive functions and HRQOL in cirrhotic patients with MHE.
