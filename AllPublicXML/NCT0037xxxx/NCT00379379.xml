  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to find out whether the hypoglycemic and improving insulin
      resistance effect will appear or not, when EA applying on specific acupoints of NIDDM
      patients.

      Some previous animal model studies reveal that electroacupuncture (EA) applying on specific
      acupoints, such as Zhongwan and Zusanli acupoint, can reduce plasma glucose levels and
      encourage insulin secretion, even improve insulin resistance. In this study, we want to
      observe these results on type II diabetic patients who have been diagnosed in five years
      under a study design of randomized control trial (RCT) to obtain evidence on clinical.

      We undertook a randomized, single blind and sham group controlled study to evaluate the
      effect of EA with a frequency in 15 Hz and fixed intensity (10 mA) on human Zusanli acupoint.
      A total of 26 newly diagnostic type II diabetic patients are enrolled in this study. They are
      randomly divided into 2 groups. There are 13 patients in the experimental group (EG) with EA
      treatment, and the other 13 patients are divided into control group (CG) with sham treatment.
      The main outcome is the changes of laboratory parameters between before and 30 minutes after
      the test.
