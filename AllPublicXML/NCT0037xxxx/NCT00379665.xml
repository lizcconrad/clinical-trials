  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in order to determine if intratumoral chemotherapy will be
      helpful in the palliation of endobronchial tumors when used in conjunction with endobronchial
      brachytherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injections of cisplatin are given in conjunction with the brachytherapy procedure. If the
      direct intratumoral injections result in a decrease in the endobronchial obstructed airways
      and if the therapy is well tolerated, there will be immediate clinical benefit to this
      minimally invasive method, the most obvious being an improved quality of life. Approximately
      2 mg cisplatin per cubic centimeter of tumor are injected into each tumor through a flexible
      bronchoscope. A total of four to six injections are administered one week apart. Response to
      therapy is assessed based on improvement in intraluminal obstruction by tumor, as assessed by
      endobronchial observation.
