    <textblock>
      This is two-part study (Phase I/Phase II). Part I is designed to find the optimal (best)
      doses of GW572016 and trastuzumab when given together,Part II is designed to evaluate the
      tumor response rate (shrinkage or lack of growth) in patients receiving lapatinib and
      trastuzumab.

    <description>Lapatinib:
A specified dose of lapatinib will be orally taken once daily, at least one hour before or one hour after the morning meal. Lapatinib should be taken at the same time of day wherever possible.
The starting dose of lapatinib should be 750 mg/day, which will be increased to 1000 mg/day (dose escalation group) according to the dose escalation criteria.
Trastuzumab:
Trastuzumab (4 mg/kg/day in the first week and 2 mg/kg/day for the 2nd and subsequent weeks) will be administered by intravenous infusion over at least 90 minutes immediately after administration of lapatinib. The fifth (Day 36) and subsequent doses may be administered up to 3 days after the scheduled date. In this case, however, the all following doses should be administered at one-week intervals.</description>
