    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that patients with vascular disease are undertreated for modifiable risk
      factors, leading to increased morbidity and mortality in this population.

      The objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive database that will demonstrate the
      current adequacy of risk factor management in this high risk population, and that will
      provide needed guidance for future treatment options.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients who attend the Vascular Surgery Clinic at Toronto General Hospital, St.
        Michael's Hospital, and St. Joseph's Health Centre who have PAD, cerebrovascular disease
        (CBVD), or aneurysms will be eligible for this study. Patients who are currently enrolled
        in other clinical studies are eligible for this study; however proper adherence to the
        other study will take precedence over of the current proposal.
