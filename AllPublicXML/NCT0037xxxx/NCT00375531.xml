      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to conduct a randomized pilot study on the
      efficacy of Mindfulness Meditation (MfM) on sleep in post war Iraqi/Afghanistan veterans with
      PTSD. It is hypothesized that the change in sleep (measured by actigraphy), sleep self report
      measures, and PTSD symptoms (measured by the PTSD Checklist) from baseline, 8 weeks and 12
      weeks will be greater for veterans with PTSD who are treated with MfM, controlling for
      pretreatment values and other clinical and demographic factors.

      A secondary objective will investigate whether there is an improvement in psychological
      wellness (measured by optimism, perceived wellness, and spirituality) following MfM
      treatments.

      It is hypothesized that change in optimism, perceived wellness, and spirituality from
      baseline, 8 weeks and 12 weeks will improve in veterans with PTSD who are treated with MfM,
      controlling for pretreatment values and other clinical and demographic factors. Physiological
      measures of actigraphy in the home will be done at baseline, eight weeks, and twelve weeks.
      Subjective measure of sleep include measurements of sleep and quality of life(FOSQ) and
      subjective sleep quality (PSQI). Other self-report measures that will examine psychological
      wellness include the Life Orientation Test (LOT), the Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS) and the
      Spirituality Assessment Scale (SAS).

      Research Design: This exploratory study is a randomized, controlled, repeated measures trial
      to estimate the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation (MfM) to improve the severity of PTSD
      symptoms, specifically sleep and anxiety, and to improve the psychological wellbeing in Iraqi
      veterans with PTSD. The study is a repeated measures, comparative study using a parallel
      design. Both groups will receive routine treatment for PTSD; in addition, the treatment group
      will receive 8 weeks (1.5 hours/week) of mindfulness meditation from a trained psychologist,
      (Co-PI, N Chychula) who has been conducting these mindfulness meditation groups with combat
      veterans for 3 years. Subjects will be asked to commit to practice mindfulness meditation
      practice for 45 minutes each day. Data will be collected at baseline, eight weeks, and twelve
      weeks (one month follow-up). An equal number of participants will be randomly assigned to
      each group with 15 assigned to each group.

      Methodology: For purposes of this pilot study, mindfulness meditation will be delivered in
      the context of a structured manual driven program, developed to enhance awareness of
      moment-to-moment experience of perceived mental processes. Although rooted in Buddhist
      traditions, this program is not religious but aims to create a greater awareness of body
      sensations, feelings and thoughts. This is thought to allow greater perception of one's
      responses and a gradual reduction in negative affect accompanied by an improvement in
      vitality and coping and psychological wellbeing (Grossman, 2004).
