  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy( IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Since the
      etiology of the disease is not clearly understood, no specific therapeutic strategies was
      defined for IgAN. Both ACEi/ARB and steroid was found to be effective in slowing the rate of
      disease progression, but the use of steroid was restricted because of its side effects.
      However, there is no evidence from RCT on the question of whether combined use of steroid
      with ACEi/ARB can bring more benefit to IgAN patients than ACEi/ARB alone. We therefore
      undertook a randomized, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of
      combined use of ACEi/ARB plus steroid compared with ACEi/ARB alone in the treatment of
      patients with IgAN.

      IgA nephropathy( IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Since the
      etiology of the disease is not clearly understood, no specific therapeutic strategies was
      defined for IgAN. In the many studies on the treatment of IgAN, both ACEi/ARB and steroid was
      found to be effective in slowing the rate of disease progression, but the use of steroid was
      restricted because of its side effects, and ACEi/ARB was considered to be the first line
      therapy. However, there is no evidence from RCT on the question of whether combined use of
      steroid with ACEi/ARB can bring more benefit to IgAN patients than ACEi/ARB alone. We
      therefore undertook a randomized, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety
      profile of combined use of ACEi/ARB plus steroid compared with ACEi/ARB alone in the
      treatment of patients with IgAN.
