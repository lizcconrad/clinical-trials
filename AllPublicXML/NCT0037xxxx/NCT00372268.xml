  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During laparoscopy, administration of cold and dry carbon dioxide (CO2) leads to hypothermia.
      Different types of gas conditioning have been studied in order to prevent this specific
      hypothermia. Intra-abdominal administration of local anesthetics has also been studied in
      order to prevent post-operative pain. In both cases, some results have been described.

      The investigators propose to evaluate in a prospective, randomized, double blind trial, the
      impact of 4 different types of conditioning of insufflated gas during laparoscopy for womb
      surgery on hypothermia prevention and post-operative pain. These 4 types of gas conditioning
      are:

        -  CO2 wet and cold with nebulized Nacl and direct intra-abdominal administration of Nacl

        -  CO2 wet and cold with nebulized ropivacaïne 0.75% and direct intra-abdominal
           administration of Nacl

        -  CO2 dry and cold with direct intra-abdominal administration of ropivacaïne 0.2%

        -  CO2 dry and cold with direct intra-abdominal administration of Nacl

      The investigators use a new device (Aeroneb® Pro [Aerogen® Company]) which can wet (by
      nebulization) the insufflated gas and therefore permits intraperitoneal medicament
      administration (local anesthetics).
