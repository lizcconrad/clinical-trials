  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combined
      treatment of Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) with Gemcitabine and radiotherapy in patients with
      localized unresectable pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer treatment is hampered by its resistance to both chemo and radiotherapy.
      Gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy has become one of the standard therapies for localized
      unresectable pancreatic cancer, but with poor responses and survival rates of less than 12
      months. Radiotherapy increases VEGF expression and activates the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway which
      may contribute to radioresistance, thus the addition of anti-angiogenic agents and/or Ras/ERK
      inhibitors could enhance radiation mediated cytotoxicity. Sorafenib is a novel dual-action
      Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGF-R2 and VEGF-R3) inhibitor
      targeting both angiogenic and Ras-Raf-1 signal transduction pathways. Based upon preliminary
      laboratory and clinical data Sorafenib holds promise for improving outcomes of therapy for
      patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      Polymorphisms in genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway (VEGF, VEGF-R2, HIF-1 and eNOS)
      may contribute to the process of angiogenesis, tumor behavior, and may explain the
      heterogeneity in efficacy (and toxicity) of agents whose major mechanism of action is
      blocking angiogenesis33-37. Proteomic analysis may also contribute to identify patterns of
      response or resistance to therapies, and potentially predict outcomes.

      Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI has been shown to be a useful pharmacodynamic marker of
      biological activity for anti-angiogenic agents38-40 and may also predict radiation
      therapy-induced vascular changes41. In vivo imaging of angiogenesis using DCE-MRI and the
      analysis of angiogenesis markers genetic polymorphisms may predict response and clinical
      benefit to therapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer patients. These biologic and
      pharmacodynamic endpoints will be analysed to correlate with the tumor activity seen.
