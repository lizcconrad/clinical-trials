      Our specific aims are:

        1. To examine the efficacy of GIFT in improving MST-related clinical outcomes in women
           veterans

        2. To examine the effects of GIFT on fronto-limbic brain function and

        3. To examine the effects of GIFT on levels of neuroactive steroid associated with PTSD.

      Guided imagery is a complementary and alternative treatment (CAM) modality. This directed
      meditation technique uses healing imagery to promote recovery in a variety of illnesses,
      including cancer, heart disease and, more recently, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      PTSD is a severe and disabling anxiety disorder. It is among the most common mental
      disorders, affecting 10% of women in the United States during their lifetime. Sexual assault
      is the most common cause of PTSD. Similarly, military sexual trauma (MST) is disturbingly
      common among women in the armed forces. At least 20% of women veterans using VA services
      report a history of sexual assault. Unfortunately, high rates of MST-related PTSD are
      anticipated among women currently deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.

      To address this issue, we will evaluate a guided imagery intervention for women veterans who
      have MST-related PTSD. We will evaluate the efficacy of Guided Imagery for Trauma (GIFT) in
      decreasing PTSD symptoms. Using brain-imaging techniques, this research will examine the
      effects of GIFT on brain function in the areas associated with PTSD. We will also examine the
      effects of GIFT on neurosteroids, which are candidate modulators of PTSD symptoms, and may
      also represent novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

    <description>Guided Imagery for Trauma (GIFT) - music and voice narration over a 12-week intervention. The control intervention included a relaxing music audio (the same music used in the guided imagery audio but without the narrative voiceover), PDA to log audio use, orientation and weekly phone consults, but did not have access to the patient advocate or to the guided imagery instructions provided on the GIFT audio.</description>
