      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to investigate
      the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of irofulven combined with oxaliplatin in patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

    <description>Oxaliplatin will be administered in a 2-hour infusion on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Starting dose 40 mg/m^2, dose escalation 50, 60, 70, and 80 mg/m^2 every 28 days if no dose-limiting toxicity.
Thirty minutes after completion of oxaliplatin infusion, irofulven will be administered in a 30-minute infusion on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Starting dose 0.30 mg/kg, dose escalation to 0.40 mg/kg every 28 days if no dose-limiting toxicity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent obtained prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures
             and treatment.

          2. Malignant solid tumor confirmed by a biopsy sample.

          3. Pancreatic, endometrial, gastric, and hepatocellular cancer patients that have
             exhausted standard treatment options.

          4. Measurable disease according to RECIST.

          5. 18 years of age or older.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS): 0-1.

          7. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          8. Previous anticancer treatment must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to first
             dose of study treatment (6 weeks for mitomycin C, 8 weeks for bicalutamide).

          9. Patients of reproductive age must be using effective contraceptive methods.

         10. Negative pregnancy test for patients of reproductive potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior therapy with irofulven or oxaliplatin.

          2. Patients who have had radiation therapy to more than 30% of the bone marrow prior to
             entry into the study.

          3. Prior chemotherapy with nitrosoureas or high dose carboplatin (AUC &gt; 6), prior
             mitomycin C cumulative dose greater than or equal to 25 mg/mÂ², prior bone marrow
             transplant or intensive chemotherapy with stem cell support.

          4. Presence of any serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study
             (e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, active infection).

          5. Any previous history of another malignancy (other than cured basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin or cured in-situ carcinoma of the cervix) within 5 years of study entry,
             unless the active malignancy can be unmistakably identified by evidence such as recent
             biopsies or tumor specific markers.

          6. Treatment with any other investigational agent, or participation in another clinical
             trial within 28 days prior to study entry.

          7. Pregnant or lactating patients or any patient with childbearing potential not using
             adequate contraception.

          8. Patients with retinopathy or significant visual impairment not correctable by
             refractory lens will be enrolled on a case by case basis according to the expected
             benefit ratio, taking into account the malignant disease and the existence of an
             objective decreased visual acuity and its degree.

        Please note: There are additional criteria that must be met in order to be eligible for
        this study.
