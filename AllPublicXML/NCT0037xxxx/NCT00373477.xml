  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will enable the investigators to conduct a randomized clinical trial to
      demonstrate the value of generalist care managers in the treatment of depression in Medicaid
      patients seen in primary health care practices. Depressed patients will be recruited at two
      primary care practices in Western North Carolina and randomly assigned to either generalist
      care management or usual care. Patients in each condition will be assessed at baseline and
      six months follow-up. Outcomes will include depressive symptoms, level of functioning, and
      cost-effectiveness measures.

      Randomized trial among depressed Medicaid patients aged 18 years and older in 2 primary care
      practices in Western NC comparing an intervention with a GCM to usual care (UC) between July
      2003 and February 2005. GCMs, already providing diabetes and asthma services, were further
      trained and given ongoing supervision to provide algorithmâ€“based depression care to enhance
      guideline concordant treatment. GCMs provided elements of self-management, decision support,
      use of information systems, and core care management components.
