    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety and effectiveness of a preventative vaccine for parvovirus
      B-19 infection. Eighty-nine healthy adults ages 18-49, whose blood tests negative for B-19,
      will be enrolled. Participants will be randomly chosen to receive 1 of 4 possible vaccine
      types: low dose of the vaccine and an adjuvant (substance which assists with transfer of
      medication to body); high dose of the vaccine alone; high dose of the vaccine and an
      adjuvant; or saline (substance containing no medication). Participants will receive 3
      vaccinations over a 6 month period and will be followed for 6 additional months. Blood
      samples will be taken at months 1, 2, 6, 7 and 12 to determine if antibody, protein produced
      by the body's immune system that recognizes and helps fight infections, has been formed to
      the vaccine. These tests measure vaccine efficacy, i.e., determine if the vaccine induces
      immunity. All participants will be followed closely for safety throughout the study.

      This study is a Phase I/II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the
      immunogenicity and safety of 2 dose levels of a recombinant human parvovirus B-19 vaccine
      (VAI-VP705). The vaccine is composed of viral capsids that incorporate 2 B-19 proteins (VP-1
      and VP-2). There will be 3 sites participating in this study: Cincinnati Children's Hospital
      Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Maryland School of
      Medicine. Eighty-nine parvovirus B-19 seronegative healthy adults 18-45 years old will be
      randomized to 1 of 4 groups: 2.5 mcg VAI-VP705 with the adjuvant MF59, 25 mcg with the
      adjuvant MF59, 25 mcg without the adjuvant MF59, or placebo (saline control). Each
      participant will receive 3 separate vaccinations (Months 0, 1, and 6) and will continue in
      the study for up to approximately 14 months. Study participants will be followed to evaluate
      safety and immune response. The primary study objective is to evaluate the safety of
      VAI-VP705 administered with and without MF59 adjuvant in healthy parvovirus B-19 seronegative
      adults. The secondary study objectives are to: evaluate the immunogenicity of primary and
      booster immunizations of 25 mcg of VAI VP705 with and without MF59 and 2.5 mcg with MF59;
      compare the antibody response of vaccine administered with MF59 at each of 2 doses, 2.5 and
      25 mcg versus 25 mcg of vaccine administered without MF59; and evaluate the duration of the
      immune response 12 months after primary immunization. The primary endpoint is the number and
      percentage of study participants who experience any vaccine-associated adverse events or
      serious adverse events. The secondary endpoints include: the percentage of study participants
      who develop neutralizing antibody responses against parvovirus B-19 28 days following the
      last dose of vaccine; the percentage of study participants who maintain a neutralizing
      antibody titer at 12 months after primary immunization; the geometric mean antibody titers
      (as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) by treatment group at 28 days and at 12
      months after primary immunization; and the geometric mean neutralizing titers per treatment
      group at 28 days and at 12 months after primary immunization.
