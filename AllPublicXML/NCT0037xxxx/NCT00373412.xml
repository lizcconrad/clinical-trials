  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives of this trial are to:

      Evaluate the kinetics and magnitude of the CMV-specific immune response post-Towne challenge
      (3000 pfu) in healthy CMV-seronegative volunteers who receive VCL CT02 administered (1 mg
      weekly x 3) 3 months previously compared to randomized controls who do not receive VCL CT02
      as measured by:

        1. antibody titers for gB;

        2. T-cell IFN-g ELISPOT;

        3. T-cell proliferation assays for IE1, pp65, and/or gB; and

        4. cytokine and phenotypic flow cytometry responses to pp65, IE1, and/or gB.

      Evaluate the safety safety of Towne challenge in healthy CMV-seronegative adult subjects who
      have previously been immunized with a trivalent pDNA CMV vaccine (VCL-CT02) administered
      intramuscularly.

      Our hypothesis is that the immune response to Towne vaccine 3000 pfu challenge after VLC-CT02
      priming will be greater than that after Towne vaccination alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, open-label trial of the live, attenuated Towne
      CMV vaccine administered as a &quot;challenge&quot; to healthy, CMV-seronegative, adult subjects who
      previously receive the CMV immunotherapeutic trivalent pDNA-based vaccine, VCL-CT02, given by
      intramuscular route at Days 1, 7 and 14 or who receive no VCL-CT02.

      Up to 12 healthy, CMV-seronegative subjects will be enrolled. If a subject consents and meets
      all eligibility criteria, the subject will be randomized to the VCL CT02 (N=6)or control
      (N=6) groups. VCL CT02-assigned subjects will receive VCL CT02 (1 mg weekly x 3) and then on
      Day 77 will received Towne vacine (3000 pfu subcutaneously). Control-assigned subjects will
      receive Towne alone. Safety will be monitored and both antibody to CMV gB and T-cell
      responses to CMV antigens will be measured at specified intervals for 252 days post Towne
      challenge.
