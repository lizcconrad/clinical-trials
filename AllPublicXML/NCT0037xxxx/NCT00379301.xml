  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF)—the most common heart condition in
      the US—where the upper chambers of the heart beat very fast and in a disorganized manner.
      This can be felt as palpitations, tiredness, shortness of breath and passing out, plus can
      lead to stroke, damage to the heart muscle and a shorter life span. Study participants will
      receive a common treatment for atrial fibrillation called radiofrequency ablation (RFA),
      where small lesions or &quot;burns&quot; are made inside the heart to cut off the abnormal impulses
      that cause AF. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three different
      common ablation strategies in patients with persistent or permanent AF. Subjects will be
      randomized (like drawing straws) to be treated with one of the three strategies to see if
      there is a difference in how well atrial fibrillation is controlled after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most cases, AF originates where the pulmonary veins (PV) enter the left upper chamber of
      the heart, known as the left atrium (LA). Common to the procedure in each arm of the study is
      pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) or ablation of tissue around the pulmonary vein entrances.
      After PVI, the procedure continues with ablation in other areas of the LA where similar
      abnormal impulses are found. The three strategies for continuing with ablation after PVI are
      described in the &quot;Arms&quot; section below.
