  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives of this trial are to:

        1. Evaluate the kinetics and magnitude of the CMV-specific immune response post-Towne
           challenge (3000 pfu) in healthy CMV-seronegative volunteers who received VCL CT02
           administered ID or IM 9 to 15 months previously as measured by: 1) ELISA and/or
           virus-neutralizing antibody titers for gB; 2) T-cell IFN-g ELISPOT; 3) T-cell
           proliferation assays (CFSE) for IE1, pp65, and/or gB; and possibly 4) cytokine and
           phenotypic flow cytometry responses to pp65, IE1, and/or gB.

        2. Evaluate the safety safety of Towne challenge in healthy CMV-seronegative adult subjects
           who have previously been immunized with a trivalent pDNA CMV vaccine (VCL-CT02)
           administered intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID).

      Our hypothesis is that the immune response to Towne vaccine 3000 pfu challenge after VLC-CT02
      priming will be greater than that after Towne vaccination alone (concurrent controls will be
      administered Towne alone in a concurrent, companion trial).

      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label trial of the live, attenuated Towne CMV vaccine
      administered as a “challenge” to healthy, CMV-seronegative, adult subjects who previously
      received the CMV immunotherapeutic trivalent pDNA-based vaccine, VCL-CT02, given by
      intradermal or intramuscular routes as described in the following table; these subjects have
      been followed for 32 weeks.

      Table 6.1 Subject Distribution Group Formulation Dosing Regimen (day) Dose per
      Injection(Administered to the deltoid region) Route of Administration Number of Subjects

        1. VCL-CT02 0, 28, 56 1.0 mg Intramuscular (IM) 6

        2. VCL-CT02 0, 28, 56 100 μg/injection × 2 injections Intradermal (ID) 11 Total 17

      Up to 10 subjects from Groups 1 and 2 will be approached for enrollment in the current
      protocol. If a subject consents and meets all eligibility criteria, the subject will receive
      Towne (3000 pfu subcutaneously) between 9 and 15 months after the subject’s first dose of
      VCL-CT02. Safety will be monitored and Both antibody to CMV gB and T-cell responses to CMV
      antigens will be measured at specified intervals for 252 days post Towne challenge.
