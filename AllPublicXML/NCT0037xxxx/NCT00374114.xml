  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonic surgical aspiration of the cervix may be an effective method of treating cervical
      dysplasia without compromising the integrity of the cervix in reproductive age women.

    <textblock>
      Women age 18 to 55 years of age with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2 or 3 on colposcopy
      with a negative EndoCervical Curettage are enrolled in a pilot study comparing ultrasonic
      surgical aspiration and traditional cervical excision procedure for the treatment of cervical
      dysplasia. In this pilot study, the patients serve as their own control group. Prior to
      receiving the traditional treatment for cervical dysplasia consisting of Cold Knife
      Conization with EndoCervical Curettage, each patient's cervix is treated with ultrasonic
      surgical aspiration. The aspirate is sent to pathology and the results compared with the
      findings from the cervical cone biopsy. The patients then are followed with Liquid-based
      Cytology pap smears every 4 to 6 months until completion of the study enrollment/treatment
      period.
