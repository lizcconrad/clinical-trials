  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the bortezomib,
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
      We are looking for the highest dose of the combination that can be given safely and see how
      well it works as a combination in newly diagnosed patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The safe dose of dexamethasone is already known. The dose of bortezomib and lenalidomide
           will be increased during the study until the best and safest amount (or dose) is
           identified. The participant's dose of the study drugs will depend on when they enter the
           study.

        -  In this study each cycle will be 21 days and participants will begin the study
           medication in the clinic on Cycle 1 Day 1. Lenalidomide (capsules) will be taken daily
           for the first 2 weeks only (Day 1-14). Dexamethasone (tablets) will be taken on Day 1,
           2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12. Bortezomib will be given intravenously in the outpatient
           treatment clinic on Day 1, 4, 8 and 11. The third week is a rest period and no study
           medication will be given.

        -  During the course of the study treatment, tests and procedures will be performed at
           designated time periods. This includes; medical history updates, physical/neurological
           examinations, skeletal survey (x-rays or scan), blood samples, optional bone marrow
           aspiration/tissue biopsy, urine samples, 12-lead ECG, and MRI/CT scan (if needed).

        -  It is expected that study participants will receive study treatment for 8 cycles (168
           days). If the participant completes the first 8 cycles of the study, has stable or
           responding disease and has not experienced bad side effects, they will be allowed to
           continue treatment on a maintenance schedule, detailed in the protocol, at the study
           doctor's discretion.
