  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes is the most common life-long disorder with onset in childhood. Patients need
      insulin injections, blood sugar monitoring several times each day, and adhere to a strict
      diet. Adequate control of blood glucose is essential to prevent long term kidney and eye
      complications that result in kidney failure and blindness. Adolescence is a time when
      diabetes is difficult to control, due in part to high growth hormone levels causing insulin
      resistance ( a state where the body does not respond as strongly to insulin). This study will
      test whether treatment with rosiglitazone (an oral medication used frequently in type 2
      diabetes) will reduce the insulin resistance of adolescence and improve the control of type 1
      diabetes during puberty.
