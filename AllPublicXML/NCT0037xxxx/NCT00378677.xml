  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether dry powder inhalation of Cyclosporine A
      is beneficial in lung transplant patients with Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome. For
      patients suffering from this syndrome often no therapeutic options are available.
      Furthermore, the side effects of the maintenance therapy leaves no room for dose increments.
      The hypothesis for this trial is that when Cyclosporine A is administered locally (in the
      lungs) chronic rejection can be treated more effectively without extra systemic side effects.

      Because calcineurin inhibitors are not completely effective in a full prevention of acute
      rejection and the corresponding chronic disfunction of the transplanted organ (Bronchiolitis
      Obliterans Syndrome, BOS) a rejection risc remains. To effectively treat BOS high doses of
      calcineurin inhibitors are necessary. On the other hand these high doses lead te serious side
      effects. The search for a balance between effectiveness and side effects leads to dose
      adjustments. Ultimately, chronic rejection is unstoppable.

      In order to treat chronic rejection higher doses of calcineurin inhibitors are not a
      therapeutic option. The only option to reach a high dose in the target organ without extra
      systemic side effects would be inhalation. Indeed, this has been extensively investigated at
      the University of Pittsburgh (lead investigator Iacono).

      The intervention in the Pittsburgh trials existed of nebulization of Cyclosporine in
      propylene glycol with pretreatment of nebulization of lidocaine/albuterol in order to make
      the inhalation tolerable.

      The investigational drug in this trial consists of dry powder inhalation of a sugar-glass
      based solid dispersion containing cyclosporine A. The effectiveness is measured by comparing
      the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) before and after the intervention.
