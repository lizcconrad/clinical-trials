      The Xolair® Pregnancy Registry is an observational study established by Genentech to obtain
      data on pregnancy outcomes in women who are exposed to Xolair®. Women exposed to at least one
      dose of Xolair® within 8 weeks prior to conception or at any time during their pregnancy will
      be followed to completion of their pregnancies. The evaluation of infants will be conducted
      at birth and at 6-month intervals until the infants are 12 months old. Follow-up of the
      infant will be extended until the infant is 18 months old, if the woman continues Xolair®
      treatment while breastfeeding.

        Women exposed to at least one dose of Xolair® within 8 weeks prior to conception or at any
        time during their pregnancy. Enrollment in the Xolair® Pregnancy Registry is voluntary and
        must be initiated by the pregnant woman. A healthcare provider cannot enroll a patient but
        can suggest that the pregnant woman call the Registry Center to enroll herself.
