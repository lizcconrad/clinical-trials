  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we are trying to compare the safety and financial benefit of starting the
      realimentation early versus conventional oral intake following the Cesarean surgery in Iran.

      Cesarean delivery is announced to constitute 50% of deliveries in the Capital and 39% of all
      the deliveries nationwide, which is far beyond the acceptable international normal range,
      according to the official site of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic
      Republic of Iran [http://www.mohme.gov.ir/HNDC/Indicators/Simaye_Salamt/Simaye_Salamat.htm].
      This high rate of elective cesarean deliveries might be due to several reasons which are far
      beyond the scope of this study. Here we tried to see whether the reduction in the time of
      hospitalization for these patients is safe at the expense of earlier oral realimentation and
      to see whether this strategy increases the patients' satisfaction or not.
