      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectivity and the safety of bortezomib in
      patients with disseminated MALT lymphoma or at relapse following HP-eradication, or
      chemotherapy or radiation.

      It is a phase II prospective single arm study with a target sample of 16 patients. 1.5mg/m2
      Bortezomib is given intravenously on day 1,4,8,11 every three week, for a maximum of 8cycles.
