    <textblock>
      This study compares two blood thinners which are both accepted standard cares, fondaparinux
      and unfractionated heparin (UFH). These drugs are used to prevent the growth of existing
      blood clots and formation of additional blood clots in patients with pulmonary embolism (a
      blood clot in the lung) as they are beginning to take warfarin (another standard care blood
      thinner). Patients will be invited to participate because they have been diagnosed with a
      pulmonary embolism, require anticoagulation therapy (treatment with a blood thinner), and are
      currently hospitalized.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients treated with fondaparinux will have
      shorter hospital stays and lower costs of treatment while in the hospital than similar
      patients receiving a different standard care with UFH. Fondaparinux is already approved by
      the FDA for use in patients with pulmonary embolism, for both inpatient and outpatient care,
      as long as treatment is begun with warfarin while they are hospitalized. It is therefore not
      an experimental treatment. The study is being conducted to determine which FDA approved
      treatment is the best practice for hospital treatment of pulmonary embolism. The study will
      also examine the safety and effectiveness of fondaparinux in local use.

      Research Question

      This study is being conducted to determine if treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) with
      fondaparinux will decrease the length of stay and hospital costs of therapy while maintaining
      safety and efficacy, when compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH). Primary research
      questions: Determine if PE treatment utilizing fondaparinux will reduce the inpatient length
      of stay (LOS) and costs of hospital care to St. Mary's Duluth Clinic Health System (SMDC),
      when compared to a matched group of patients treated with UFH as standard care, during the
      same time period. Secondary research questions: Determine if bleeding and recurrent
      thrombosis rates are similar between the fondaparinux cohort and the UFH matched control
      group.

      Specific Aims

        1. Enroll 30 St. Mary's Medical Center (SMMC, an affiliate of SMDC) patients into the
           treatment cohort, utilizing fondaparinux as their primary immediate antithrombin
           therapy, while warfarin is being titrated to therapeutic effect.

        2. Retrospectively identify a matched control group of 30 PE patients, treated with UFH as
           standard care, during the same period of time.

        3. Determine the LOS and costs of inpatient care on a standardized scale for both the
           treatment cohort and the control group.

        4. Perform a retrospective review of patients' medical records for the 3 months after the
           initial pulmonary embolism, to determine the rates of:

      4a. repeat venous thromboembolism events (VTE) 4b. bleeding events

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients 18 years of age or older who present with acute symptomatic pulmonary
             embolism and who require antithrombotic therapy

          2. Diagnostic confirmation based on the following criteria

               1. intraluminal filling defect on spiral computed tomography (CT) or pulmonary
                  angiography

               2. a high-probability ventilation-perfusion lung scan, or a nondiagnostic lung scan
                  with documentation of deep-vein thrombosis, either by compression ultrasonography
                  or by venography.

          3. Primary outpatient MD of record is an SMDC MD or patient did not have an outpatient MD
             when this event occurred.

          4. For the matched control (UFH) cohort only: unfractionated heparin utilized for initial
