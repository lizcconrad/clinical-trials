        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or greater.

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven non-small cell lung cancer that is either
             metastatic or recurrent and failed at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic
             regimen.

          -  Patients who have recurred after previous surgery and/or radiation may participate in
             this trial.

          -  Patients may have had prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are eligible for this clinical trial if their
             disease has been treated and they are clinically stable and documented by a stable or
             improved pretreatment CT or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for CNS disease within
             28 days prior to registration.

          -  Measurable OR non-measurable disease documented by CT, MRI, X-ray or nuclear exam
             (FDG-PET). Measurable or non-measurable disease must be present outside the area of
             surgical resection. Pleural effusions, ascites and laboratory parameters are not
             acceptable as the only evidence of disease.

          -  Progression after at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

          -  Greater than 3 weeks since surgery and must have recovered from all associated
             toxicities at time of registration.

          -  ANC ≥ 1,500/µl and platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl obtained within 28 days prior to
             registration.

          -  Adequate hepatic function documented by a serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times institutional
             upper limit of normal and liver enzymes (SGOT or SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x the institutional upper
             limit of normal obtained within 28 days prior to registration.

          -  Patients requiring lung radiation must have an FEV1 of &gt; 1000 liters obtained within
             28 days prior to registration and must have pulmonary function tests with DLCO.

          -  Zubrod Performance Status of 0,1 or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior single-agent, weekly Docetaxel chemotherapy.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 1.

          -  Prior malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer
             from which the patient is currently in complete remission or other cancer from which
             the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.
