  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased insulin sensitivity is and independent risk factor for stroke despite glycemic
      control. It is known that physical exercise increases insulin sensitivity in healthy
      subjects. Wether stroke patients can increase insulin sensitivity via physical exercise is
      not known.

      Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Physical
      exercise has shown to increase IL-6 directly after exercise in untrained subjects. When
      fitness is increased in each subject then the peak IL-6 concentration after exercise
      decreases and so does the basal level of IL-6. It is not known whether stroke patients can
      increase physical activity level to a degree where chronic inflammation are decreased.

      This study is designed to evaluate if physical exercise after stroke will increases insulin
      sensitivity and reduce low-grade chronic inflammation.

      Stroke patients have been randomized to intervention with physical exercise or control in the
      ExStroke pilot trial and followed for 2 years. Using the study population from the ExStroke
      pilot trail blood samples will be obtained at the last control. Insulin sensitivity can be
      measured from fasting glucose and insulin using the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA).
      Interleukin-6, TNF-alfa and CRP is measured to estimate chronic inflammation.
