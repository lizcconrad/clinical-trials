    <textblock>
      Early promising data are published focusing on the role of manual thrombus aspiration devices
      in patients with ST segment elevation (STEMI).

      The aim of our single center randomized study is to evaluate the early and late effect of
      thrombus aspiration device (AD) after every stage during Primary PCI in the set-up of STEMI
      population.

      Our hypothysis is that preforming thrombus aspiration after every stage of primary PCI may
      give early and late advantages compared to the standard primary PCI technique.

      ADMIT-Randomized Single Center Study with two arms:

      Standard PCI versus Primary PCI, using thrombus aspiration device after ever step of the
      procedure.

      Issues to be examined are:

        1. Immediate angiographic differences between the study arms. By evaluation of: TIMI FLOW
           GRADE,TIMI FRAME COUNT,MYOCARDIAL BLUSH GRADE. No reflow phenomenae,

        2. Infarc size evaluated by serum markers and non invasive parameters

        3. In hospital major adverse cardiac events

        4. Major adverse cardiac events during 30&amp; 180 days of follow up
