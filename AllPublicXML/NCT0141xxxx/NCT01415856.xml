  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Torino II device, which emits a pulsed
      electromagnetic field), will help to decrease pain and swelling after knee replacement
      surgery, and thereby decrease the use of narcotic medications after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a research study to determine if the Torino II, a pulsed
      electromagnetic fields (PEMF) device is helpful in reducing postoperative pain and swelling
      after total knee replacement surgery. Postoperative pain and swelling may cause discomfort
      that may directly influence functional recovery after surgery. By reducing pain and swelling
      immediately following surgery,the use of high doses of narcotic, NSAID, and Tyelenol pain
      killers can be reduced, and possibly avoided. Recovery can be maximized, as well.

      The PEMF device that is being used (the Torino II) is distributed by Ivivi Health Sciences,
      and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of pain and swelling following surgery.
      The device is non-invasive, and is fixed onto the outside of the dressing with Velcro straps.
      The device will give off electromagnetic pulses to target pain relief in the knee. PEMF
      devices have been in clinical use for decades, and to date, no reported side effects have
      occurred.

      It is important to note that treatment will still follow the standard Meritus Medical Center
      protocol for knee replacement surgery. This includes pain medication, icing, and physical
      therapy. This standard protocol will be followed no matter what study group patients are
      assigned to. Participation in this study or lack thereof will not change the treatment
      protocol.
