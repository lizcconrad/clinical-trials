      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of 12 weeks of daily supplementation with
      Superba(TM) Krill Oil on fasting serum triglyceride levels and omega-3 index in subjects
      whose habitual fatty fish and seafood intake is low and who have borderline high or high
      fasting serum triglyceride levels.
