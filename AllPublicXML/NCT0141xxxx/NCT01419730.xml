    <textblock>
      This research will examine the effectiveness of vitamin D or placebo (the placebo is a tablet
      that looks like Vitamin D study drug, but has no Vitamin D study drug in it), with and
      without physical activity (walking and progressive resistance exercise), in treating bone
      loss in women who have undergone treatment for breast cancer. The investigators would also
      like to find out if the physical activity program improves cardiovascular fitness, energy
      expenditure, muscular strength, muscle mass, and balance. One hundred five (105) subjects are
      expected to take part in this study. The investigators don't know if bone loss in breast
      cancer survivors should be treated differently than bone loss in other women.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be female and have a primary diagnosis of Stage I, II, or III hormone-receptor
             positive breast cancer.

          -  Women must be postmenopausal at time of enrollment.

          -  Must provide informed consent.

          -  Must be willing to discontinue use of calcium and/or vitamin D supplements.

          -  Participants must have an ionized serum calcium level within normal limits
             (1.19-1.29mmol/L) and a total corrected serum calcium of &lt; 10.6 mg/dl.

          -  Participants must be slightly vitamin D deficient (serum vitamin D level &lt;32ng/ml)

          -  Must have a functional capacity rating of ≤ 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology

          -  Must have the approval of their treating physician (or physician's nurse practitioner
