  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the use of extended release niacin/laropiprant (ERN/LRPT) combination
      tablets in a primary prevention population currently not taking or eligible for
      lipid-modifying therapy (LMT); the population will comprise participants with low to moderate
      risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at or below goal level, and normal or mildly elevated
      triglyceride (TG) levels.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    In HPS2-THRIVE, MK-0524A did not meet the primary efficacy objective and there was a
    significant increase in incidence of some types of non-fatal SAEs
