  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if small proteins found on the surface of myeloma
      cells (called CXCR4 and CD47) or inside the myeloma cells (Pim kinases, sphingolipids, and
      pS6) can predict how patients will respond to chemotherapy-treatment and if a small molecule
      inside the myeloma cells (called Pim kinase) can be used as a treatment target for myeloma. A
      sample from the bone marrow biopsy (a small amount of tissue removed from the body for
      laboratory testing) and aspirate (a small amount of fluid is removed from the body for
      laboratory testing) that had been done before the subject entered this study will be provided
      for research purposes. Based on preliminary data, it is hypothesized that CXCR4, CD47,
      sphingolipids, and Pim kinases could be used as prognostic/predictive markers and that Pim
      kinase inhibitors provide a new agent for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

    <description>Our Aim 1 is to perform a corrective study to measure the expression levels of CXCR4, CD47, and pS6 by flow cytometry in myeloma patient's marrow aspirate and correlate their expression level with patients' treatment responses</description>

    <measure>Determine if Pim kinase inhibitors or sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitors will inhibit patients' myeloma cells</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Our aim 2 involves only in vitro cell culture system and in vivo animal models. We will measure the efficacy of Pim kinase inhibitors in inhibiting patients' myeloma cell growth in vitro using cell culture system. We will also determine the efficacy of Pim kinase inhibitors and sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitors in inhibiting tumor growth of patients' myeloma cells in animal models. We will measure the tumor size in animal models. Our Aim 2 does not involve any measurement of human myeloma patients. Therefore, measures of safety, tolerability etc in patients are not applicable.</description>

      The patients will not have bone marrow biopsy or aspirate solely for this study. When the
      patients undergo routine bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for the purpose of initial
      diagnosis, followup or restaging, they will be asked and consented for participation in the
      study. The patient will then be treated with standard chemotherapy including
      Bortezomib-based, Revlimid-based, Thalidomide-based chemoregimen. The bone marrow aspirate
      from patients who consent to be in the study will be stained for CXCR4, CD47, pS6, in
      addition to standard study flow cytometry panel for multiple myeloma. The staining and flow
      cytometry analysis will be performed at the Clinical Flow Cytometry Facility (Director: Dr.
      Sally Self) according to the standard flow cytometry procedure. Sphingolipid gene expression
      levels will be measured. A small aliquot may be sent to collaborators in Genentech Corp for
      measurement of pS6 and Pim kinase expression. The sample information will be de-identified.
