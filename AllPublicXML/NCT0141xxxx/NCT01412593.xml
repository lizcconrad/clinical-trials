  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver disease is a common medical problem in Saudi Arabia. Early studies indicated that
      around 10% of the Saudi population is either infected with hepatitis B or C. An estimated 12%
      of chronic HCV and HBV patients undergoing liver biopsy from Saudi centers have cirrhosis. Of
      these 3-5% would decompensate yearly thereby requiring liver transplantation. Based on the
      most recent national census figures, and a 1-2% prevalence rate of HBV and HCV nationwide, an
      estimated 1,000 patients would require liver transplantation on a yearly basis for
      decompensated cirrhosis.

      Liver transplantation is the only available life saving treatment for patients with end stage
      liver disease. Unfortunately less than 100 liver transplantations are performed in Saudi
      Arabia in three centers. Around 100 other patients travel abroad for transplantation annually
      while all other patients progressively deteriorate and eventually die from the complications
      of decompensated liver cirrhosis.

      In addition, even in patients who are listed for liver transplantation, often patients are
      too sick to wait on the transplant list that often takes more than a year and the on-list
      mortality is high. A procedure or an intervention that may help to stabilize liver function
      in order to help patients survive on the transplant list while awaiting liver transplantation
      would be of immense benefit. Examples of such interventions are already approved and used in
      some centers like the MARS system.

    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention arm will be admitted to the Liver Care Unit. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 300mcg/mL) will be administered for 1 day as a single daily subcutaneous dose. This dose is sufficient to induce 10 folds enrichment for bone marrow cells.</description>
