      Objective: Studies documenting the prevalence of delirium among critically ill children are
      still rare. Emerging literature from psychiatric specialists reports the prevalence of
      delirium to be approximately 10% in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This is likely
      to be an underestimation of the true prevalence, as demonstrated in early adult delirium
      literature, especially given the absence of validated bedside tools to diagnose delirium in
      the PICU.

      The primary aim of this study is to validate the German version of the Pediatric Confusion
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (pCAM-ICU). The secondary aim of the study is
      to compare validity and reliability of the pCAM-ICU and the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence
      Delirium (PAED) Scale.
