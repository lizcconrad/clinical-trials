  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The daily removal of supragingival dental plaque is a major factor in the prevention of
      caries, gingivitis and periodontitis. Proper control of bacterial plaque is obtained through
      the mechanical removal of the biofilm by the proper use of the toothbrush and floss. However,
      some studies have shown that the mean time of brushing tooth surfaces is less than that
      required to obtain a proper cleaning 1 and only 2-10% of the patients use dental floss
      regularly and effectively 2. In addition, it has been demonstrated that even after education
      and motivation of the patient to the proper use of toothbrush and floss, its compliance is
      reduced with time 3. The result is the persistence of plaque in some areas, particularly on
      the interproximal surfaces of teeth. Many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and
      usefulness of antiseptic mouthwashes containing active ingredients such as chlorhexidine
      (CHX) and essential oils (EO) to prevent and control the formation of plaque and gingivitis,
      when used in addition to mechanical procedures 4-7. Chlorhexidine is still the gold standard
      for its antimicrobial action and high substantiveness, but side effects, such as
      pigmentation, taste alteration and the formation of supragingival calculus limit its
      continued use 8. Essential oil (EO) mouthwashes have been used for years as an adjunct to
      brushing in addressing oral hygiene. Their effectiveness in controlling plaque and gingivitis
      are well documented in literature 9-14. They kill microorganisms by destroying their cell
      walls and inhibiting their enzymatic activity 15,16. Furthermore, phenolic compounds like EOs
      are known to interfere with the inflammation process 17,18. The antibacterial action is
      particularly effective for the ability of the mouthwash with EOs to penetrate the biofilm
      19-21. The traditional EO mouthwashes contain ethanol, a chemical used to dissolve numerous
      substances in mouthwashes, including CHX. The concentration of ethanol present in the
      mouthwash with EOs is more than 20%, sufficient to dissolve the EOs but not enough to carry
      out a direct antibacterial effect 22,23. Many aspects against the use of alcohol in
      mouthwashes, such as its effects on the surfaces of composite restorations 24 and its
      possible role in the formation of oropharyngeal cancer are being discussed 25,26. Although a
      direct correlation of the cause and effect between the occurrence of oropharyngeal cancer and
      the use of mouthwashes with alcohol 27, has not demonstrated so far, it is considered
      desirable to eliminate ethanol for use in daily mouthwash, bringing in search of new
      formulations. Recently, an EOs containing mouthwash without alcohol was introduced on the
      European market (Daycare, Curaden, Kriens, and Suisse). To our knowledge, to date there are
      no published data on the effectiveness of this antimicrobial product. The rinsing with this
      mouthwash can cause fewer side effects but, in contrast, it may be less effective.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory properties of a new alcohol free EO
      containing mouthwash with respect to the traditional mouthwash containing 21.3% ethanol,
      through a standard 3-days plaque regrowth model.
