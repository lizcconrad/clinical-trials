  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute mountain sickness is a common ailment in people venturing over 2500 m altitude.
      Pilgrims to high altitudes are at an added risk since they are unaware and they gain height
      faster than the recommendations. Acetazolamide is the standard treatment and prophylaxis of
      acute mountain sickness. There are no randomized controlled trials that have studied
      protective effects of Acetazolamide in rapid ascent, and there are few conflicting studies
      regarding this matter.

      This study is a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial of Acetazolamide versus
      placebo in 380 healthy individuals travelling to Gosaikunda Lake of Nepal in rates of ascent
      that are faster than the recommendations. Acetazolamide 125 mg twice daily and a placebo will
      be randomly assigned for 3 days and participants will be assessed at 3 stations.

      This study will undertake to establish the role of Acetazolamide in Rapid Ascent and will be
      the first RCT done in this issue.

      The investigators hypothesize that Acetazolamide 125mg twice daily given before rapid ascent
      to high altitude in Nepalese pilgrims will not be superior to placebo in decreasing both the
      incidence and severity of acute mountain sickness.
