      proportional systemic gabapentin exposure over a wide dose range. This is a double-blind,
      placebo-and active-controlled 3-period crossover study designed to assess the effect of GEn
      600 mg on simulated driving performance. Subjects will receive each of 3 treatments in a
      randomized order: GEn 600 mg, placebo and placebo/diphenhydramine 50 mg. Each treatment
      period will consist of 6 days, with subjects being dosed at approximately 5 pm on each dosing
      day. The placebo /diphenhydramine treatment will consist of placebo on Days 1-4 and 6 and 50
      mg diphenhydramine on Day 5. Placebo will be administered on Day 6 in all treatment periods
      to ensure washout of drug prior to the start of the next treatment period. Simulated driving
      performance will be assessed at baseline (prior to randomization) and on Day 5 in the evening
      (7-9 pm) and on Day 6 between7-9 am and between 11am-1pm for each treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. A subject
             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for
             the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK
             Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation at least 6 months
             previously or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section
             8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.Child-bearing potential and
             agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 for an
             appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior
             to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.
             Female subjects must agree to use contraception until the follow-up visit is
             completed.

             calculations.

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
