      This study evaluated the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the GEBA Scale with
      photonumeric guide for the assessment of overall eyebrow fullness. There is no treatment

    <measure>Inter-rater Reliability of Physician Raters Using the Global Eyebrow Assessment (GEBA) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Inter-rater agreement (among raters) of the GEBA scores (1=very sparse, 2=sparse, 3=full, 4=very full) to assess eyebrow fullness was evaluated using Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W). Each of 7 raters scored 112 subjects' eyebrows using the GEBA Scale at 2 different time points at day 1. The overall inter-rater agreement for Kendall's W for all raters combined was estimated based on the average of the scores from those 2 different time points. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of Kendall's W was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was pre-defined as: ≤ 0: poor, 0.00-0.20: slightly, 0.21-0.40: fair, 0.41-0.60: moderate, 0.61-0.80: substantial and 0.81-1:00: almost perfect. The 95% confidence interval for Kendall's W was provided.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-rater (within raters) agreement of the GEBA scores (1=very sparse, 2=sparse, 3=full, 4=very full) to assess eyebrow fullness was evaluated by weighted Kappa statistics. Weighted Kappa statistics were calculated for each of 7 raters who evaluated 112 subjects using GEBA scale, assessing agreement between 2 different time points at day 1. The overall intra-rater agreement for Kappa statistics for all raters combined was estimated by pooling Kappa statistics for each rater using a chi-square statistic. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of Kappa statistics was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was predefined as: ≤ 0: poor, 0.00-0.20: slightly, 0.21-0.40: fair, 0.41-0.60: moderate, 0.61-0.80: substantial and 0.81-1:00: almost perfect.
