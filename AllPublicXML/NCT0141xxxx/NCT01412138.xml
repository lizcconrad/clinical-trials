  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human endometrium is a very dynamic tissue characterized by cyclical process of
      proliferation, differentiation and cellular shedding as part of each menstrual cycle. This
      issue suggests the presence of somatic stem cells. Endometriosis is characterized by presence
      of endometrium outside the uterine cavity. The existence of a somatic stem cell population in
      endometrium could explain the incorrect proliferation of these cells, which would lead to
      formation of endometriotic foci.

      Throughout the life of the woman, the endometrium undergoes a series of continuous
      modifications that require a highly accurate feedback mechanism and specialized and must be
      based on the activity of the stem cell population.

      Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic disease characterized by the presence of
      functional endometrium outside the uterine cavity, mainly in the peritoneum and ovary
      (Giudice and Kao, 2004). It affects 6-10% of women of reproductive age, often resulting in a
      series of gynecological problems, including dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and infertility. The
      nature of endometriosis suggests that the initiation of ectopic endometrial lesions may be
      due to stem or progenitor cells, which is consistent with the theory of retrograde
      menstruation (Starzinski-Powitz et al. 2001; Leyendecker et al. 2002, Gargett, 2006; Gargett,
      2007, Sasson and Taylor, 2008). To date, no direct evidence of the role of somatic stem cells
      of the endometrium in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. However, numerous studies show that
      ectopic endometrial cells implant in many established models used for the study of
      endometriosis.(Masuda et al., 2007b; Sasson and Taylor, 2008; Gargett y Masuda.,2010)
