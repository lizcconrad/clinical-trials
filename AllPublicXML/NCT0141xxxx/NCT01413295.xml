  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The different alternatives used since 1996 to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) have
      increased the mean survival of these patients. This outstanding advance is due to the
      extended indications for resection of hepatic metastases and to the use of new
      chemotherapeutic drugs (fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) and monoclonal
      antibodies (bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab). However, none of these treatments is
      curative and the majority of patients are overwhelmed by the illness. The first line of
      treatment for MCRC is FOLFOX and the second, irinotecan plus cetuximab for patients with wild
      type KRAS gene (60%) with a 30% responses, and bevacizumab plus irinotecan with a 5-10% of
      responses, in patients with mutated KRAS (40%). A treatment with autologous dendritic cells
      (DCs) pulsed with autologous tumour antigens is proposed as a third line of therapy. A
      randomized phase II trial would be performed, by selecting two groups of patients, one of
      them would be treated with the best supportive treatment and the other with DCs plus the best
      supportive treatment. The aim of the study would be to analyze the outcome after 4 months of
      treatment. In patients treated with DCs, IFN-γ spot forming cells and proliferative responses
      would be determined pre and post treatment in lymphocytes stimulated with autologous DCs
      pulsed with autologous tumour antigens. Pre and post treatment serum levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α,
      TGF-β e IL-12, would also be measured.
