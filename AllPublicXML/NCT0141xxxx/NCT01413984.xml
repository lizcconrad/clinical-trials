  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate Covington's Helping Women Recover (HWR) plus Beyond Trauma
      (BT) curriculum with female offenders at Eddie Warrior Correctional Facility in Taft,
      Oklahoma. The purpose of the proposed study is to expand previous findings by including a
      comparison group of women that are not receiving treatment but are otherwise eligible, and by
      using outside evaluators to conduct the assessments. Furthermore, this study will extend the
      outcomes measured in previous evaluations by including measures of sleep disturbance,
      posttraumatic cognitions, and a more extensive assessment of trauma-related symptoms. The
      hypotheses for this study are listed below:

        1. Incarcerated women with substance use disorders and history of trauma enrolled in the
           integrated treatment program (HWR plus BT) will report significantly fewer symptoms on
           measures of posttraumatic stress and associated cognitions, substance use, depression,
           and related symptoms following treatment than those in the comparison group.

        2. Those in the treatment group will improve significantly more than those in the
           comparison group on the symptoms listed above.

    <description>Four treatment rounds will be conducted, and a goal of 20 women (10 from each group) will be recruited to participate in each round. A new treatment group will start every four months. Sessions are approximately 2 hours each, 3-4 times per week over four months in a group format. This treatment program will focus on the integrated treatment of trauma and substance abuse in women. Versions of the curriculum exist both for community and corrections populations. In this intervention the corrections version will be used.</description>
