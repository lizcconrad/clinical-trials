  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed in the early 1970s, Fontan Operation has provided palliative care for patients with
      single ventricle physiology. Single ventricle is a rare subclass of the atrioventricular (AV)
      alignment abnormalities double inlet and common inlet ventricles (and rarely, straddling
      tricuspid valve), in which there is only one ventricular sinus [1]. Most patients present
      with symptoms of congestion , low cardiac output, and deep cyanosis immedietly after birth.
      Untreated, these heart anomalies are highly lethal. Neonatal heart transplantation is
      implacable because of shortage of donors. Fontan operation is a three staged palliative
      procedure: the single ventricle pumping blood to the systemic circulation , while blood flows
      laminarly to the lungs through direct anastomosis of the superior and inferior vena cavae
      (total cavo pulmonary connections), inevitably by-passing the right heart .

      This procedure has been shown to immediately correct the mixed venous blood dysfunction,
      providing treatment for the prominent signs of cyanosis.

      Along with its beneficial outcomes, Fontan circulation patients have been documented to have
      a variety of post-operative late complications. Of most substantial, increased systemic
      vascular resistance (mean of 10-15 mmHg higher) [2], systolic dysfunction as a result of
      decreased preload and increase afterload [3], and atrial arrhythmias [4].

      With the advent of bypassing right-heart circulation with Fontan operation, the pulmonary
      vascular bed is exposed to a new atmosphere of blood flow. Instead of physiological pulsatile
      flow in normal circulation, the pulmonary vasculature is receiving slow velocity, laminar
      flow [5]. Patients post-Fontan operations have been documented to have restrictive-type
      pulmonary function, but still yet to be correlated with Fontan circulation or as a possible
      result of prior lung tissue injury from the pre/intra-operation high volume blood flow.
      Regardless, Fontan patients are described to have decreased pulmonary function.

      The purpose of this research effort is to document and analyze the pulmonary function of
      those patients post-Fontan operation. It is still unclear as to what the long-term effects of
      Fontan operation are towards the pulmonary vascular bed, leaving us questions about the
      effects on lung capacities, ventilation-perfusion efficiency, and oxygen saturation.

      Generation of Data:

        1. Spirometry-Spirometry will be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS (American Thoracic
           Society/ European Respiratory Society) Task Force using a KoKo spirometer (KoKo system,
           PDS Inc., Ferraris Cardiopulmonary System Group; Louisville, CO, USA). Each maneuver
           will be repeated for at least three technically acceptable FEFV curves; the best results
           were used for analysis. [6]

        2. Whole Body Plethysmography- FRCpleth will be measured in a commercial, whole body ZAN500
           constant volume body plethysmograph (ZAN-Messgeraete GmbH, Germany); the surrounded
           glassed cabin of 980 L includes a chair with adjustable height, all meeting the ATS/ERS
           recommendations for plethysmography measurements [7,8]. The flow, volume, cabin
           pressure, and mouth pressures are automatically calibrated. BTPS conditions for lung
           volumes are automatically corrected. According to the manufacturer, environmental
           interference is automatically reduced by a numeric-drift-compensation, enabling quick
           stable signals for immediate testing.

        3. MCT - Methacholine challenge tests will be performed in a designated room at the
           Pediatric Pulmonary Unit, Meyer Children's Hospital, Haifa, Israel. MCT was performed
           with double doses of fresh methacholine solutions in saline. Solutions were driven by
           KoKo-PDS dosimeter via mouthpiece. The MCT will end when FEV1 dropped by more 20% from
           baseline FEV1 values or when a methacholine concentration of 16 mg/ml was reached. The
           exact PC20 value will be then calculated by the program according to the log-transformed
           formula, as described in the guidelines for methacholine.[9] Airway hyper-reactivity was
           defined as PC20 &lt;8 mg/ml. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored by pulse
           oximetry (Nonin Wrist Ox 3100, Nonin Medical, Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA).

        4. FENO: Measurement of FENO will be performed by portable electrochemical analyzer NIOX
           MINO (Aerocrine AB, Smidesvägen, Sweden),[10] and according to ATS recommendations . The
           measurement procedure includes a deep inhalation to total lung capacity followed by
           exhalation for 10 seconds at a mouth flow rate of 50 mL/sec and a pressure of 10
           cmH2O.[11] Analysis of Data: Subjects of study will be patients post-Fontan operation
           over the age of 6 years in order to fulfill the cooperation requirement necessary to
           obtain data. Patients should be in general good health without any ongoing acute
           pulmonary disease.
