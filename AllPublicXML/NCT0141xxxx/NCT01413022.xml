      This phase I trial studies the side effects and optimal dose of PF-04136309 when given with
      combination chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX; 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) in
      treating patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. These
      patients are not candidates for surgical resection which is the most effective treatment for
      pancreatic cancer. Giving PF-04136309 together with FOLFIRINOX may shrink pancreatic tumors
      in some patients so that surgery becomes an option

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To define the optimal dose and toxicity of PF-04136309 in combination with FOLFIRINOX
      (fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin) in patients
      with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the safety of PF-04136309 and FOLFIRINOX by grade 3 or 4 toxicity for
           clinical use.

        -  To determine the tumor control rate (TCR) as defined by stable disease (SD), partial
           response (PR), and complete response (CR): TCR = SD + PR + CR.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the prevalence and function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in
           the bone marrow, peripheral circulation, and tumor before and after treatment with
           PF-04136309 and FOLFIRINOX.

        -  To determine the prevalence and function of MDSC in the bone marrow, peripheral
           circulation, and tumor before and after treatment with FOLFIRINOX.

             inflammatory bowel disease, any condition that increases the risk of severe irinotecan
             gastrointestinal toxicity, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding
