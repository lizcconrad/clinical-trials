  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATNC05 is a combination of two known marketed generic compounds. The investigators
      hypothesize that the combination acts synergistically to reduce chronic radicular neuropathic
      back pain of the cervical, thoracic and the lumbar regions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Back pain represents one of the most common and chronic physical ailments. In the United
      States, acute back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits. In fact, nine
      of ten adults experience back pain at some point in their life, and five out of ten working
      adults report back pain every year.

      While only a minority of individuals suffering from back pain resort to surgery, there are
      only limited options for offering relief from chronic back pain. Heat therapy is one option
      for short term relief, as well as alternative cold compression therapy proximate to the
      location of pain. Alternative treatments such as massage therapy, acupressure and pressure
      point massage have also been used. Some pharmaceuticals have shown usefulness in treating
      back pain, including muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics and
      Opioid Agonists. However opioids are limited by side effects such as constipation and
      sedation, as well as by dependence, tolerance and scheduling issue. NSAIDs avoid some of the
      liabilities of opioids, yet they also have toxicities which can limit their usefulness.

      Accordingly, there is a need in the art of treating back pain for an alternative
      pharmaceutical composition that reduces the symptoms of back pain effectively and for longer
      periods of time.
