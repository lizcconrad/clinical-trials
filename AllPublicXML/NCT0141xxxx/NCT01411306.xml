  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite medical advances, half of the patients admitted to hospital for recovery from acute
      illness, injury or surgery have swallowing difficulties and those requiring tubes for
      breathing support are at even greater risk. Difficulties with swallowing decrease patients'
      quality of life, prolong their hospital stay, as well as lead to medical complications such
      as pneumonia, malnutrition and death. Presently, there is no screening test for swallowing
      difficulties in patients who have required respiratory support. Screening will allow for
      early detection of swallowing problems which is important to prevent serious complications,
      such as pneumonia. This research will determine the accuracy of a new screening test, the
      Toronto Bedside Swallowing Screening Test (TOR-BSST©) previously tested with stroke patients,
      to predict the presence of swallowing difficulties in patients who have required breathing
      support for longer than 48 hours. The investigators will enroll 100 patients from the
      intensive care medical surgical units at the University Health Network. The findings from
      this research will help identify those patients with swallowing problems earlier than it is
      currently possible. Once identified, at risk patients will be referred to a speech language
      pathologist swallowing expert for more comprehensive testing; thereby, decreasing their risk
      of experiencing serious complications, such as pneumonia, secondary to swallowing problems.
