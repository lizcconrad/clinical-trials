  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, controversy has emerged regarding the role of the 23vPPV in infants due to
      potential immunological hypo-responsiveness (i.e. a poorer immune response to repeat
      vaccination). Although previous experience of 23vPPV in children in PNG has demonstrated
      protective efficacy against acute lower respiratory tract infection, the investigators feel
      it is a matter of urgency to determine if 23vPPV administration provides elevated antibody
      concentrations at 3 to 5 years of age, and to ensure the immunological safety of the 23vPPV
      in infants.

      Following consent and eligibility assessment, a baseline blood sample and nose swab will be
      taken, a 0.1ml dose of 23vPPV will be administered and a follow up blood sample and nose swab
      will be collected 28 days later. The investigators will also collect data on incidence of
      ALRI in all study participants by medical record review.

    <description>Children who were previously vaccinated with Pneumovax (23vPPV) at 9 months will be followed up at age 3-5 years of age. They will be given a challenge dose of Pneumovax (0.1mL) and followed up 1 months later. Age matched controls identified from each villages will also be recruited and given a challenge dose of Pneumovax. Serotype-specific antibodies will be measure pre- and post-challenge dose to determine anitbody levels.</description>
