        DuraSeal group will be patients that undergo a spinal procedure where a dural opening
        occurrs and is treated with DuraSeal Exact Spine Sealant System. Control group will be
        patients that have undergone a spinal procedure where a dural opening occurred and was
        treated with anything other than DuraSeal Sealant (Spine or Dural). These subjects may be
        enrolled retrospectively (through a chart review of past cases) or prospectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older

          -  Subject had a spinal procedure where a dural opening (either intentional or
             incidental) occurred and was treated with either:

               -  DuraSeal™ Exact Spine Sealant (DuraSeal™ Sealant group ONLY) OR

               -  Any other method of sealing the dura with the exception of DuraSeal™ Sealant
                  -either spinal or cranial. (Control group ONLY)

          -  Subject, or authorized representative, has been informed of the nature of the study
             and has provided written informed consent approved by the appropriate Institutional

             data.

               -  Prospective subjects: Consent must be obtained within 24 hours of surgery stop
                  time.

               -  Retrospective subjects (Control group specific): IRB approval may be granted to
                  individual sites to waive requirement for informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigator determines that the subject will not be able to comply with the
