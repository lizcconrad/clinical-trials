    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Reflective Nasal Congestion Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1-7</time_frame>
    <description>The reflective assessment is a self-evaluation of the symptom severity over the preceding 12 hours. Baseline values were calculated as the mean from 4 consecutive 24-hour periods in which a symptom score was ≥1, prior to randomization. The nasal congestion score was calculated from data captured twice daily (morning and evening) in the participant's diary during the run-in and treatment periods. Participants rated congestion on a 4-point scale of severity: 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident), 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), and 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping). The average of individual reflective nasal scores was reported as the daily reflective nasal congestion score over the entire treatment period.</description>

    <measure>Time to Maximal Phenylephrine Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The time to maximal phenylephrine effect was defined as the earliest time that the nasal congestion symptom score in the Phenylephrine treatment group demonstrated the greatest numerical difference from the Placebo treatment group in change from baseline. The mean change from baseline scores for a Phenylephrine treatment arm and for the Placebo treatment arm at each timepoint of the treatment period (Day 1 morning, Day 1 evening, etc) was calculated. The difference between the Phenylephrine treatment arm and Placebo treatment arm mean at each timepoint of the treatment period was calculated. The time to maximal phenylephrine effect was the first timepoint at which the difference between the Phenylephrine treatment arm and the Placebo treatment arm was greatest. The results for the Placebo treatment arm are not presented as the result of this outcome measure is only relevant for the Phenylephrine treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire With Standardized Activities (RQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The RQLQ is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed to measure the physical, emotional, and social problems in adults with rhinoconjunctivitis. Questions were divided into 7 domains: sleep (3 questions), non-hay fever symptoms (7 questions), practical problems (3
questions), nasal symptoms (4 questions), eye symptoms (4 questions), and activities (3 questions), and emotions (4 questions). Individual items within the RQLQ are equally weighted. The questionnaire is analyzed directly from the scores recorded and the results are expressed as the mean score for each of the domains (i.e., domain scores range from 0 to 6). Six represents the greatest impairment and 0 represents the least impairment. Overall quality of life score is the mean score for all domains.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Reflective Nasal Congestion Score</title>
        <description>The reflective assessment is a self-evaluation of the symptom severity over the preceding 12 hours. Baseline values were calculated as the mean from 4 consecutive 24-hour periods in which a symptom score was ≥1, prior to randomization. The nasal congestion score was calculated from data captured twice daily (morning and evening) in the participant's diary during the run-in and treatment periods. Participants rated congestion on a 4-point scale of severity: 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident), 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), and 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping). The average of individual reflective nasal scores was reported as the daily reflective nasal congestion score over the entire treatment period.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1-7</time_frame>
        <population>Efficacy analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat population (all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication). Number of participants evaluable in the placebo group at baseline was 287 and for the treatment period was 286.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Reflective Nasal Congestion Score Per Day</title>
        <description>The reflective assessment is a self-evaluation of the symptom severity over the preceding 12 hours. Baseline values were calculated as the mean from 4 consecutive 24-hour periods in which a symptom score was ≥1, prior to randomization. The nasal congestion score was calculated from data captured twice daily (morning and evening) in the participant's diary during the run-in and treatment periods. Participants rated congestion on a 4-point scale of severity: 0 = best and 3 = severe symptoms. The average of individual reflective nasal scores were reported as the daily reflective nasal congestion score for each day of the treatment period.</description>

        <title>Time to Maximal Phenylephrine Effect</title>
        <description>The time to maximal phenylephrine effect was defined as the earliest time that the nasal congestion symptom score in the Phenylephrine treatment group demonstrated the greatest numerical difference from the Placebo treatment group in change from baseline. The mean change from baseline scores for a Phenylephrine treatment arm and for the Placebo treatment arm at each timepoint of the treatment period (Day 1 morning, Day 1 evening, etc) was calculated. The difference between the Phenylephrine treatment arm and Placebo treatment arm mean at each timepoint of the treatment period was calculated. The time to maximal phenylephrine effect was the first timepoint at which the difference between the Phenylephrine treatment arm and the Placebo treatment arm was greatest. The results for the Placebo treatment arm are not presented as the result of this outcome measure is only relevant for the Phenylephrine treatment group.</description>

          <description>The time to maximal phenylephrine effect was defined as the earliest time that the nasal congestion symptom score in the Phenylephrine treatment group demonstrated the greatest numerical difference from the Placebo treatment group in change from baseline. The mean change from baseline scores for a Phenylephrine treatment arm and for the Placebo treatment arm at each timepoint of the treatment period (Day 1 morning, Day 1 evening, etc) was calculated. The difference between the Phenylephrine treatment arm and Placebo treatment arm mean at each timepoint of the treatment period was calculated. The time to maximal phenylephrine effect was the first timepoint at which the difference between the Phenylephrine treatment arm and the Placebo treatment arm was greatest. The results for the Placebo treatment arm are not presented as the result of this outcome measure is only relevant for the Phenylephrine treatment group.</description>

        <title>Day 7 Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Instantaneous Symptom Assessment Score</title>
        <description>The instantaneous assessment is a self-evaluation of the symptom severity at the moment of the assessment prior to the next dose. Baseline values were calculated as the mean from 4 consecutive 24-hour periods in which a symptom score was ≥1, prior to randomization. The nasal congestion score was calculated from data captured twice daily (morning and evening) in the participant's diary during the run-in and treatment periods. Participants rated congestion on a 4-point scale of severity: 0 = best and 3 = worst symptoms). The average of individual instantaneous nasal scores was reported as the daily instantaneous nasal congestion score over the entire treatment period.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline for the Morning Instantaneous Symptom Assessment Scores for Each Day During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The instantaneous assessment is a self-evaluation of the symptom severity at the moment of the assessment prior to the next dose. Baseline values were calculated as the mean from 4 consecutive 24-hour periods in which a symptom score was ≥1, prior to randomization. The daily nasal congestion score was calculated from data captured daily (morning) in the participant's diary during the run-in and treatment periods. Participants rated congestion on a 4-point scale of severity: 0 = best and 3 = worst symptoms. The average of individual instantaneous nasal scores was reported as the daily instantaneous nasal congestion score for each day of the treatment period.</description>

        <title>Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire With Standardized Activities (RQLQ)</title>
        <description>The RQLQ is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed to measure the physical, emotional, and social problems in adults with rhinoconjunctivitis. Questions were divided into 7 domains: sleep (3 questions), non-hay fever symptoms (7 questions), practical problems (3
questions), nasal symptoms (4 questions), eye symptoms (4 questions), and activities (3 questions), and emotions (4 questions). Individual items within the RQLQ are equally weighted. The questionnaire is analyzed directly from the scores recorded and the results are expressed as the mean score for each of the domains (i.e., domain scores range from 0 to 6). Six represents the greatest impairment and 0 represents the least impairment. Overall quality of life score is the mean score for all domains.</description>
