      The aim of this study is to investigate effects of femur exposed to unilateral vibration on
      the rest muscle electrical activity of contralateral hip adductors and contralateral soleus
      H-reflex in young adult men.

      This study hypothesize that femur exposed to unilateral vibration may affect the rest muscle
      electrical activity of contralateral hip adductors. Vibration can effectively enhance muscle
      strength and power. Previous studies have shown that vibration increases muscle
      electromyographic (EMG) activity. It has been showed that bone has an effect on the increase
      in muscle EMG activity caused by vibration in healthy young adults in a study. In this study,
      it was reported that vibrations-induced increases in muscle electrical activity of flexor
      carpi radialis (FCR) was related to ultradistal radius bone mineral content (BMC) and the FCR
      H-reflex was suppressed or depressed during vibration. This findings were reported to support
      the assumption that the bone exposed to cyclic mechanical loading may neuronally regulate
      muscle activity.

      A total of 20 voluntaries are planned to include in this study.

      Vibration will be applied the right lower extremity by whole-body vibration (PowerPlate Pro).
      Cases will stand on vibration plate. WBV will be applied at a frequency of 40 Hz and
      amplitude of 2 mm for 60 seconds. WBV will be applied one session only.

      The rest muscle electrical activity of ipsilateral and contralateral hip adductor muscles at
      rest will be measured by PowerLab (data acquisition system, ADInstruments, Australia)
      device.The rest-EMGrms will be measured at before and during vibration. We also evaluate a
      change in contralateral soleus H reflex during vibration.

      Effects of bone on the rest muscle electrical activity will be assessed by hip bone mineral
      density, bone mineral content and serum sclerostin level. The right hip bone mineral density
      (BMD) and BMC will be evaluated by bone densitometer (Norland). Plasma sclerostin level will
      be measured by using Human Sclerostin ELISA kÄ±t before and after vibration.
