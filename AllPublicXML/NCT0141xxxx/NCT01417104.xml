  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess the effectiveness of short term (~9 months)
      Aliskiren/Placebo therapy to slow down the progression of atherosclerotic disease in thoracic
      and abdominal aorta. This will be checked by comparing before and after therapy magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) pictures of the aortic wall. Aliskiren is an FDA approved drug for
      hypertension but in this study is used for a new indication. Recent studies with animals have
      shown that Aliskiren therapy reduces the atherosclerotic plaque. Therefore, in this study,
      the investigators would like to evaluate whether the investigational drug Aliskiren, which is
      not FDA approved for this indication has the same beneficial effects in people with
      atherosclerotic disease.

      Treatments and Clinic Visits:

      The 36-week double-blind, randomized treatment phase of the trial is preceded by 2-week
      single-blind placebo period to assess eligibility into the active treatment period,
      compliance, and to confirm the baseline blood pressure values of the enrolled subjects. If at
      the end of the single-blind phase, inclusion criteria will not be met, the participants will
      not be allowed to continue on to the trial. If they are eligible they will undergo baseline
      MRI studies after being randomized to either placebo or Aliskiren 150 mg, with an escalation
      to 300 mg at 2 weeks into treatment. This dose will be maintained for the duration of the
      trial. After randomization and dose escalation visits (at 2 weeks), patients will return for
      scheduled clinic visits at weeks 12 and 36. Assessment of routine safety measures including
      serum creatinine and potassium will be performed at pre-designated visits (randomization,
      drug escalation and end-of trial). At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting
      position for 5 minutes, SBP/diastolic blood pressure will be measured 3 times in accordance
      with the AHA Committee Report on blood pressure determination. The patient will be then asked
      to stand for 2 minutes, and a single blood pressure measurement will be measured in the
      standing position. Evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) will be determined using
      the Romhilt-Estes scoring system at baseline. Specialized measurements of plasma including
      insulin, glucose measures, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) and high- sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) will be performed at randomization and 12 weeks into the trial.
      Central aortic blood pressure assessment will be performed at randomization and end of
      trial/exit visits (SphygmoCor CP, AtCor Medical, Itaska, Illinois, USA). Plasma direct renin
      measurements will be obtained at baseline and 12 weeks in part to assess compliance of
      patients with their therapy (Diasource, Belgium).

    <description>All patients underwent imaging using a 3T, MRI system. The MRI sequence method used for wall depiction was a 3D, fat suppressed, dark blood, turbo spin echo sequence with variable flip angles (SPACE). Following co-registration of pre and post treatment MR images, and generation of MPR sections, images were magnified, contrast adjusted and patient/exam identifier information was removed and replaced by pre-assigned code to blind images for measurements.
An experienced observer performed manual measurements of lumen and lumen plus wall areas by delineating the inner border and the outer border of the vessel wall in each cross-section image of the aorta. Using an approach similar to intravascular atheroma volume calculations, normalized total aortic wall volume (TWV) for thoracic region, abdominal region and total aorta for each patient and each exam was generated.</description>

        <title>Change in Normalized Total Aortic Wall Volume (TWV) Between the Trial Arms at the End of the Treatment</title>
        <description>All patients underwent imaging using a 3T, MRI system. The MRI sequence method used for wall depiction was a 3D, fat suppressed, dark blood, turbo spin echo sequence with variable flip angles (SPACE). Following co-registration of pre and post treatment MR images, and generation of MPR sections, images were magnified, contrast adjusted and patient/exam identifier information was removed and replaced by pre-assigned code to blind images for measurements.
An experienced observer performed manual measurements of lumen and lumen plus wall areas by delineating the inner border and the outer border of the vessel wall in each cross-section image of the aorta. Using an approach similar to intravascular atheroma volume calculations, normalized total aortic wall volume (TWV) for thoracic region, abdominal region and total aorta for each patient and each exam was generated.</description>
