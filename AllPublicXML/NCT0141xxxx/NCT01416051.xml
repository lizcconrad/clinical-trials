  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today's obesogenic environment, favors behavioral choices that lead to an excess of energy
      intake over expenditure, and consequently weight gain. Intervention strategies that harness
      the body's own appetite and satiety regulating signals could provide an effective means of
      countering excessive energy intake. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a
      vegetable oil emulsion (Olibra) would result in weight loss that was associated with a
      reduction in food intake.

      71 healthy subjects were enrolled (60 females, 11 males; Age: 18 - 60 years, BMI 25 - 40
      kg/m2) in a two-phased, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel trial. During
      a 12-week period, Olibra was compared with a placebo (milk fat). Food intake testing was
      conducted on three days and anthropometric data was collected on 7 days. Key outcome measures
      were, body weight, body composition, energy intake, and appetite ratings.
