  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common, costly, disabling and potentially lethal condition. Despite well
      recognised and proven drug therapies, many patients remain breathless on exertion. A special
      pacemaker (cardiac resynchronisation therapy) may help improve symptoms of breathlessness and
      survival by restoring coordinated beating of the heart. However, despite careful planning and
      the knowledge of the most appropriate selection criteria, up to a third of patients do not
      get the desired beneficial effects after the pacemaker has been implanted.

      The implantation of the special pacemaker requires three leads (wires) to be inserted within
      the heart. Currently this is undertaken under X-ray guidance. Some patients may have scarring
      of the heart muscle due to previous heart attacks or their underlying condition. The X-ray
      technique cannot see this and therefore the doctor may implant the lead in such an area of
      scar tissue. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can demonstrate these areas of scar.
      The study aims to investigate whether CMR can better predict where the wires should be
      placed. The CMR pictures will be taken before the patient has the special pacemaker
      implanted.

      Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) is currently recommended for patients with heart
      failure who have symptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic impairment and a prolonged QRS
      duration.1, 2 Up to a third of patients post CRT implantation do not derive the anticipated
      clinical benefit. The reasons for this are multifactorial, with patient selection and
      successful LV lead implantation likely to be key factors.

      The mechanism by which CRT exerts its clinical benefits is fundamentally through the
      correction of mechanical dyssynchrony. However, despite much research in this area the
      optimal measures of dyssynchrony for the selection of suitable candidates for CRT have not
      been established. The current guidelines were revised in light of the PROSPECT trial which
      failed to prove validity and reproducibility in complex echocardiographic variables of
      dyssynchrony.3 The 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains the most widely used criterion for
      the assessment of dyssynchrony in patients being considered for CRT, with patients with a
      broad QRS complex (&gt;150ms) appearing to benefit the most.4, 5

      Although the definition of left bundle branch block (LBBB) is well established, the precise
      electrophysiological characteristics remain poorly understood. An arbitrary 'cut off' of 120
      milliseconds was recommended by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) in 1948 for its
      definition.6 This has subsequently become enshrined in the literature. The presence of LBBB,
      a heterogeneous entity, is associated with both electrical and mechanical abnormalities
      within the left ventricle.7 Septal and lateral wall delay frequently occur in this setting,
      with delayed activation of the lateral LV wall forming the basis for bi-ventricular pacing.
      It is well documented within populations with left ventricular impairment that there is
      prolongation of the QRS complex which is associated with an adverse prognosis.8

      The success of CRT is reliant upon achieving an acceptable position of the left ventricular
      lead during implantation. The LV lead position needs to be anatomically stable to minimise
      the risk of lead displacement and also to avoid diaphragmatic capture. Furthermore, patients
      with myocardial scar tissue in the lateral LV segments as detected on CMR are known to have a
      worse outcome following CRT 9 and pacing such sites may potentially be pro-arrhythmic.10 It
      is not known whether CMR guided placement of the LV lead in order to avoid sites of
      myocardial scar and fibrosis can result in an improved clinical outcome in these patients.

      A recently published study corroborates that myocardial scar in the region of activation of
      the LV lead may have a detrimental effect on the delivery of CRT. A consecutive series of 397
      patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy were imaged prior to the implantation of CRT. Using
      the complex echocardiographic technique of 'speckle tracking', myocardial scar was
      demonstrated to have an adverse effect on patients' outcomes. It remained an independent
      predictor of adverse clinical outcome. Notably due to the complexity of the technique, the
      presence of myocardial scar was validated using CMR.11

      CRT response is a contentious subject. It is well recognised within the literature that
      approximately 30-40% of patients do not appear to improve clinically following CRT
      implantation.12 However, the inter-study variability of what has been considered as a marker
      of response has been wide and several different variables have been utilised.13 Several of
      the studies have also been small, single centre, and non-randomised. There is currently a
      lack of consensus in what constitutes 'response' vs 'non-response' following CRT, which may
      be either defined in terms of markers of LV reverse remodelling or changes in the clinical
      indices of heart failure or a combination of them both. In an effort to rationalise the
      endpoints of CRT trials, clinical composite scores have been devised inclusive of both
      imaging based and clinical endpoints. However, the correlation between both LV remodelling
      and clinical endpoints when compared using correlation coefficients is marginally better than
      chance. The realisation that clinical improvement post CRT implantation does not necessarily
      accompany mechanical remodelling has also confused the issue.

      Rationale for Study The aim of the present study is to provide pilot data, the results of
      which should increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which CRT improves clinical
      outcomes in patients with heart failure.

CMR guided LV lead placement - an expert panel will decide pre-operatively the optimal branch of the coronary sinus for LV lead placement based on the presence of myocardial scar tissue and coronary sinus anatomy. The operator will informed as to the optimal vein to target for delivery of the LV lead. Should this be technically unfeasible (e.g. due to pacing considerations or stability of LV lead position), then the most suitable vein will be used at the time of implantation.</description>

The CRT device will be implanted using established conventional techniques. The CMR study will be performed pre-implantation only. The distribution of myocardial scar and fibrosis will be derived from this study. A CMR venogram will also be generated and the suggested optimal venous tributaries of the great cardiac vein will be identified from discussion between the principal investigator and senior CMR physician.
