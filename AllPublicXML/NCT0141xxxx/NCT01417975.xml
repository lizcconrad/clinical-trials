    <textblock>
      Female and male smokers will complete questionnaires and smoking behavior will be examined.
      After abstaining from smoking for approximately 18 hours, they will be randomized to a
      moderate intensity exercise groups or passive sitting group. Smoking satisfaction and smoking
      behavior will be assessed following treatment.

      The hypotheses detailed below are specific to the randomization of participants into the
      following 2 groups:

        1. Moderate exercise (Experimental condition; MEG)

        2. Passive sitting (Attention control condition; PSG)

      Hypothesis 1: A bout of moderate intensity exercise will be associated with decreased smoking
      satisfaction after a temporary period of abstinence compared to a control condition.

      Hypothesis 2: Smoking topographic measures will mediate the relationship between a bout of
      moderate intensity exercise and smoking satisfaction.

      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Canadians (Canadian Cancer Society (CCS),
      2010). Cigarette smoking is responsible for 85% of these cases (CCS, 2007). Exercise has been
      shown to be an effective adjunct to pharmacological cessation strategies (Ussher, Taylor, &amp;
      Faulkner, 2008). A recent systematic review concluded that a single bout of low to moderate
      intensity exercise can help regulate cravings, withdrawal symptoms and negative affect
      associated with quitting (Taylor, Ussher, &amp; Faulkner, 2007).

      Smoking satisfaction is an immediately reinforcing effect of nicotine. Smoking satisfaction
      may outweigh the temporally distant adverse health risks of smoking (Cappelleri, Bushmakin,
      Baker, Merikle, Olufade, &amp; Gilbert, 2007). Varenicline, an alpha 4-beta-2 nAChR partial
      agonist, mimics the effect of nicotine by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms (Coe et
      al., 2005). A 12-week treatment period of varenicline has been shown to reduce smoking
      satisfaction (Jorenby et al., 2006). However, the effect of acute exercise on smoking
      satisfaction is not yet known.

      Smoking topography is a key facet of smoking behaviour. Smoking behaviour can be subjectively
      or objectively measured by quantifying puff volume, maximum puff velocity, inter-puff
      interval, puff duration, number of puffs per cigarette and time to smoke a single cigarette.
      Smoking topography can estimate exposure to carcinogenic toxins present in cigarette smoking
      (Djordjevic, Hoffman, &amp; Hoffman, 1997). Evidence exists to support that exercise modifies
      smoking topography (Katomeri &amp; Taylor 2006; Mikhail, 1983; Reeser, 1983; Zacny &amp; Stitzer,
      1985).

    <description>Smoking topography will be assessed using the Clinical Research Support System (CReSS) Pocket, a computer-based, battery-powered, hand-held unit by Plowshare Technologies. The CReSS Pocket has an orifice flow meter mouthpiece, and a pressure drop related to the flow rate that is produced when a puff is taken. From the flow rate, the CReSS derives puff count (number of puffs per cigarette), puff volume (the volume of carbon monoxide taken in during each puff), puff duration (length of time for each puff), inter-puff interval (amount of time between puffs), and time to first puff.</description>

    <description>The moderate exercise condition will involve participants waking briskly (equivalent to moderate intensity) on a treadmill for 10 minutes. Moderate intensity exercise is defined as 40-68% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Heart rate (HR) will be monitored using a Polar RS100 Heart Rate monitor to serve as a guide for participants to attain the appropriate intensity.</description>

    <description>The passive sitting condition will involve participants sitting passively in a chair for 10 minutes. Heart rate (HR) will be monitored in participants of the passive sitting group to help maintain group equivalency (with the moderate exercise condition) with regards to distraction effects and researcher contact.</description>
