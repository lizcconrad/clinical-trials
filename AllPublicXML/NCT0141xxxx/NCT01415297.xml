  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximal tolerated dose of NKP-1339,
      a ruthenium containing compound administered intravenously on a weekly schedule, in patients
      with advanced solid tumors. The responses to treatment in this population will be evaluated.
      In addition, the PD and PK properties of the compound will be explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NKP-1339 is a novel GRP78 targeted ruthenium based anti-cancer compound which is
      intravenously administered. GRP78 is a key regulator of misfolded protein processing, which
      is unregulated in cancer cells. In nonclinical anti-tumor studies, NKP-1339 showed activity
      against many tumor types, including those resistant to platinum and other standard
      anti-cancer agents. This Phase I trial evaluates the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated
      dose, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of NKP-1339.
