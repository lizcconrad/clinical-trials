    <textblock>
      Many people with a leg amputation have difficulty walking even after they have finished their
      rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to see if a large amount of walking practice on
      a treadmill can improve functional abilities.

    <description>The program requires volunteer participants to attend 15 sessions over 10 to 12 weeks with a total time commitment of 13.5 hours. There is an initial testing session that includes an assessment of the participant's legs, balance, and walking abilities. The entire program includes 12 treadmill training visits that take place three times per week for four weeks, a post-training testing session one week after completion of the training, and a follow-up testing session four weeks after completion of the training.</description>
