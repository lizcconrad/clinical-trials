  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and depleted levels of iron are the most prevalent nutritional deficiency and
      the leading cause of anemia in the world; this can occur at any age, but preschool children
      are at particular risk of developing it. This condition may cause serious repercussions for
      life, being a public health threat of considerable importance worldwide.

      Food fortification is considered the most effective solution to counter this situation,
      because it can help more people than other solutions. It is going to carry out a community
      trial to compare the efficacy of ferrous sulfate with respect to iron amino acid chelate as a
      dietary supplement in preschool children of Medellin with depleted levels of iron; in terms
      of increasing ferritin levels in blood and maintain hemoglobin levels. It is hypothesized
      that at the end of the study the effect of milk fortified with iron amino acid chelate won't
      be less than the effect of fortified with ferrous sulfate.

      It is hoped that the results may contribute, albeit indirectly, to improve the health status
      of children with depleted levels of iron whom consume iron-fortified products.
