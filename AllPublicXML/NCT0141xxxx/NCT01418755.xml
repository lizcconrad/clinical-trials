  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently an articular cartilage repair has been given much attention in the orthopaedic
      field. Cartilage regeneration capacity is very limited. Optimal approach seems to be a
      delivery of natural growth factors. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) contains
      proliferative and chemoattractant growth factors. The objective of the present study was to
      determine if PRP can increase tibiofemoral cartilage regeneration and improve knee function.

      Fifty consecutive and strictly selected patients, affected by Grade II or III chondromalacia,
      underwent one year treatment (9 injections) with autologous PRP in a liquid form with 2,0 to
      2,5-fold platelets concentration. Outcome measures included hte Lysholm, Tegner, IKDC, and
      Cincinnati scores. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate cartilage thickness and
      degree of degeneration.

    <time_frame>11 months</time_frame>
    <description>50 patients with Grade II or III chondromalatia in the knee joint, underwent one year treatment with autologous Platelets Rich Plasma. To carefully assess the subjective and objective clinical outcomes, these questionnaires were used: Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, IKDC scores, and Cincinnati score. All these scores were recompleted 11 months after the beginning of the Platelets Rich Plasma injections.</description>
