  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab
      [RO5072759 (GA101)] in combination with CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine,
      Prednisone) chemotherapy in patients with advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients
      will receive 8 cycles of obinutuzumab (1000 mg intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle,
      during Cycle 1 obinutuzumab will also be infused on Days 8 and 15) in combination with CHOP
      chemotherapy on Day 1 of cycles 1 to 6. A substudy will investigate the drug-drug interaction
      of obinutuzumab with CHOP chemotherapy agents. For the substudy, an additional cohort of
      approximately 15 patients are planned to be enrolled at a subset of investigational sites.

    <description>Complete response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al., 2007). Disease response was evaluated by the investigator using regular clinical and laboratory examinations, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and computed tomography (CT).

        <title>Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by the IRF at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al., 2007). Disease response was evaluated by the IRF using CT scans, PET scans and pertinent clinical information. CR is the disappearance of all evidence of disease. PR is at least 50% regression of measurable disease compared to tumors measured by a baseline scan and no new sites.</description>
