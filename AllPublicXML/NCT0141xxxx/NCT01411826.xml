      controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      Participants in the control group will view standard online information about colon cancer
      screening. Participants in the intervention group will view the same information and also
      will be invited to sign on to the online website and interact with peer supporters at their
      convenience. They will have 6 months to communicate with peer supporters. Peer supporters are
      encouraged to address comments and concerns of the study participants.

      About 300 study participants, majority white, female. Inclusion criteria: age 50-75, not
      currently meeting colorectal cancer screening guidelines, no previous colorectal cancer.

      The study will also include 15 previously identified peer supporters.

      Recruitment: Administrators of the SparkPeople.com weight loss community will send study
      recruitment emails to members at least 50 years of age. Interested individuals will pass an
      eligibility screening and provide informed consent.
