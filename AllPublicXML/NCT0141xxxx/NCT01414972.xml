    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is the comparison between the effects of supplementation with 25000 IU
      preformed vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) or placebo for 4 months on gene expression of T CD4+
      lymphocyte in atherosclerotic patients(documented with angiography).

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death and disability in the world, is considered an
      inflammatory disease with a complex etiology. The immune system has a prominent role in the
      formation, development and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. A whole range of
      identified cytokines have been shown to play a part in atherogenesis, some with
      proatherogenic properties while others having antiatherogenic properties. With increasing
      evidence for the significant role of inflammation and the cytokines involved together with
      the Th1/Th2 imbalance in atherosclerosis and its progression to Coronary artery diseases
      (CADs), the control of cytokine production may become potential therapeutic targets and
      modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance may provide a new pharmacological tool to treat this
      disease. Vitamin A (VA) or VA-like analogs known as retinoids, are potent hormonal modifiers
      of type 1 or type 2 responses but a definitive description of their mechanism(s) of action is
      lacking. high level dietary vitamin A enhances Th2 cytokine production and IgA responses, and
      is likely to decrease Th1 cytokine production. Retinoic acid inhibits IL 12 production in
      activated macrophages, and RA pretreatment of macrophages reduces IFNγ production and
      increases IL4 production in antigen primed CD4 T cells. Supplemental treatment with vitamin A
      or retinoic acid (RA) decreases IFNγ and increases IL5, IL10, and IL4 production. Thus,
      vitamin A deficiency biases the immune response in a Th1 direction, whereas high level
      dietary vitamin A may bias the response in a Th2 direction.
