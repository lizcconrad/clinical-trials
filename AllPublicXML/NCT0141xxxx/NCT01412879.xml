      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.
      Others interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy also work in different ways to kill more cancer cells or stop them from growing.
      It is not yet known whether rituximab is more effective with combination chemotherapy or
      bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma undergoing
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving rituximab together with
      combination chemotherapy or bendamustine hydrochloride followed by consolidation chemotherapy
      and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation works in treating older patients with
      previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with newly diagnosed
           mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin
           hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone (RHCVAD), methotrexate and cytarabine
           (MTX/Ara-C), and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or rituximab and bendamustine
           (R-bendamustine) and autologous stem cell transplant and to select a regimen for further
           development.

        -  To assess the response rate and overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed MCL
           treated with R-HCVAD/MTX/Ara-C and ASCT or R-bendamustine and ASCT.

        -  To assess the toxicity and tolerability of R-HCVAD/MTX/Ara-C and ASCT or R-bendamustine
           and ASCT in patients with newly diagnosed MCL.

        -  To determine the prognostic value of quantitative minimal-residual disease (MRD)
           monitoring in the peripheral blood of MCL patients after induction therapy and serially
           after high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT on treatment outcome.

        -  To bank diagnostic tissue sections for future translational research studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk
      classification by Mantle Cell Lymphoma International prognostic Index (MIPI) score (low risk
      vs intermediate/high risk). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (induction therapy):

             -  Courses 1 and 3: Patients receive induction therapy comprising rituximab IV on day
                1; cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 2-4; doxorubicin
                hydrochloride IV over 72 hours on days 5-7; vincristine sulfate IV on days 5 and
                12; and dexamethasone IV or orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-5 and 12-15.
                Patients with responsive disease after course 1 proceed to course 2.

             -  Course 2 and 4: Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1; methotrexate IV over 2-22
                hours on day 2; cytarabine IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 3-4; and
                leucovorin calcium PO or IV on days 3-6. Patients undergo stem cell collection
                after completion of course 2.

             -  Each course is 21 days long and continues in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (induction therapy):

             -  Course 1-6: Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 and bendamustine hydrochloride
                IV over 30 minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in
                the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-4 weeks
                later, patients with responsive disease receive 2 additional courses of treatment.

             -  Stem cell mobilization: Beginning within 8 weeks, patients receive rituximab IV and
                cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients then undergo stem cell
                collection about 26 days later.

      Consolidation therapy: Patients receive one of the following preparative regimens.

        -  BCV* chemotherapy: Carmustine IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -4; etoposide IV over 4
           hours on day -4; and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day -2.

        -  BEAM* chemotherapy: Carmustine IV over 4 hours on days -7 and -6; etoposide IV over 1
           hour twice daily and cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice daily on days -5 to -2, and
           melphalan IV on day -1.

        -  TBI, etoposide, cyclophosphamide: Patients undergo total-body irradiation (TBI)** twice
           daily on days -8 to -5. Patients also receive etoposide IV on day -4 and
           cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day -2.

        -  NOTE: * Patients 61 years of age or older receive either BCV or BEAM.

        -  NOTE: * *TBI may not be used for patients 61 years of age and older. Stem cell
           transplantation: Patients then undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for up to 8 years from registration.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 2 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease progression is defined using the 2007 revised Cheson et al. criteria that is at least 50% increase in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of target measurable nodal lesions over the smallest sum observed, or &gt;= 50% increase in greatest transverse diameter (GTD) of any nodal &gt; 1 cm in shortest axis, or &gt;= 50% increase in the SPD of other target measurable lesions over the smallest sum observed, any new bone marrow involvement, any new lesion, lymph node with long axis is &gt; 1.5 cm or if both long and short axes are &gt; 1 cm, PET positive if patients with no pretreatment PET scan or when PET scan was positive before therapy. Progression-free survival is measured from date of registration to date of first observation of progressive disease, or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive and progression-free are censored at date of last contact.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 8 months (Assessed at the beginning of each cycle of treatment, at restaging, and at post transplant.)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events (AEs) are reported by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. For each patient, worst grade of each event type is reported. Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening, Grade 5 = Fatal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate (Complete and Partial Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR) is a complete disappearance of all disease with the exception of the following. If no PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted if it is PET negative. If the PET scan was negative before therapy, all nodal masses at baseline must have regressed. No new lesions. Previously enlarged organs must have regressed and not be palpable. Bone marrow (BM) must be negative if positive at baseline. Normalization of markers. Partial Response (PR) is a 50% decrease in the sum of products of greatest diameters (SPD) for up to 6 identified dominant lesions, including spleenic and hepatic nodules from baseline. No new lesions and no increase in the size of liver, spleen or other nodes. If PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, PET should be positive in at least one previously involved site.</description>

             cell lymphoma (MCL)

               -  A diagnosis of MCL must be confirmed by histopathological diagnosis including
                  immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry documenting both of the following
                  phenotypes:

                    -  CD19+ or CD20+

                    -  Cyclin D1+ or evidence of the t(11;14) translocation by cytogenetics or FISH

          -  Adequate sections from the original diagnostic specimen must be available for
             submission for central review

               -  An adequate biopsy requires sufficient tissue to establish the architecture and a
                  WHO histologic subtype with certainty

        <description>Disease progression is defined using the 2007 revised Cheson et al. criteria that is at least 50% increase in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of target measurable nodal lesions over the smallest sum observed, or &gt;= 50% increase in greatest transverse diameter (GTD) of any nodal &gt; 1 cm in shortest axis, or &gt;= 50% increase in the SPD of other target measurable lesions over the smallest sum observed, any new bone marrow involvement, any new lesion, lymph node with long axis is &gt; 1.5 cm or if both long and short axes are &gt; 1 cm, PET positive if patients with no pretreatment PET scan or when PET scan was positive before therapy. Progression-free survival is measured from date of registration to date of first observation of progressive disease, or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive and progression-free are censored at date of last contact.</description>

        <title>Response Rate (Complete and Partial Response)</title>
        <description>Complete Response (CR) is a complete disappearance of all disease with the exception of the following. If no PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted if it is PET negative. If the PET scan was negative before therapy, all nodal masses at baseline must have regressed. No new lesions. Previously enlarged organs must have regressed and not be palpable. Bone marrow (BM) must be negative if positive at baseline. Normalization of markers. Partial Response (PR) is a 50% decrease in the sum of products of greatest diameters (SPD) for up to 6 identified dominant lesions, including spleenic and hepatic nodules from baseline. No new lesions and no increase in the size of liver, spleen or other nodes. If PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, PET should be positive in at least one previously involved site.</description>
