  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery for cancer of the esophagus is associated with a high risk of postoperative
      complications. It has been shown that the risk of postoperative complications can be
      decreased by optimising the amount and type of infusion fluids given during surgery, steered
      by measurement of cardiac stroke volume, mostly done with a device called esophageal Doppler.
      This device can however not be used during this type of surgery. This study wants to test the
      hypothesis that postoperative complications in patients operated for esophageal cancer can be
      partially prevented by using a goal directed strategy for the administration of fluids and
      drugs influencing the heart and vessels, based on measurement of stroke volume by pulse wave
      analysis (FloTrac).

    <description>Stroke Volume and Cardiac Index are measured with the Flotrac/Vigileo system and circulation is optimised
Crystalloid infusion (2,5 ml/kg/t) throughout surgery
3 ml/kg Volulyte (artifical colloid) is infused during 5 minutes and SV is measured directly before and 5 minutes after. If SV increases more than 10% the dose is repeated until no increase &gt; 10% is observed. A new dose is given if SV decreases more than 10% from the last value.
If despite optimal filling Cardiac Index (CI) is below 2,5 l/min/m2 infusion with dobutamin is started to attain CI &gt; 2,5.
If despite CI &gt; 2,5 Mean Arterial Pressure &lt;65 mmHg vasopressor (phenylephrine / norepinephrine) is started until MAP equals or is over 65.</description>
