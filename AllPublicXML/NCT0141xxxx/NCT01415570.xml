    <textblock>
      In the United States, African Americans are 3.6 time and Hispanics 1.5 times more likely to
      suffer from chronic kidney disease and need dialysis treatment for life, when compared to the
      non-Hispanic Whites. Unfortunately many dialysis patients die, so that after 5 years only
      less than 35% are still alive. Dialysis patients who appear malnourished or who have muscle
      and fat wasting are even more likely to die. Interestingly, among dialysis patients,
      minorities (African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans) usually survive longer than the
      non-Hispanic Whites. If the investigators can discover the reasons for these so-called
      &quot;racial survival disparities&quot; of dialysis patients, the investigators may be able to improve
      survival for all dialysis patients and maybe even for many other people who suffer from other
      chronic diseases. During this 5 year study the investigators would like to test if a
      different nutrition and diet can explain better survival of minority dialysis patients. The
      investigators will also test if in additional to nutrition there are 2 other reasons for
      better survival of minority dialysis patients, namely differences in bone and minerals and
      differences in social and psychological and mental health. The investigators plan to study
      450 hemodialysis patients every 6 months in several dialysis clinics in Los Angeles South Bay
      area. These subjects will include 30% African Americans, 30% Hispanics, 30% non-Hispanic
      Whites and 10% Asians. Every 6 months the investigators will examine their nutritional
      conditions, dietary intake, psycho-social conditions and quality of life, and will recruit 75
      new subjects to replace those who left our study as a result of kidney transplantation, death
      or other reasons. Hence, the investigators estimate studying a total of 1,050 hemodialysis
      patients over 5 years. Clinical events such as hospital admissions and survival will be
      followed. Blood samples will be obtained every 6 months for measurements of hormones and
      &quot;biomarkers&quot;, and the remainder of the blood will be stored in freezers for future
      measurements. The investigators plan to design and develop race and ethnicity specific
      nutritional risk scores and food questionnaires and will test some of these scores in larger
      national databases of hemodialysis patients. Almost a year after the study starts, the
      investigators also plan to do additional tests of body composition and dietary intake in a
      smaller group of these patients at the GCRC.

      I. SPECIFIC AIMS &amp; HYPOTHESES I.1.HYPOTHESES: Despite higher burden of chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) in minorities, they have greater survival compared to non-Hispanic Whites with CKD. The
      investigators hypothesize that survival advantages of minority CKD patients (pts) result from
      biologically plausible mechanisms related to differences in nutritional status &amp; diet (main
      hypothesis) or differences in bone-&amp;-minerals and/or psychosocial &amp; coping status (2
      alternative hypotheses). Differences in these conditions may lead to different degrees of
      protein-energy wasting, inflammation, oxidative stress, &amp; platelet activation, leading to
      thrombo-embolic &amp; cardiovascular (CV) events. Discovering the biology of CKD racial survival
      disparities may lead to improving outcomes in both CKD and others chronic diseases.

      During this 5-year study the principal investigator (Dr. Kalantar-Zadeh) will also help a
      number of early-career investigators to design and develop additional studies including
      research in minority populations with chronic diseases using data and resources of this
      study.
