  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will undertake a 12-week, open-label study of milnacipran in a
      well-characterized cohort of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) who are 65 years and
      older to investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of this drug in the elderly
      population. The investigators hypothesize that milnacipran will be effective in treating
      fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), and will be prove to be safe when patients are selected for the
      absence of pre-existing blood pressure abnormalities and other serious medical conditions.
