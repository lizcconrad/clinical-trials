  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the fertilization rate between the combination of
      Menopur and Bravelle mixed in the same syringe and Menopur alone, both administered
      subcutaneously (SC), in subjects undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).
      Additionally the study assessed subjects' ability to mix and store the combination of Menopur
      and Bravelle and to assess safety of the Menopur and Bravelle combination.

    <measure>Summary of the Subject Comprehension Questionnaire (SCQ) on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Subject comprehension questionnaires were completed on Day 1 only by participants assigned to the Menopur and Bravelle treatment arm. On Day 1, the participant read the Mixing Instructions Guide on how to mix and administer the medications at home. The participant was given enough time to read and understand the instructions and ask any questions. The participant then completed the SCQ which consists of 7 questions with YES/NO answers, to self-gauge their understanding of drug administration procedures. Reported data represent the number of participants who answered the question YES. Gonadotropins are referred to as investigational medicinal product (IMP).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Subject comprehension questionnaires were repeated on Day 6 after 5 days of combination therapy by participants assigned to the Menopur and Bravelle treatment arm. The SCQ consists of 7 questions with YES/NO answers to self-gauge participants' understanding of drug administration procedures. Reported data represent the number of participants who answered the question YES. Gonadotropins are referred to as investigational medicinal product (IMP).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assigned to the Menopur and Bravelle treatment arm read the Mixing Instructions Guide on how to mix and administer the medications at home. Participants were given enough time to read and understand the instructions and ask any questions. After completing the SCQ, participants prepared and self-administered her assigned first daily dose in the presence of the study coordinator or designee assessor. The assessor then completed a 7 question questionnaire with YES or NO answers to document their assessment of participant understanding of drug administration procedures. Reported data represent the number of participants for whom the assessor answered the question YES.

    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-emergent AE was any AE occurring after start of investigational medicinal product (IMP) and within the time of residual drug effect, or a pretreatment AE or pre-existing medical condition that worsened in intensity after start of IMP and within the time of residual drug effect. The time of residual drug effect was the estimated period of time after the last dose of the IMP, where the effect of the product was still considered to be present based on pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, or other IMP characteristics.</description>

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infertile pre-menopausal female subjects

          -  Documented history of infertility (eg., unable to conceive for at least 1 year, or 6
             months for women ≥36 years of age, or women with bilateral tubal occlusion or absence,
             or subjects who require donor sperm).

          -  Subject's male partner with semen analysis that was at least adequate for
             intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) within 6 months prior to the subjects
             beginning down-regulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-agonist. Partners
             with severe male factor requiring invasive or surgical sperm retrieval or donor sperm
             could have been used.

          -  Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) &gt; 1 ng/mL and &lt; 3 ng/mL at screening.

          -  Eligible for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or ICSI treatment.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Oocyte donor or embryo recipient; gestational or surrogate carrier

          -  Previous IVF or assisted reproductive technology (ART) failure due to a poor response
             to gonadotropins. Poor response was defined as development of ≤ 2 mature follicles or
             history of 2 previous failed cycle cancellations prior to oocyte retrieval due to poor
             response.

          -  Inadequate number of oocytes, defined as fewer than 5 oocytes retrieved in previous
             ART attempts.

          -  Subject's male partners with obvious leukospermia (&gt;2 million white blood cells
             [WBC]/mL) or signs of infection in semen sample within 2 months of the start of
             subject's pituitary down-regulation. If either of these conditions existed, the male
             was to be treated with antibiotics and retested prior to subject's pituitary
             down-regulation.

          -  Undergoing blastomere biopsy and other experimental ART procedures.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of ≤18 and ≥32 kg/m^2

        <title>Summary of the Subject Comprehension Questionnaire (SCQ) on Day 1</title>
        <description>Subject comprehension questionnaires were completed on Day 1 only by participants assigned to the Menopur and Bravelle treatment arm. On Day 1, the participant read the Mixing Instructions Guide on how to mix and administer the medications at home. The participant was given enough time to read and understand the instructions and ask any questions. The participant then completed the SCQ which consists of 7 questions with YES/NO answers, to self-gauge their understanding of drug administration procedures. Reported data represent the number of participants who answered the question YES. Gonadotropins are referred to as investigational medicinal product (IMP).</description>

        <title>Summary of Assessor Questionnaire on Day 6</title>
        <description>Participants assigned to the Menopur and Bravelle treatment arm prepared and self-administered her daily dose on Day 6 in the presence of the study coordinator or designee assessor. The assessor then completed a 7 question questionnaire with YES or NO answers to document their assessment of participant understanding of drug administration procedures. Reported data represent the number of participants for whom the assessor answered the question YES.
