    <textblock>
      This experiment will examine if the use of computerized tasks that train individuals to
      control their attention more effectively will predict individual differences in
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms, rumination and BDNF change. After giving consent, filling out
      self-report forms, and giving blood for the BDNF test, 80 participants will be randomized to
      Cognitive Control Training (CCT) or Peripheral Vision Task (PVT) (described below) which will
      be administered three times over a two week period. At the third visit, participants will
      also complete an anagram task and repeat the blood draw for BDNF testing. The investigators
      hypothesize that computerized tasks that train individuals to control their attention more
      effectively will reduce Obsessive Compulsive (OC) symptoms. Additionally, individuals
      training in CCT will show increased ability to disengage from unattainable goals as assessed
      by responses to an unsolvable anagram task. Finally, individuals training in CCT will show a
      greater increase in BDNF levels as compared to individuals training in PVT.

    <description>Cognitive Control Training - Pace Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT;(Gronwall, 1977): A computer version of the PASAT will be used to measure sustained attention and working memory. Participants are asked to add serially presented numbers. Attention Control Intervention (Wells, 2000): This task involves training individuals to attend differentially to multiple auditory sources (e.g., by counting tones, discriminating the location of tones, and moving their attention between auditory sources for a prolonged period).</description>

    <description>Peripheral Vision Task (PVT; C. Moore, personal communication): This task serves as a non-active control condition which does not target the brain regions influenced by the Wells and PASAT tasks. Participants focus on the placement of dots on a computer screen in this task while listening to a tone.</description>
