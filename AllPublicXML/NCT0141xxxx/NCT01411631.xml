    <textblock>
      There is some evidence that polyphenols can affect cognitive function. Therefore, consumption
      of polyphenols has the potential to prevent cognitive impairment or even enhance cognitive
      performance. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of polyphenol
      consumption served in the form of Concord Grape Juice (CGJ) on cognitive performance and
      driving performance in Mums.

      The study design will be a repeated measures, double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled,
      crossover study. There will be 2 conditions; CGJ and a placebo drink. 20 participants will
      undergo two 12 week dietary interventions which will entail daily consumption of a 12oz
      serving of CGJ or placebo in a counterbalanced manner. There will be a 4 week washout period
      between conditions. At baseline, 6, and 12 weeks of each 12-week treatment arm cognitive
      performance and driving performance will be assessed (using the driving simulator at the
      Institute for Transport Studies). CGJ is a common ingredient in commercially available
      products.

      Mums will be defined as mothers of pre-teen children (aged under 13 years) who are aged
      40-50. This population generally have hectic and stressful lifestyles and therefore there is
      potential for this population to receive cognitive benefit from polyphenol consumption.

The PSS and the Spielberger MSTAI will also be administered on each test day.</description>
