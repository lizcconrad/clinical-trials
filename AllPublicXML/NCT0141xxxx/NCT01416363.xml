  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how 3 types of drug formulations are absorbed by the body. This
      study is termed 'open-label', which means volunteers will be aware of which treatment they
      are receiving. The study is split into 2 parts. Part 1, involves volunteers receiving 2 new
      formulations, as a single dose. There is no placebo (dummy-drug; no active ingredient) in
      this study. Volunteers will also receive a single dose of a formulation used in previous
      trials (reference formulation), so a proper comparison with the new formulations can be made.
      The new fomulations will be administered with food and the reference formulation will be
      given without food. In Part 2, volunteers will receive only one of the 3 formulations as a
      repeat dose for 7 days. Each of these doses will be given with food.

      The present study will be conducted in two parts in healthy male volunteers. Part 1 will
      investigate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of single doses of firategrast administered
      as the existing immediate release tablet formulation, as a modified release tablet (3hr)
      formulation and as a simulated gastro-retentive formulation to be administered via a
      naso-gastric tube. Subjects will receive each formulation in a randomised 3-way single dose
      crossover fashion.

      Part 2, based on the review of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data from the first
      two study treatment periods of Part 1, will investigate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability
      of multiple doses of firategrast administered as the existing immediate release tablet
      formulation, as a modified release tablet (3hr) formulation and as simulated gastro-retentive
      formulation to be administered via naso-gastric tube for a period of 7 days.
