    <description>The S-HRI provides feedback on participants' stages of change for each risk and the single most important step they can take to begin progressing. A counselor will review the report with participants and provide motivational interviewing (MI) coaching and referrals to relevant behavior change services. Repeated computer and individual counseling contacts at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up are designed to support participants through the process of changing multiple risk behaviors.</description>
