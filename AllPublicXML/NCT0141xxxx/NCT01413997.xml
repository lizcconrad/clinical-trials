  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop a biomarker - the Connective Tissue Motion Measure
      (CTMM) -quantifying the functional behavior of perimuscular connective tissues.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The differential motion between specific connective tissue strata will be measured during
      tissue displacement (linear oscillation) initiated by a computer-controlled needle stimulus
      tool (NST). The CTMM will be suitable as an outcome measure for mechanistic and clinical
      studies of CAM interventions. The CTMM also will potentially serve as a clinical diagnostic
      and treatment-monitoring tool for manual therapists, acupuncturists, and CAM clinicians
      interested in assessing the functional status of a patient's connective tissue.
