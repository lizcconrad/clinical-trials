      Multicentered, randomized study of safety and efficacy of whole-body vibration (WBV) as add
      on to standard pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis (alendronate 70 mg/ week or
      raloxifene 60 mg/day) in post-menopausal women.

      After informed consent of the patients has been obtained, each patient's potential
      eligibility will be assessed during a &quot;Screening Visit&quot;. Eligible subjects will be stratified
      into two groups: those that are on treatment with alendronate and those that are on treatment
      with raloxifene.

      Subsequently, at baseline, the patients in each group are randomised to receive either WBV or
      no WBV during the first segment of the study. Baseline evaluation of biomarkers of bone
      remodelling, fall risk and back pain will be performed before starting the first segment.
      Patients will return for efficacy and safety evaluations at week 3 and week 6. At 6 weeks
      after baseline the second segment of the study starts: patients that were on WBV during
      segment I will be observed for another 6 weeks without WBV, whereas the patients that did not
      receive WBV during segment I will now be treated with WBV for 6 weeks in segment II. All
      patients will return for additional visits at week 9 and 12 for safety and efficacy
      evaluation.

      Objectives Primary

        1. To establish the effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) on biomarkers of bone remodelling
           in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

        2. To establish the effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) on fall risk and low back pain in
           postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

      Secondary

        1. To compare the effects of WBV treatment to the effects of treatment without WBV on
           biomarkers of bone remodelling, fall risk and low back pain, while keeping standard
           pharmacotherapy as a constant parameter

        2. To compare the effects of WBV in combination with alendronate to the effects of WBV in
           combination with raloxifene on biomarkers of bone remodelling, fall risk and low back
           pain

        3. To evaluate the long-term effects of WBV on biomarkers of bone remodelling, fall risk
           and low back pain

        4. Safety of WBV

      Investigational Medical Device (IMD)

      Whole Body Vibration procedure (WBV) will be performed using Fitvibe® medical (Manufacturer:
      Uniphy Elektromedizin GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany), a certified medical device, in the following
      way:

      Three Sessions per week of treatment, with a minimum of 15 sessions within a period of 6
      weeks One session consists of 10 runs each containing 30 sec vibration intervals with a 15
      sec plateau, interrupted by 30 sec pauses Frequency of 30 Hz Amplitude of 2 mm

      Efficacy Endpoints Primary

        1. Changes in biomarkers of bone formation (Bone specific alcalic phosphatase - Ostase) and
           bone resorption (cross links of N-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen - N-Tx) during
           treatment with WBV

        2. Changes in fall risk (Tinetti Mobility test) and low back pain (11 point NAS) during
           treatment with WBV

      Secondary

        1. Changes in Ostase and N-Tx biomarkers during the first 3 weeks of treatment with WBV

        2. Changes in Ostase and N-Tx biomarkers during Segment II in Group I a and II a

        3. Changes in fall risk (Tinetti Mobility test) and low back pain (11 point NAS) during the
           first 3 weeks of treatment with WBV

        4. Changes in fall risk (Tinetti Mobility test) and low back pain (11 point NAS) during
           Segment II in Group I a and II a

      Safety Variables Routine physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, body height and
      adverse events

      Statistical Methods The confirmatory analysis is based on the primary criterion &quot;Effect of
      WBV&quot;, measured with the changes in markers of bone formation Ostase and N-Tx as well as fall
      risk and low back pain from start to end of WBV segment of the study (within group
      comparison). Since normal distribution cannot be assumed for the test variables, the
      Wilcoxon-rank-test will be used as two-sided test on difference.

      The final evaluation of the primary criteria will be performed hierarchically in the
      following order:

        1. &quot;changes in marker Ostase during treatment with WBV&quot;

        2. &quot;changes in marker N-Tx during treatment with WBV&quot;

        3. &quot;changes in fall risk during treatment with WBV&quot;

        4. &quot;changes in low back pain during treatment with WBV&quot;

      The hypothesis for the four tests on difference are:

      H0: µ1-µ2 = 0 H1: µ1-µ2 = 0 The experiment wise multiple level alpha is defined as alpha =
      0.05 two-sided respectively as required for confirmatory studies. If the primary hypothesis
      tests are performed in the given order (1. to 4.) the test can be performed with full alpha
      as long as the result for the previous test turns to be significant (Principle of a priori
      ordered hypotheses).

      The confirmatory analysis is performed using the ITT population (intention-to-treat).
