      This study investigates if using a very low carbohydrate diet during combined chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy is safe and if it can be tolerated by patients.

      Standard treatment for pancreatic cancer includes chemotherapy concurrent with radiation
      therapy (chemoradiation).

      This study is a phase I trial to determine the safety of dietary manipulation during
      chemoradiation for pancreatic cancer. Specifically, pre-clinical data from mouse studies
      indicates a ketogenic diet increases tumor cell killing.

      Participants will:

        -  Utilize a specialized ketogenic diet designed by bionutritional services of the clinical
           research unit. This diet begins 2 days before chemoradiation and continues through at
           least 5 weeks of chemoradiation.

        -  Have blood drawn for research purposes weekly to determine measurements of oxidative
           stress

        -  Have urine collected sporadically through the study to determine measurements of
           oxidative stress

        -  Keep a diary of concomitant medications, side effects, and blood sugars

        -  Have follow-up to monitor for outcomes and overall survival

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a cytological or histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma arising
             in the pancreas. Adenosquamous cancers will be acceptable.

          -  Hypertensive medication should be initiated or increased for optimal blood pressure
             control according to standard public health guidelines prior to starting the ketogenic
             diet.
