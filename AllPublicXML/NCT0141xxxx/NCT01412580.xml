  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the high returns of schooling in developing countries, policymakers pay a lot of
      attention to increasing school access. But if the mother is deficient in key micronutrients,
      brain development can biologically constrain children's demand for education. To execute this
      strategy, the investigators collect cohort observational data on a previous randomized
      controlled trial with micronutrient supplements offered to HIV-negative pregnant women in Dar
      es Salaam, Tanzania, between 2001 to 2003.

      This is a cohort study which collected follow-up observational data on households which were
      offered micronutrient supplements. The followup study outcomes include various socio-economic
      household characteristics and parental post-natal behaviors.
