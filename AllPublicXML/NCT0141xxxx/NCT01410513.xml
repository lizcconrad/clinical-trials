      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for
      SAR245409 when administered in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab or
           bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with indolent Hon-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL) Mantle
           Cell Lymphoma (MCL) or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR245409, bendamustine and rituximab when
           used in combination in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL

        -  To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab
           or bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL

        -  To determine the antitumor activity of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab or
           bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL

  <detailed_description>

      All subjects will take SAR245409 twice daily. All subjects will receive SAR245409 as long as
      there is clinical benefit.

      Combination therapy with SAR245409, bendamustine and rituximab , will be administered over a
      28 day cycle for up to 6 to 8 cycles.

      Subjects receiving the doublet combination , SAR245409 plus rituximab will receive weekly
      rituximab for 4 - 8 weeks. Monthly Rituximab may be continued beyond 8 weeks.
