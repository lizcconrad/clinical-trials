    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have a documented diagnosis of a form of primary humoral immunodeficiency
             involving antibody formation and requiring gammaglobulin replacement, as defined
             according to the IUIS Scientific Committee 2009, and by diagnostic criteria according
             to Conley ME, Notarangelo LD, Etzioni A. Diagnostic criteria for primary
             immunodeficiencies. Clin Immunol 1999; 93:190-197. The diagnosis must be confirmed by
             the Medical Director prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject is 2 years or older at the time of screening

          -  Written informed consent is obtained from either the subject or the subject's legally
             authorized representative prior to any study-related procedures and study product
             administration

          -  Subject has been receiving a consistent dose of IgG over a period of at least 3 months
             prior to screening at an average minimum dose over that interval equivalent to 300
             mg/kg body weight (BW)/4 weeks and a maximum dose equivalent to 1.0 gram/kg BW/4 weeks
             at a dosing frequency as follows:

               1. intravenously (IV) at mean intervals of approximately 3 or 4 weeks or

               2. subcutaneously (SC) at mean intervals of approximately 1 or 2 weeks

          -  Subject has a serum trough level of IgG &gt; 5 g/L at screening

          -  Subject has not had a serious bacterial infection within the 3 months prior to
             screening

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a known history of or is positive at screening for one or more of the
             following: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
             hepatitis C virus (HCV), PCR for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Type 1/2

          -  Abnormal laboratory values at screening meeting any one of the following criteria
             (abnormal tests may be repeated once to determine if they are persistent):

               1. Persistent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) &gt;
                  2.5 times the upper limit of normal for the testing laboratory

               2. Persistent severe neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;=
                  500 /mm3)

          -  Subject has creatinine clearance (CLcr) value that is &lt; 60% of normal for age and
             gender

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with or has a malignancy (other than adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix),
             unless the disease-free period prior to screening exceeds 5 years

          -  Subject is receiving anti-coagulation therapy or has a history of thrombotic episodes
             (including deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,

             standard practice at the site

          -  Subject has an ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions (urticaria,
             breathing difficulty, severe hypotension, or anaphylaxis) following IV immunoglobulin,
             SC immunoglobulin, and/or Immune Serum Globulin (ISG) infusions

          -  Subject has immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (IgA less than 0.07g/L) and known anti
             IgA antibodies

          -  Subject is on preventative (prophylactic) systemic antibacterial antibiotics at doses
             sufficient to treat or prevent bacterial infections, and cannot stop these antibiotics
             at the time of screening

          -  Subject has active infection and is receiving antibiotic therapy for the treatment of
             infection at the time of screening

             the opinion of the investigator, would be at significant risk of increased bleeding or
             bruising as a result of subcutaneous therapy

          -  Subject has total protein &gt;9 g/dL or myeloma, or macroglobulinemia (IgM) or
             paraproteinemia

          -  Women of childbearing potential meeting any one of the following criteria

               1. subject presents with a positive pregnancy test

               2. subject is breast feeding

               3. subject intends to begin nursing during the course of the study

               4. subject does not agree to employ adequate birth-control measures (e.g.
                  intrauterine device, diaphragm or condom [for male partner] with spermicidal
                  jelly or foam, or birth control pills/patches) throughout the course of the study

          -  Subject has participated in another clinical study and has been exposed to an
             investigational product (IP) or device within 30 days prior to study enrollment
             (exception: treatment with immunoglobulin pre-study)

          -  Subject is scheduled to participate in another (non-Baxter) non-observational

             administration
