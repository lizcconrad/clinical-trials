  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common clinical problem defined by an abrupt (&lt; 48 hour)
      increase in serum creatinine (SCr) resulting from an injury or insult that causes a
      functional or structural change in the kidney. Despite significant advancements in the care
      of the critically ill child, mortality rates observed in critically ill children who develop
      AKI have not improved. The investigators have shown even &quot;small&quot; increases in SCr, which is
      the standard kidney function marker, are associated with increased child mortality, even when
      outcome was controlled for significant patient co-morbidity. Furthermore, the investigators
      have also shown that the amount of fluid accumulation observed in critically ill children
      with AKI is independently associated with mortality suggesting that earlier dialysis may
      improve survival. However, the investigators also do not want to dialyze patients who don't
      ultimately need dialysis, as it is an invasive procedure. The data cited above highlight the
      need not only to detect AKI early, but also predict it severity in order to optimize clinical
      decision making with respect to fluid administration and dialysis initiation. While
      substantial research has been expended to validate NGAL as an early marker of AKI, it has not
      been studied in the context of clinical decision support to guide a therapeutic intervention.
      The investigators hypothesize that NGAL levels can be used to determine predict which
      critically ill children will develop severe and prolonged AKI with substantial volume
      overload, thereby providing the clinician with a diagnostic tool to guide CRRT initiation.

      The specific aims of this proposal are:

        1. Determine if NGAL (POC plasma and confirmatory urine) concentrations can predict which
           critically ill children will ultimately develop significant (&gt;10%) positive ICU fluid
           accumulation Hypothesis to be tested: Elevated plasma NGAL concentrations (initial
           plasma threshold &gt; 250 ng/ml) will predict which critically ill children will develop a
           positive ICU net fluid accumulation of &gt; 10% of ICU admission weight

        2. Determine if NGAL (POC plasma and confirmatory urine) concentrations can predict which
           critically ill children who develop &gt;10-20% ICU fluid overload will recover urine output
           and kidney function rapidly Hypothesis to be tested: Elevated plasma NGAL concentrations
           (initial urinary threshold &gt;1 ng/mg Cr ) will predict which critically ill children who
           develop &gt;10-20% FO will not have an improvement in AKI as determined by an improvement
           of at least one pRIFLE strata within 24-48 hours of developing pRIFLE-I or pRIFLE-F

        3. Determine if NGAL (POC plasma and confirmatory urine) concentrations can predict kidney
           function recovery in critically ill children develop &gt;10-20% ICU fluid overload who
           receive continuous renal replacement therapy Hypothesis to be tested: Decreasing NGAL
           concentrations will be associated with improvement in urine output and initial
           resolution of AKI in &lt; 72 hours

      This pilot study will be novel in that the investigators will evaluate NGAL levels in near
      real-time, twice daily to guide clinical decision support in terms of fluid administration
      effect assessment and CRRT provision in this critically ill pediatric population.
      Specifically, the investigators will use the NGAL data daily to 1) drive initiation of CRRT
      in children with elevated NGAL and &gt; 10-20% fluid overload and 2) drive CRRT discontinuation
      in patients with decreasing NGAL concentrations. In addition, the investigators will employ
      an adaptive study design to readjust the threshold NGAL during the time course of the study
      if the data suggest adjustment will enrich the data pool.

2)Elevated NGAL will predict which critically ill children who develop greater than 10 to 20% FO will not have an improvement in AKI as determined by an improvement of at least one pRIFLE strata within 24-48 hours of developing pRIFLE &quot;I&quot; or &quot;F.&quot;

    <description>The investigators will use the NGAL data daily to 1) drive initiation of CRRT in children with elevated NGAL and &gt; 10-20% fluid overload and 2) drive CRRT discontinuation in patients with decreasing NGAL concentrations. All members of the Critical Care Medicine and Nephrology divisions have agreed that initiation of CRRT within 24-48 hours of a patient reaching &gt;10% fluid overload is clinically acceptable, and that often the decision to start CRRT has been arbitrary in the past, based on physician bias or preference. All members agree that the current standard of 24-48 hours after &gt;10% is achieved is acceptable and now will be put into standard clinical practice.</description>
