    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a Nordic diet rich in plant-based
      foods and fish on indicators of cardiovascular disease risk at two different levels of salt
      intake.

      The study is a 20-wk randomized controlled crossover trial. The subjects follow a
      salt-restricted diet during the study. The study begins with a 4-wk run-in phase for all
      subjects. After that the subjects are randomly allocated to one of two groups. Group 1
      consumes a healthy Nordic low-salt diet enriched with plant-based foods and fish for 16
      weeks. Group 2 consumes a low-salt diet for 16 weeks. During the 16 weeks, both groups
      receive salt and placebo capsules in a double-blind, crossover fashion (8+8 weeks).
