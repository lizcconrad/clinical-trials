  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to pilot test a behavioral intervention that includes a home
      visit component compared to a clinic only and standard of care for the treatment of obesity
      in preschool age children. The results of this study will inform the design of a larger
      randomized control trial.

      H1: The clinic + home intervention will result in a significantly greater decrease in BMIz
      compared to the in clinic only intervention or pediatric standard of care at 6 months
      post-treatment.
