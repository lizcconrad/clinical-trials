  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Delivery of directed hypofractionated targeted (HT) radiotherapy (RT) tumor boost to the
           dominant tumor lesion in the prostate as identified by multiparametric MRI will increase
           tumor eradication from the prostate.

        2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the multiparametric MRI defined regions at high
           risk of harboring tumors that determine outcome.

        3. 10-15% of men undergoing RT have Circulating DNA or tumor cells (CTC) that are related
           to an adverse treatment outcome.

        4. Quality of life will not differ significantly between the treatment arms.

        5. Prostate cancer-related anxiety will be reduced in the HTIMRT arm, because the patients
           will be aware that the dominant tumor will be targeted with higher radiation dose.

Failure-Free Survival (FFS) is the elapsed time from start of radiotherapy to first documented evidence of biochemical or clinical failure or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

          -  A. Biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  B. T1-T3a disease based on digital rectal exam.

               1. T1a is permitted if peripheral zone biopsies are positive.

               2. T3a disease based on MRI is acceptable.

          -  C. No evidence of metastasis by any clinical criteria or available radiographic tests.

          -  D. Gleason score 6-8.

          -  E. Patients with Gleason score 8 must be offered long term androgen deprivation
             therapy (ADT) and refuse such treatment because only 4-6 (±2 months) months (short
             term ADT) is permitted on this protocol. Gleason score ≥ 8 patients should be
             recommended to receive short term ADT in conjunction with RT. When given, the ADT
             recommended to begin after fiducial marker placement, if applicable; however, ADT is
             permitted to have been started up to two months prior to the signing of consent.

               1. Patients with Gleason score 8 disease must have &lt;40 of the diagnostic tumor
                  tissue involved with tumor.

               2. Patients with Gleason score ≤7 may be treated with 4-6 (±2 months) months of ADT.

          -  F. PSA ≤100 ng/mL within 3 months of enrollment. If PSA was above 100 and dropped to
             ≤100 with antibiotics, this is acceptable for enrollment.

          -  G. If PSA is &gt;15 ng/ml or there is ≥ Gleason 8 disease, a bone scan should be obtained
             ≤4 months before enrollment and should be without evidence of metastasis. A
             questionable bone scan is acceptable if plain x-rays, CT and/or MRI are negative for
             metastasis.

          -  H. No previous pelvic radiotherapy

          -  I. No previous history of radical/total prostatectomy (suprapubic prostatectomy is

             stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (well-differentiated small cell lymphocytic
             lymphoma). If a prior malignancy is in remission for ≥ 5 years then the patient is
             eligible.

          -  K. Identifiable multiparameter functional MRI defined tumor lesion or lesions using a
             1.5T or 3.0T MRI (3.0T preferable), that total in volume &lt;33% of the prostate within 3
             months prior to enrollment.

             a. Multiparametric functional including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of prostate
             and pelvis is required prior to protocol consideration

          -  L. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document

          -  M. Zubrod performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) performance status may be used to estimate Zubrod)

          -  N. Willingness to fill out quality of life/psychosocial forms.

          -  O. Age ≥35 and ≤85 years.

          -  P. Serum testosterone is within 40% of normal assay limits (e.g., x=0.4*lower assay
             limit and x=.04*upper assay limit + upper assay limit),, taken within 4 months of
             enrollment. Patients who have been started on ADT prior to signing consent are not
             required to have a serum testosterone at this level prior to signing consent; but, a
             serum testosterone prior to fiducial marker placement is recommended.

          -  Q. Serum liver function tests (LFTs) taken within 3 months of enrollment.

          -  R. Complete blood counts taken within 3 months of enrollment.

          -  A. Previous pelvic radiotherapy.

          -  B. Previous history of radical prostatectomy.

          -  C. Concurrent, active malignancy, which is not nonmetastatic skin cancer or early
             stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (well-differentiated small cell lymphocytic
             lymphoma). If a prior malignancy is in remission for &lt; 5 years then the patient is not
             eligible

          -  D. Not willing to fill out quality of life/psychosocial questionnaires.
