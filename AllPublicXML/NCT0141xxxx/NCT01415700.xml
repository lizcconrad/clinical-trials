  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implantable feet stimulator proposes to correct the feet's STEPPAGE observed after
      central nervous system's injury such as hemiplegia secondary to stroke. It aims to improve
      the patient's walking floor by removing the STEPPAGE, reducing the effort of walking,
      facilitating the flow and removing anomalies compensatory (such as the mowing of the hip).
      Its objective is to improve the patient's autonomy locomotor.

      The aim of this study is to compare the results of the implementation of an implanted
      stimulator in the levator muscles of the foot to the results obtained by wearing a
      splint-type reliever, which is considered standard treatment, in order to determine if the
      implanted stimulation may be proposed in the treatment of foot drop off a neurological
      center.
