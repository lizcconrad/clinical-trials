    <textblock>
      Context:

      Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer and the second most common cause of
      cancer-related deaths in European and North-American men.

      After external radiotherapy or brachytherapy, the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) value is
      often fluctuating and PSA nadir may only be reached after 2 years or more and may remain
      detectable several years after the completion of radiation. Moreover, PSA bounces and blips
      render patients and physicians very anxious about any possibility of a relapse. In this
      context, biomarkers that could predict the response to radiation earlier than PSA for
      patients with prostate cancer appear long overdue.

      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy at 3 Tesla without endorectal coil is a non invasive
      procedure which allows quantification of metabolites such as Choline, Creatine, Polyamines
      and Citrate within the prostate gland.

      Objectives:

      The investigators are conducting a French prospective study on the Evaluation of the Response
      to Irradiation with MR Spectroscopy (ERIS). Their purpose is to monitor the early response of
      radiation with 3D MR Spectroscopy during the first year after completion of radiation and its
      impact on biochemical control. Therefore, the ERIS trial aims to investigate whether or not
      there could be a correlation between the time course of PSA and that of Choline and Citrate.
