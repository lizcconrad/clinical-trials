    <textblock>
      This open label Phase 1 study involves treating subjects with advanced cancer with BAY80-6946
      in combination with paclitaxel. It will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BAY80-6946 in combination with paclitaxel. The trial will
      involve multiple participating sites from the US. Following determination of the MTD, an
      expansion cohort of 20 evaluable subjects with breast cancer was planned. Finally, 16
      patients have been enrolled to treatment (Cohort 3). A new expansion cohort with modified
      dosing cohort is now introduced (Cohort 4: breast cancer expansion cohort with modified
      dosing) in which another 20 subjects are planned to be enrolled to treatment.

          -  Pre-existing interstitial lung disease and/or severe impaired pulmonary function

          -  History of cardiac disease; congestive heart failure (CHF) &gt;NYHA Class II; active
             coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry;
             new onset angina within 3 months prior to study entry or unstable angina, or
             ventricular cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy

          -  Prior diagnosis of Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia (defined as consistent
             fasting blood or plasma glucose &gt; 125 mg/dL) or HgBA1c â‰¥ 7%

          -  Active clinically serious infections Grade â‰¥ 2 (NCI-CTCAE version 4.0), including
             viral hepatitis

          -  Poorly controlled seizure disorder

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or
             diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic hepatitis C or B

          -  Subjects undergoing renal dialysis

          -  Known bleeding diathesis
