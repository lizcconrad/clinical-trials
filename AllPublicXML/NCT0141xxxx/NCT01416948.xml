  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of methylphenidate and galantamine in the treatment of
      persistent cognitive symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or
      traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are prevalent in
      service members returning from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and
      Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). Virtually all individuals who suffer TBI (TBI) have acute
      cognitive effects, and a significant number have persistent symptoms. A large number of
      individuals with PTSD also report problems with cognition, however, little is known about the
      treatment of cognitive complaints in either condition and less is known about cognitive
      complaints in individuals with co-occurring TBI and PTSD.

      There is some preclinical evidence that both the cholinergic and catecholaminergic
      neurotransmitter systems play important roles in cognitive function in healthy individuals as
      well as those with mTBI and/or PTSD. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of two
      pharmacotherapies, one that predominantly augments cholinergic function (galantamine [GAL])
      and one that augments predominantly catecholaminergic function (methylphenidate [MPH]), for
      reducing cognitive symptoms in individuals with TBI and/or PTSD.

      Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled design, 159 individuals with TBI and/or
      PTSD with persistent cognitive complaints will be randomized to receive galantamine 12 mg
      BID, methylphenidate 20 mg BID, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective is to assess
      the efficacy of galantamine and methylphenidate in reducing cognitive complaints in patients
      with PTSD and/or TBI. Secondary objectives are to assess the extent to which non-cognitive
      distress responds to galantamine or methylphenidate, and assess the effect that galantamine
      and methylphenidate have on cognitive performance.

    <measure>Ruff Neurobehavioral Inventory - Postmorbid Cognitive Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Ruff Neurobehavioral Inventory (RNBI; Ruff &amp; Hibbard, 2003) is a self-report instrument for assessment of a wide range of symptoms (cognitive, emotional, and physical), as well as quality of life and daily functioning. It was designed to assess these areas in individuals who have recently been affected by an injury, illness, or other stressor. The Postmorbid Cognitive scale will be used as the primary outcome measure in this study. The Postmorbid Cognitive scale consists of 24 items assessing Attention/Concentration, Executive Functions, Learning/Memory, and Speech/Language.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rivermead Postconcussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPCSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The RPCSQ (N King, 1995), which can be self-administered or given by an interviewer, asks patients to rate the severity of 16 different symptoms commonly found after a mild traumatic brain injury. Patients are asked to rate the severity of each symptom over the past week and compare to the severity before their injury. This instrument will be used to determine the extent to which the broad spectrum of TBI symptoms respond to GAL and MPH.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ - 9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ - 9 (Pfizer, 1999) is the self-administered 9 item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire. This instrument will be used to determine the extent to which GAL and MPH improve depressive symptoms in participants with PTSD and/or TBI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist - Specific Event Version (PCL-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist - Specific Event Version (Weathers, 1993) is a 17 item self-report measure of DSM IV symptoms of PTSD in response to a specific event, used for screening and diagnosis of PTSD and monitoring symptom change during treament. This measure will be used to determine the extent to which the broad spectrum of PTSD symptoms responds to GAL and MPH.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PreMorbid-Postmorbid Difference Score on Cognitive Scale of Ruff Neurobehavioral Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement will be used to determine the extent to which GAL and MPH reduce the perceived difference between subjects' premorbid and postmorbid cognitive functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological Tests of Memory, Attention and Other Executive Functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>These measurements will be used to determine the extent to which GAL and MPH affect objective cognitive functioning in participants with PTSD and/or TBI as measured on the following neuropsychological tests: Rey Verbal Auditory Learning Test; Trail Making Test; WAIS-III Processing Speed Index and Digit Span; Digit Vigilance test; WMS-III Letter-Number Sequencing; Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised; Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test; Continuous Performance Test; and D-KEFS Verbal Fluency.</description>

The drug will be gradually tapered during weeks 12-14. If adverse events ensue, the subject's dose can be held at the current dose (rather than proceeding with scheduled dose increases) or reduced to the previous dose.
