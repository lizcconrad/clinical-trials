      This proposal is a phase I/II feasibility study to demonstrate that mixed chimerism can be
      established with minimal risk in recipients with hemoglobinopathies treated with
      Campath-1H-based nonmyeloablative conditioning and graft engineering to reduce the risk of
      Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), but preserve engraftment of donor cells.

        1. Inclusion Criteria

             The following criteria are established to identify subjects with hemoglobinopathies,
             hematologic or bone marrow failure syndromes who have a high predicted morbidity and
             are at risk for early mortality:

                  characterized by severe chronic anemia.

               -  Patients with other complex and transfusion-dependent hemoglobinopathies,
                  including sickle cell disease.

               -  Patients with sickle disease who have one or more of the following:

                    -  Overt or silent stroke

                    -  Neurocognitive impairment

                    -  Pain crises 2 or more episodes per year for past year

                    -  Osteonecrosis involving 1 or more joints

                    -  Evidence of retinopathy

                    -  Priapism

                    -  Microalbuminuria or evidence of sickle cell nephropathy

                    -  Alloimmunization

             Subjects must also meet all of the following general inclusion criteria:

               -  Subjects must have a related donor which can consist of Histocompatibility
                  Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched donor up to haploidentical match, mismatched for
                  1, 2 or 3 HLA-A, B or -DR loci.

               -  Subjects must have adequate cardiopulmonary function as documented by
                  echocardiogram or radionuclide scan. (Shortening fraction &gt;26% or ejection
                  fraction &gt;40% or ≥ 80% of normal value for age).

               -  Subjects must have adequate pulmonary function documented by Forced expiratory
                  volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 50% of predicted for age and/or Diffusing capacity
                  of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (corrected for hemoglobin) ≥50% of
                  predicted for age for patients &gt; 10 years of age.

               -  Subjects must have adequate hepatic function as demonstrated by a serum albumin ≥
                  3.0 mg/dL, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) or serum glutamic
                  oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) less than or equal to 5 times the upper limit of
                  normal. Liver biopsy or a liver MRI is necessary if the patient has received
                  chronic transfusions for over a year and/or has a ferritin level of ≥ 1600.

               -  Subjects must have adequate renal function as demonstrated by a serum creatinine
                  less than or equal to 2 mg/dL. If serum creatinine is ≥ 2 mg/dL, then a
                  creatinine clearance test or nuclear medicine GFR should document GFR of ≥ 50
                  ml/min/1.73 m2.

               -  Subjects or legal guardians must give written informed consent.
