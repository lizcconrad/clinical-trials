  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to evaluate the effect of additional chemotherapy in
      postoperation therapy of cervical cancer patients with risk factors (big tumor, deep invasion
      or tumor thrombi in the vascular system).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer has a very high morbidity. Many patients need additional therapy after
      surgery in order to elevate the survival rate and life quality. In this research, we are
      going to give additional therapy to patients who have big tumor, deep invasion or tumor
      thrombi in the vascular system after surgery. randomized control method will be used in this
      research, in order to compare the survival rate and side effects between radiation therapy
      only, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy with additional
      chemotherapy. 3D-CRT and Topotecan will be used in this research.

    <description>Including criteria: cervical cancer patients after surgery with big tumor, deep invasion or tumor thrombi in the vascular system, but without lymph invasion, positive surgery margin or parametrium invasion. Patients in this group receive radiation therapy only. radiation therapy regimen: 3D-CRT pelvic radiation, 95%CTV DT 45Gy/25f. Radiation field include tumor bed and regional lymph nodes area. Upper border: branching of abdominal aorta. The radiation fields go down along the iliac vessels (including regions of 7mm out of the iliac vessels) and include the tumor bed region. Lower border: the inferior margin of obturator foramen.</description>

    <description>Including criteria: cervical cancer patients after surgery with big tumor, deep invasion or tumor thrombi in the vascular system, but without lymph invasion, positive surgery margin or parametrium invasion. Patients in this group receive concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. radiation therapy regimen is the same with radiation therapy only group. Chemotherapy regimen: Topotecan (1.5mg /m2 d1,2, 1mg d3) and Cisplatin (25mg /m2 d1-3). Chemotherapy will be carry out in the 2nd and 6th week of radiation therapy.</description>
