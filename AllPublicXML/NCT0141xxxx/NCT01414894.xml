  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine how well Triple-H works and how safe it is. The
      investigators are hoping to determine the effects of starting the therapy early and to
      explore if hypervolemia and/or hypertension are beneficial, and what the optimal target
      ranges are.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age more than or equal to 18 years

          2. Aneurysmal SAH of any clinical grade

          3. Head computed tomography demonstrating SAH

          4. Cerebral angiography revealing the presence of cerebral aneurysm(s) in a location that
             explains the SAH

          5. Treatment of aneurysm with clipping or coiling must be carried out prior to
             randomization and within 72 hours of bleeding

          6. Signed consent by study participant or applicable legal representative within 72 hours
             after SAH

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of traumatic SAH

          2. Non-aneurysmal SAH as indicated by no demonstrable aneurysm by cerebral angiography

          3. Presence of an unsecured intracranial aneurysm(s) at risk of rupture that in the
             opinion of the Investigator would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality
             of the data

          4. Delayed referral with clipping/coiling greater than 72 hours after the initial
             bleeding

          5. Time of symptom onset cannot be reliably determined

          6. Intracranial hypertension (ICP &gt;25 mm Hg) at the time of screening

          7. History within the past six months and/or physical findings on admission of
             decompensated congestive heart failure (NYHA functional class III or IV, or objective
             class C or D)

          8. Acute, evolving or recent myocardial infarction

          9. Cardiac arrhythmia or second and third degree atrio-ventricular block causing
             hemodynamic instability

         10. Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis

         11. Suspected or confirmed pregnancy

         12. Non English speaking

         13. A condition that would preclude the performance of the neurobehavioral test battery
             due to a prior diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, stroke, degenerative condition,
             cerebral tumor, or mental retardation

         14. Severe terminal disease with life expectancy less than 6 months

         15. Refusal of consent
