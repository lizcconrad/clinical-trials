    <textblock>
      The overall study objective is to evaluate Chondrofix Osteochondral Allograft (&quot;Chondrofix&quot;)
      for the repair of osteochondral lesions in the knee. This includes, but is not limited to
      primary cartilage lesion repair and revision of failed prior cartilage repair treatments. The
      study hypothesis is that Chondrofix Allograft will provide pain relief and functional
      improvement as demonstrated by a comparative analysis of baseline clinical evaluations at 24
      months of follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Knee cartilage injuries are a major cause of pain and functional impairment in young to
      middle age adults and can lead to progressive joint degeneration. In response to challenges
      with current cartilage repair options, Chondrofix Allograft was developed as an off-the-shelf
      treatment option adding to the variety of cartilage reparation offerings.

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, post-market clinical outcomes study designed to
      assess the clinical outcomes of Chondrofix Allograft used in the treatment of both primary
      and revision cartilage repair cases. Study design includes up to 6 qualified investigational
      sites with 50 subjects enrolled across all centers during an 18 month enrollment period.
      Study subjects will be followed postoperatively for 5 years. The Investigators who are
      responsible for the conduct of this study in compliance with this protocol will be orthopedic
      surgeons who are skilled in the techniques of articular cartilage repair.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Generally, the following inclusion criteria must be met, however, this is not a complete
        list.

          -  Male and non-pregnant female subjects between 18 and 70 years; subject must be
             skeletally mature

          -  If female, subjects are not pregnant at time of surgery and do not plan on becoming
             pregnant during the first 24 months of the study

          -  Up to two (2) cartilage lesion(s), each measuring less than 8 cm2, of the femoral
             condyle or trochlear groove of the knee

          -  Localized knee pain unresponsive to conservative treatment (e.g., medication, bracing,
             physical therapy) and/or previous surgical intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Generally, if a potential participant meets any of the following criteria, they will not be
        eligible for this study. Additionally, more criteria will be evaluated to confirm
        eligibility as this list is not a complete list of criteria.
