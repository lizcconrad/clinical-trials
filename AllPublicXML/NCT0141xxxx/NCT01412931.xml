  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women are being asked to participate in a research study that is looking for new methods to
      understand and predict premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy—full term
      pregnancy is 40 weeks). In this study the investigators will be looking at proteins in
      vaginal fluid, tissue from the placenta after the baby is born (fetal membranes), and a new
      form of ultrasound of the mouth of the womb (cervix) that measures its length, volume, and
      stiffness, in order to try to know who will have a preterm birth and who will reach full
      term. The investigators will collect the vaginal fluid samples and perform ultrasounds both
      in the clinic throughout pregnancy in normal women, and from women admitted to the hospital
      because they are in early labor. The investigators will collect the placental tissue after
      the baby is born (this is normally discarded). This study will help us to understand the
      process of preterm birth and the investigators hope that this will eventually allow us to
      develop better methods to treat preterm labor and prevent the birth of premature babies.

        Pregnant women with a single intrauterine pregnancy with good gestational age dating, and
        live fetus with no indications for preterm delivery will be enrolled. Three groups of
        subjects will be recruited: a) 50 women with uncomplicated pregnancies and no history of
        preterm birth, b) 50 multiparous women with history of spontaneous preterm labor or preterm
        premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) c) 20 women evaluated on the labor and delivery unit
        because they are deemed to be at high risk for preterm birth. Pregnant women of all races
        and ethnicities will be recruited into the study.
