    <textblock>
      This Phase I, open-label, non-randomized study is designed to determine the absolute
      bioavailability of the standard 2 mg tablet formulation of GSK1120212 co-administered with an
      intravenous microdose (5 μg) dose of [14C]-labelled GSK1120212 (7.4 kBq) in subjects with
      solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic sampleswill be obtained up to 10 days post-dose. Safety
      assessments, including assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory values (hematology
      and clinical chemistry) and vital signs, will be performed throughout the study. After
      completing all assessments, eligible subjects may transition to MEK114375, an open-label,
      rollover study to continue treatment with GSK1120212.

             anticoagulants such as warfarin as long as INR is monitored during the study according
             to clinical practice.

             in the table due to Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones are not excluded.
             Laboratory results obtained during Screening should be used to determine eligibility
             criteria. In situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted range, the
             investigator may opt to retest the subject and the subsequent within-range screening
             result may be used to confirm eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently receiving cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy with delayed toxicity,
             extensive radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or major surgery) within
             the last 3 weeks; chemotherapy regimens without delayed toxicity within the last 2
             weeks; or use of an investigational anti-cancer drug within 28 days preceding dosing
             of GSK1120212; use of any other investigational product within 30 days, 5 half-lives

          3. Current use of a prohibited medication (Section 8.2) or requires any of these
             medications during the study NOTE: Use of anticoagulants such as warfarin is

             practice.

          4. Has unresolved Grade 2 or greater toxicity (based on NCI-CTCAE, version 4.0) [NCI,
             2009] from previous anti-cancer therapy except alopecia and Grade 2 anemia level.

          5. Has pre-existing Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy.

          6. Has participated in a study that resulted in or made a donation of blood or blood

             surgery, small or large bowel resection, or cholecystectomy should be excluded) that
             may interfere significantly with the absorption of drugs. If clarification is needed
             as to whether a condition will significantly affect absorption of drugs, contact the
             GSK Medical Monitor.

          8. Has any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical (aside from malignancy exception
             above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subject's
             safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures, in the
             opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor.

          9. Has a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.

         10. Has a history or current evidence/risk of RVO or CSR:

                  hypertension or diabetes mellitus, or history of hyperviscosity or
                  hypercoagulability syndromes)

               -  Intraocular pressure &gt;21 mmHg as measured by tonography

             compression.

             Note: Subjects previously treated for these conditions that have had stable central
             nervous system disease (verified with consecutive imaging studies) for &gt;3 months, are
             asymptomatic and are not currently taking corticosteroids, or are on stable dose of
             corticosteroids for at least 1 month prior to Day 1 of the study are permitted.

             York Heart Association [NYHA, 1994] (Appendix 3) NOTE: Subjects with BBB are not
             excluded from this study; however, if the underlying cause of the BBB is exclusionary
             or if the BBB is new onset (therefore, potentially reflective of an evolving cardiac
             condition), the subject should be excluded.
