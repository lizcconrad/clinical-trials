  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will study whether the health care costs and health utilities differ in patients with gout
      and those without gout and whether they differ between those with more severe versus less
      severe gout

      The purpose of this project is to study the out-patient and inpatient utilization and costs
      associated with tophaceous gout (a classic form of treatment-failure gout), compare these
      costs to patients with non-tophaceous gout and evaluate health utilities associated with
      these gout states. The analyses will be conducted in a manner to support a burden of illness
      type of presentation / manuscript.

      Study Questions

        1. What are the VA health care costs (inpatient and outpatient) for patients with gout
           compared to those without gout?

        2. Does health utility, as calculated by SF-6D, differ in patients with gout compared to
           patients without gout and between tophaceous and non-tophaceous gout?

        3. What are the relationships between costs and health utility?

        4. How does the burden of illness differ by subgroups of gout patients (costs and
           utilities)?

        5. What are the VA health care costs for patients with tophaceous gout and are they higher
           than patients with non-tophaceous gout?

      Inclusion criteria Patients with and without gout from the Veterans database described above
      will be included in the analyses for Study aims 1 and 5. This is approximately 3000 gout
      patients and 67,000 non-gout patients

      Patients with SF-36 data from the above cohort will be included in the analyses for Study
      aims 2-4. This is approximately 1500 gout patients and 38,000 non-gout patients
