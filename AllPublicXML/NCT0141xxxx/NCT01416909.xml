    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Constipation Treatment
      Protocol and to test whether management according to dose of constipation-inducing
      medications or according to on-going assessment is most effective.

      Patients will undergo a baseline assessment during their regular outpatient visit. With their
      permission, the investigators will audio record this visit for quality control. After the
      study, the recordings will be erased. Patients will be asked to complete 4 questionnaires.
      The investigators will collect contact information so that the follow-up assessments can be
      done by phone.

          -  Patients will be excluded: if they have non-melanoma skin cancer or colorectal or
             gynecological cancer as their primary diagnosis;

          -  if they are excessively debilitated or deemed unlikely to survive for the eight weeks
             of the data collection period;

          -  if they are unable to read and understand English;

          -  if they have an ostomy that changes bowel function;

          -  if they have had abdominal surgery within the past six weeks;

          -  or have a disease process suggestive of mechanical obstruction (tumor or adhesion);

          -  if they have a history of chronic bowel disease (including irritable bowel syndrome,
             chronic constipation prior to cancer onset, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or
             diarrhea as a result of radiation to the pelvis), or report chronic laxative use prior
             to cancer onset.
