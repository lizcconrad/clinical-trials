      A pilot investigation into the stress relieving properties of Vitano® which will assess the
      following hypotheses

      Individuals exposed to Vitano® will demonstrate diminished blood pressure and heart rate
      responses to mental stress compared to individuals in the control condition

      Physiological recovery (BP, HR and cortisol) from mental stress will be enhanced in
      individuals exposed to Vitano® compared to individuals in the control condition

      Vitano® will have positive effects on cognitive functioning.

      Subjective ratings of stress will be reduced in individuals exposed to Vitano® compared to
      individuals in the control condition

      There will be a significant improvement in subjective well-being in individuals taking
      Vitano®.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subject is able to read and understand the Informed Consent Form (ICF), and understand
             study procedures.

          -  The subject has signed the ICF.

          -  Healthy male or female subjects aged 18-35 years inclusive. Attempts will be made to
             achieve an equal gender ratio through appropriate screening procedures, but a failure
             to do so will not preclude analysis of the final data set.

          -  A score above 30 on the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).

          -  The subject agrees to use suitable methods of contraception during the study and for 3
             months afterwards.

          -  The subject is a non-smoker.

          -  The subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, healthy on the basis of medical
             history, vital signs, and the results of routine laboratory tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  The subject consumes more than 5 caffeine-containing beverages per day.

          -  The subject is colour blind.

          -  Clinically significant hepatic or renal abnormality as determined by laboratory tests.

          -  BMI above 33.

          -  History of alcohol, narcotic, benzodiazepine, or other substance abuse or dependence
             within the 12 months preceding Visit 1.

          -  Positive alcohol breath test at any visit. A repeat test will not be allowed. [NOTE:
             subjects must be told to avoid consumption of alcoholic beverages for at least 24
             hours prior to attending the Centre].

          -  Use of any other medication which may interfere with study outcome and/or interfere
             with IMP within the 2 weeks or 5 half lives preceding the first treatment phase, with
             the exception of contraceptive pill, non-steroidal analgesics, and paracetamol. [NOTE:
             Concomitant medications which do not influence study outcome and/or do not interfere
             with IMP may be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator].

          -  Current participation in another clinical trial with an investigational or
             non-investigational drug or device, or participation in another clinical trial within
             the 3 months preceding Visit 1 (screening visit).

          -  Any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, compromises the subject's ability
             to meet protocol requirements or to complete the study.

          -  Moderate or severe anxiety* *If participants are found to have moderate or severe
             anxiety during the screening process then they will be referred to the University
             Counselling service.
