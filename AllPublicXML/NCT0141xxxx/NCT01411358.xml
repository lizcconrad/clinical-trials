    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to each of the three influenza
      vaccine strains included in the licensed seasonal flu vaccine, as measured by
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) at 21 days post immunization in non-elderly and elderly
      subjects in compliance with the requirements of the current European Union (EU)
      recommendations for the evaluation of the immunogenicity for a new formulation of a licensed
      flu vaccine (CPMP/BWP/214/96).
