  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is given after curative surgery for pancreas cancer to try to improve cure
      rates. There are two choices of chemotherapy which are currently considered equal treatments:
      gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil (5FU). This study is trying to determine if one of two standard
      chemotherapies is better than the other depending on whether patients have high or low human
      equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1). hENT1 is a protein that is found in varying
      amounts on pancreas cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this pilot study is based on trying to better deliver adjuvant chemotherapy
      by selecting treatment for patients that is individualized based on the hENT1 biomarker.
      Gemcitabine (gem) requires human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) to enter
      cells. If a pancreatic cancer has low hENT1, gem will not be able to enter cells efficiently.
      5-fluorouracil (5FU) does not require the same transport into cells. Thus, upfront hENT1
      testing will allow determination of therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented pancreatic adenocarcinoma not previously treated with
             systemic therapy.

          -  Complete macroscopic and microscopic (R0) resection for ductal adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas with no evidence of malignant ascites, peritoneal metastases or distant
             metastases. Lack of recurrent and/metastatic disease must be confirmed radiologically
             with CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis prior to enrolment.

          -  Adequate tissue available for IHC testing of hENT1. Histological/cytological
             confirmation of tissue to ensure sufficient material is available for hENT1 analysis
             by the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) is required. Paraffin block sufficient for
             preparing ≥ 6 unstained slides for central storage and testing if required by
             oncologist.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 - 2. (Appendix B)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months based on discretion of treating

          -  Adequate hematologic function defined by the following laboratory parameters:
             Hemoglobin &gt; 100, Platelet count &gt; 100 and Absolute granulocyte count &gt; 1.5.

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function defined by the following laboratory parameters:
             AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 X upper limit of institutional normal, bilirubin ≤ upper limit of
             institutional normal, and calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mL/min using the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula, if just below 50 mL/min based on this formula then GFR ≥ 50
             mL/min as determined.
