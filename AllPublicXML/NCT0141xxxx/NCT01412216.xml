      The purpose of this study are twofold:

        1. To understand the effects of physical inactivity (sedentarism) on vascular function,
           insulin resistance and inflammation;

        2. To assess the role of a dietary intervention (fish oil) in counteracting the effects of
           physical inactivity on vascular function and inflammation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects: Subjects must be free from any acute, chronic or debilitating
             medical conditions. Healthy status will be established on the basis of clinical
             history, electrocardiogram, clinical biochemical screening tests of blood and urine, a
             physical examination, and where necessary a chest radiograph.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any active acute or chronic medical problem: Any subject with symptoms of active
             illness (e.g., fever, leukocytosis, hypertension) will be excluded from study. The
             exclusion criteria will also include history or evidence for psychiatric disorders,
             hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), renal insufficiency, thyroid
             disease, alcohol or drug abuse, viral hepatitis, deep venous thrombosis or anemia.
             Individuals with a history of psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric disorders will also
             be excluded, such as alcoholism, drug dependency including dependency on tobacco,
             major mood disorders such as major depression and manic depressive illness,
             schizophrenic disorders, anxiety disorders including panic disorder, generalized
             anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder,
             agoraphobia, claustrophobia, paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality
             disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and
             antisocial personality disorder. In addition, potential subjects with a first order
             relative with a history of major depressive illness, manic depressive illness,
             schizophrenia, agoraphobia or panic disorder will also be excluded from entry to this
             study. Finally, individuals who are unaware of specific psychiatric diagnoses who have
             a history of having been treated with antidepressant, neuroleptic medications or major
             tranquilizers will be excluded from study. However, a personal history of limited
             prior counseling or psychotherapy (e.g., for adjustment reactions) will not
             necessarily be exclusionary.
