  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interactive games (virtual reality) have recently been the center of interest and scientific
      discussion in the field of cognitive and functional rehabilitation. From their entertaining
      and contextual aspects, off-the-shelf video games are potentially interesting tools as
      adjunct to the patient care, especially for maintaining instrumental activities of daily
      living (IADL) autonomy.

      Disease and physical inactivity worsen the patient's ability in the IADLs, thus reducing
      health related quality of life (HRQL). This decrease in cognitive and functional abilities
      can be slowed down using adapted rehabilitation program.

      However, there is no randomized controlled study comparing usual physical therapy to virtual
      reality gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Wii or the Xbox 360 Kinect.

      Off-the-shelf gaming consoles offer a large range of games where cognitive and functional
      abilities from geriatric patients could be stimulated and consequently HRQL improved.

      However, a better knowledge of the potential cognitive and functional improvement processes
      from virtual reality rehabilitation in institutional routine is needed to enhance the quality
      and the range of the available care in old adults.

      This study will not only be a validation platform of virtual reality as stand alone
      rehabilitation process but also will assess the cost effectiveness of off-the-shelf gaming
      consoles in HRQL improvement of old adults.

      The investigators will compare the efficacy of two off-the-shelf gaming consoles in HRQL
      changes of patients with Alzheimer disease and related disorders.

      •Method

      This study is a randomized controlled trial that comprises two study phases :

      Phase one; comparing three parallel groups where therapists and assessors will be kept blind
      of study objectives, and Phase two, the investigators will take the most cost-effective
      gaming console from phase one (Nintendo Wii or Xbox 360 Kinect) and the investigators will
      use it as an adjunct to physical therapy compared to physical therapy alone, with respect to
      the same amount of rehabilitation time.

      The interventions are of 120min/week for 6 weeks and a follow-up at 4 weeks after
      intervention.

      Patients will be randomized in either Xbox 360 Kinect group - a Nintendo Wii group - or
      physical therapy as the 'gold' standard condition.

      All groups will receive the same amount of rehabilitation time. Power and sample calculation
      for phase two will be based on phase one results.
