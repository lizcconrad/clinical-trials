  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a two-arm randomized clinical trial to pilot the feasibility of a
      communication training intervention for primary care clinicians, linked to a community
      program referral, on use of the 5As to promote physical activity in underserved patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus on training clinicians to communicate effectively using the 5As and
      patient-centered communication skills (Aim 1). When implemented fully, the intervention will
      also include referral to a community fitness program. Clinicians will be randomly assigned to
      two groups (1 and 2). Group 1 will participate in the training intervention first; group 2
      will act as a wait-list control for Group 1. The primary outcome, the effectiveness of the
      intervention on clinician use of the 5As during routine office visits, will be measured by
      examining 371 audio-recorded patient visits prior to, immediately, after, and 6 months after
      the clinician is trained. Secondary outcomes include whether the communication training
      intervention improved patients' perceived competence to adopt physical activity (Aim 2)and
      whether clinicians believe that the communication intervention addressed pertinent barriers
      to promoting exercise (Aim 3). Exploratory outcomes (Aim 4) will [assess potential mediators
      of the intervention's effect, examine the effect of the intervention on actual physical
      activity levels in a subset of participants, and create a taxonomy of communication markers
      for each of the 5As.]

    <description>The mean 5A Score of patients from clinicians who complete the communicatin interventon will be higher thant the mean 5A Score of patients from physicisns that have not been trained. Analytic plan: Unadjusted analysis will use two-sample t-tests to compare means. Adjusted analyses will use linear mixed effects models as described in the Statistical Analysis section.</description>

    <description>This study will examine the effect of primary care clinicians' communication intervention linked to a community-based exercise program. We will use the 5As in discussion of physical activity in 371 office visits in an ethnically diverse, primarily low income patient population. Secondary and exploratory aims are to provide pilot information on [feasibility and sustainability of the intervention from the patients' and clinicians' perspective and derive effect sizes on the intervention's effect on objective changes in physical activity in a subset of participants.</description>
