  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irinotecan is one of key drug used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The incidence of
      irinotecan induced diarrhea varies between 60-90%, with severe diarrhea in 20-40%. The main
      cause of diarrhea is one of irinotecan metabolites, SN-38 which is in the liver
      glucuronidated and subsequently expelled into the intestine. Due to the bacterial enzyme
      beta-D-glucuronidase in intestinal lumen it is deconjugated. This form causes direct damage
      of intestinal mucosa associated with malabsorption and the development of diarrhea. It is
      known that probiotic bacteria, reduce activity of intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase and
      therefore these bacteria could be applied in the prevention of diarrhea in patients treated
      by this food supplement. Given their low toxicity, good tolerability, probiotics may be an
      important part of supportive therapy. This is a first study aimed to determine the
      effectiveness of the probiotics in the prophylaxis of irinotecan induced diarrhea due to
      reduction intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase activity.
