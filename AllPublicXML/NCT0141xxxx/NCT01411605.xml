  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, childhood and adolescent obesity has reached epidemic proportions despite major
      efforts to promote weight reduction. Pediatric obesity commonly presages adult obesity and is
      associated with the development of weight-related comorbid conditions and increased
      morbidity.

      Regular physical activity is an important modality of obesity management. Despite
      controversies, poor exercise tolerance has frequently been reported in youth obesity and the
      cause of this limited exercise tolerance remains unknown. Several factors accompanying
      obesity may interfere with exercise tolerance in obese populations. Respiratory factors, such
      as decreased thoracic compliance, increased airway resistance and breathing at low pulmonary
      volumes are associated with obesity and may impact exercise intolerance in this population.
      Moreover, even in people with otherwise normal lungs, the normal ventilatory responses to
      exercise can become constrained in obesity. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms
      underlying this exercise intolerance remains fundamental in order to favour long term
      adherence to exercise training. This is especially true in youth populations, in which the
      management of overweight and obesity must be undertaken as soon as possible, due to the early
      onset of cardiovascular risk factors.

      The main purpose of this study is to determine early-onset cardio-respiratory mortality
      factors in obese adolescents as well as their relation with exercise intolerance (i.e.
      dyspnea) when compared with age and gender-paired normal-weight volunteers.
