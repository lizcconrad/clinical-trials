  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Intervention Development Study (IDS) to quantify the physical demands (using
      biomechanical investigation) of a 2-phase (beginning &amp; intermediate), 32-week yoga program
      designed for community-dwelling older adults. Additionally, the IDS will explore the
      adherence and adverse events of participation in the program. Data from the IDS will be used
      to develop evidenced-based yoga programs, which the investigators postulate will be
      associated with fewer musculoskeletal side effects compared to non-evidence based yoga
      programs. The investigators also postulate that evidenced-based tailoring of yoga for seniors
      will enhance adherence and efficacy. The programs developed during this IDS will be tested in
      an expanded, Phase II, Randomized Controlled Trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yoga is currently being recommended to restore and preserve strength, flexibility, balance, &amp;
      physical capacity in older adults; however, our clinical trial experiences suggest that
      without proper evidenced-based prescription, Yoga participation can be ineffective or even
      injurious for seniors. To address this lack of evidence-based knowledge, the proposed IDS
      will: 1) quantify the physical demands of a 32-wk Yoga program designed for independent
      ambulatory seniors; 2) characterize the relations between these demands and participant
      physical characteristics; 3) examine the adherence, efficacy, &amp; safety of the program; and 4)
      characterize the relations among reported adverse events, baseline participant
      characteristics, and Yoga physical demands.
