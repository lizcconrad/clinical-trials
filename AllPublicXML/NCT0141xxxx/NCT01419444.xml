    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine whether treatment of voice disorders can be
      provided just as effectively using telemedicine as it can using on-site, traditional therapy.
      An exercise protocol for improving airflow with voicing has been demonstrated to be effective
      in a prior UAMS investigation (Protocol 107454). These exercises are used as part of the
      normal clinic routine at UAMS working with individuals with voice problems. The three
      exercises used are: gargling with and without voicing; cup bubble blowing with and without
      voicing; and, stretch and flow exercises, which involves the use of a piece of tissue to
      provide visual biofeedback on the ability to use proper airflow with voicing. The purpose of
      the exercises is to increase airflow and breathiness in the voice and reduce muscle tension.
      In addition, patients will be taught to use a &quot;confidential voice&quot; or gentle voice during
      speaking.

      The investigators voice patients come from all over the state and many cannot return for
      regular treatment. Developing a way to provide treatment to them closer to home could greatly
      improve quality of care and quality of life. Twenty participants will participate for 12
      sessions each. All participants will be evaluated at UAMS before and after treatment as part
      of standard care and will, upon consent, be randomized to receive treatment via telemedicine
      at an AHEC site or at UAMS Medical Center. Homework will be provided along with log sheets.
      Results of airflow measures using an airflow-recording device (Viasys, KAY/PENTAX) pre- and
      post treatment will determine whether telemedicine results are equal to results of
      traditional, on-site treatment. The investigators hypothesize that results from treatment
      using telemedicine will be equivalent to results for onsite, traditional treatment.
