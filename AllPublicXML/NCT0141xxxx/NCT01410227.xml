    <description>Treatment success was defined as the extent of control of bleeding episodes (BEs) using a mean efficacy rating score of &lt;2.5 for a participant's BEs treated with study product (recombinant von Willebrand Factor [rVWF] with or without recombinant factor VIII [rFVIII]) during the study period. Scores used: Excellent = 1 - actual infusions ≤ estimated number of infusions required to treat BE; no additional VWF required (all BEs); Good = 2 - &gt;1-2 infusions (minor/moderate BEs) or &lt;1.5 infusions (major BEs) greater than estimated required to control BE; no additional VWF required (all BEs); Moderate = 3 ≥ 3 infusions (minor/moderate BEs) or ≥ 1.5 infusions (major BEs) greater than estimated required to control BE; no additional VWF required (all BEs); None = 4 - severe uncontrolled bleeding or intensity of bleeding not changed; additional VWF required.

      <pre_assignment_details>49 participants provided informed consent and were screened for the study, of which 37 were exposed to study product. Reasons for discontinuation were 6 screen failures, consent withdrawn by 3 participants, 1 physician decision, 1 participant received high doses of rFVIII for oral procedure and arm for which 1 participant was eligible was closed.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>In Part A, (pharmacokinetic [PK] assessment followed by on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes [BEs] for 6 months) participants were initially infused either with 50 IU/kg recombinant von Willebrand Factor:von Willebrand Ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo rVWF) [rVWF] administered together with 38.5 IU/kg recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) [rVWF:rFVIII] or 50 IU/kg rVWF administered together with saline. Participants then crossed over to the alternate infusion after washout (PK). For on-demand treatment, participants received study product [VWF:rFVIII or rVWF], where BEs were initially treated with rVWF:rFVIII and subsequently with rVWF with or without rFVIII, based on FVIII levels (dose based on previous FVIII levels or if not available from the individual participant's PK data at discretion of investigator). In part, B participants continued to receive on-demand treatment for BEs with study product [VWF:rFVIII or rVWF] for a further 6 months.</description>

          <description>In Part A, (pharmacokinetic [PK] assessment followed by on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes [BEs] for 6 months) participants were initially infused either with 50 IU/kg recombinant von Willebrand Factor:von Willebrand Ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo rVWF) [rVWF] administered together with 38.5 IU/kg recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) [rVWF:rFVIII] or 50 IU/kg rVWF administered together with saline. Participants then crossed over to the alternate infusion after washout (PK). For on-demand treatment, participants received study product [VWF:rFVIII or rVWF], where BEs were initially treated with rVWF:rFVIII and subsequently with rVWF with or without rFVIII, based on FVIII levels (dose based on previous FVIII levels or if not available from the individual participant's PK data at discretion of investigator). Participants then exited the study or could opt to sign informed consent to move to Arm 1 receive treatment for bleeding episodes with study product.</description>

          <description>In Part A, participants initially underwent a first PK assessment of an infusion of 80 IU/kg recombinant von Willebrand Factor Ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo rVWF) [rVWF]. After the first PK assessment participants received on demand treatment for bleeding episodes (BEs) with study product [VWF:rFVIII or rVWF], where BEs were initially treated with rVWF:rFVIII and subsequently with rWVF with or without rFVIII, based on FVIII levels. If FVIII levels not available, the individual participant's PK data was used to determine rFVIII dose at discretion of investigator. Participants received on-demand treatment for 6 months after the first study product infusion. After 6 months participants underwent a second PK assessment of an infusion of 80 IU/kg rVWF. In part B, participants continued to receive on-demand treatment for BEs with study product [VWF:rFVIII or rVWF] for a further 6 months.</description>

          <description>In Part A, participants received on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes (BEs) with study product (recombinant von Willebrand Factor [rVWF] administered together with recombinant Factor VIII [rFVIII] (rVWF:rFVIII) or rVWF alone), where BEs were initially treated with rVWF:rFVIII and subsequently with rVWF with or without rFVIII, based on FVIII levels. If not available, the individual participant's PK data was used to determine rFVIII dose at discretion of investigator. Participants received on-demand treatment for 6 months after the first study product infusion. In part, B participants continued to receive on-demand treatment for BEs with study product [VWF:rFVIII or rVWF] for a further 6 months. No pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were conducted in this arm.</description>

        <title>Number of Infusions of rVWF:rFVIII and/or rVWF Per Bleeding Episode</title>
        <description>The actual number of infusions of recombinant von Willebrand factor:recombinant factor VIII (rVWF:rFVIII) and/or rVWF required to treat a bleeding episode (BE). BEs were to be initially treated with an infusion of rVWF:rFVIII and subsequently with rVWF with or without rFVIII, based on FVIII levels, if available. In cases, where no FVIII levels were available, the individual participant's PK data was used to determine the rFVIII dose. The data set included prospectively estimated BEs treated with study product with an available efficacy rating from participants in the Full Analysis Set.</description>

One Bethesda Unit (BU) is thereby defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreased the measured activity in the assays to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assays were validated using human plasma samples from two type 3 VWD patients with low (1-2 BU/mL) and high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non-human primates immunized with human rVWF (&gt;100 BU/mL).
