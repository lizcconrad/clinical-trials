  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes has been
      markedly increased in recent years. More and more children and young adults develop this
      devastating disease. Despite of multiple factors (e.g., food, environmental, and genetic
      factors) contributing to the developing of diabetes, increasing evidence demonstrated that
      chronic inflammation and/or atuoimmunity are common issues and play key roles in the
      pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, leading to the insulin resistance and the shortage of
      insulin-producing islet beta cells. Thus, anti-inflammation is becoming a novel approach for
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Evidence that multipotent stem cells derived from human
      cord blood (CB-SCs) can control inflammation and autoimmune responses by altering regulatory
      T cells (Tregs) and human islet beta cell-specific T cell clone in type 1 diabetes offers
      promise for a new approach to treat type 2 diabetes. Here, the investigators develop a novel
      Stem Cell Educator therapy by using CB-SC and explore the therapeutic effectiveness of Stem
      Cell Educator therapy in T2D patients.

    <description>Human cord blood-derived multipotent stem cells (CB-SC) display unique phenotypes, such as the expression of embryonic stem (ES) cell markers, multipotential of differentiations, very low immunogenecity, and immune modulations. Stem Cell Educator will be used for isolation and purification of cord blood stem cells for the treatment.</description>

    <description>For the treatment, commonly the left (or right) median cubital vein, a patient's blood is passed through a Blood Cell Separator that isolates the lymphocytes from the blood according to the recommended protocol by manufacture; consequently, the collected lymphocytes were transferred into the Stem Cell Educator and treated by CB-SC; after that, the educated cells return the blood back to the patient via a dorsal vein of hand. During the MCS+ collection, the whole blood flow rate was maintained at 35 mL/min. The whole procedure was scheduled for 6 ~ 7 hrs.</description>
