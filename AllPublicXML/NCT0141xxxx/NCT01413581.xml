      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that rhBSSL improves growth in preterm infants as
      compared with placebo. The infants should be born before week 32 of gestational age.

      The study drug, rhBSSL or placebo, will be administered during a 4 week treatment period by
      adding it to either infant formula or pasteurized breast milk.

      The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of rhBSSL.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 (rhBSSL:placebo). The study consists
      of maximum 1 week screening period, a 4-week treatment period and a 2 year follow-up period.
