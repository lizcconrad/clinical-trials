  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at how well people respond to two different drug treatments
      for depression. Clinically, people can respond differently to different treatments for
      reasons which are not always clear. Some research shows that people with a family history of
      bipolar disorder or completed suicide may react differently to standard medications used to
      treat depression than those without a family history. The investigators need to know if these
      drugs are effective to use in patients with depression who have a family history of bipolar
      disorder or completed suicide.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed after 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be reduction in the score on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which has become the standard outcome tool in clinical trials for assessing symptoms of depression. Response will be defined as 50% reduction in MADRS Remission will be defined as MADRS ≤ 12.</description>

    <measure>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed after 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a standard outcome tool used to assess mania.</description>

    <measure>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed after 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI)is a scale used to measure overall symptom severity, treatment response, and treatment efficacy in patients with mood disorders.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Columbia Suicide Classification Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed over 6 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia Suicide Classification Scale, used in the FDA analysis of pediatric antidepressants, has become a standard tool used in clinical depression trials and will be used to monitor changes in suicide risk or self-harm weekly.</description>

    <measure>Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed over 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS):
The BARS is a very brief clinical assessment for the presences of akathisia. Akathisia secondary to antidepressants has been associated with increased suicidality. The inclusion of the BARS will serve to delineate akathisia from psychomotor agitation as part of treatment -emergent mixed symptoms.</description>

    <description>Following the enrollment period, subjects will enter a six-week randomized treatment period with either lithium or paroxetine. Lithium carbonate will be commenced at 600mgs hs, with increase to 900mgs at day 7. Dose will be flexibly titrated to give a serum level between 0.5 and 1.1mmol/l. At visit 4, the dose of lithium may be adjusted (within the range of 0.6 and 1.1 mmol/l).</description>
