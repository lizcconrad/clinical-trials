  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary polyphenols might have beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism based on
      the studies made in animals or cell cultures. The findings regarding the possible decrease of
      low-grade inflammation are existing also in humans. Low-grade inflammation has been suggested
      to be a mechanistic link between obesity and its consequences on cardiometabolic health. The
      aim of the present study is to examine the effect of diet rich in berries on glucose and
      lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers.

    <textblock>
      Berries are traditionally an important part of the Nordic diet. About 50 different berries
      are grown in the northern region, and about half of them are edible. Phenolic compounds are
      one of the most diverse group of secondary metabolites present in edible plants, and berries
      are especially rich in them. Flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans and complex phenolic
      polymers (polymeric tannins) are typical for berries. Phenolic compounds are reported to have
      a variety of beneficial biological properties. They are potent antioxidants, and exhibit
      various other physiological activities including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial,
      antiallergic, anticarcinogenic and antihypertensive activities. Epidemiological studies
      indicate that diet rich in phenolic compound correlates with lower risk of cancer and
      cardiovascular disease.

      The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of diet rich in berries on glucose and
      lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers and gene expression profile in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in subjects with features of metabolic syndrome.

      Randomized, controlled clinical intervention including 4 wk run-in period, 8 wk dietary
      intervention and 4 wk recovery period was conducted.
