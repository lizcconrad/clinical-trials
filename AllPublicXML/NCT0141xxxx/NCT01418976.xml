  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a case series study evaluating the feasibility and dosage of Intensive Mobility
      Training (IMT). Twelve participants with chronic, mild-to-moderate, Traumatic Brain Injury
      (TBI) causing significant locomotor impairment, who meet these specific criteria, will be
      recruited. Location and nature of neural insult will be determined by multimodal Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam. All participants will receive 3 hours of rehabilitation per day
      for 20 days, focusing on gait and balance. Locomotion and balance will be comprehensively
      tested prior to IMT, after 10 days of IMT, and then again after the full dose of IMT. This
      study will determine the feasibility of this intervention in the population of TBI patients,
      allow an estimate of effect size and provide initial information on possible neural
      predictors of success. Furthermore the investigators will be able to determine whether the
      dosage of 10 days is sufficient or whether significant improvements are made with 20 days of
      the intervention.
