      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to prospectively assess and compare survival in
      subjects with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) randomized to Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) or
      Hemodialysis (HD) treatment.

      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to prospectively assess and compare the
      following parameters in subjects receiving PD or HD treatment:

        -  Technique failure

        -  Cause of death

        -  Comorbidity status at baseline and changes throughout the study

        -  Change in residual renal function (RRF)

        -  Dialysis adequacy (i.e., Kt/Vurea)

        -  Change in blood pressure, hemoglobin, and S-phosphate

        -  Change in nutritional status

        -  Occurrence of bacterial and other infections

        -  Hospitalization, including number, duration, and underlying reason(s)

        -  Systemic inflammation as assessed by high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP)

        -  Quality of life (QOL)

      Safety Objectives: To compare the nature and frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious
      adverse events (SAEs), including abnormal laboratory test findings with clinical
      significance, in subjects receiving PD or HD treatment.

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess and compare technique failure</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Technique failure is defined as a change of dialysis modality (PD to HD, or HD to PD) or death. However, a temporary transfer, defined as ≤ 6 weeks duration and ≤ 2 occasions per any 52-week period, will not be considered technique failure. The use of both modalities within a 7-day period for more than 4 consecutive weeks will be considered technique failure. Technique failure will be monitored in two ways: modality failure including deaths and technique failure not including deaths.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Residual Renal Function (RRF)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs</time_frame>
    <description>RRF will be estimated if the subject's urine volume is ≥ 100 mL/24 h. RRF will be assessed by calculating GFR from a 24-h urine urea and creatinine collection and normalized to 1.73 m2 Body Surface Area. RRF will be measured at screening, visit 1 and every 12 weeks after visit 1 till the end of the study. Subjects who have a permanent modality transfer will be followed up for RRF (with the frequency of assessment determined by the modality they are switched to) until the end of the study, transplantation, stopping dialysis, lost to follow-up, or death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dialysis Adequacy</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>In subjects receiving PD, dialysis adequacy (Kt/Vurea) will be assessed at 4 weeks (visit 2), 12 weeks (visit 4) and then every 12 weeks (±14 days) until the end of the study (±14 days). Kt/Vurea target for PD patients is ≥ 1.7 per week. Kt/Vurea target for HD patients is ≥ 1.2 per dialysis session. Subjects who have a permanent modality transfer will be followed up for Kt/Vurea (with the frequency of assessment determined by the modality they are switched to) until the end of the study, transplantation, stopping dialysis, lost to follow-up, or death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Co-morbidity Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>The Charlson Comorbidity Index contains 19 categories of comorbidity which are primarily defined using ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes, as well as a few procedure codes. The overall comorbidity score reflects the cumulative increased likelihood of one-year survival; the higher the score, the more severe the burden of comorbidity. Every diagnosis and procedure code is analyzed to see if it falls within one of the 16 comorbid conditions. In this study, the comorbidity assessment will be measured at visit 1, every 24 weeks (±14 days) after visit 1 to visit 23, and at the end-of-study visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of Bacterial and Other Infections Infection rates</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of bacterial and other infections infection rates, especially regarding exit sites and peritoneal, will be monitored for HD and PD patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Hospitalization rates and duration for each underlying reason will be monitored for HD and PD patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transplantation Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Kidney transplantation is the best outcome that a patient can expect. By default, a patient will be discontinued from the study after transplantation. Imbalance of the transplantation rate between HD and PD will be assessed. However, all patients will be followed to the end of the study to assess the primary endpoint which is all-cause mortality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cause of Death</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Cause of deaths due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), infection (except peritonitis), peritonitis, malnutrition, stroke, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes, etc., will be monitored for HD and PD patients</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Dose changes in ESA dose will affect patient's status for anemia control, and will be monitored for HD and PD patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood pressure, hemoglobin, and S-phosphate</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure, hemoglobin, and S-phosphate will be monitored for HD and PD patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Global Assessment for Nutritional Status</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) is a technique to assess a patient's nutritional status. The SGA will be measured by one dedicated, trained physician per site at visit 1, every 24 weeks (±14 days) from visit 1 to visit 23, and at the end-of-study visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systemic inflammation as assessed by hs-CRP</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Scores of systemic inflammation will be assessed using high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP). Hs-CRP will be assessed at visits 1, 4-23, and at the end-of-study visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Quality of life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 yrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life Quality of life (QOL) will be assessed using the EQ-5D-3L (European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions - 3L translation), the KDQoL-SF (Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form) questionnaires, and the Karnofsky Index. QOL will be assessed at visit 1, every 24 weeks (±14 days) from visit 1 to visit 23, and at the end-of-study visit.</description>

             sign an ICF.

          6. Subjects who are able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.
