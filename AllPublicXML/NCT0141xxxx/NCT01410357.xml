    <textblock>
      This project tests a model for improving illness self-management among persons who have both
      serious mental illness and diabetes and will be performed within a primary care setting at a
      safety net hospital system. The information gained from the randomized trial will be
      supplemented with reports from participants about their experiences of trying to improve
      illness self-management. Improvements in self-management should result in a reduction of
      psychiatric symptoms and improvements in functioning and physical health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will test a novel intervention, Targeted Training in Illness Management (TTIM),
      intended to improve both serious mental illness (SMI) and diabetes mellitus (DM)
      self-management in 100 individuals with SMI-DM vs. 100 individuals with SMI-DM receiving
      treatment as usual (TAU). The intervention will be conducted in a safety-net health system
      primary care setting and will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      primary effects of TTIM will be assessed with respect to SMI symptoms, Functional Status/Role
      Impairment, General Health Status, and DM outcomes. Secondary outcomes include adherence to
      psychotropic and DM medication, and engagement in healthy behaviors.

      This assessment will include quantitative assessment of facilitators/barriers targeted by the
      proposed intervention as well as a supplemental qualitative assessment. The qualitative
      assessments will include input from patients and interventionists. Specific aims for the
      qualitative analysis are to validate findings from the RCT, expand understanding of &quot;key
      active ingredients&quot; of TTIM, and provide information to inform future studies on individuals
      with SMI and related medical conditions.

The TRQ format captured an exact proportion (%) of days with a missed medication dose for each oral maintenance psychotropic medication and then an average combined TRQ was calculated for all orally-prescribed medications.</description>

          <title>Targeted Training in Illness Management (TTIM)</title>
          <description>Participants in this arm received the TTIM intervention as well as regular treatment for their DM and SMI from their normal medical and mental health care providers.
Targeted Training in Illness Management (TTIM): This intervention blended psychoeducation, problem identification/goal-setting, behavioral modeling and reinforcement via use of Peer Educators, and health care linkage, and was adapted to the primary care setting and targeted SMI-DM participants. Generalizability was enhanced with relatively brief in-person participation requirements and professional staff typically found in primary care were utilized. TTIM stressed information sharing that is accessible to participants, and through a collaborative process, fostered motivation for SMI-DM self-management.</description>

Norm-based scores are placed on the same metric with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Scores above 50 reflect higher functional status than the average population and scores below 50 reflect lower than average function. Both the physical and mental are separate subscales with their own scoring as determined by the process above.</description>

The TRQ determines proportion of prescribed medication missed, and ranges from 0 (no medication missed/100% adherent) to 100 (no medication taken/0% adherent). The TRQ format captured an exact proportion (%) of days with a missed medication dose for each oral maintenance psychotropic medication and then an average combined TRQ was calculated for all orally-prescribed medications.</description>

        <title>Comparison of AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) Score Between TTIM and TAU (Treatment as Usual) at 60 Weeks</title>
        <description>The AUDIT scale (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) has 10 questions, with scores on each question ranging from 0 to 4 (0= never, 1= less than monthly, 2= monthly, 3= weekly 4= daily/almost daily). Questions 9 and 10 only have three anchors: 0, 2, and 4. The scores are summed to get total. Therefore, the range of possible scores are 0-40, with higher scores indicating indicating a greater likelihood of hazardous and harmful drinking. However, such scores may also reflect greater severity of alcohol problems and dependence, as well as a greater need for more intensive treatment.</description>

        <title>Comparison of ISMI (Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness -Alienation) Between TTIM and TAU at 60 Weeks</title>
        <description>The ISMI (Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness) has 29 questions, broken into 5 subscales. This subscale, Alienation, has 6 Likert-scale items. Each question is rated as 1= strongly disagree, 2= disagree, 3= neutral, 4= agree, 5= strongly agree. Total scores on the Alienation subscale range from 6-30, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of reported internalized stigma of mental illness.</description>

        <population>While 74 participants completed the TTIM arm and 76 completed TAU, there was some missing data for this scale, resulting in 70 TTIM and 74 TAU.</population>

Targeted Training in Illness Management (TTIM): This intervention blended psychoeducation, problem identification/goal-setting, behavioral modeling and reinforcement via use of Peer Educators, and health care linkage, and was adapted to the primary care setting and targeted SMI-DM participants. Generalizability was enhanced with relatively brief in-person participation requirements and professional staff typically found in primary care were utilized. TTIM stressed information sharing that is accessible to participants, and through a collaborative process, fostered motivation for SMI-DM self-management.</description>

            <description>Participants in this arm received the TTIM intervention as well as regular treatment for their DM and SMI from their normal medical and mental health care providers.
Targeted Training in Illness Management (TTIM): This intervention blended psychoeducation, problem identification/goal-setting, behavioral modeling and reinforcement via use of Peer Educators, and health care linkage, and was adapted to the primary care setting and targeted SMI-DM participants. Generalizability was enhanced with relatively brief in-person participation requirements and professional staff typically found in primary care were utilized. TTIM stressed information sharing that is accessible to participants, and through a collaborative process, fostered motivation for SMI-DM self-management.</description>

          <description>The Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale is an 8-item Likert scale, with each question ranging from 1-5. Items 1, 2, 6, and 7 are reverse coded. Total summed scores range from 8-40, with higher scores indicating higher perceived self-management competence in regards to diabetes.</description>
