             acid value of at least 8.0 mg/dL at Screening Visit. Patients on allopurinol must
             agree to discontinue their existing therapy at Visit 1 through the entire duration of
             the study and must have a sUA value of at least 8.0 mg/dL after a minimum 2 week
             wash-out at Visit 2.

          2. Male or female, 18-75 years of age at Screening Visit

             medically accepted methods of contraception including a barrier method (see the list

          8. Patients must have liver function tests (LFTs) ≤ 1.5X ULN for AST, ALT and
             T-bilirubin, ≤ 2X ULN for ALP, ≤ 3X ULN for GGT; CK ≤ 3X ULN

          9. All other clinical laboratory parameters must be within normal limits or considered
             not clinically significant

         10. Electrocardiogram (ECG) must be normal, or if abnormal, considered not clinically
             significant

         11. Patients must have a systolic blood pressure ≤ 160 mm Hg and a diastolic blood
             pressure ≤ 95 mm Hg; known hypertensive patients controlled with medication other than
             diuretics (BP reading as above) may be included

             febuxostat, or pegloticase) within two weeks of the Screening Visit

          2. Known or suspected secondary hyperuricemia (e.g. due to myeloproliferative disorder,
