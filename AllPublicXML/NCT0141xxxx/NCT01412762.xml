  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about what patients undergoing surgery for thyroid
      cancer expect from their surgery. Your input may help us to better prepare and inform
      patients about their disease and its treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To establish a patient-reported outcomes tool for measuring preoperative expectations in patients undergoing surgery for thyroid cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>This will be done by conducting qualitative semistructured interviews with 15 thyroid cancer patients (pre- and postoperatively) to identify recurring themes about their expectations regarding thyroid surgery.</description>

    <description>We aim to interview 15 patients with confirmed thyroid malignancy both pre- and postoperatively, for a total of 30 interviews. For the expansion of this study, we will accrue 25 patients with biopsy-proven thyroid cancer undergoing thyroidectomy to be educated with the CITSAV application prior to surgery.</description>

    <intervention_name>patient interviews</intervention_name>
    <description>The pre-operative interview will be within 4 weeks of planned surgery and the postoperative interview within 8 weeks of surgery completion. This initial study is designed to develop an instrument to measure patient preoperative expectations in this patient population.</description>
