  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are the major cause of non-dental pain in orofacial area.
      Laser therapy can be considered as one of the most recent treatment approaches in the field
      of physiotherapy. The special features of laser light such as coherence, monochromaticity,
      and collimation can result in the ability of laser light to modify cellular metabolism,
      increase tissue repair and reduce edema and inflammation. Several studies demonstrated
      successful results regarding the use of low level lasers in releasing pain of musculoskeletal
      conditions, but there are also contradictory reports in this field, and the clinical
      effectiveness of this treatment modality has been debated in some review articles. A few
      studies evaluated the efficacy of low level laser therapy in the treatment of
      temporomandibular disorders and the associated myofacial pain. There are remarkable
      variations in the methodology of these researches and some reported insufficient data
      regarding the physical properties of the laser used. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of low level laser therapy in improving the sign and symptoms of patients
      suffering from myofacial pain syndrome.

      This study will be implemented on 20 patients referring to Department of Prosthetic Dentistry
      of Mashhad Dental School. The patients are selected according to the RDC/TMD criteria to
      include those having temporomandibular disorders with muscular origin. The patients will be
      randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 (treatment group) will receive low level laser
      therapy. The laser light will be applied with 890 nm diode laser (Mustang 2000+, Russia) with
      frequency of 1500 Hz, and dose of 2 J/cm2 per point in the painful muscles.

      In Group 2 (placebo) the low power laser will be applied with a minimal dose that is very
      lower than the threshold necessary for therapeutic effects. Laser therapy for both the
      treatment and placebo groups will be applied on all painful muscles three times a week for
      four weeks. Patients will be evaluated at the start of the treatment, after the 6th and 12th
      sessions of laser therapy and also one month after the end of the treatment. At each
      evaluation, the maximum mouth opening with or without pain and masticatory muscle tenderness
      will be measured. Pain will be measured through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The range of
      lateral and protrusive mandibular movements, and the difficulty in chewing food will also be
      evaluated.
