    <textblock>
      This study examines the relationship among epigenetic alterations and the development and
      persistence of psychoneurologic symptoms (cognitive dysfunction, depressive symptoms,
      anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and pain) in women receiving chemotherapy for early
      stage breast cancer. The relationship among inflammatory markers and psychoneurologic
      symptoms will also be explored. It is hypothesized:

        1. Chemotherapy triggers inflammatory activation, which in turn leads to the acquisition of
           genetic alterations. These alterations result in cellular changes and are modified over
           time.

        2. Inflammatory activation and epigenetic alterations are related to the temporal
           development, severity, and persistence of psychoneurologic symptoms.

      Advancements in breast cancer have resulted in increased survival rates; however, many women
      with breast cancer experience distressing symptoms. Inflammatory activation and epigenetic
      alterations have been associated with the etiology of cancer. To date, no investigators have
      considered these epigenetic processes as possible mechanisms associated with the etiology of
      distressing symptoms in women with breast cancer. The specific aims of this study are to
      examine:

        1. The frequency and severity of psychoneurological (PN) symptoms (depressive symptoms,
           anxiety, sleep disturbances, fatigue, pain and cognitive dysfunction)and the
           interrelationship among PN symptoms at each time point

        2. Levels of inflammation and to quantify the frequency and genome-wide location of changes
           in epigenetic patterns across time following chemotherapy

        3. The relationship among inflammation, epigenetic changes, and the development, severity,
           and persistence of PN symptoms across time The study results may potentially deepen
           understanding regarding the biological processes underlying PN symptoms and lead to
           improved strategies for symptom management in women with breast cancer.
