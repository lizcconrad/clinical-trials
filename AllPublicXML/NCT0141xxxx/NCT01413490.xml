  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus is one of the leading causes of liver failure and liver cancer worldwide.
      Current treatment of hepatitis C infection is only successful in about half of those who are
      eligible. The current treatment aims to boost the host immune system but does not directly
      act on the virus. Many drugs are in various stages of development that target the virus
      directly - their specific mode of action is confirmed by showing the virus is forced to adapt
      in the presence of the drug. As with many viruses, treating with only one specific drug would
      quickly lead to the virus adapting and becoming resistant. We therefore need to find new
      combinations of directly acting drugs. Rimantadine has already been shown in the laboratory
      to target hepatitis C directly. We have designed this study to see if it happens in real life
      as well. If so, we could use rimantadine to help fight hepatitis c more effectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of HCV infection, genotype 1 or genotype 3

          -  Be eligible for standard combination therapy with pegylated IFN and ribavirin

          -  Be at least 18 but no more than 65 years of age

          -  Have signed an informed consent indicating that the patient is aware of the infectious
             nature of their disease and have been informed of the procedures of the protocol, the
             experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects,
             risks, and discomforts

          -  Be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, the treatment plan, and
             laboratory tests

          -  Have no contraindications to receiving rimantadine therapy

          -  Have blood results within defined acceptable haematological and biochemical parameters
             (haemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl, platelet count &gt;150 x 109/L, bilirubin &lt;25 umol/L, albumin &gt;35
             g/L, creatinine &lt;150 umol/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent

          -  Have previously received treatment for HCV infection (i.e. are currently treatment
             na√Øve)

          -  Have any condition which would deem the patient ineligible for combination therapy
             with pegylated IFN or ribavirin. This includes pregnancy, significant cardiac, renal
             or autoimmune disease, severe depression or psychosis, and previous organ
             transplantation

          -  Cirrhosis or liver failure as evidenced by clinical (cutaneous stigmata of chronic
             liver disease, ascites, encephalopathy), ultrasonic (cirrhotic appearance of liver,
             ascites) or biochemical (platelet count &gt;150 x 109/L, bilirubin &lt;25 umol/L, albumin
             &gt;35 g/L) evidence, routinely collated in all patients diagnosed with HCV

          -  Any condition which would preclude the use of rimantadine. This comprises significant
             renal impairment (creatinine &gt;150), pregnancy, epilepsy or history of unexplained
             seizures

          -  Have any other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the Chief Investigators, would make the patient inappropriate
             for this study. This includes the presence of end stage liver disease (cirrhosis), and
             HIV infection
