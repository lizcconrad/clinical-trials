    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of scheduled maintenance Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatment compared to on-demand TMS treatment for symptomatic
      worsening in patients who have shown a clinical response to acute TMS treatment.

      This is a 12-month maintenance treatment study for patients who have responded to a 6 week
      course of acute TMS treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The study will seek to
      assess the change in depressive symptomatology across the duration of maintenance treatment
      using observer and self-administered efficacy measures. Describe the efficacy of TMS
      re-introduction in patients not receiving maintenance pharmacotherapy who show a recurrence
      of depressive symptoms. Assess the safety and durability of acute TMS therapy followed by
      maintenance TMS treatment for up to 12 months.

             episode of ≥ 4 weeks and CGI-S ≥ 4.

          -  Duration of current episode of depression ≤ 3 years (the definition of an episode is
             demarcated by a period of ≥ 2 months when the patient did not meet full criteria for
             the DSM-IV definition of Major Depressive Episode.

             discontinue treatment with those agents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators, site personnel directly affiliated with this study, and their immediate
