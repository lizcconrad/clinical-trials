      The aim of the current study is to test the hypothesis that patients with IBS may have a
      defective ICV pressures and may have small bowel bacterial overgrowth. The goal of the
      current study is to identify the role and competence of ileocecal valve (ICV) in patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome.

      The primary objective is to measure the pressure of the ileocecal valve in patients with and
      without irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Ileocecal valve reflux pressures during air
      insufflation of cecum will be used.

      This is an outpatient study. There will be no requirement to stay overnight in the hospital.
      The research will be conducted in the gastroenterology section of the department of Medicine
      in North shore university hospital and in North shore long island Jewish medical center. Both
      these hospitals are tertiary care centers with adequate facilities for the safe and
      appropriate conduct of this research. Participants must meet all eligibility criteria and
      sign the consent form before enrolling in the study. This is a cohort study with 2 groups
      (patients with IBS and participants without IBS). Patients will be enrolled into one of these
      two categories based on their medical history, signs and symptoms and questionnaire. There
      are no controlled compounds used in this study. There is no treatment involved in this study.
      There are 2 study related visits per subject.

      Based on questionnaire we plan to recruit 25 participants who meet the criteria of IBS and 25
      participants who do not meet the criteria of IBS (Total of 50 participants in the study).
      Patients with IBS are those who meet the criteria of IBS based on their symptoms and the
      responses to a validated ROME III - questionnaire. All other participants who do not meet the
      criteria for IBS are classified as non-IBS participants. All the participants should be
      having a clinically indicated colonoscopy.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of small bowel bacterial overgrowth or irritable bowel
             syndrome and who are undergoing routine colonoscopies or subjects who are undergoing
             routine colonoscopy and test positive for small bowel bacterial overgrowth will be
             candidates. If the patient has prior lactulose breath test done for clinical purposes
             then repeat lactulose breath test will not be required. If no prior lactulose breath
             test has been performed then it will be done as part of this research study. In
             addition patients who test negative for SBBO will be candidates for the control
             population.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medications-Subjects on any medication that could affect the ileocecal valve
             high-pressure zone will be excluded; this includes use of prokinetic agents, current
             use of any antibiotics and anticholinergics. Patients will be excluded if the
             lactulose breath test is done on antibiotics or during the colonoscopy preparation.

        GI symptoms, conditions and disorders: In addition exclusion criteria will include a
        history of ileocecal resection or disease affecting the colon and/or small bowel including
        crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or diseases causing diarrhea.
