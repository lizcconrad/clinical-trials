      1. Obesity is a big health problem worldwide.

        2. Mostly obese people have food addiction and bad eating habits.

        3. Bariatric surgery is a good alternative for patients who failed to loose weight with
           other measures like behavioral changes, activities and sports, diet, etc..

        4. The investigators know the changes occurred after surgery in eating habits due to
           restrictive and malabsorptive feature of the surgery performed.

        5. There is no study in the literature to measure these changes.

        6. The investigators will try to detect these kind of behavioral changes by a survey before
           and after surgery.
