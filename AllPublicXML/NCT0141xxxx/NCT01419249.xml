      PREDICT Validation is a validation pharmacogenetic trial. The purpose of this study is to
      confirm that some genes can be used to predict how well a subject diagnosed with idiopathic
      growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) or turner syndrome (TS) will respond to a treatment with
      recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH).

    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, interventional, retrospective, multicenter, international study,
      single-arm, non-randomized, and non-controlled study. The subject's trial participation
      includes a single visit. During the visit, subjects who give consent to participate in the
      trial will undergo blood sampling for genetic markers testing and retrospective data will be
      collected relative to the first year of the subject's r-hGH treatment.

      The r-hGH treatment followed by the subject is indicated the pediatric population, therefore
      most of the subjects included into the trial will be below 18 years old.

      This study is a non-investigational medicinal product (IMP) trial therefore no drug product
      data is provided.

    <description>Height SDS was calculated as height minus reference mean height divided by standard deviation of the reference population. Height SDS reflects the height relative to a reference population of the same age and gender. Change from baseline in height SDS at Year 1 was one of the growth parameter to assess the first year growth response to r-hGH treatment.</description>

    <description>GHD KIGS predictive model includes various clinical, auxological and biological markers which are as follows: maximum growth hormone (GH) response to provocation test; age at onset of therapy; birth weight SDS; average GH dose received during the first year of r-hGH therapy; height SDS at start of therapy; the difference between the pre-treatment height SDS of the subject and the mid parental height SDS; and weight SDS at start of therapy.</description>
