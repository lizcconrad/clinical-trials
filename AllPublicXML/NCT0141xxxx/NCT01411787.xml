  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-site pilot study incorporating one control group. This research
      involves an exercise group and a non-exercise group (control group).

      The patients who are in the exercise group will be enrolled in the Dallas County Women's
      Adventure Boot Camp. This will require them to undergo exercise training 3 times per week,
      under the direction of an experienced personal trainer in a group setting. All Boot Camp
      personal trainers are trained in basic cardiac life support (CPR) and are trained to watch
      for any signs or symptoms associated with a poor exercise response.

      The investigators hypothesize that randomizing women to a supervised exercise program of core
      conditioning, muscular/circuit training, and short distance running administered during
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer can be performed.

      Patients will continue on study as they are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for their
      breast cancer. This will be about 4 - 6 months.

      The exercise protocol will consist of activities including walking/running up to a mile,
      calisthenics (jumping jacks, short relays, rapid punches) and light (no greater than 5
      pounds) weight lifting. The patients who do not receive the exercise program will be allowed
      to do what they would normally do during their neoadjuvant chemotherapy. They are allowed to
      engage in their own exercise regimens and diet modifications.

      Subjects will receive the chemotherapy as directed by their physicians, and then undergo
      surgery as planned. Randomization will occur by drawing cards entitled &quot;exercise&quot; or
      &quot;control&quot; from an envelope and then assigning the patient to this group.

    <description>Ki-67 has significant value for predicting survival and recurrence risk in breast cancer. A recent study reveals that patients with a post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy Ki-67 index of less than 1.0% had significantly improved survivals when compared to patients with a Ki-67 index &gt; 1.0%</description>

    <description>Patient will continue normal activities. Ki-67 will be measured in the initial core biopsy and then again in the final pathologic specimen which is removed for definitive surgical intervention. Insulin resistance levels will be measured by obtaining insulin-like growth factor binding protein one and C-peptide levels just prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and then again after the last chemotherapy dose. Body mass index, percent body fat, and improving fitness levels will also be measured.</description>
