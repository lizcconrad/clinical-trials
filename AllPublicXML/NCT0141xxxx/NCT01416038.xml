  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is a novel way to treat cancer and does so by targeting the immune system to
      destroy tumor cells. Many different therapeutic vaccines have been evaluated in phase 1, 2,
      and even phase 3 trials. Much has been learned about the principles of applying immune-based
      therapies and specifically the types of patients that may be most likely to mount an
      effective immune response. When used alone, cancer vaccines may have their greatest impact
      earlier in the disease course or in situations with minimal residual disease.

      ImmunoVaccine Technologies Inc. (Immunovaccine) is an immuno-oncology company developing a
      novel adjuvanting technology platform termed DepoVax. DepoVax was created to enhance the
      speed, strength and duration of an immune response. The peptide antigens included in
      DPX-Survivac are designed to target Survivin, a protein which is over-expressed in many
      cancer types, including epithelial ovarian cancers.

      This study was designed be a phase 1-2 trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity
      profiles of DPX-Survivac, a therapeutic vaccine co-administered with a regimen of low dose
      oral cyclophosphamide. The dosing-finding phase 1 study of 15 subjects would move directly
      into a randomized phase 2 study. However, with the evolving field of immunotherapy
      Immunovaccine has begun to focus on combination therapies, combining DPX-Survivac treatment
      with checkpoint inhibitors and other immune modulators, such as in NCT02785250.

      The standard treatment for all ovarian cancer is aggressive debulking surgery followed by
      chemotherapy. Ovarian carcinoma is one of the most chemosensitive solid tumors and early
      stage patients are most responsive to treatment. However, despite improvements to the
      standard treatment over the past three decades, almost all patients with advanced stage
      disease at presentation will relapse, with an average progression free survival of 16-18
      months. When residual or recurrent disease manifests itself, resistance to chemotherapy often
      prohibits further curative therapy. Therefore, there are still significant unmet needs in
      treating ovarian cancer patients.

      Treatment with DPX-Survivac is for patients with late-stage ovarian, fallopian tube, or
      peritoneal cancer who have completed initial chemotherapy treatment and successful debulking
      surgery. The phase 1 dose finding study will administer 3 doses of DPX-Survivac with or
      without accompanying low dose oral cyclophosphamide.
