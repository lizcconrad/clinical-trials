  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect and store normal and malignant tissue from patients
      with gastric cancer, GIST, esophageal cancer, pancreas cancer, hepatocellular cancer, biliary
      cancer, neuroendocrine, peritoneal mesothelioma, anal cancer and colorectal cancer, an
      estimated 50 to 100 of each tumor type. To collect and store blood samples from patients with
      gastric cancer, GIST, esophageal cancer, pancreas cancer, hepatocellular cancer, biliary
      cancer, neuroendocrine, peritoneal mesothelioma, anal cancer and colorectal cancer. To create
      a database for the collected tissue and allow access to relevant clinical information for
      current and future protocols. To create tissue microarrays for each gastrointestinal cancer
      subtype, namely, gastric cancer, GIST, esophageal cancer, pancreas cancer, hepatocellular
      cancer, biliary cancer, neuroendocrine, peritoneal mesothelioma, anal cancer and colorectal
      cancer, to facilitate future molecular studies. To grant access to Dr Kindler, Dr. Salgia,
      and Dr. Catenacci to this database (as it is being acquired) of the coupled patient tissue
      samples (normal and malignant) and relevant clinical information for the investigation of
      tyrosine kinases, such as Met and Ron, receptor tyrosine kinase family members, STATs,
      paxillin, focal adhesion proteins, cell motility/migration proteins,
      tyrosine/serine/threonine kinase family members, related molecules, and downstream targets
      implicated in the pathogenesis of GI cancers. Examples of molecular testing include
      evaluation of DNA mutation, alternative splice variants, protein expression and
      phosphorylation, and immunohistochemistry on samples. These studies will be correlated with
      clinical information as stated above.
