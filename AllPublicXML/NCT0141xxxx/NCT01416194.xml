    <textblock>
      This observational cohort study is being conducted to further characterize selected adverse
      events of interest among a patient population with osteoporosis who are prescribed
      bazedoxifene, raloxifene, or a bisphosphonate in usual clinical care outside of a randomized
      clinical trial setting. The study will compare the rates of the selected clinical events
      among the three treatment groups.
