    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the effect of moderate versus
      high intensity exercise training on physical fitness and physical function in patients with
      type 2 diabetes. The research hypothesis is that high intensity exercise training will be
      superior to moderate intensity on such outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants meet the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria for type 2
             diabetes.

          -  A physician must consider each participant to be medically stable to participate in
             this investigation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any individual with a history of a medical condition identified by the American Heart
             Association as an absolute contraindication to exercise testing is excluded from this
             study.

          -  Any individual with angina (stable or unstable), uncontrolled hypertension,
             proliferative retinopathy, severe peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, autonomic
             neuropathy, history of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, or
             unable to participate in this study due to a physical impairment is excluded from this
             investigation.

          -  Any individual involved in resistance training or aerobic training within 3 months of
             the beginning of this investigation is excluded.
