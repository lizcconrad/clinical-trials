  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an early access program of 'Nexavar post-marketing surveillance (PMS) for renal
      cell carcinoma (RCC) in Japan' which is a regulatory, local prospective and observational
      study for patients with unresectable or advanced RCC under real-life practice conditions. The
      objective of this study is to assess safety and effectiveness of Nexavar at some limited
      sites which joined to clinical trial of Nexavar, before available of it in the market. The
      enrollment period is 2 months, and patients who received Nexavar will be recruited and
      followed one year since starting Nexavar administration. The data of this study will be
      integrated into the Nexavar PMS and the data will not be analyzed and reported alone.
