    <textblock>
      Critical care nursing interventions related to oral care can reduce the microorganisms in the
      oropharynx available for translocation to other sites. THis is a randomized, controlled and
      double blinded study performed in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) from a Brazilian
      university hospital which objectives were to analyze 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate
      influence on Gram-negative pathogens colonization of oropharyngeal and tracheal secretions of
      mechanically ventilated children.

    <description>Oral care included use of an oral gel containing chlorhexidine digluconate 0.12% as an active ingredient (chlorhexidine digluconate 0.12%; methylcellulose gel 2.12%, 25 g; gooseberry syrup, 4 drops; menthol solution 50%,3 drops; and distilled water, to 30 g).The gel is applied on a toothbrush, and the teeth are cleaned in quadrants; all teeth surfaces are cleaned (vestibular,lingual, occlusal, and incisal). After each quadrant was cleaned, 10 mL of water (dispensed via a syringe) is used to rinse the quadrant and continual aspiration is used to remove all the gel and debris. After all the teeth are cleaned, the ventral surface of the tongue is brushed with posteriorto- anterior movements.</description>

    <description>This group received the same oral care that experimental group with the use of a similarly formulated gel without the antiseptic agent.The gel is applied on a toothbrush, and the teeth are cleaned in quadrants; all teeth surfaces are cleaned (vestibular, lingual, occlusal, and incisal). After each quadrant is cleaned, 10 mL of water (dispensed via a syringe) is used to rinse the quadrant and continual aspiration is used to remove all the gel and debris. After all the teeth are cleaned, the ventral surface of the tongue is brushed with posterior to anterior movements.</description>

    <description>Oral care with 0.12% Chlorhexidine Digluconate and toothbrushing is realized twice a day and took about 10 minutes to complete, depending on the child's acceptance and clinical conditions.</description>
