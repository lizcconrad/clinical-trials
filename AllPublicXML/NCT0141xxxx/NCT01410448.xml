  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether delayed (i.e. 28 ± 4 days post-transplant)
      administration of everolimus after transplantation reduces the risk of wound healing
      complications in comparison with immediate administration in de novo renal transplant
      patients (proportion of patients without wound/surgical complications related to initial
      transplant surgery) between randomization and 3 months after transplantation.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Without Wound Healing Complications - Worst-case Scenario</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants without wound healing complications was assessed. Wound healing complications consisted of lymphorrhea, fluid collections, wound dehiscence, wound infections and incisional hernia. In the worst-case scenario, failure, i.e. at least one healing complication occurrence, was identified in one of the following cases: wound complication occurrence, missing information about wound complication occurrence, or study discontinuation due to any reason.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and serum urea and by calculating creatinine clearance using the MDRD-4 formula. eGFR = 186.3*(serum creatinine [mg/dL])^-1.154 * (age at screening) -0.203 * (0.742 if female) * (1.21 if African American).
