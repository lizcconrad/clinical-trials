    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate puncture site complication rate
      as well as the short- and long-term (up to 24 months) outcome of treatment by means of Astron
      Pulsar / Astron Pulsar-18 stent implantation in symptomatic (Rutherford 2-4) femoro-popliteal
      arterial stenotic or occlusive lesions, using 4F compatible devices of BIOTRONIK and without
      the use of a closure device.

      The hypothesis is that the primary patency at 12 months is non-inferior to the primary
      patency obtained in the Durability study (72.2%).
