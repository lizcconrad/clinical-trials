  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, randomized, phase 2b study, designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma following
      intratumoral administration of BC-819 and intravenously administered gemcitabine.
      Intratumoral injections of BC-819 will be performed using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).

      Primary Objective: To assess the effect of intratumoral endoscopic ultrasound injection of
      BC-819 administered with intravenous gemcitabine on progression-free survival.

      Secondary Objectives: To compare the effects of intratumoral injection of BC-819 administered
      in combination with intravenous gemcitabine vs. intravenous gemcitabine alone on:

      Overall survival, Response rate, Resectability of the target tumor lesion, Quality of life,
      Safety, Serological Tumor Marker: CA 19-9, Duration of response, Failure-free survival

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BC-819 (also known as DTA-H19) is a double-stranded DNA plasmid, 4,560 base pairs (bp) in
      length, carrying the gene for the Diphtheria toxin A (DT-A) chain under the regulation of the
      H19 promoter. This is a Targeted Cancer Therapy; DT-A chain expression is triggered by the
      presence of H19 transcription factors that are only up-regulated in tumor cells. The
      selective initiation of toxin expression results in selective tumor cell destruction via
      inhibition of protein synthesis selectively in the tumor cell, enabling highly targeted
      cancer treatment.

    <description>Post screening and prior to randomization, all patients will receive gemcitabine by IV infusion at a dose of 1000mg/m2 once weekly for four weeks. They may also enter the study if they received up to 4 doses of gemcitabine before entering the study. In this case, they will be randomized immediately provided there is no evidence of disease progression.
After randomization patients will receive gemcitabine at a dose of 1000mg/m2 + 8 mg doses of BC-819 or gemcitabine at a dose of 1000mg/m2 + 12 mg doses of BC-819</description>
