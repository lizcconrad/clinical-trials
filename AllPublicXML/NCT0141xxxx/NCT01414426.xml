  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well vandetanib works in preventing head and neck
      cancer in patients with precancerous head and neck lesions. Chemoprevention is the use of
      certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of vandetanib may keep cancer from forming
      in patients with premalignant lesions

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the effect of ZD6474 (vandetanib) compared to placebo on microvessel density
      (MVD) from baseline to 3 months in patients at risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)
      with preneoplastic lesions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Change in MVD over 6 months. II. Change in putative targets of ZD6474: tissues will be
      analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor
      (pEGFR), EGFR, phosphorylated-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (pVEGFR2),
      VEGFR2.

      III. Change in proliferative index as measured by Ki-67 IHC. IV. Safety, tolerability, and
      adherence to ZD6474 for 6 months in patients at risk for OSCC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare OSCC incidence in both study arms (ZD6474 and placebo).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive vandetanib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 9 and 12 months and then
      every 6 months for 2 years.
