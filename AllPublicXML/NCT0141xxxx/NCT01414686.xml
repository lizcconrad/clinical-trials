    <textblock>
      More than half of individuals post-stroke have residual movement disabilities, including
      reduced mobility, balance, and increased risk of falling. There is a need for innovative,
      long-term and economically-feasible interventions for those with chronic stroke. Recently, a
      focus has been placed on the use of virtual reality and interactive gaming as a low cost and
      effective manner of treating movement disorders. Yet few studies have investigated
      interactive gaming platforms effect on balance following stroke. The proposed study is a
      randomized, single-blind, control group cross-over study for individuals with chronic stroke
      designed to examine an innovative therapeutic approach by investigating the effects of
      commercially-available gaming systems on balance, mobility and fear of falling in a sample of
      individuals with chronic motor deficits following stroke.

      Objective: To determine if playing active video games results in improved balance and motor
      performance.

      Design: Randomized-matched, single-blind, control group cross-over study Setting: Laboratory
      Patients: Participants with chronic hemiparesis post-stroke were randomly assigned to a
      gaming group or normal activity control group.

      Interventions: Gaming systems provided an interactive interface of real-time movement of
      either themselves or an avatar on the screen. Participants played games 1 hour/day, 4
      days/week, for 5 weeks, totaling 20 hours of game-play. The intervention was strictly
      game-play without physical therapy. All games were played in standing position and trainers
      supervised to protect against loss of balance.

      Measurements: Both groups were tested prior to and following the 5 weeks (post-test) and 3
      months following the completion of the intervention/control. Outcome measures included:
      Fugl-Meyer Motor Exam, Single Leg Stance time, symmetrical weight bearing, Berg Balance
      Scale, Dynamic Gait Index, Timed Up and Go, Six Minute Walk, 3 Meter Walk, step length
      differential, and perception of recovery.

    <description>Two commercially available gaming platforms were used in this study, the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PS 2. The Wii games included &quot;Wii Sports&quot; and &quot;Wii Fit&quot;; PS games included the EyeToy &quot;Play 2&quot; and &quot;Kinetic&quot;. Each of these games provides multiple mini games which pose different movement challenges, including dynamic balance, speed, accuracy, general mobility, and weight shifts.
Game play was performed 1 hour/day, 4 days/ week, for a period of 5 weeks, totaling 20 hours.</description>
