  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of perinatal transmission is essential to decrease the global burden of chronic
      HBV. Recombinant HBV vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) given after delivery to
      the newborns of HBsAg positive mothers is the standard of care for prevention of HBV in
      babies. Some studies have however, shown that vaccine alone may be equally effective. Hence,
      immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine with or without HBIG is effective in prevention of
      transmission of overt HBV infection to the babies. The primary outcome measure of most of the
      trials on immunoprophylaxis was the occurrence of hepatitis B, defined as a blood specimen
      positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). However, whether this immunoprophylaxis
      also prevents HBsAg negative HBV infection (occult HBV infection) in babies is not known. In
      the present study the investigators evaluated the efficacy of the two regimens; vaccination
      alone and compared it with vaccination plus HBIG administration at birth in preventing
      transmission of both overt and occult HBV infection to the newborn babies.
