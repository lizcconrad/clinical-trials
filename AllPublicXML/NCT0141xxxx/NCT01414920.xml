      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of TAK-875, once daily
      (QD), in combination with sitagliptin QD in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAK-875 is being developed at Takeda Global Research and Development, Inc. as an adjunct to
      diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM.

      Sitagliptin is an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) approved as an adjunct to diet
      and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM.

      This study will investigate the effects of the combination of TAK-875 with a DDP-4 inhibitor
      on glycosylated hemoglobin reduction.
