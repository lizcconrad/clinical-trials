      Introduction. The cardiovascular diseases, at the origin of 4 deaths out of 10, remain the
      leading cause of mortality in Europe. According to WHO, this tendency will spread in 2020 on
      a worldwide scale. These pathologies are avoidable on the whole by the adoption of healthy
      lifestyles. To prevent occurred of the cardiovascular affections is, more than ever, a major
      goal of Public health. The transborder &quot;Great Area&quot;, localised zone in the middle of Europe
      between the very high cardiovascular risks of the North and the weaker risks of the South,
      constitutes a zone privileged for the action against the cardiovascular diseases. However,
      there to date does not exist any joint action in this geographical area. The Public Research
      centre of the Health of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, the School of Public health of the
      University of Liege, the Clinical Center of Investigation of the University hospital of Nancy
      and the University hospital of the Saar wish to be linked and mutualiser their means
      available and their complementary competences in order to evaluate and to act on the
      cardiovascular health of the citizens of the &quot;Great Area&quot;. Over one 3 years period the
      Nutrition project, Environment and Cardiovascular Health (NESCAV) aims at creating on the
      level of the Great Area a transborder alliance of prevention and promotion of cardiovascular
      health. This great multicentric transverse investigation and poly-set of themes will make it
      possible to collect relevant data on cardiovascular health of the population of the Great
      area.

      Objective of this biomedical research project: It is about multicentric, transverse a
      Européenne epidemiological study aiming, through biological questionnaires and analyses, to
      collect information on the cardiovascular risk factors within the Great Area.

      Methods: In Lorraine, this study will be carried out on 800 subjects from 18 to 69 years
      taking part simultaneously in a quinquennial assessment of preventive medicine (CPAM), in the
      Centers of Preventive medicine (CMP) of Nancy and Longwy. The study will proceed on 1 year
      and six months, the recruitment of the volunteers will finish with the end of the year 2011.
      Data collected: General questionnaire, medical examination Quantification of the nutritional
      contributions Perception of the participant on the methods of assumption of responsibility of
      various risk factors cardiovascular Blood and urinary biological taking away: glycemia,
      HbA1C, insulin (specific study analyzes), total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL
      cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteines A1 and B, numeration of blood picture,
      creatinin, uric acid, gamma WP, GOT, GPT, CRP; and a urinary collection (a micturition) in
      order to proportion the microalbuminurie. A plasmathèque will be made up, in order to measure
      later on biomarqueurs of the cardiovascular risk (biological collection stored with the CIC).
      A measurement of pollutants and poisons will be carried out starting from taking away of
      hair. (analyzes realized in Luxembourg) Data analysis: All the relative data with the
      participants will be anonymisées with the CMP before export to the CIC. These anonymized data
      will also be the subject of a treatment computerized in the countries taking part in the
      study, and a database common to the partners of the Great area will be made up, in order to
      compare the characteristics of the 3 transborder populations.
