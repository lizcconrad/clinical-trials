  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators enrolled 144 subjects admitted to ICUs: 60 patients with systemic
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and 84 patients with sepsis. Tests for serum sTREM-1,
      PCT, and CRP levels and blood culture were performed on the day of admission and with the
      occurrence of FUO (&gt;38.3ºC) during hospitalization. Based on the results of blood culture,
      the subjects were divided into bacteremia (33 patients) and non-bacteremia groups (51
      patients). Based on 28-day survival, bacteremia patients were also divided into survivor (22
      patients) and non-survivor groups (11 patients). Serum sTREM-1 and PCT levels were summarized
      as medians (interquartile ranges) and CRP levels were presented as means ± standard
      deviations. To explore the early diagnostic value of soluble triggering receptor expressed on
      myeloid cells 1 (sTREM-1), procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels for
      identification of sepsis and bacteremia and the prognosis among patients with a fever of
      unknown origin (FUO) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to discuss the clinical application
      of the results.
