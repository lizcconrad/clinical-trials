    <textblock>
      Metabolites of dietary phosphatidylcholine- choline and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)- were
      recently identified as being associated with myocardial infarction in a case-control study.
      The latter TMAO is a gut-microflora-derived choline metabolite that has been shown to be a
      potent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This pilot study seeks to use
      information derived from a dietary questionnaire in children to test the association of
      dietary choline intake to plasma levels of TMAO as well as the relationship between plasma
      choline levels and components of atherogenic dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides and small
      LDL, and reduced HDL cholesterol). An ancillary goal of this study is to build on existing
      programs of community outreach to local Oakland/Berkeley minority communities, and to develop
      an infrastructure for family-based and community participation in clinical research across
      the full age spectrum and among diverse populations. This pilot study will examine the
      association of dietary choline intake assessed by food frequency questionnaires to biomarkers
      of CVD risk in 40 children (&gt; 7 years of age) and their parents as there is no information
      regarding this relationship in children. The results of this pilot study will form the basis
      for a proposal to carry out a randomized intervention trial to directly test the effects of
      dietary choline intake on plasma TMAO and lipoprotein levels. Ultimately, better
      understanding of the relationship between dietary choline intake and CVD risk factors may
      facilitate the formulation of appropriate dietary choline recommendations in children and
      adults.

      From interested participants (children and parents) we will obtain:

        1. Informed consent

        2. Anthropometric measurements - height, weight, waist and hip circumference, blood
           pressure, % body fat by bioimpedance (Tanita scale).

        3. Health History Questionnaire

        4. Food Frequency Questionnaire

        5. Fasting blood sample- We will collect a total of 40 ml of blood (less than 3 ml/kg for
           the entire study). The blood samples will be used to measure triglyceride,
           LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, apoA1, apoB, C-reactive protein,
           lipoprotein subfraction analysis by ion mobility, DNA for inclusion in our DNA biobank,
           choline, TMAO and other metabolites related to heart disease risk.

      Standard Blood sampling: Using standard blood collection procedures, blood samples will be
      collected from participants after a 12-14 hour fast. The blood will be collected in tubes
      containing the following preservative solution: 3.0 gms EDTA (dipotassium), 1.7 mg P-Pack,
      0.15 gms gentamycin sulfate, 0.15 gms chloramphenicol, 5.96 mls aprotinin (Sigma A-6279), and
      0.30 gms sodium azide all of which are diluted to 20mls with doubly deionized water. Plasma
      is separated by immediate centrifugation at 4Â°C. Lipid and lipoprotein measurements are
      performed and aliquots of plasma are frozen for future analyses.
