      Heart bypass surgery is used to increase blood flow to the heart. This surgery is usually
      done using a heart-lung machine (on-pump surgery) allowing the surgeon to perform the
      procedure on a still heart. However, this heart-lung machine causes an inflammatory response
      and is linked with complications such as heart injury, stroke, brain injury, kidney failure,
      need for blood transfusions, irregular heart rhythms and death. An effective way of
      counteracting the effects of the heart-lung machine is to not use the pump itself, thus
      performing the bypass surgery with a beating heart (off-pump surgery). However, off-pump
      surgery is technically more difficult, possibly associated with a decrease in graft patency.
      The ongoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Off or On Pump Revascularization Study (CORONARY),
      is a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing bypass surgery done with and without the
      pump. Worldwide, 4700 patients will be included and followed up for 5 years. The proposed
      research project, The Patency AssessmenT of grafts pErformed iN CORONARY (PATENCY-CORONARY),
      is a prospective clinical trial for the evaluation of patency (or &quot;openness&quot;) of the bypass
      grafts that will enrol 1200 consecutive CORONARY patients reaching their one year follow-up.
      Patients will undergo a non-invasive scan using X-rays to safely and quickly evaluate graft
      patency. The PATENCY-CORONARY trial will determine if off-pump surgery is associated with
      decreased graft patency at 1-year post-surgery compared to on-pump surgery when performed by
      skilled surgeons in different clinical settings, whether decreased graft patency is
      associated with adverse short and long-term outcomes, and explore other risk factors
      associated with decreased graft patency.

      Background: As Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) aims to restore adequate blood supply
      to the ischemic heart, the success of the operation should depend mainly on the patency of
      the bypass grafts. Graft failure has consequences similar to those of native coronary artery
      disease: recurrent angina, myocardial infarct (MI), additional revascularization procedures,
      and premature death. CABG is generally performed using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with
      cardioplegic arrest allowing the surgeon to complete the delicate coronary anastomoses on a
      still heart in a bloodless field. Off-pump CABG surgery using specially designed heart
      stabilizer systems has been proposed as a less invasive approach to CABG avoiding the CPB
      circuit itself. The benefits of off-pump CABG compared with conventional on-pump CABG are
      still intensively debated. Multislice spiral computed tomography angiography (CTA) represents
      a non-invasive method as compared to conventional coronary angiography allowing a
      comprehensive and objective imaging of bypass grafts and native coronaries with elevated
      diagnostic accuracy.

      Rationale: CORONARY trial (NCT00463294) is a large, international, prospective, CIHR-funded,
      randomized controlled trial assessing both the short and long-term clinical outcomes of 4,700
      patients undergoing on-pump or off-pump CABG. However, angiographic evaluation of coronary
      graft patency was not intended in CORONARY.

      Objectives: PATENCY-CORONARY is a new prospective trial of a consecutive subset of 1,200
      CORONARY patients reaching their one-year follow-up who will undergo graft patency assessment
      using CTA and 3D reconstructions. This trial will determine whether off-pump compared to
      on-pump CABG surgery is associated with lower CABG patency when performed by experienced
      surgeons and if there is an association between graft failure assessed by CTA, and the
      occurrence of CORONARY primary outcomes (composite of death, angina, MI, stroke, renal
      failure and new coronary revascularization [CABG or PCI]).

      Primary outcome: CABG patency index (i.e. the percentage of patent [non-occluded] distal
      anastomoses out of the total number of distal anastomoses for all patients) at 1 year after
      CABG surgery by experienced surgeons; Secondary outcomes: 1) graft lesion severity on a
      3-point scale at 1 year (mimicking the FitzGibbon grading ABO); and 2) percentage of patients
      with at least one occluded bypass graft at 1 year; Tertiary outcome: correlation between CTA
      findings (compromised grafts) with CORONARY primary outcomes(composite of death, angina, MI,
      stroke, renal failure and new coronary revascularization [CABG or PCI]), at one and five-year
      of follow-up post-CABG.

      Methods: All CORONARY patients reaching their one-year follow-up will be included
      consecutively in the PATENCY-CORONARY trial until the target of 1,200 CTA is reached and
      reasons for exclusion will be noted prospectively to prevent selection bias. Amount of
      contrast agent used, radiation dose and potential morbidities during this imaging procedure
      will be recorded. Each CTA examination will be assessed by two experienced and blinded
      radiologists and each graft will be classified according to conduit type and portions: body
      of the graft, anastomoses and the distal native coronary bed. In addition of PATENCY-CORONARY
      outcome analyses, patients undergoing CTA will be compared to excluded patients (no CTA) and
      the overall cohort of patients.
