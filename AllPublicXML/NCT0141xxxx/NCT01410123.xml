  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a series of 3 linked randomized clinical trials of 6 month duration, with a
      total of 12 month follow-up, to evaluate the effect of Integrated Stepped Care on drinking
      outcomes and HIV biologic markers (including VACS index) in HIV-infected patients with
      unhealthy alcohol use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy alcohol use threatens the health benefits seen with antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      for HIV-infected (HIV+) patients. Although research has demonstrated the efficacy of brief
      interventions, motivational counseling, and medications to treat unhealthy alcohol use in HIV
      uninfected patients, there is limited research or use of these treatments in HIV+ patients.
      We have demonstrated that integrated treatment of addiction in HIV clinics is feasible.
      Stepped care algorithms can facilitate the evaluation of varying intensities of treatments
      for unhealthy alcohol use. The proposed study will compare onsite Integrated Stepped Care
      treatment (ISC) to treatment as usual (TAU) in three, linked, 6-month randomized clinical
      trials in 642 HIV+ patients with unhealthy alcohol use. Screened patients are randomized to
      ISC or TAU after determining that they meet criteria for either 1) at-risk drinking, 2)
      alcohol abuse or dependence or 3) moderate alcohol consumption in the presence of liver
      disease. ISC and TAU are tailored to the drinking category. ISC for at-risk drinkers and
      those with Moderate Alcohol use and Liver Disease begins with a brief intervention and is
      stepped up to Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) in those who meet predefined failure
      criteria. ISC for abuse or dependence begins with addiction physician management (APM)
      including alcohol pharmacotherapy if not contraindicated. APM is stepped up to include MET if
      predefined failure criteria are met. The study will test the hypothesis that ISC leads to
      decreased alcohol consumption and improved HIV biomarkers. Data analyses will be conducted on
      the intention to treat sample.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be HIV-infected and receiving HIV care at one of the participating medical centers.

          2. Meet one of the following criteria for unhealthy alcohol use:

               -  At-risk Drinking Study- greater than 14 drinks per week or greater than 4 drinks
                  per occasion in men and greater than 7 drinks per week or greater than 3 drinks
