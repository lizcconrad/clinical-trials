      The purpose of this study is to find out if a counseling program the investigators have
      developed can help breast cancer survivors adopt a healthier lifestyle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group of breast cancer
      survivors will receive general information on how to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. The
      other group of breast cancer survivors will receive counseling on how to increase their level
      of physical activity.

      Participants will have three consultations with a health counselor. The first two
      consultations will take place in-person and the third consultation will take place via
      telephone. Participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires assessing their
      physical and mental well-being, their dietary habits, and their physical activity habits at
      four time-points: in-person during their first study visit, via mail or through an online
      survey 6 weeks later, in-person 12 weeks later, and via mail or through an online survey 24
      weeks later. Additionally, during their first study visit and 12 weeks later, their level of
      aerobic fitness will be tested by having participants walk a long hallway for six minutes.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief Motivational Interviewing (MI) based intervention, relative to a time and attention control intervention (healthy lifestyle counseling), in promoting physical activity among early-stage breast cancer survivors who are physically inactive but are contemplating increasing their level of physical activity.</description>
