    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively compare the findings of two diagnostic tests, Direct Magnetic
      Resonance Arthrography(MRA) and Indirect MRA, to the findings during shoulder arthroscopy in
      patients with shoulder pain. The sensitivity and specificity of both Direct and Indirect
      MRA's in diagnosing specific pathologies of the shoulder will be determined using shoulder
      arthroscopy as the gold standard.

    <textblock>
      Direct MR arthrography (MRA) requires the injection of a contrast agent into the shoulder
      under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This
      is invasive, risks infection, and requires time and resources. It has recently been shown
      that the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances the joint cavity
      during an MRI and thus indirectly produces an arthrographic effect(Indirect MRA). The study
      will enroll patients who have already had a Direct MRA as part of their standard of care
      diagnostic test for shoulder pain, if it is determined by their surgeon that arthroscopic
      surgery is indicated they will be asked if they would be willing to have an Indirect MRA
      prior to their arthroscopic surgery. The patient will need to have a blood test(BUN and
      Creatinine)done to ensure kidney function is normal, and a serum and urine pregnancy test, if
      female, to ensure there is no pregnancy, prior to the completion of the Indirect MRA. After
      the patient's scheduled shoulder arthroscopic surgery, the results of the two MR arthrography
      techniques will be compared for sensitivity and specificity in detecting partial and full
      thickness rotator cuff tears, labral tears, long head biceps dislocation/tearing, and grade
      IV cartilage lesions by comparing the results to the actual arthroscopic findings. The Direct
      MR arthrography and arthroscopic surgery are standard of care and would occur regardless of
      this study, the Indirect MR arthrography is the diagnostic intervention that is
      study-related.

    <description>This study will compare the findings of the Indirect MRA and the retrospective data of the Direct MRA, to the results obtained during their arthroscopic shoulder surgery in patients with shoulder pain. The incidence of partial and full thickness rotator cuff tears, long head biceps dislocation/tearing, and grade IV cartilage lesions will be recorded for each type of MRA of the shoulder. The sensitivity and specificity of both direct and indirect MR arthrography in diagnosing shoulder problems will be determined by what was actually visualized during their arthroscopic shoulder surgery.</description>

    <description>After patient has signed consent and had blood tests to ensure normal kidney function (BUN and Creatinine) as well as serum and urine pregnancy tests for females to ensure there is no pregnancy, the patient will have an Indirect MRA. The participant will be weighed and the correct dose of 0.1 mmol/kg calculated. An IV will be inserted into participant's arm. The gadopentetate dimeglumine will be injected into the IV and the patient will be asked to gently exercise the shoulder (small windmills and flexion/extension) for 5 minutes. The patients then undergo MRI imaging 15-30 minutes after the injection. Contraindications include known allergy to gadopentetate dimeglumine, and renal failure with creatinine clearance of less than 30ml/min.</description>
