      Phase I part, Primary objective: the maximum tolerated dose of S-1 in the SLOG regimen
      Secondary objectives: the dose-limiting toxicity of the regimen Phase II part, Primary
      objective: Overall tumor response rate (by RECIST criteria) Secondary objectives: Disease
      control rate (Objective response rate (ORR) + stable disease â‰§ 16 weeks), Time to tumor
      progression, Progression-free survival, Overall survival ,Safety profile, Biomarker study

      Phase I: 2~24 patients Phase II: Considering a design with p0 = 0.25 and p1 = 0.40 for which
      error is 0.10 and errors is 0.20, these constraints can be met with a two-stage Simon's
      design of 25 patients in the first stage and 27 patients in the second stage.

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be entered in cohorts of three. In any dose level of S-1, if none develops DLT as listed after the first two doses of SLOG chemotherapy, another cohort of 3 patients will be accrued to the next dose level. If at any time two or more patients develop DLT at the same dose level, the dose escalation will be terminated, and the prior dosage level will be considered the MTD.</description>

    <measure>to evaluate the following items in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receiving SLOG treatment,</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>9.2.1 Simon's optimal two-stage design will be used to determine the target patient number for the phase II part of this study. Using the approach, we test a null hypothesis that the true-response probability is less than an uninteresting level (p0) of 25% against the alternative hypothesis that the true response probability is at least as great as a target level (p1) of 40%. Response probabilities less than 25% will be considered inactive while response probabilities greater than 40% will be called highly effective.</description>

In case of grade 4 or complication neutropenia, patients may receive G-CSF according to the regulation of National Insurance Bureru treated with appropriate antibiotics. Therapeutic G-CSF may be used at the discretion of attending physicians.</description>
