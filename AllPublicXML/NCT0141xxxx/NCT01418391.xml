  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) is a new regional block for abdominal wall.It
      had been reported the effect of post-operative pain control in minor abdominal surgery, such
      as inguinal hernia repair and appendectomy. On the other hand, because of the accurate of the
      pre-operative images, the minimal laparotomy for colon cancer was accomplished. Thus, the
      purpose of this study is to investigate the effect, such as analgesic effect, hemodynamic
      stability, and post-operative morphine consumption, of TAP block in minimal laparotomy.

      outcome measures:

        -  Hemodynamic parameters (mean artery pressure, heart rate): recorded at time points of
           before induction of general anesthesia (baseline), after tracheal intubation
           immediately, after surgery started 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min; then
           recorded them every 10 mins.

        -  Post-operative morphine consumption: recorded morphine consumption at the time intervals
           of post-operative 0~6 h, 6~12 h, 12~24 h, 24~36 h, and 36~48 h ,respectively. The total
           amount of morphine consumption was also counted.
