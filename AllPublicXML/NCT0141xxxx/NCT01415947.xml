  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The V-Chordal System is a new technology for mitral repair. The Valtech V-Chordal system,
      consists in the ability to adjust (elongate or shorten) the neochordae &quot;off-pump&quot; to achieve
      an optimal coaptation. The adjustment mechanism allows overcoming the main problem of chordal
      replacement by enabling accurate sizing of the chords.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Degenerative mitral insufficiency with mitral leaflet prolapsed , who are candidates
             for mitral valve repair according to ESC or ACC/AHA guidelines.

          -  Patient able and willing to return to the implant center for follow-up visits

          -  Able and willing to give informed consent and follow protocol procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inadequate echocardiographic window for transthoracic imaging

          -  Severe organic lesions with retraction of chordate tendineae, severly fibrotic and
             immobile leaflets, severely deformed subvalvular apparatus.

          -  Evolving endocarditis or active endocarditis in the last 3 months.

          -  Heavily calcified annulus or leaflets.

          -  Congenital malformation with limited valvular tissue

          -  Patient requires mitral valve replacement.

          -  Previously implanted annuloplasty ring/band.

          -  Patient requires aortic or pulmonic valve replacement or repair.

          -  Patient is pregnant (urine HCG test result positive) or lactating.

          -  Patient has a major cardiac or non-cardiac disease, which in the investigator's
             experience produces an unacceptable surgical risk.

          -  Life expectancy of less than twelve months.

          -  Patient is participating in concomitant research studies of investigational products.
