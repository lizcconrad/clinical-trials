    <textblock>
      This study is being done to provide valid data on the evolution of a cohort of French
      participants treated with ezetimibe, alone or in combination with a statin, to be used in
      simulation models for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patterns of drug use, evolution of risk
      factors for CVD, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and goal attainment in low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels over time will be analyzed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Cardiovascular (CV) Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who experienced myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, ischemic stroke, revascularization procedure, fatal stroke, and/or sudden death was recorded. The number of events was divided by the total number of patient-years calculated for each treatment group to produce the rate of CV events per 1000 patient years.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Levels at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>LDL-C levels at baseline and after 12 months of treatment were compared and the percentage change was recorded. In the model, it is assumed that the 5th and 95th percentiles represent the minimum and maximum effect of treatment, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With CV Risk Factors</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrollment (baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Enrolled participants' data were reviewed for presence of CV risk factors that included smoking, alcohol &amp; substance abuse, high blood pressure, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, cholesterol level, hypertriglyceridemia, body mass index, cardiovascular disease history, family history of early cardiovascular disease. The sum of all risk factors was tabulated for each participant and totals were summarized by group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Continued Treatment for 12, 24, 36, and 48 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' data reviewed and the number of participants who had continued treatment for 12, 24, 36, and 48 months was recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Discontinuation of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who stopped study drug at least once during the study period was recorded and summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who died from any cause was recorded. The number of deaths was then extrapolated to produce the number of deaths per 100,000 patient-years.</description>
