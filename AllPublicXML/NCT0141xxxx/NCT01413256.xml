      Background:

      Respiratory allergic reaction causes great suffering to millions of people worldwide. One of
      the most known allergen- is the pollen from vegetation, ragweed. Genus Ambrosia Ambrosia
      belonged to the complex ragweed flowers are pollinated by the wind and the plant's male
      flowers produce large quantities of small grains of pollen and airborne over long distances
      and those causes allergic reactions. The plant blooms between June and October, creating a
      second wave after wave of allergy caused by spring blossoms.

      This plant originated in North America has invaded many areas in Europe and in recent years,
      taking over large areas in Israel, Hula Valley and northern Acre Emek Hefer for a pen and
      layers to the south. After ragweed plants are based in particular they spread quickly and
      invade agricultural fields and significantly reduce the crop.

      High allergenic ragweed is a health hazard to humans. Ragweed plant investigated many aspects
      of North America and Europe in recent decades and extensive literature on ambrosia, but this
      is the first time ragweed study focuses on Israel.

      Working hypothesis and aims:

      Goal of this study is to identify the existence and nature of the sensitivity distribution of
      ragweed in Israel.

      Importance of research:

      A. Ragweed allergen testing and comparing the effect of exposure to plants on the sensitivity
      of the allergic Israeli patients

      B. The inclusion of ragweed allergen in the diagnostic and therapeutic panel
