    <textblock>
      The Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Patient Registry Initiative (NPRI) is a web-based registry
      that asks participants to fill out a 30-minute online questionnaire to collect information
      about the spectrum of medical and social problems experienced by children and adults with
      NF1. The information gained from your participation may one day help doctors develop
      personalized treatments for individuals living with NF1.

      We are currently enrolling individuals with NF1 who either (1) HAVE previously been diagnosed
      with a brain tumor younger than 18 years or (2) HAVE NEVER had a brain tumor. Please note:
      there is no therapy associated with this study. Individuals may participate in the registry
      by going to https://nf1registry.wustl.edu/
