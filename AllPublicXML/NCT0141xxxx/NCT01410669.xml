  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a randomized trial to determine if motivational interviewing (MI) is an
      effective intervention to help women in abusive intimate relationships. The study objective
      is to motivate abused women to identify and achieve their own specific goals that can help
      them address the violence in their lives. This project will be integrated into the setting of
      a busy family planning clinic in the mid-western United States, which serves a largely rural
      population. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is screened using the Women's Experience with
      Battering Scale (WEB), a modified Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS), and the Danger Assessment
      Screen (DAS). An expected 250 women who screen positive for IPV will be enrolled, randomized
      to the intervention or to usual care group, and complete the 6-month study protocol. All
      subjects complete a self-administered computer-based questionnaire at the initial and 6-month
      follow up visits to measure self-efficacy (primary outcome), stage of readiness to change,
      selected IPV-related health correlates (e.g., depression), and steps taken and resources
      used. The MI intervention is an &quot;active listening&quot; counseling technique aimed at guiding the
      patient towards identifying feasible, personalized goals and steps she can take to increase
      her self-efficacy and control in the relationship. The trained study interviewer will work
      with participants to identify steps they can safely take and local resources to help them
      meet their goals. The MI protocol consists of a face-to-face counseling session at baseline
      with follow-up telephone interviews conducted at 1-, 2-, and 4-months post-intervention to
      reinforce the intervention and assess the participants' level safety. The control group will
      receive usual care, which includes talking with a Level 3 Domestic Violence Advocate and
      receiving a comprehensive list of domestic violence resources. Effectiveness of the MI
      intervention will be determined by increased self-efficacy, measured by the Domestic Violence
      Coping and Self-Efficacy Scale, a validated tool for use among women with a recent history of
      domestic abuse; and by a reduction in depressive symptoms (CESD-10). The impact of the
      intervention will be assessed by an increase in participants' readiness-to-change, and extent
      of their involvement in a wide variety of self-help and coping activities over the follow-up
      period. If successful, this screening and intervention program will be translated to other
      clinical settings.

    <description>MI is a &quot;client-centered&quot; counseling approach developed to deliver stage-tailored intervention messages using non-confrontational, supportive communication strategies. The client is encouraged to explore the barriers and facilitating factors associated with the behavior change. The interviewer's role is to guide the conversation and avoid use of conventional directive approaches (e.g., persuasion, providing information).
In this trial, a trained motivational interviewer meets individually with patients randomized to the intervention for one-hour at baseline, followed by four MI telephone follow up contacts at 1-, 2-, and 4-months post baseline.</description>
