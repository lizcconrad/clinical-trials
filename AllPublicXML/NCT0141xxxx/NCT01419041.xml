        Inclusion Criteria:

        All Subjects

          -  Healthy male and/or female of non childbearing potential subjects between the ages of
             18 and 65 years, inclusive ('healthy' is defined as no clinically relevant
             abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination,
             including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG, and clinical
             laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18 to 40 kg/m2 inclusive; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg
             (&gt;110 lbs).

        Subjects with Normal Renal Function (Group 1)

          -  Normal renal function (CLcr =&gt;90 mL/min) during the screening period.

          -  Matched 1-to-1 to subjects in Group 2 with respect to age (+/-5 years), weight (+/-10
             kg), gender, and race according to protocol.

        Subjects with Severe Renal Impairment (Groups 2)

          -  Good general health commensurate with the population with chronic kidney disease.

          -  Severe renal impairment (CLcr&lt;30 mL/min) during the screening period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All Subjects

          -  Renal allograft recipients.

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption.

          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;470 msec at screening.

          -  Urinary incontinence without catheterization.

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential, including those with
             tubal ligation.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

        Subjects with Severe Renal Impairment (Groups 2)

          -  Subjects with any significant hepatic, cardiac or pulmonary disease (apart from stable
             ischemic heart disease), or subjects who are clinically nephrotic.

          -  Subjects requiring hemodialysis.

          -  Subjects with strict fluid restriction (ie, &lt;1500 mL/24 hours).

          -  Significant bleeding diathesis which could preclude multiple venipuncture.

          -  Use of food or drugs that are CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.

          -  Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior
             to the first dose of trial medication

          -  Concurrent use of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices.
