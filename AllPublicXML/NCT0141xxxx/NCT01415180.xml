  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis represents the leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. However, as distinct
      from adult medicine, there exists a large knowledge gap regarding long term health related
      quality of life (HRQL) and functional status (FS) following pediatric sepsis. This lack of
      sepsis outcomes data is critical because failure to identify children at risk for sepsis
      associated HRQL/FS deterioration may delay delivery of crucial rehabilitation medicine
      efforts to facilitate recovery. Moreover, failure to identify mechanisms of sepsis associated
      HRQL/FS deterioration may impede development of novel, effective interventions for these
      children. For the first time the LAPSE investigation will quantify deterioration of HRQL/FS
      among children surviving sepsis. We will measure the incidence, magnitude and duration of
      HRQL/FS alterations associated with pediatric septic shock, and examine clinical,
      sociodemographic, and parent/family factors potentially associated with such adverse
      outcomes. Because sepsis affects a heterogeneous group of children, long term morbidity
      associated with sepsis likely depends on premorbid health status and parent, family and home
      characteristics, as well as children's clinical course during sepsis critical illness.
      Mechanisms underlying adverse sepsis outcomes among children are poorly understood at this
      time. Clinically multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)has been clearly linked to sepsis
      mortality. To begin to understand pathophysiology underlying pediatric sepsis morbidity, this
      investigation will seek to identify evidence for association of HRQL/FS alterations following
      sepsis with intensity and duration of sepsis mediated organ dysfunction as well as with
      pre-existing comorbidities and parent, family, and home characteristics. Thelong term goal of
      this research program is to timely identify children at high risk of sepsis mediated HRQL/FS
      deterioration and ultimately to design effective interventions to minimize such risk. The
      primary objectives of this investigation are to comprehensively characterize HRQL/FS
      trajectory and to critically examine the potential role of sepsis mediated organ dysfunction
      as well as pre-existing comorbidities and parent, family,and home characteristics as risk
      factors for the adverse outcomes. The central hypothesis is that intensity of sepsis organ
      dysfunction will predict magnitude of HRQL/FS deterioration. We also hypothesize that the
      trajectory towards baseline HRQL/FS following the sepsis event will also depend on
      pre-existing co-morbidities and parent, family, and home, and characteristics. Knowledge of
      these potential mechanisms will ultimately facilitate development of targeted interventions
      to maximize HRQL/FS among children surviving sepsis.
