      This study aims to evaluate if a multidisciplinary educational program in primary
      cardiovascular prevention for children could improve the Framingham Score index of their
      parents after one year.

      Students aging 6 to 10 years old were exposed to two different approaches in the city of Sao
      Paulo, Brazil. For the students of the morning period (control group) we delivered written
      educational material for their parents in the beginning and middle of the year 2010 about
      healthy lifestyle (nutrition, exercise and smoke quitting). The students of the afternoon
      period (intervention group) received the same educational material for their parents and the
      children were exposed to a weekly educational program in cardiovascular prevention with a
      multidisciplinary heath team during the year 2010. This intervention tried to teach to these
      children, in different manners appropriate for their age, concepts of healthy nutrition,
      avoidance of tobacco and physical activity. Both at the inclusion in the study and one year
      later we collect data of parents and their children of the two groups, in a single weekend,
      including nutritional and exercise survey, measures of weigh, height, waist circumference,
      arterial blood pressure, and laboratorial exams.
