  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of treating patients with a
      brain tumor known as craniopharyngioma with limited surgery and a 5mm clinical target volume
      margin in combination with proton therapy. Proton therapy will be indicated for patients with
      diagnosed craniopharyngioma who are not treated with radical surgery (gross-total resection).
      Irradiated patients will undergo a series of evaluations designed to evaluate the effects of
      proton therapy. Similar evaluations will be performed on patients treated with radical
      surgery. Proton therapy will include 30 treatment fractions administered 5 days per week.
      Weekly imaging will be a requirement to monitor for cyst expansion and target volume
      deformation.

      The primary objectives of this study :

      To estimate the progression-free and overall survival distributions for children and young
      adults with craniopharyngioma treated with limited surgery and proton therapy using a 5mm
      clinical target volume margin while monitoring for excessive central nervous system necrosis.

      The Secondary Objectives of this study:

        -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of cystic intervention and the event-free survival
           distribution for children and young adults with craniopharyngioma treated with limited
           surgery and proton therapy using a 5mm clinical target volume margin; and compare the
           distributions of progression-free, event-free and overall survival with the
           distributions for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital cohort of 93 patients on
           which the design of this trial is based.

        -  To estimate the distributions of progression-free survival and overall survival for
           children and young adults with craniopharyngioma treated only with primary surgical
           resection and to compare these distributions with the distributions observed for
           patients treated with limited surgery and proton therapy.

    <description>Craniopharyngioma patients will have limited surgery and a 5mm clinical target volume margin in combination with proton therapy. Proton therapy will be indicated for patients with diagnosed craniopharyngioma who are not treated with radical surgery (gross-total resection). Patients who have had radical surgery or limited surgery prior to enrollment on this study and have no evidence of tumor will be observed for 5 years.
Participants receive ^1^8F-fluorodeoxyglucose and ^1^1C-methionine will be given to aid in tumor visualization.</description>

    <description>Patients will be selected for radical surgery based on the neurosurgeon's assessment that a Gross-Total Resection may be achieved with acceptable post-operative morbidity. The goal of surgical intervention in this study should be to facilitate tumor control, keeping surgical morbidity to a minimum. Common indications for surgical intervention directed at the tumor will include establishing a tissue diagnosis, tumor control by radical resection, relieving tumor mass effect to reduce symptoms and decreasing the target volume for proton therapy by planned volume reduction surgery. These indications can be achieved through radical or limited surgery.</description>

    <intervention_name>Proton Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Proton therapy will be started once a final treatment plan has been developed and approved. There is no time limit for the interval from enrollment to when proton therapy commences. The total prescribed dose will be 54CGE administered at 1.8CGE per fraction. The time course of administration will be one fraction per day, 5 days per week, for a period of 6 weeks. Radiation will be prescribed to the planning target volume which will include the tumor bed encompassed by an anatomically defined margin meant to include subclinical microscopic disease, and an additional geometric margin that is meant to account for the technical limitations associated with planning and administering daily fractionated treatment. Making radiation therapy safer through the use of proton therapy.</description>
