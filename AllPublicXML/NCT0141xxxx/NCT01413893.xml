        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject has completed a previous study utilizing linifanib (per the criteria in the
             previous study) or was active and assigned to linifanib when the study was completed
             and the investigator believes that continued treatment with linifanib is in the best
             interest of the subject.

          2. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (one
             of the following listed below) prior to study entry, for the duration of study
             participation and up to 90 days following completion of therapy. Women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation
             of treatment and/or post menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months
             to be considered of non-childbearing potential:

               -  total abstinence from sexual intercourse (minimum one complete menstrual cycle);

               -  vasectomized partner(s);

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (oral, parenteral or transdermal) for at least 3 months
                  prior to study drug administration; if the subject is currently using a hormonal
                  contraceptive, she should also use a barrier method during this study and for 1
                  month after study completion;

               -  intrauterine device (IUD);

               -  double-barrier method (condoms, contraceptive sponge, diaphragm or vaginal ring
                  with spermicidal jellies or creams);

               -  Additionally, male subjects (including those who are vasectomized) whose partners
                  are pregnant or might be pregnant must agree to use condoms for the duration of
                  the study and for 90 days following completion of therapy.

          3. Is capable of understanding and complying with parameters as outlined in the protocol
             and able to sign the informed consent, approved by an Independent Ethic Committee
             (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to the initiation of any screening or
             study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subject discontinued linifanib administration before completing the prior study (due
             to disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent, other).

          2. Subject has any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator places the
             subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.

          3. Subject is a lactating or pregnant female.
