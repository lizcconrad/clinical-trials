  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess 1) the electrical activity of the diaphragm in mechanically
      ventilated patients during weaning from mechanical ventilation. 2) Whether the electrical
      activity of the diaphragm may predict the weaning outcome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimization of the time to liberate the patient from mechanical ventilation should be
      balanced between the risks associated with failed extubation and those related to prolonged
      mechanical ventilation. Weaning failure is associated with major complications. Even when
      weaning protocols and clinical predictors have been used to improve the weaning outcome,
      there is still a significant proportion of patients who fail to breath spontaneously with
      significant risks of pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased morbidity and
      mortality rate. Electrical activity of the diaphragm, a mirror of the respiratory drive and
      now available on an ICU ventilator may help to predict in a more accurate way the weaning
      outcome. The patients will be ventilated in NAVA with the titration method (1). As soon as
      patients passed successfully a daily screening EAdi will be measured during a spontaneous
      breathing trial.

    <description>Nava is a new ventilatory mode which delivers pressure in proportion of the the Electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), a reflection of the neural respiratory output. EAdi will be obtained through a nasogastric tube with a multiple array of electrodes placed at its distal end. Correct positioning of the EAdi catheter is assured by means of a specific function of the ventilator (''EAdi catheter positioning''). The EAdi signal is processed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommendations and filtered by algorithms designed to provide the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio</description>
