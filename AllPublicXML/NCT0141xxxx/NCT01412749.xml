  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this data review research study is to create a registry database using
      information (data) collected from patients who have had Endoscopic Head and Neck Surgery
      (eHNS). Researchers want to use the registry database to learn more about short-term and
      long-term outcomes for patients who have eHNS.

      1.1 Primary Objective: To develop a registry database of patients who have had eHNS.

      1.2 Secondary Objective: To evaluate short-term oncologic parameters and functional outcomes,
      operative for patients undergoing eHNS performed at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).

      1.3 Tertiary Objective: To collect data on long-term oncologic outcomes including local and
      distant failure and survival following eHNS.

      Information from medical records will be collected and entered into the registry database at
      M. D. Anderson Cancer Center for future research related to cancer.

      The information collected from medical records will include, but is not limited to, medical
      history, sex, age, race, gender, type and stage of disease, type of treatment(s) you have
      received, radiology reports, surgical and pathological reports, the results of any test(s),
      treatment(s) and/or surgery performed.

      This is a registry study evaluating endoscopic head and neck surgery. The data from the
      surgical resection will be descriptive. Comparisons will be made to non-robotic, open
      historical controls and patients treated with radiation therapy, based on literature reports.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer who are candidates for definitive
             surgical resection of the primary tumor and who, in the opinion of the treating MDACC
             physician, are candidates for eHNS will be included

          2. Medically fit for an endoscopic surgical resection by consensus of MDACC surgical
             oncology and anesthesia faculty (common best practice criteria).

          3. Date of records anticipated to be reviewed would be from March 1, 2011 to June 30,
             2013

          4. Approximately 200 patients are expected to fit the criteria above in order to be
             eligible for prospective data collection and review.
