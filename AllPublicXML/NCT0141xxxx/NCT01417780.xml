      A study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics profile of different doses of AB103
      administered to patients diagnosed with Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections that are scheduled
      for an urgent surgical intervention as part of their standard of care. The primary study
      hypothesis is that AB-103 can be administered safely to the patients presenting with
      Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections.

      Secondary endpoints are efficacy by exploratory descriptive analyses of specific efficacy
      endpoints from three outcome domains to demonstrate treatment benefit of AB103 in comparison
      to placebo in patients with Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections. The efficacy domains are:

        1. Clinical status domain

        2. Pharmacoeconomics domain

        3. Systemic and local inflammatory biomarker domain

             gangrene/ myonecrosis) that may be supported by specific signs and symptoms, e.g.

             III-IV}, Liver dysfunction {Childs-Pugh class C}, Renal dysfunction {Dialysis}),
             immunosuppression, receiving or about to receive chemotherapy or known severe
