  <official_title>An Open-label, Single Arm, Phase II Trial to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of Sym004 in Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) Who Have Failed Anti-EGFR Monoclonal Antibody-based Therapy</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as a multi-center, open label Phase 2 trial that investigates the
      efficacy and safety of Sym004 in subjects with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck
      (SCCHN). Subjects included must have responded to previous anti-epidermal growth factor
      receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibody-based therapy and subsequently become resistant to
      that therapy. It is believed that Sym004 has the potential to induce tumor responses and
      provide a superior treatment option to subjects with advanced SCCHN.

      Symphogen was the sponsor for planning/conducting and reporting results for this trial.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from the first infusion of Sym004 until progressive disease or death, assessed up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS time was defined as the time from first infusion of Sym004 until progressive disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1. or death. PD was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on trial. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm). The unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and the appearance of one or more lesions was also considered progression. Subjects who died without confirmed PD were considered as progressed. Subjects who died or showed PD more than 21 days after last treatment were censored (that is, were considered alive without progression on Day 21 after last treatment). Evaluation was done using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Tumor Response and Derived Endpoints (Objective Response Rate and Disease Control Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first infusion of Sym004 until disease progression or death, assessed up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Best objective tumor response was defined as the occurrence of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or PD according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1.
Objective response was defined as the occurrence of CR or PR according to RECIST Version 1.1. Disease control was defined as the occurrence of CR, PR or SD according to RECIST Version 1.1.
CR: Disappearance of all lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 mm; PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all - lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first infusion of Sym004 until disease progression or death, assessed up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of overall response was defined as the time from the first time point where measurement criteria are met for CR or PR until first date of recurrence or PD was objectively documented according to RECIST Version 1.1. Duration of overall response was censored at date of last imaging data of measured lesions if no confirmation of recurrence or PD was available.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first infusion of Sym04 until disease progression, assessed up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TTP was defined as the time from first infusion of Sym004 until disease progression according to RECIST Version 1.1 criteria. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. The subjects who died without prior assessment of PD were censored for TTP.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first infusion of Sym004 until death, assessed up to 18 months</time_frame>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time</title>
        <description>The PFS time was defined as the time from first infusion of Sym004 until progressive disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1. or death. PD was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on trial. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm). The unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and the appearance of one or more lesions was also considered progression. Subjects who died without confirmed PD were considered as progressed. Subjects who died or showed PD more than 21 days after last treatment were censored (that is, were considered alive without progression on Day 21 after last treatment). Evaluation was done using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

CR: Disappearance of all lesions.
