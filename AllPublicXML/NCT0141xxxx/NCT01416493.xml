      This is a proof of concept study asking if alkaline phosphatase injections can reduce acute
      inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

      This is a proof of concept study to establish the safety of subcutaneous (sc) treatment and
      the efficacy of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in reducing specific pro-inflammatory cytokines
      during and after 3 days of twice daily s.c. treatment. A total dose of 12000 Units AP will be
      administered by 2000 IU s.c. injection twice daily for 3 days. Subjects will be closely
      followed for 8 days and regular clinical observations will be made during 3 months. Close out
      will be 3 months after initiation of treatment.

    <description>The anticipated effects of bIAP will be short lived, within 4 days. However, in order to capture durable clinical responses or any late adverse effects, patients will be followed through 3 months at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 incorporating trial observations with routine monthly care to reduce disruption to patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients of any race with an age &gt;18 years.
        Woman of child-bearing potential must be on regular contraceptives throughout the trial
        (Pregnancy tests).

        1A: RA according to the 1987 revised ARA criteria (Arnett 1987) with an active disease with
        DAS28&gt;3.2 despite the prior or concurrent use of DMARDs.

        2. Patients may be on no active therapy or may be on continuous DMARD therapy including
        Methotrexate, Sulphasalazine, Leflunomide, Hydroxychloroquine, Myocrisin alone or in
        combination, or on NSAID treatment, or on steroid (prednisolone not more than 10mg/day).

        3. Patients must have a measurable acute phase response: CRP (&gt; 10mg/dl), ESR &gt; 25. (to be
        measured on routine lab range CRP/ ESR/AP/ standard biochemistry)

        4. Patients eligible for treatment with biological TNFα blockers and who are awaiting the
        administration of such treatment may enroll in the laboratory and safety protocols Data for
        Clinical Phase observations will be collected but will be handled as last observation
        carried forward for the final records prior to the administration of TNF blocking agent,
        should that occur within the 3-month Clinical Phase. The administration of TNFα blockers
        will not be delayed for the protocol.

        5. Patients who have given written informed consent prior to participation in the trial and
        who undertake to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are unwilling or unable to be fully evaluated for follow-up.

          2. Patients who have an active infection or who are suspected of having systemic
             infection and or patients that are treated with antibiotics.

          3. Patients whose screening blood do not reflect a sufficient cytokine or acute phase
             response.

          4. Patients who have evidence of significant hepatic disease, including history of
             clinical signs or laboratory values of total bilirubin &gt; 34.2 umol/L (&gt; 2.0 mg/dL),
             ALT (&gt;120) or AST (&gt;135) corresponding to &gt; 3X upper limit of normal.

          5. Alkaline phosphatase levels must be less 145 IU/L (routine clinical method)

          6. Patients who received investigational drugs in the 30 days prior to study drug
             administration, or are currently participating in a study during which the
             administration of investigational drugs within one month is anticipated.

          7. Patients who have renal insufficiency (history of creatinine &gt;177umol/L or &gt;2.0 mg/dL)
             or chronic renal failure requiring dialysis.

          8. Patients with severe neurological deficits (see Appendix I).

          9. Patients who have a recent history of drug substance or alcohol abuse.

         10. Patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenia.

         11. Patients with a history of cancer who have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy
             within the past 3 months. Patients receiving only adjuvant hormonal therapy are not
             excluded. If the cancer has not resolved completely, the patient should not be
             enrolled without permission of Alloksys.

         12. Patients receiving oral glucocorticoids &gt;10mg /day or any IV, IM or Intra articular
             dosing within 30 days of commencing the protocol.

         13. Patients who are vegetarians or veganists or those patients that may be expected not
             to be tolerant to bovine proteins, or not to wish exposure to bovine proteins for
             personal reasons.

         14. Patients who are, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor, unsuitable for
             the study.
