  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if complementary and alternative medicines (CAM)
      should be included with traditional therapy for women with ovarian cancer. Some of the
      alternative medicines include non-traditional drug and herbal therapies along with dietary
      and nutritional strategies. Only a few of these alternative medicines have been tested with
      women with ovarian cancer.

      The study will be offered to women with ovarian cancer who are receiving care at the
      Gynecologic Oncology Clinic at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. Prospective candidates,
      identified via chart review, will receive a mailing that describes and invites them to be
      screened for eligibility. Potential participants seen in the clinic will also be approached
      and invited to participate.

      The informed consent process and pretesting will take place in the clinic, with exceptions
      made as needed for women who prefer to complete documents at home.

      The intervention, which will consist of four educational CAM sessions, will be held on site
      in a private room at Moffitt Cancer Center. Immediately before and after each session, we
      will administer a brief on-site pre- and post-test. Upon completion of the intervention,
      participants will be asked to complete a post-test on site or at home, depending on their
      preference. Follow-up telephone calls will be made to the participants at 8 weeks after the
      last session.

      Pre- and post-test measures will focus on quality of life, prior use of CAM therapies, topic
      preferences, knowledge gained from the presentations, changed intentions and behaviors
      associated with CAM, and satisfaction with the program.

    <description>Aim 3, symptom experience, quality of life, and knowledge of CAM therapies will be measured pre- and post- CAM education programs. Pre-test means, post-test means, and pre-post difference score means, along with standard deviations, will be calculated. No formal power analysis is planned because this is a pilot study to collect preliminary information for future larger studies.</description>
