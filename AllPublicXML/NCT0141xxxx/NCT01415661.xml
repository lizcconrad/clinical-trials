  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation was designed to assess the patency of the esophageal entrance during
      cricoid pressure (CP) in anesthetized, paralyzed obese and non obese patients using the
      Glidescope 速 video laryngoscope (GVL).

    <textblock>
      Eighty-nine patients undergoing surgeries necessitating general anesthesia and tracheal
      intubation were enrolled in this study. Group 1 (OB) including obese patients (n= 59) was
      undergoing bariatric surgery. Following rapid sequence induction/intubation (RSII) anesthesia
      with cricoid pressure, clear view of the vocals cord and the entrance to the esophagus were
      assessed using Glidescope速 video laryngoscope before intubation and following intubation.
      Following securing the airway, efficacy of cricoid pressure was tested by the capability to
      insert gastric tubes (20 and 38 Fr) under direct vision using GVL. Group 2 (NOB) including
      non-obese patients (n=30) was undergoing moderate surgery requiring tracheal intubation under
      general anesthesia. Efficacy of cricoid pressure was also tested similarly using GT's (20 and
      38 Fr) following induction of anesthesia and before intubation. Inability of GT insertion was
      recorded as non-patent esophagus (effective CP) and successful insertion of GT was recorded
      as patent esophagus (ineffective CP). Then CP was released and insertion of GT achieved for
      correct verification of the esophageal opening position in both groups.
