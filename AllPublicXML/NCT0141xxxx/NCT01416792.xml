  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional cardiac surgery requires patient connection to the Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB)
      apparatus which takes over the function of the heart and lungs while the surgeon performs the
      necessary surgery. The residual blood left in the CPB equipment (1.5-2.0 L) is centrifuged
      and washed leaving only red blood cells (RBCs) suspended in a saline solution. The RBCs are
      reinfused into the patient as needed by the anesthesiologist. The main problem with this
      technique is that many of the important components of the blood such as plasma proteins and
      clotting factors are discarded through cell washing. This study will explore a novel method
      (multiple-pass hemofiltration) of processing the residual pump blood which will allow the
      patient to receive their own whole blood with minimum waste of important components. The
      newer method of processing the residual pump volume has also been termed off-line modified
      ultrafiltration (off-line MUF) and is similar to the process that the kidneys use to filter
      the blood. It is hypothesized that multiple-pass hemofiltration of the residual CPB volume
      will reduce the occurrence of inflammatory responses, preserve plasma proteins, and decrease
      allogenic blood exposure and improve clinical outcomes as compared to centrifugation.

    <textblock>
      This study is being performed because the traditional method of recovery of the residual
      volume of blood from the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit involves centrifugation and washing
      of whole blood with a saline solution. This process is sufficient for the recovery of red
      blood cells however; it results in the discarding of other important components of the blood.
      The removal of white blood cells, plasma proteins and clotting factors may result in an
      increased risk of a adverse outcomes during the post-operative period. The new technique our
      team wants to investigate returns a greater proportion of the patients' whole blood for
      reinfusion. Our study objectives are to compare the two techniques and determine which
      technique produces the safest most reliable method of blood processing to help the patient
      have a smooth, short, transfusion free post-operative period in the intensive care unit
      (ICU).
