  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy but sedentary aging leads to increased morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular
      disease. This is partly due to the accumulation of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) and
      the stiffening of the myocardium and arteries. New medication has been developed to break
      these AGE-crosslinks to improve cardiovascular compliance. The positive influence of regular
      physical activity is well known for cardiovascular disease and aging. Therefore, what is the
      most effective intervention, physical exercise and/or new medication AGE-crosslink breakers,
      in improving the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular compliance and improving the endothelial
      function in healthy sedentary elderly.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine the combined effects of one year exercise training and the AGE-crosslink breaker Alagebrium on vascular endothelial function.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline and 12 months the endothelial function will be measured with an invasive vascular function measurement using the leg model. Via an arterial line in the common femoral artery acethylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and LNMMA will be infused at different dosages. Vascular response will be measured using venous occlusion plethysmography. Non-invasive vascular measurements, e.g.flow mediated dilation and pulse wave velocity, using ultrasound techniques will be performed at 0, 6 and 12 months. Also, cardiopulmonary fitness level will be tested at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months with an ergometer.</description>

    <measure>Examine the combined effects of one year exercise training and the AGE-crosslink breaker Alagebrium on cardiac function.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An echocardiogram will be performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Measures such as strain, strain rate and myocardial velocity, together with the diastolic function parameters (e.g. E/A, S/D, and E/E' ratio) will be specifically evaluated. Also, the common measures such as wall thickness, volumes, etc, will be examined.</description>

    <time_frame>0 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A cerebral perfusion measurement will be performed at baseline and after 12 months with transcranial doppler, near infra-red spectroscopy and continuous beat to beat blood pressure monitoring using the Finameter during different posture maneuvers and hypo- and hypercapnia. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation and vasoreactivity will be examined.
Cognitive function will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months using the CANTAB.</description>
