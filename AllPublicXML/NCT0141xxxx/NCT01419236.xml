    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire-Ejaculatory Dysfunction-Short Form (MSHQ-EjD-SF) Ejaculatory Function Score at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MSHQ-EjD-SF: 4 item, self-reported questionnaire assessing ejaculatory dysfunction. MSHQ-EjD-SF Ejaculatory Function Score: sum of scores for questions (Q)1 through Q3 about frequency and strength of ejaculations and volume of ejaculate for sexual activity attempts during past month. Ejaculation frequency was rated 1 (could not ejaculate) to 5 (all the time); strength and volume from 0 (could not ejaculate) to 5 (as strong/much as it always has been). Total Ejaculatory Function Score ranged from 1 to 15. Least-squares (LS) mean of change from baseline calculated using repeated measures mixed‐effects model (MMRM) including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level [≥200 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) versus (vs.) &lt;200 ng/dL], baseline erectile dysfunction (ED) severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline ejaculatory function score as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ejaculate Volume at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in ejaculate volume was determined by actual measurement of semen volume in milliliters (mL). LS mean of change from baseline was calculated using MMRM including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level (≥200 ng/dL vs. &lt;200 ng/dL), baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline ejaculatory volume as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sexual Activity Log: Perceived Volume of Ejaculate at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sexual activity log was used by study participants to document ejaculatory functioning and orgasmic pleasure for each sexual activity attempt over 4 weeks. Ejaculatory functioning included perceived volume of ejaculate, perceived force of ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, and frequency. Reported is the perceived volume of ejaculate rated from 0 (no ejaculate) to 10 (high volume of ejaculate). LS mean of change from baseline was calculated using MMRM including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level (≥200 ng/dL vs. &lt;200 ng/dL), baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline ejaculatory volume as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sexual Activity Log: Perceived Force of Ejaculation at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sexual activity log was used by study participants to document ejaculatory functioning and orgasmic pleasure for each sexual activity attempt over 4 weeks. Ejaculatory functioning included perceived volume of ejaculate, perceived force of ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, and frequency. Reported is the perceived force of ejaculation rated from 0 (could not ejaculate) to 10 (strong ejaculation). LS mean of change from baseline was calculated using MMRM including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level (≥200 ng/dL vs. &lt;200 ng/dL), baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline perceived force of ejaculation as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sexual Activity Log: Delayed Ejaculation at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sexual activity log was used by study participants to document ejaculatory functioning and orgasmic pleasure for each sexual activity attempt over 4 weeks. Ejaculatory functioning included perceived volume of ejaculate, perceived force of ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, and frequency. Reported is delayed ejaculation rated from 0 (did not ejaculate) to 10 (optimal/best ejaculate time). LS mean of change from baseline was calculated using MMRM including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level (≥200 ng/dL vs. &lt;200 ng/dL), baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline delayed ejaculation as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sexual Activity Log: Frequency of Sexual Attempts at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sexual activity log was used by study participants to document ejaculatory functioning and orgasmic pleasure for each sexual activity attempt over 4 weeks. Ejaculatory functioning included perceived volume of ejaculate, perceived force of ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, and frequency. Reported is the change from baseline number of sexual attempts at 16 weeks. LS mean of change from baseline was calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including treatment group, region, baseline total testosterone level, baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe) as fixed effects, and centered baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sexual Activity Log: Orgasmic Pleasure at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sexual activity log was used by study participants to document ejaculatory functioning and orgasmic pleasure for each sexual activity attempt over 4 weeks. Reported is orgasmic pleasure rated from 0 (no pleasure) to 10 (excellent). LS mean of change from baseline was calculated using MMRM including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level (≥200 ng/dL vs. &lt;200 ng/dL), baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline orgasmic pleasure as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-Orgasmic Function Domain Score at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IIEF: 15 item, self-reported questionnaire assessing overall erectile function and satisfaction during past month. Orgasmic Function Domain Score: sum of IIEF scores for Q9 and Q10. In Q9, participants (pts) identified how often they ejaculated when having sexual stimulation or intercourse. In Q10, pts identified how often they had a feeling of an orgasm with or without ejaculation when having sexual stimulation or intercourse. For each Q, scores ranged from 0 (no sexual stimulation or intercourse), 1 (almost never or never) to 5 (almost always or always). Total Orgasmic Function Domain Scores ranged from 0 to 10. LS mean of change from baseline calculated using MMRM including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level (≥200 ng/dL vs. &lt;200 ng/dL), baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline Orgasmic Function Domain Score as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in MSHQ-EjD-SF Bother/Satisfaction Score at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MSHQ-EjD-SF was a 4 item, self-reported questionnaire used for the assessment of EjD during the past month. The MSHQ-EjD-SF Bother/Satisfaction Score was based on Q4: &quot;If you have had any ejaculation difficulties or have been unable to ejaculate, have you been bothered by this?&quot; Scores ranged from 0 (no problem with ejaculation), 1 (not at all bothered) to 5 (extremely bothered). LS mean of change from baseline was calculated using MMRM including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level (≥200 ng/dL vs. &lt;200 ng/dL), baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline Bother/Satisfaction Score as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire-Ejaculatory Dysfunction-Short Form (MSHQ-EjD-SF) Ejaculatory Function Score at 16 Weeks</title>
        <description>MSHQ-EjD-SF: 4 item, self-reported questionnaire assessing ejaculatory dysfunction. MSHQ-EjD-SF Ejaculatory Function Score: sum of scores for questions (Q)1 through Q3 about frequency and strength of ejaculations and volume of ejaculate for sexual activity attempts during past month. Ejaculation frequency was rated 1 (could not ejaculate) to 5 (all the time); strength and volume from 0 (could not ejaculate) to 5 (as strong/much as it always has been). Total Ejaculatory Function Score ranged from 1 to 15. Least-squares (LS) mean of change from baseline calculated using repeated measures mixed‐effects model (MMRM) including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level [≥200 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) versus (vs.) &lt;200 ng/dL], baseline erectile dysfunction (ED) severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline ejaculatory function score as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Sexual Activity Log: Frequency of Sexual Attempts at 16 Weeks</title>
          <description>The sexual activity log was used by study participants to document ejaculatory functioning and orgasmic pleasure for each sexual activity attempt over 4 weeks. Ejaculatory functioning included perceived volume of ejaculate, perceived force of ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, and frequency. Reported is the change from baseline number of sexual attempts at 16 weeks. LS mean of change from baseline was calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including treatment group, region, baseline total testosterone level, baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe) as fixed effects, and centered baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <description>IIEF: 15 item, self-reported questionnaire assessing overall erectile function and satisfaction during past month. Orgasmic Function Domain Score: sum of IIEF scores for Q9 and Q10. In Q9, participants (pts) identified how often they ejaculated when having sexual stimulation or intercourse. In Q10, pts identified how often they had a feeling of an orgasm with or without ejaculation when having sexual stimulation or intercourse. For each Q, scores ranged from 0 (no sexual stimulation or intercourse), 1 (almost never or never) to 5 (almost always or always). Total Orgasmic Function Domain Scores ranged from 0 to 10. LS mean of change from baseline calculated using MMRM including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, region, baseline total testosterone level (≥200 ng/dL vs. &lt;200 ng/dL), baseline ED severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe), and centered baseline Orgasmic Function Domain Score as fixed effects, and unstructured covariance structure for modeling correlation.</description>
