      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of adding the Health Promotion activities
      and rehabilitation to the usual alcohol and drug interventions on the outcome for alcohol and
      drug abusers compared to the usual intervention alone.

      Background: Alcohol and drug abuse are followed by tremendous physical, psychological and
      social problems as well as early death. Heavy smoking, poor nutrition, physical inactivity
      and chronic diseases (co-morbidity) are often part of these problems and illnesses.

      There seems to be a large potential for a better outcome by including smoking cessation,
      physical training, diet and nutrition as well as co-morbidity in a multi-disciplinary setting
      - a potential not used yet. This Very Integrated Program (VIP) is inspired from the
      rehabilitation offered to patients with chronic diseases and surgical patients having a
      likewise unhealthy lifestyle and similar co-morbidity.

      Aim: to evaluate the effect of adding the VIP program to the usual alcohol and drug
      intervention on the outcome for alcohol and drug abusers compared to the usual intervention
      alone.

      The VIP project consists of 3 steps:

        1. To map the health status and estimate the potential improvement for 400 alcohol and drug
           abusers

        2. To pilot test the VIP program

        3. To evaluate it compared to the daily routines for 260 alcohol and drug abusers with a
           poor health status in a randomised controlled trial.

      Main outcome: Change from abuser to non-abuser. Secondary outcomes are health status; quality
      of life, use of health services, time return to work (or similar activity level), harm
      reduction, and cost-effectiveness.
