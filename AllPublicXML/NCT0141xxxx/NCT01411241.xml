    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess whether the second CYD dengue vaccination could be
      administered concomitantly with the booster vaccination of a pediatric combination vaccine
      (Pentaxim™) during the same day and visit but in 2 different sites of administration.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response against all antigens
           (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib) in participants receiving one booster
           dose of Pentaxim™ vaccine administered concomitantly with the second dose of CYD dengue
           vaccine compared to subjects receiving one booster dose of Pentaxim™ vaccine
           administered concomitantly with placebo.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety of Pentaxim™ vaccine administered concomitantly with the second
           dose of CYD dengue vaccine, or administered concomitantly with placebo.

        -  To describe the safety of the CYD dengue vaccine in all subjects after each dose.

        -  To describe the antibody response to each dengue virus serotype (post-Dose 2 and
           post-Dose 3) after the second dose of CYD dengue vaccine administered concomitantly with
           Pentaxim vaccine or administered alone.

        -  To describe the antibody response to each dengue virus serotype post-Dose 2 and
           post-Dose 3 in all subjects.

      Participants will require 8 or 9 clinic visits and will receive a total of 7 injections. The
      dengue post-vaccinal viremia will be assessed at Visit 2 from a subset of toddlers. The
      dengue immunogenicity will be assessed 28 days after CYD dengue dose 2 and dose 3 from a
      subset of toddlers. All participants will be followed-up for safety after each vaccine dose
      and for 6 months after the last dengue vaccination.
