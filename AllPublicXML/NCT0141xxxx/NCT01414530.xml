    <textblock>
      Muscle or joint pain is one of the most common symptoms during menopausal transition. As this
      could be severe enough to affect social and daily life and to reduce quality of life,
      attentions should be paid about this.

      Although understanding of muscle or joint pain related to menopause is still insufficient,
      estrogen can play an important role. Previous studies have shown that estrogen protects
      cartilage in both animals and humans.

      However, perimenopause is different from postmenopause, in the point that estrogen is still
      secreted with a great fluctuation.

      Until now, no study has been performed to evaluate the effects of oral contraceptive on
      muscle or joint pain in women during menopausal transition. Moreover, since menopausal
      symptoms vary according to ethnicity and culture, a study in Korean population is necessary.

      Therefore, this randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the effects of oral
      contraceptive on muscle or joint pain in women during menopausal transition, compared to
      NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug).
