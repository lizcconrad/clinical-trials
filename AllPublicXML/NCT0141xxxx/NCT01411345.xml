  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. The investigators hypothesize that increasing radiation dose to the functional
           MRI-defined lesion in the prostate bed will result in an improved initial complete
           response (reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to &lt; 0.1 ng/mL), which is related
           to long-term outcome biochemically.

        2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the DCE-MRI enhancing and non-enhancing tumor
           regions.

        3. 10-15% of men undergoing RT have free circulating DNA (fcDNA) or tumor cells (CTC) that
           are related to an adverse treatment outcome.

        4. Prostate cancer-related anxiety will be reduced in the MRI targeted SRT arm, because the
           patients will be aware that the dominant tumor will be targeted with higher radiation
           dose.
