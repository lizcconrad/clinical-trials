    <textblock>
      This prospective study will collect safety information from more than 600 patients treated
      with Pergoveris®.

      During the Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS) period, data about the patient´s background,
      patient's medical history, Pergoveris® indication, prior infertility medication, Pergoveris®
      treatment status, concomitant drugs, all adverse events (regardless of the causal
      relationship to Pergoveris®) and efficacy (follicular growth and clinical pregnancy) will be
      collected for study purposes.

      The post marketing surveillance is based on all cases treated with Pergoveris®.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, who are eligible for Pergoveris® treatment according to the indication in

             Administration is &quot;Pergoveris® in association with a follicle stimulating hormone(FSH)
             preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with
             severe Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients
             were defined by an endogenous serum LH level &lt; 1.2 IU/L&quot;
