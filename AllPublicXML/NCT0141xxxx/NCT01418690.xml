  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate tissue oxygenation is required for effective white blood cell function and
      bactericidal activity. Decreased tissue oxygenation is a risk factor for perioperative wound
      infections. Regional anesthetic techniques result in a functional sympathetic block and may
      increase tissue oxygenation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in tissue
      oxygenation using a non-invasive Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. The current study
      will evaluate changes in tissue oxygenation following regional anesthetic techniques
      (peripheral nerve blockade and neuraxial techniques such as caudal block) in pediatric
      patients).

      Regional anesthesia will induce a sympathetic blockade and improve tissue oxygenation.
