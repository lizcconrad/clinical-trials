    <description>Phase 1- Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) with 3 + 3 Dose Escalation Cohorts in patients hematologic malignancies.
Phase 2- The Phase 2 portion of this trial will enroll patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) into separate arms to assess activity of oprozomib in these patient groups. The purpose of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to estimate the best ORR (for each group separately).</description>

             with acute leukemia or MDS.

          -  Relapsed after standard therapy for their malignancy and considered to be an
             appropriate candidate for a Phase 1 clinical study by their treating physician.

        Phase 2

          -  Multiple myeloma with measurable disease

          -  Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia with symptomatic relapse

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Chemotherapy with approved or investigational anticancer therapeutics, including
             steroid therapy intended to treat underlying malignancy, within 3 weeks prior to first
             dose or 6 weeks for antibody therapy.

          -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to first dose. Radioimmunotherapy within 8

          -  Prior stem cell transplant (SCT) therapy (autologous SCT within the prior 8 weeks;
             allogeneic SCT within the prior 16 weeks). Patients with prior allogeneic SCT should
             not have evidence of moderate-to-severe graft-vs-host disease (GvHD; as defined in
             Filipovich 2005).
