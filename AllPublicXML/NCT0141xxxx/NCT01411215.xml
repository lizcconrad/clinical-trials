  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter and observational study in China, which is designed to
      record the data of RA &amp; AS patients within 52 weeks after rheumatologists decided to
      prescribe etanercept, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatment. All eligible
      subjects agreed to be recruited in the study and can withdraw anytime if they choose so.

      Patients with RA or AS are typically managed by rheumatologists. As this study seeks to
      record the data of RA &amp; AS patient in etanercept and evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      treatment, patients will be recruited from Rheumatic department. Rheumatologist will be asked
      to build up the database for RA &amp; AS patient surveillance prospectively in outpatient dept,
      which benefits for the patient treatment outcomes evaluation and clinical management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this non-interventional study is to evaluate the safety of
      etanercept in Chinese RA and AS subjects. Total of 600 subjects (300 RA subjects and 300 AS
      subjects) will be enrolled in the study. If the true rate of an adverse event is no less than
      0.5%, with sample size of 600 subjects, this study will have 95% probability to detect at
      least one occurrence of the adverse event. The study prematurely discontinued on January 15,
      2013 due to slow enrollment and low adherence of etanercept. It should be noted that safety
      concerns have not been seen in this study and have not factored into this decision.
