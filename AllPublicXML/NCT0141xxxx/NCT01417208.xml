        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has diabetic foot ulceration, venous ulcer, or mixed aetiology ulcer with a
             surface area &lt;100 cm2 and &lt;10 cm in widest diameter on lower extremity, but larger
             than 1 cm2 (venous and mixed aetiology ulcers will be defined by clinical exam of
             treating physician. Diabetic foot ulcers will be defined by clinical exam of the
             treating physician and as lower extremity ulcers in patients with a diagnosis of
             diabetes, but without venous stasis disease).

          -  Wound present for &gt;30 days.

          -  Patient has wound in location amenable to creation of airtight seal around wound using
             TNP dressings.

          -  Patient is able to comply with study protocol requirements.

          -  Patient is able to understand and provide written consent.

          -  Patient has ulcers due to inflammatory conditions such as pyoderma gangrenosum,
             rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, cryoglobulinaemia, necrobiosis lipoidica,
             panniculitis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or calcinosis.

          -  Patient has untreated osteomyelitis.

          -  Patient has any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the

          -  Patient has exposed blood vessels.

          -  Patient is pregnant or pregnancy is suspected.
