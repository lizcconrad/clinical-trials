  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is about a prospective study conducted in patients suffering from dysphagia and
      cervical spine disorders and how they are interrelated. Three questionnaires have been given
      to patients with neurologic deficits, the first of these investigates the occurence of
      dysphagia in the three stages of swallowing, the second looks into the quality of life
      following a stroke or other neurologic damage and the third analyses how cervical spine
      disorders can affect every day life. After the bedside examination, VFSS or FEES, the
      patients are submitted to swallowing and cervical resistance exercises in fixed time periods
      after their hospitalisation. The results will be collected and evaluated using the
      statistical programme SPSS.
