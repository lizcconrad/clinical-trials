  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to uncover the prevalence of vulnerability among patients aged
      ≥ 70 coming to the medical oncology division of the Oscar Lambret Centre, according to the
      short screening test Vulnerable Elders Survey 13 (VES-13).

      The objective is to better understand the value of routine screening of patients before the
      consultation, it was proposed as a secondary objective of this study to assess the
      correlation between the identification of the vulnerability in the screening test VES-13 and
      the identification made by the clinician during the consultation. The correlation between
      VES-13 and opinion of the clinician for three categories of patients (self - intermediate -
      fragile) will also be studied.
