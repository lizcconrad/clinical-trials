  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Amatuximab is a cancer treatment drug that targets mesothelin. High levels of this
      substance are found on some kinds of tumor cells. Lab studies have shown that amatuximab
      helps the immune system to kill cells that have high levels of mesothelin. However, more
      research is needed to determine how safe and effective amatuximab is for treating tumors with
      high levels of mesothelin.

      Objectives:

      - To assess the safety and effectiveness of amatuximab in treating tumors with high levels of
      mesothelin.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a type of cancer that overexpresses
      mesothelin.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also
           have blood tests and tumor assessment studies.

        -  Participants will have two intravenous doses of amatuximab several hours apart.
           Researchers will monitor them closely and do frequent blood draws. On the same day and
           also within 48 hours of the second dose, participants will have imaging studies. These
           studies will measure how well the amatuximab is working against the cancer.

        -  Participants will have a third imaging study of the cancer about 1 week after the
           infusions.

        -  Participants will have a followup visit 2 weeks after receiving amatuximab. This visit
           will require blood samples. Four weeks after receiving the drug, researchers will review
           patients symptoms or side effects. This interview can be done in person or by phone.

      Background:

        -  Amatuximab is a high-affinity monoclonal IgG antibody raised against human mesothelin.

        -  Mesothelin is a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol-linked membrane glycoprotein thought to
           be involved in tumor metastasis

        -  Mesothelin is over-expressed in many cancers

      Objectives:

      -The primary objective is to determine the biodistribution of radiolabeled amatuximab in
      tumor and nontumor tissues in subjects with mesothelin over-expressing cancers including
      mesothelioma, pancreatic, ovarian, and non small cell lung cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Female or male subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age;

        -  Histologically confirmed mesothelin-expressing cancer;

        -  Transaminases less than or equal to 3 times ULN for mesothelioma, non small cell lung
           and ovarian cancer;

        -  Transaminases less than or equal to 5 times ULN for pancreatic cancer with known liver
           metastasis.

      Design:

        -  This is a single-center, single-dose, open-label, pilot study of MORAb-009 in
           approximately 20 subjects with mesothelin expressing tumors.

        -  Indium-radiolabeled MORAb-009 (5mCi) will be administered.

        -  Serial single photon emission-computerized tomography imaging will be performed to
           determine binding to tumor and nontumor tissue.

        -  Subjects will be observed closely for safety and possible development of anti-MORAb-009
           antibodies.

        -  Pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled antibody will be determined with imaging over time.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Female or male subjects, greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Histologically-confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma,
             mesothelin-positive ovarian cancer, or NSCLC. A new biopsy is not required; the
             diagnostic biopsy sample will be sufficient. IHC confirmation of mesothelin-positivity
             is not necessary for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma as nearly 100% of
             pancreatic adenocarcinomas and mesotheliomas express mesothelin. Mesothelin expression
             in ovarian cancer and NSCLC will be tested by IHC and any degree of positivity (1+,
             2+, or 3+) will be accepted.

          -  Subjects are required to have measurable disease that has progressed through prior
             therapy and that includes a non-hepatic lesion for imaging that is greater than or
             equal to 1.5 cm, as defined by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status or 0, 1, or 2.
