  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nab-paclitaxel has demonstrated to be an active agent in breast cancer and probably a less
      toxic alternative to solvent based taxanes. It is indicated in metastatic breast cancer after
      failure of anthracyclines. However, most patients receive anthracyclines as well as taxanes
      as part of their (neo-)adjuvant therapy. There is currently no standard treatment for
      patients with an early relapse (&lt;12 months) after a taxane containing (neo-)adjuvant therapy.
      Nab-paclitaxel, a novel nano-particle encapsulated paclitaxel is expected to have only
      limited cross-resistant to solvent-based taxanes and might therefore be indicated in this
      setting.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine overall response rate (ORR) and to exclude that it is 20% or lower.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine compliance and toxicity of the therapy.

        2. To determine clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients with measurable disease.

        3. To determine duration of response.

        4. To determine progression-free survival (PFS).

        5. To determine overall survival.

        6. To assess biomarkers, e.g. SPARC expression in the tissue of the primary or metastatic
           tumor.
