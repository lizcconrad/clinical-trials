  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that different inhalation profiles (inhalation flow rate versus time
      curves) result from different forms of patient training. Furthermore, significant
      inter-subject variability in these profiles should exist that can, under some circumstances,
      depend on the design of different inhalation devices; this is because dry powder inhalers
      have different airflow resistances. The investigators also hypothesize that the spread of
      flow rate versus time profiles for inhalation can be collected. Finally, these profiles can
      be analyzed from a group of human subjects and used to define a mean and statistical range of
      inhalation flow rate versus time curves.

      The investigators propose to collect the inhalation profiles from 20 'inhaler na√Øve' healthy
      volunteers after they have (a) read a typical inhaler package insert and (b) been formally
      trained in inhaler use by a pharmacist. No drug exposure will occur. The data will be used
      from this pilot study to (a) show the inter-subject variability in the inhalation profiles
      used by adults inhaling through realistic airflow resistances (like those in inhalers)
      following different types of training (b) show how formal training changes inhalation
      technique and (c) provide a database of typical inspiratory profiles for use and improvement
      of realistic tests of inhalers in the laboratory. Since pulmonary deposition from inhalers
      greatly depends upon the way patients inhale through them, this research will result in a
      database to improve the design and in vitro characterization of inhalers.
