      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Therapeutic Workplace in
      promoting methadone treatment and increasing abstinence in unemployed, out-of-treatment
      injection heroine users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized study is planned for 5 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the Therapeutic
      Workplace in promoting methadone treatment and abstinence in unemployed injection drug users.
      Participants will be recruited through street outreach, at agencies that serve the target
      populations, and informal word-of-mouth referrals. Participants will be invited to attend the
      workplace and to enroll in the methadone treatment. To engage participants in the workplace,
      they will be allowed to work independent of whether they enroll in methadone treatment and
      independent of their drug use. The workplace participants (N=162) will be randomly assigned
      to three groups. The &quot;Usual Care Control&quot; participants will be allowed to work independent of
      their methadone use or urinalysis results. The &quot;Methadone Contingency&quot; participants will be
      required to take methadone to attend work, and will receive a brief pay decrease for failing
      to take their medication. The &quot;Methadone &amp; Abstinence Contingency&quot; participants will be
      required to take their medication in order to attend work, as well as receive a brief pay
      decrease for any positive urine samples for both cocaine and methadone.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Individuals were eligible if they were:

          -  at least 18 years old,

          -  reported injection drug use in the past 30 days,

          -  met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV criteria for opioid dependence,

          -  reported using heroin at least 21 out of the past 30 days,

          -  provided an opiate-positive urine sample,

          -  showed visible signs of injection drug use (i.e., track marks),

          -  reported not receiving substance abuse treatment in the past 30 days,

          -  lived in Baltimore,

          -  and were unemployed.

        Participants were excluded if they

          -  had current severe psychiatric disorders or chronic medical conditions that would
             interfere with their ability to participate in the workplace,

          -  reported current suicidal or homicidal ideation,

          -  had physical limitations that would prevent them from using a keyboard,

          -  had medical insurance coverage (as this would disqualify them from receiving interim
             methadone treatment),

          -  were pregnant or breastfeeding,

          -  or were currently considered a prisoner.

        Eligible participants were invited to participate in a 4-week induction. Participants who
        attended the workplace for at least five minutes on two out of five workdays in the last
        week of induction were randomly assigned to one of three conditions and were invited to
        attend the workplace for an additional 26 weeks
