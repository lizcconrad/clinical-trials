    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of
      intranasal oxytocin in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when
      paired with a computer game intervention that is designed to enhance face perception skills.

    <textblock>
      Recognizing faces is critical to social functioning, and can be improved for individuals with
      ASD by using intervention software in the form of appropriately designed computer games. The
      effects of this type of social intervention may be amplified with the concurrent use of
      oxytocin. Furthermore, these learning effects may impact social skills in general and
      translate to the level of the individual's everyday social behavior. Thus, the objective of
      this study is to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin in
      children and adolescents with ASD when paired with a computer game intervention that is
      designed to enhance face perception skills.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-testing (after max. 12 days)</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the extent to which the participant employed a featural or holistic face recognition strategy. A sample face is presented, followed by a test face composed of either two whole faces or two face parts.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-testing (after max. 12 days)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a test of emotion recognition. This test asks children to pick the best word out of four options to describe the mental state of a set of eyes. The test includes 28 photographs of eyes with both affective (e.g., upset) and cognitive (e.g., thoughtful) mental state words as choices.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-testing (after max. 12 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Happy Faces&quot; task requires that participants look at a series of faces of men and women. Faces are presented on the screen one by one and children are asked just to look at the faces. Eye movements are measured with a Tobii x120 tabletop eye-tracker to evaluate participants' looking patterns towards the eyes versus the mouth region.</description>

    <description>Intranasal oxytocin (Trade name: Syntocinon)
Pharmacological class: The pharmacologic and clinical properties of Syntocinon are identical with the naturally occurring hormone oxytocin, which is released from the posterior pituitary.
Route of administration: Intranasal
Planned exposure: Each participant will receive one dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) per day for 5 days.
One dose of 24 IU equals 6 spray puffs (3 puffs in each nostril).
Oxytocin will be imported from Victoria Pharmacy Zurich- Switzerland.</description>

Pharmacological class: The pharmacologic and clinical properties of Syntocinon are identical with the naturally occurring hormone oxytocin, which is released from the posterior pituitary.
Route of administration: Intranasal
Planned exposure: Each participant will receive one dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) per day for 5 days.
One dose of 24 IU equals 6 spray puffs (3 puffs in each nostril).
Oxytocin will be imported from Victoria Pharmacy Zurich- Switzerland.
Intranasal Oxytocin (Trade name: Syntocinon): This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in children and adolescents with ASD. Subjects will be randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo for a 5 day period with concomitant game play of computer games, which are designed to enhance face perception skills.
