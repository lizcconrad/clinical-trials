      Henatinib is a novel oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antitumor and
      antiangiogenic activities. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      Henatinib in patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies

      1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Henatinib, and the maximum tolerated dose
           (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

        2. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Henatinib and its metabolites .

        3. To assess preliminary antitumor activity .

        4. To determine preliminary regimen for phase II study .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologic (except sputum smear) confirmed metastatic or locally
             advanced solid tumor (At least one measurable lesion longest diameter ≥20 mm using
             conventional techniques or larger than 10 mm in diameter by spiral CT scan).

          2. Life expectancy of more than 12 weeks.

          3. Lack of standard treatment or standard treatment failure.

          4. Screening laboratory values within the following parameters:

               1. HB:≥90g/L

               2. ANC:≥1.5×109/L

               3. PLT:≥100×109/L

          5. ALT and AST:≤1.5×ULN(But if the liver metastases, ALT and AST:≤5×ULN) 1. Serum total
             bilirubin:≤1.5×ULN 2. Serum creatinine:≤1.5×ULN 3. Creatinie clearance rate:≥60ml/min
             4. Electrolytes normal or return to normal after treatment

          6. Recovery from all clinically significant AEs related to prior therapies. Duration from
             the latest therapy is more than 6 weeks for nitroso or mitomycin, or more than 4 weeks
             for radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or other anti-cancer treatments (such as
             testing drugs, biologics, hormones or surgery).

          7. Signed and dated informed consent. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled
             visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of CNS metastasis.

             ≥ 480 ms or can not be measured. (Note: If ECG QTc interval ≥ 480 ms during the
             screening period, you must repeat 2 times, separated by at least 24 hours, the average
             QTc of the 3 times must be &lt;480 s, the patient can be enrolled in this study) .

             anti-epileptic drugs).

         12. Other serious illness or condition.

         13. Treated with VEGFR TKIs such as sunitinib or solafenib before study entry.

         14. Less than 4 weeks from the last clinical trial.

         15. Pregnancy, breast-feeding women or women of childbearing age without effective
             contraception.

         16. Allergic or known history of hypersensitivity to henatinib or any of it components.

         17. Drug abuse, the drug and mental illness may affect the patients participation in this
             study and the assessment of the research results.

         18. Any unstable or likely situation that harms the safety and compliance of the patients
             in this study.

         19. Any factors that influence the usage of oral administration.

         20. Evidence of significant medical illness that in the investigator's judgment will
             substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and
             completion of the study.
