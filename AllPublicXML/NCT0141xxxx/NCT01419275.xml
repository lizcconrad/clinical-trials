      Quantifying Collateral Perfusion in Cerebrovascular Disease-Moyamoya disease and stroke
      patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the early hours following large vessel occlusion, the ultimate severity of the stroke is
      largely determined by the ability of collateral flow networks to supply blood to ischemic
      tissue via circuitous routes that bypass the proximal clot. Robust collateral flow can
      improve response to thrombolytic therapy and decrease the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
      Despite their central importance, collaterals during acute stroke are poorly understood,
      largely because assessment has required an invasive imaging test, cerebral angiography. This
      proposal assesses whether a noncontrast MRI perfusion technique, called arterial spin
      labeling (ASL), can yield important information about collateral flow.

    <description>Sensitivity and specificity for MRI-based ASL measure of presence of collaterals was measured using digital subtraction angiography as a gold standard. Measurements were for 20 regions per patient were scored as either positive or negative for collateral flow. A positive value (results) means the region is supplied by collateral flow. Negative means the region is supplied by antegrade (normal) flow. Sensitivity measures the proportion of positives that are correctly identified as such. Specificity measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as such.</description>
