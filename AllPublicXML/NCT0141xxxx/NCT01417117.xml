  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurs when small arteries in the brain rupture due to
      weakening by age, high blood pressure, and/or elevated cholesterol. In addition to artery
      rupture, recent data suggests that patients with ICH are also at risk for developing
      occlusion of arteries during the acute phase, called ischemic strokes. Data suggests these
      ischemic strokes can negatively impact patient outcomes. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is
      a sequence on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that is a sensitive marker for ischemic
      strokes in the brain. In this proposal, our primary aim is examine prospectively the effect
      DWI abnormalities have on functional outcomes in patients with ICH. Our hypothesis is that
      the DWI abnormalities found on MRI of the brain lead to worse functional outcomes in patients
      with ICH

      Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a sensitive method to assess for secondary ischemia in
      patients with acute brain injury. By comparing the outcomes of patients with and without DWI
      abnormalities, we would able to assess the impact these lesions have on functional recovery
      in patients with ICH. Since no direct therapies exist for this disease, DWI abnormalities may
      be a novel target for intervention to improve outcomes. If traditionally assessed functional
      outcomes are not affected by DWI, the mechanism behind these lesions would still warrant
      further evaluation and potential treatment. Detection of subclinical infarcts has emerged as
      a potential surrogate marker for subsequent risk of stroke, vascular dementia, and cognitive
      impairment. Furthermore, the cause behind DWI lesions in acute ICH may lead to better
      understanding the pathophysiologic interplay between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.
