      Which breakfast has the most beneficial effect on blood glucose and insulin, blood hormones
      and blood pressure, egg or cereal breakfast? Over a seven week period the participant will
      take part in eating breakfast of either egg breakfast or cereal breakfast which will be
      monitored. Blood samples will be taken before participants eat and different times throughout
      until after Lunch on day 1 and day 7. Questionnaires will be given to determine satiety
      (feeling of fullness) and hunger before and after breakfast and lunch. After a two week
      period participants will return for another week of the same procedure and tests that was
      followed from Day 1 though day 7 listed. However, this time participants will be eating the
      second of the two breakfasts whichever one they did not have for the first test period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caloric intake for Lunch after you have received an Egg or Cereal Breakfast and Levels of glucose, insulin, and lipids are measured.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Before breakfast satiety following an egg breakfast compared to the other breakfast determines the impact of egg breakfast on their Lunch intake. Blood samples will be taken to test the levels of glucose, insulin, and lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Egg Breakfast</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group will be given a breakfast consisting of eggs. A breakfast consisting of eggs induces greater satiety and reduces Lunch Time intake.</description>

    <description>This breakfast will consist of a breakfast that will include cereal. A breakfast cereal or white bread increases lunchtime energy intake.</description>
