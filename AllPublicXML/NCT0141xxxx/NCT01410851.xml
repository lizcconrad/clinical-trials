  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulses have the potential to be positioned as a food for body weight and metabolic control
      based on their composition, effects on rate of digestion and absorption of fat and
      carbohydrates, and effects on satiety. However, the role of individual pulses incorporated
      into a mixed meal on regulation of food intake, satiety and glycaemic control remains
      unclear. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine the effects of ad libitum
      consumption of pulse meals (treatments) on food intake at an ad libitum pulse meal, food
      intake at an ad libitum pizza meal at four hours, subjective appetite and blood glucose.

    <time_frame>over 280 min</time_frame>
    <description>Energy intake was measured at the treatment meal (0-20 min) and at a pizza meal (second meal) provided four hours later (260-280 min).</description>

    <description>Following treatment meal consumption, blood glucose and appetite were measured at 20, 40, 60, 110, 140, 200 and 260 min and are reported as pre-second meal values. Following the pizza meal, blood glucose and appetite were measured at 280, 300, 320 and 340 min and are reported as post-second meal values.</description>

    <description>The pulse treatments and control (pasta with tomato sauce) were made the day before the session and the recipe was calculated to provide 1500 kcal at each session. All meals had the same energy density (~77kcal/100g). Calories derived from pulses were consistent among all pulse treatments (44%). The pulse treatments and control all contained macaroni pasta and homemade tomato sauce.</description>
