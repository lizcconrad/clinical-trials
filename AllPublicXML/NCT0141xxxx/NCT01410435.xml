  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the duration of most studies with IV iron in IBD subjects have been only 4-12 weeks
      studies there is a need to follow-up on long term safety and efficacy of any maintenance iron
      therapy.

      This study represents subjects from the Lead-in Study (P-Monofer-IBD-01) on iron isomaltoside
      1000 (Monofer®) to assess the long term safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) and its
      ability to maintain stable haemoglobin in IBD subjects with Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA).

    <description>To assess the long term efficacy of iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) by means of the ability to maintain stable Hb (defined as Hb ≥ 12.0 g/dL) in subjects with Hb ≥ 12.0 g/dL at the Baseline of Extension Study.
To assess the ability to achieve stable Hb (Hb ≥ 12.0 g/dL) at Month 3 Visit of Extension Study, and then to maintain the stable Hb thereafter in subjects with Hb &lt; 12.0 g/dL at Baseline of Extension Study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Completed the Lead-in Study or discontinued from Lead-in Study due to intolerance to
             oral iron.

          2. Life expectancy beyond 18 months by Investigator's judgement.

          3. Willingness to participate after informed consent. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Discontinuation from Lead-in Study (except for due to intolerance to oral therapy).

          2. Any major protocol deviation in Lead-in Study.

          3. Pregnancy and nursing [To avoid pregnancy, women have to be postmenopausal, surgically
             sterile, or women of child bearing potential must use one of the following
             contraceptives during the whole study period and after the study has ended for at
             least 5 times plasma biological half-life of the investigational medicinal product (5
             days): Contraceptive pills, Intrauterine Devices (IUD), contraceptive injections
             (prolonged-release gestagen), subdermal implantation, vaginal ring, and transdermal
             patches].

          4. Any other medical condition that, in the opinion of Investigator, may cause the
             subject to be unsuitable for the completion of the study or place the subject at
             potential risk from being in the study.

          5. Patients with a Harvey-Bradshaw Index &gt;8 or Partial Mayo Score (excluding Endoscopy
             Sub-score) &gt;6 at End of Study Visit of Lead-in Study.
