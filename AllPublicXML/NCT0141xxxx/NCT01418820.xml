  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual field areas, which are not absolutely blind, are hypothesized to have some residual
      capacities that constitute their potential for vision restoration. Vision restoration can be
      achieved by varies methods including behavioral training and electrical brain stimulation
      such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transorbital
      alternating current stimulation (rtACS) which are able to influence the excitability and
      activity of cortical areas.

      It is hypothesized that transorbital alternating current stimulation (tACS) can improve the
      residual field of vision in patients with post-chiasmatic lesions.

    <description>10 days (2x 5 working days), daily transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) is applied with a device generating weak current pulses in predetermined firing bursts of 2 to 9 pulses. The amplitude of each current pulse is below 1000 ÂµA. Current intensity is individually adjusted according to how well patients perceived phosphenes, e.g. any sensation of flickering light in response to the rtACS stimulation. Stimulation frequencies were between the individual alpha frequency peak and below flicker fusion.</description>
