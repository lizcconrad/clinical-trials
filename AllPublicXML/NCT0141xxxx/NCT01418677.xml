    <textblock>
      This is an open-label non-randomized study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors who are no longer responding to available therapy. HALAVEN will be administered to
      subjects on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.

    <measure>To study the influence of moderate and severe renal impairment on the Composite of Pharmacokinetics of HALAVEN following a single intravenous administration to subjects with cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Halaven will be measured on Day 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis will be conducted using the dose-normalized primary PK parameters (AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, and Cmax) respectively. Relationships between each individual PK parameter and renal function (creatinine clearance) will be analyzed by linear regression models using the PK parameter as the dependent variable and renal function as the independent variable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of HALAVEN in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment, as well as in those with normal renal function.</measure>
    <time_frame>Halaven will be measured on Day 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety data that will be evaluated include adverse events, clinical laboratory results, physical examination results, ECG, and vital signs</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors that have progressed
             following standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists (including surgery
             or radiation therapy).

          -  Renal function must fall into one of the following categories:

          -  Normal function - creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 80 mL/min.

          -  Moderate impairment - creatinine clearance &gt;30 to 50 mL/min.

          -  Severe impairment - creatinine clearance 15 to less than 30 mL/min.

          -  Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 times the ULN (in
             the case of liver metastasis less than or equal to 5 times ULN). In the case ALP &gt;3
             times the ULN (in the absence of liver metastasis) or &gt;5 times the ULN (in the
             presence of liver metastasis), and the subject is also known to have bone metastasis,
             the liver specific ALP must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver
             function instead of the total ALP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance greater than 50 to less than
             80 mL/min).

          -  Subjects with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance less than 15 mL/min or on
             dialysis).

          -  Subjects with a hypersensitivity to halichondrin B and/or halichondrin B chemical
             derivatives.

          -  Subjects with prior participation in an HALAVEN clinical study, even if not previously
             assigned to HALAVEN treatment.

          -  Radiation therapy encompassing &gt;30 % of bone marrow.

          -  Subjects with organ allografts requiring immunosuppression.
