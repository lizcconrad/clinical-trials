  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clots that develop in the deep veins of the legs or the lungs can result in pain, heart and
      lung disease and may lead to death if unrecognized or not treated. Risk factors for
      developing clots include surgery, hospitalization and/or being immobile. Up to 10 to 40% of
      people may develop a clot during or after their hospital stay or surgery, and sometimes these
      clots do not cause symptoms. In order to help reduce the risk of developing a clot in the
      legs or lungs, many people undergoing surgery receive a small dose of a blood thinner in
      hospital after their surgery is completed. Although prescription of a low dose blood thinner
      is routine practice after most surgeries, the risk or benefit of blood thinners after kidney
      transplant surgery is still not clear. Given this, many transplant physicians differ in
      prescribing practices of low dose blood thinners after kidney transplant surgery. More
      information is needed about the risk of clotting and bleeding in people after kidney
      transplant surgery so that physicians can become more unified in deciding whether a low dose
      blood thinner would protect patients after kidney transplant without producing harm.

      The REPORT study is designed to examine the risk of clotting in the legs or lungs in people
      after kidney transplant surgery as well as the risk of bleeding. Ultrasounds of the legs will
      be performed at various time points after surgery for up to one year to screen for blood
      clots. People participating in this study will also be screened and monitored for bleeding
      after surgery. Although this study will also examine the prescription practices of
      physicians, no blood thinners will be given or withheld from participants as a result of this
      study. Physicians will prescribe blood thinners as per their usual practice after kidney
      transplant. Overall, the goal of the study is to find out how frequent clotting and/or
      bleeding is after kidney transplant surgery, which will help in making recommendations
      regarding the use of low dose blood thinners in people after their surgery.

      Ultrasound scanning of the legs is a safe test that does not cause physical pain and has no
      risk of causing injury. Participation in this study will provide the benefit of additional
      monitoring with several ultrasound tests after surgery, screening for clots in the legs which
      can cause health risks and even death if unrecognized. If a clot is found, it will be treated
      promptly and according to current medical standards under the care of a specialist.

      In the long term, the results of this study will help improve health care delivery to people
      undergoing kidney transplant with the goal of decreasing potential complications such as
      clotting and/or bleeding. Currently, there are no guidelines available to guide physician's
      in the use of a low dose blood thinner after kidney transplant surgery. This study will help
      determine the risk of clotting or bleeding and help us make recommendations that will reduce
      potential risks and complications for people undergoing kidney transplant in the future.
