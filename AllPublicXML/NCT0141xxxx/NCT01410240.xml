    <description>A well-validated scale to reflect problems in people with lower limb issues.
Pain scale (5 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme pain) is used to grade each item, higher scores indicate greater pain. The overall pain scale = 0 (no pain) to 50 (extreme pain)
Stiffness scale (2 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme stiffness) is used to grade each item, higher scores indicate greater stiffness. The overall stiffness scale = 0 (no stiffness) to 20 (extreme stiffness)
Physical Activity Difficulty (PAD) scale (17 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme PAD) is used to grade each item, with higher scores indicating greater PAD. The overall PAD scale = 0 (no PAD) to 170 (extreme PAD)
Averages calculated by taking sum of all individual item scores listed above and dividing by total number of items, range = 0 (no issues) to 10 (extreme issues).

        <description>A well-validated scale to reflect problems in people with lower limb issues.
Pain scale (5 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme pain) is used to grade each item, higher scores indicate greater pain. The overall pain scale = 0 (no pain) to 50 (extreme pain)
Stiffness scale (2 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme stiffness) is used to grade each item, higher scores indicate greater stiffness. The overall stiffness scale = 0 (no stiffness) to 20 (extreme stiffness)
Physical Activity Difficulty (PAD) scale (17 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme PAD) is used to grade each item, with higher scores indicating greater PAD. The overall PAD scale = 0 (no PAD) to 170 (extreme PAD)
Averages calculated by taking sum of all individual item scores listed above and dividing by total number of items, range = 0 (no issues) to 10 (extreme issues).
Total Scores calculated by taking sum of all individual item scores listed above, range = 0 (no issues) to 240 (extreme issues)

        <description>A well-validated scale to reflect problems in people with lower limb issues.
Pain scale (5 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme pain) is used to grade each item, higher scores indicate greater pain. The overall pain scale = 0 (no pain) to 50 (extreme pain)
Stiffness scale (2 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme stiffness) is used to grade each item, higher scores indicate greater stiffness. The overall stiffness scale = 0 (no stiffness) to 20 (extreme stiffness)
Physical Activity Difficulty (PAD) scale (17 items): 0 (none) to 10 (extreme PAD) is used to grade each item, with higher scores indicating greater PAD. The overall PAD scale = 0 (no PAD) to 170 (extreme PAD) Averages calculated by taking sum of all individual item scores listed above and dividing by total number of items, range = 0 (no issues) to 10 (extreme issues).
Total Scores calculated by taking sum of all individual item scores listed above, range = 0 (no issues) to 240 (extreme issues).

      <restrictive_agreement>Baxter's agreements with PIs may vary per requirements of individual PI, but contain common elements. For this study, PIs are restricted from independently publishing results until the earlier of the primary multicenter publication or 1 year after study completion. Baxter requires a review of results communications (e.g., for confidential information) ≥30 days prior to submission or communication. Baxter may request an additional delay of ≤60 days(e.g., for intellectual property protection)</restrictive_agreement>
