  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following surgery to remove tumours of the head and neck, patients undergo reconstruction
      with free flaps - tissue that is taken from elsewhere in the body and given a new blood
      supply by attaching it to vessels in the neck. Following this type of surgery, patients often
      need medication to maintain their blood pressure in the intensive care unit. The effect of
      these drugs on the transplanted tissues is unknown. This study investigates the effects of
      four commonly used drugs on free flap perfusion.

      The optimal sympathomimetic drug to support blood pressure without adverse vasoconstriction
      of free flap circulation remains unknown. This study examined the effects of four agents
      (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dobutamine and dopexamine) on free flaps following resection of
      head and neck cancer.

      Twenty five patients were recruited to the study. Each patient received an infusion of the
      four drugs in a random order with an intervening washout period between drugs, at four
      infusion rates. Continuous free flap skin blood flow monitoring was performed using laser
      Doppler velocimetry, with a second sensor on normal skin acting as a control. Global
      cardiovascular variables were monitored using the LiDCO Rapid pulse contour analysis system.
