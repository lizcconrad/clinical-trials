      Loss of muscle protein and mass are the main causes of fatigue after bowel surgery which may
      result in a longer hospital stay and a higher rate of complications. This problem is
      especially important for patients after surgery for bowel cancer because cancer itself causes
      a waste of muscle protein. Anesthesiologists can decrease these negative effects of surgery
      by choosing the type of pain treatment (analgesia) and by giving nutrition (sugar and
      protein). Our group recently observed that optimal pain relief with epidural catheters (these
      are placed in the so called epidural space, which lies between the spine and the skin of the
      back) in combination with a low calorie protein diet intravenously (through the vein)
      maintains the body's protein stores after bowel surgery.

      The goal of our new research program is to find out whether this protein saving effect
      depends on how protein depleted the patient is before surgery. In other words we would like
      to answer the question: do cancer patients who show protein wasting before the operation
      benefit more from feeding than patients who show no signs of protein wasting? A second goal
      of this program is to find out if we need to use sugar as part of the diet or whether the
      infusion of protein alone is sufficient. Just giving protein would make feeding not only
      easier but also would avoid the increase in the patient's own blood sugar during and after
      the operation, which typically occurs when sugar is given intravenously during that period.

      1. Goals The overall goal of perioperative nutrition support is to abolish protein wasting
           and to promote anabolic processes by directing amino acids into protein synthesis rather
           than oxidation. Protein repletion and enhancement of anabolism appear to be particularly
           important in cancer patients who enter major abdominal surgery in a catabolic state.

        2. Objectives The objectives of this research program are

             -  to examine whether the anabolic effects of hypocaloric nutrition depend on the
                degree of catabolism before the operation and thus identify patients who benefit
                the most from perioperative nutrition support (study I)

             -  to investigate whether excluding glucose from hypocaloric nutrition, i.e. infusing
                an isonitrogenous amount of amino acids without glucose avoids hyperglycemia and,
                thus, accentuates the patient's anabolic response to feeding (study II).

      In order to confirm the validity of our assumptions we will perform two consecutive studies
      in two distinct patient populations. For the assessment of the patients' catabolic state and
      obtaining insight into the biochemical mechanisms, whereby the effects of nutrition are
      mediated, stable isotope tracer kinetics will be applied. Using primed continuous infusions
      of L-[1-13C]leucine and [6,6-2H2]glucose we will quantitate the whole body dynamics of
      protein and glucose metabolism, i.e. protein breakdown, amino acid oxidation, protein
      synthesis, glucose production and glucose uptake before and after surgery. A positive protein
      balance (difference between protein synthesis and protein breakdown) will be used as an
      indicator of anabolism. Anabolic processes at the organ level (liver, muscle), i.e.
      fractional synthesis rates of the acute phase proteins albumin and fibrinogen and muscle
      protein synthesis will be determined using L-[2H5]phenylalanine infusions. Skeletal muscle
      protein catabolism will be characterized by measuring the mRNA expression of ubiquitin and
      two of its key ligases in muscle (MAFbx/atrogen-1 and MuRF-1).
