      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether a 12 week Pilates based core
      stability training programme is effective in improving balance, mobility and balance
      confidence in ambulant individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The secondary aim is to
      determine the relative effectiveness of this 12 week Pilates based core stability training
      programme compared to a standardised physiotherapy exercise programme. Finally we intend to
      explore the underlying mechanisms of change associated with these exercise interventions by
      directly measuring changes in muscle thickness and activation in the deep abdominal core
      stabilising muscles of a sub-set of participants.

    <description>Individualised face to face training sessions, delivered over 12 weeks, plus an individualised 15-minute daily home exercise programme will be provided. This will be undertaken by a neurological physiotherapist. The exercises will comprise a standardised programme of simple physiotherapy exercises which aim to improve trunk and pelvic stability, lower limb muscle length and strength, and balance and control of movement, as described by Barrett et al [2009]. Exercises will be progressed in response to the abilities of the individual. Each participant will receive a workbook with written and diagrammatic instructions describing their home exercise programme.</description>
