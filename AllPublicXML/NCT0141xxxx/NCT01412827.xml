  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a shortage of nuclear isotopes, not only in Canada but around the world. New,
      more sensitive SPECT cameras can obtain better images in shorter scan times. These cameras
      have also shown the ability to use a smaller dose of radioisotope to obtain the images. New
      software has been tested on the standard camera, the GE Infinia-Hawkeye SPECT/CT. The
      Diagnostic Imaging Department of The University of Ottawa Heart Institute has also acquired a
      new camera, the Discovery NM530c CZT and has been doing heart scans in shorter times. The
      investigators will now be looking at the quality of images using less isotope during SPECT
      myocardial perfusion imaging for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SPECT MPI is well accepted as a reliable and cost-effective tool for diagnosis, risk
      stratification and management of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease
      (CAD) (1;2). MPI represents approximately 40% of nuclear medicine patient studies and most of
      these use 99mTc-sestamibi or 99mTc-tetrofosmin(3). Rest/stress MPI using 99mTc-sestamibi and
      99mTc-tetrofosmin uses more tracer doses than many other nuclear medicine tests and thus
      account for &gt;50% of injected radiotracer activity(3). Thus, interruptions in the supply of
      99Mo, the parent isotope of 99mTc, significantly affect stress MPI imaging and associated
      patient care.

      Alternatives to 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc-tetrofosmin for perfusion imaging include 201Tl for
      SPECT imaging and 82Rb or 13NH3 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (4;5). MPI
      using 201Tl has similar diagnostic accuracy but image interpretation is more difficult due to
      greater scatter and attenuation. Moreover, the patient effective radiation dose for MPI using
      a standard injected dose of 3.5mCi of 201Tl is ~20 mSv. This radiation dose is twice that of
      99mTc tracers which typically deliver an effective dose of ~10 mSv. PET imaging with 82Rb or
      13NH3 is another alternative, but is much more expensive and not routinely available in
      Canada due to a very limited install base of PET scanners and associated cyclotrons. The
      number of SPECT cameras operational in Canada is more than 40 times the number of PET
      scanners.

    <description>A comparison of classification of the degree of abnormality based on the two image acquisition protocols. Multi-level correlation between the two image sets (LDa vs 2 and LDb vs 2) will be obtained against the standard SPECT (FD) images.
The combined rates of non-fatal MI or death in each of the LD images as well as the standard dose images (FD) which are considered abnormal (SSS ≥ 4) will also be calculated.</description>

    <description>Rest: Imaging will occur 30 to 60 minutes after injection of tracer.
Stress: All patients will undergo a symptom-limited Bruce protocol treadmill exercise test. At peak stress, the radiotracer will be injected intravenously, and exercise will continue for an additional 60 s. The patients who are unable to achieve the targeted heart rate or exercise will be stressed pharmacologically. Dipyridamole (0.142 mg/kg/min) will be infused intravenously for 5 minutes, and 99mTc radiotracer will be injected at 2 min after infusion completion (7 min into the study). Aminophylline (100-200 mg) will be given intravenously 2 min after injection of the radiotracer.</description>
