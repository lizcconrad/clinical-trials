  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomized controlled trial in which client-centered rehabilitation of
      activities of daily living (CADL) will be compared to usual rehabilitation of activities of
      daily living (UADL) regarding participation in activities of daily living, independence in
      activities of daily living and life satisfaction during the first year after stroke. In
      addition use of health services, caregiver burden and significant others' life satisfaction
      will be studied. Study design, methods and power analysis are based on our previous pilot
      study. Participating rehabilitation centers in the counties of Stockholm, Uppsala and
      Gavleborg have been randomized to supply CADL or UADL. Patients are included who are: &lt; 3
      months after stroke, dependent in at least two activities of daily living, understand
      instructions and referred to a participating rehabilitation unit. Data are collected at
      baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. For sufficient power 280 participants will be included. In
      addition qualitative longitudinal studies will be performed in order to describe how CADL is
      integrated.
