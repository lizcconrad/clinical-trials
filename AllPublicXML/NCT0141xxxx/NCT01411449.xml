      This study is a regulatory post marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients who have received Primovist for contrast
      enhancement in MRI of liver. The objective of this study is to assess safety, especially in
      relation to renal dysfunction, and efficacy of using Primovist in clinical practice. A total
      2,000 patients for diagnosis on detection and identify hepatic tumor will be recruited and
      followed 7 days after the injection.
