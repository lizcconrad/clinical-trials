  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The late infantile form of galactosialidosis is potentially amenable to treatment by gene
      transfer with an adeno-associated viral vector encoding Protective Protein Cathepsin A (PPCA)
      or by infusion of purified protein. The published literature contains limited descriptions of
      the disease nor is it known how many patients with the disorder are potentially available for
      protocol enrollment. This preliminary study is designed to define the demographics and
      clinical characteristics of the patient population with galactosialidosis. Individuals for
      whom DNA diagnosis has been performed at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) will
      be contacted telephonically to learn their current status. In addition, a letter requesting
      information regarding patients with galactosialidosis will be sent to all pediatric
      geneticists throughout the United States. Selected physicians with expertise in lysosomal
      storage diseases throughout the world will also be contacted. Foundations and Associations
      for the lysosomal storage disorders will also be contacted in an effort to identify
      additional potential patients with galactosialidosis. The information to be collected in this
      preliminary study will facilitate development of specific eligibility criteria for future
      therapeutic studies.

      Individual patient/families will be interviewed by telephone to learn basic demographic
      information and disease status. Medical records will be requested from primary care providers
      to provide further information regarding their disorder. Individual patients identified
      through our survey of pediatric geneticists or via the disease foundations or associations
      will be sent a letter describing our purpose and which includes a consent form for a
      subsequent telephonic interview. Their medical records will also be requested.
