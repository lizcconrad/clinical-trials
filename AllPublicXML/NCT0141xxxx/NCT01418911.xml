  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will expand the understanding of factors associated with adherence to self care
      and the diabetes control among diabetes type 2 patients. The theoretical framework of the
      study incorporates central variables from two theoretical models: a cognitive model of health
      behavior - &quot;Health Belief Model&quot;, and the Stress and Coping model. The study is innovative in
      its focus on the association between the patient's attachment style and adherence to self
      care and diabetes control, a topic less studied among diabetes patients, in addition to
      cognitive, social and emotional variables. Further emphasis is upon a comparison of the study
      model between males and females.
