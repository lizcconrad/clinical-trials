    <textblock>
      This research studies protein in tumor samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
      Finding specific proteins in tumor tissue samples from patients with cancer may help doctors
      tell what type of lung cancer a patient has and plan better treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To validate a novel 4-protein signature's ability to subtype non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) in a treatment-naive, multi-institutional cohort, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)
      9761.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the NSCLC misclassification rate in a multi-institutional clinical-trial
      setting for stage 1 NSCLC (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell).

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and
      immunohistochemistry (IHC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have been registered on CALGB-9761

               -  Stage I disease

               -  Treatment-naive patients

          -  A representative paraffin block of the primary tumor must be available from patients
             on CALGB-9761 and submitted to the CALGB Pathology Coordinating Office
