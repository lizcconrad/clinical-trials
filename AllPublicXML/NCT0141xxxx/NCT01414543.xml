      psychologists' experience of client violence in clinical practice. The emphasis is upon a
      detailed understanding of how psychologists perceive and understand their experience of

      This research is interested in Counselling and Clinical Psychologists who have experienced
      client violence at their work place. The main research question being asked is how do
      psychologists' understand their personal experiences of client violence. This is an important
      and interesting subject for Counselling and Clinical Psychologists as it provides a detailed
      personal account of the implications of violence upon their personal and professional
      identity, psychological well being and how they define violence. Furthermore, this research
      may help facilitate in designing a specific policy and help future research to issue
      guidelines for counselling and clinical psychologists in order to keep themselves safe within
      their professional practice. Psychologists working for the National Health Service will be
      recruited and provided with information regarding the research aims and objectives. There
      will be interviews held at their place of work for approximately one hour.
