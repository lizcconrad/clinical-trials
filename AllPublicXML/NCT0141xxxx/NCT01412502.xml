  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study concerns the nearest relatives of patients who have passed away within 3 days of
      admission to an ICU due to: (1) brain death with multiple organ donation +/- tissues or (2)
      death via limitation and / or cessation of active treatment (LATA) without brain death or (3)
      sudden death of a previously healthy patient (no physical or mental limitations; MacCabe
      score = 0) within 3 days of admission to ICU without LATA nor brain death. Our primary
      objective is to determine the proportion of nearest relatives at risk for post traumatic
      stress disorder as defined by an Impact of Event Scale score greater than 37, and to compare
      this factor between the three above-mentioned groups.

        +/- tissues or (2) death via limitation and / or cessation of active treatment (LATA)
        without brain death or (3) sudden death of a previously healthy patient (no physical or

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants are the nearest relatives (or &quot;person-of-trust&quot;) of a patient who has
             passed away in an intensive care unit (ICU). The cause of death must fall into 1 of
             the following three categories: (1) brain death with multiple organ donation +/-
             tissues; (2) death via limitation and / or cessation of active treatment (LATA)
             without brain death; (3) sudden death of a previously healthy patient (no physical or
             mental limitations; MacCabe score = 0) within 3 days of admission to ICU without LATA
             nor brain death

          -  The participant must be one of the following (roman numerals indicate prioritization
