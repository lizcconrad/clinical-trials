      STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary: To compare the effects of consumption of a 3-ounce serving of beef
      to that of a 20g serving of BPI on skeletal muscle synthetic and breakdown rate in healthy
      elderly subjects.

      Secondary: To investigate the effect the study products on plasma levels of amino acids,
      insulin, and glucose in healthy elderly subjects.
