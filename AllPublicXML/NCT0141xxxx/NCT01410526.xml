      1.0 INTRODUCTION

      Severe abdominal sepsis is defined as sepsis plus organ dysfunction caused by a condition
      deriving from the peritoneal cavity [1]. The essentials of the management of patients with
      severe sepsis remain unchanged and can be divided broadly into sepsis control, antimicrobial
      therapy and hemodynamic stabilization [2]. Infection control mainly involves surgical
      exploration and temporary or permanent resolution of the septic agent [3]. Open abdomen
      treatment remains one of the most valid approaches of patients with severe abdominal sepsis
      [4]. Open abdomen management is mandated to avoid abdominal compartment syndrome, in cases
      with inability to re-approximate the abdominal fascia regardless to viscera oedema and
      intra-abdominal pressure and in cases with unclear or inadequate source control [5]. Topical
      negative pressure with the abdominal vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device has been
      introduced, providing a new option to manage an open abdomen [6-8].

      Cytokines are a group of proteins produced by a variety of cells playing an active role in
      the immune system. Sepsis syndrome seems to result from overwhelming systemic inflammation
      which is caused by excessive release of cytokines into systemic circulation [9]. During the
      last decade many clinical studies assess the cytokines concentration in serum plasma in
      patients with SIRS and sepsis [10-13]. Despite the board study and analysis of cytokines
      response in serum plasma, literature is poor about peritoneum immune response in
      intra-abdominal sepsis [14-15], whereas the majority of these studies concerned patients with
      elective surgery [16-18].

      This protocol is designed to assess the cytokines levels in the peritoneal cavity in severe
      intra-abdominal sepsis and to compare these levels with the corresponding values in serum
      plasma. Additionally, the cytokines values in serum plasma and peritoneum are compared
      between patients with and without sepsis that underwent major elective laparotomy (middle
      line incision &gt;15cm). Moreover, cytokines levels are correlated to morbidity and mortality.

      2.0 STUDY PROTOCOL In all patients that the origin of sepsis confirmed pre-operative as
      abdominal, laparotomy will be required. After incision and confirmation of intra-abdominal
      sepsis, involving the whole peritoneal cavity, peritoneal fluid will be sampled for
      microbiology culture and cytokines assessment. The appropriate source control interventions
      will be made and peritoneal lavage will be performed using sterile isotonic sodium chloride
      solution. At the end of operation a decision for open abdomen will be made by the surgeon,
      based on the severity of sepsis. If laparostomy will be decided, temporary abdominal closure
      will be performed with the Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) system plus the dynamic sutures
      [19].

      After a two-day application of the VAC, the previous existing dressing will be removed.
      Peritoneal fluid samples and blood samples will be obtained for cytokines assessment. The
      abdominal cavity will carefully be rinsed with saline solution and the various abdominal
      spaces will be inspected for any collections. Additionally, peritoneal fluid sample will be
      obtained for culture and quantitive analysis. Sequentially, the VAC dressing application will
      be performed based on previously described protocol [19]. Patients will return to the
      operating room for sequential fascial closure and replacement of the sponge and sutures every
      2 days until the final open abdomen closure. Peritoneal fluid and blood serum samples will be
      obtained in every VAC change until the permanent abdominal closure or patient's decease. A
      piece of polyurethane sponge of VAC system will be sent to microbiology department for
      detection of biofilm formation.

      3.0 OBJECTIVES

        1. To assess the cytokines in peritoneal fluid in patients with severe intra-abdominal
           sepsis.

        2. To compare the serum plasma cytokines values in patients with severe intra-abdominal

        3. To compare the cytokines values in serum plasma and peritoneal fluid between patients
           with severe intra-abdominal sepsis and patients without sepsis underwent major elective
           laparotomy.

        4. To evaluate parameters influencing successful, primary abdominal closure, morbidity and
           mortality.

        5. To assess the microbial load in the abdominal cavity in patients with severe sepsis.

      5.5 Blood and peritoneal fluid sampling protocol Blood sample will draw from an indwelling
      arterial line (10ml) in every VAC dressing change. Aspiration of 5 ml of peritoneal fluid
      from the Douglas space will be carried out with a syringe prior the lavage. Blood samples
      allow clotting in glass tubes in room temperature. Peritoneal sample collect in glass tubes.
      Both blood and peritoneal samples will be centrifuged and the resulting serum will be stored
      at -70o until processing.

      5.6 Bacteriological sampling and cultures At initial explorative laparotomy an aspiration of
      5 ml of fluid from the Douglas space will be carried out with a syringe. The sample will be
      emptied into a rubber membrane-sealed sterile glass tube and will be transported immediately
      to the laboratory, where it will be directly processed. The same process will be repeated at
      each change of dressings. Moreover, in every VAC dressing change a piece of the polyurethane
      sponge will be sent in the microbiology department for detection of biofilm formation.

      5.7 Antimicrobic prophylactic regime According to the Greek national guidelines for the
      antimicrobic therapy, a second generation cephalosporin (750 mg) combined with metronidazole
      (500 mg) will be empirically used against community acquired peritonitis, 30 minutes prior to
      induction of anaesthesia. Against postoperative peritonitis, piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g)
      will be employed. The antibiotic schema will be later adjusted according to the peritoneal
      fluid culture.

      5.8 Control group Thirty patients without sepsis scheduled for major elective surgery will
      constitute the control group. Blood sample and peritoneal fluid sample will be obtained at
      the end of operation before abdominal closure. Subsequently, blood samples will be obtained
      at first and third postoperative day for serum plasma cytokines assessment.

      7.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The objective of this study is: a) to assess the peritoneal immune
      response in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis, b) to compare the serum plasma
      cytokines values in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis with the corresponding values
      in the peritoneal fluid and c) to compare the cytokines values in serum plasma and peritoneal
      fluid between patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis and patients without sepsis
      underwent major elective laparotomy.

      Statistical analysis included description of these pre-operative intraoperative and
      postoperative outcomes, and indication of patient characteristics associated with these
      outcomes.

      In order to efficiently compare the results in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis, a
      control group without sepsis underwent major abdominal surgery was employed (Group A=sepsis
      and Group B=elective surgery).
