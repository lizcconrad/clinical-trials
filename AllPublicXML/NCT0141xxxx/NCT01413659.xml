  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate whether peri-operative symbiotic treatment could
      reduce the risk of postoperative infections in patients undergoing elective colorectal
      surgery. This study was also designed to assess the risk-adjusted incidence and predictors of
      surgical site infections.
