  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balance control, physical activity and health related quality of life will be assessed before
      and after a 10 to 12 weeks training program as well as 6 and 12 months thereafter in 200
      elderly (&gt;60) with balance problems (100 with osteoporosis, 100 with Parkinson's disease).
      Osteoporosis subjects will be assigned to 3 groups (balance training, balance training and
      Nordic walking, or control group) and Parkinson's subjects to 2 groups (balance training or a
      control group). The training will be progressive and specific incorporating dual task
      exercises (directly related to an increased risk of falling). Clinical and laboratory gait
      and balance measures as well as questionnaires will be used to assess physical function and
      quality of life. An earlier study, investigating this training program in healthy elderly
      with balance problems showed that the training was well-tolerated and effective, with a
      significant increase in balance control, physical function and activity. In this study, we
      expect that an improvement in balance function, physical activity and health related quality
      of life, which will lead to a decreased number of falls, prevent and/or postpone incidence of
      a hazardous fall and thereby reduce the burden on the health care system. Our model for
      functional balance training and outcome methods will expand techniques and tools available to
      physical therapists and health care scientist treating and evaluating patients with loss of
      balance function. Elderly receiving therapy with the goal to improve or recuperate physical
      function and balance will benefit from this project.

    <description>The balance-training program is based on scientifically well-established principles of exercise training and postural control as well as current research on training in elderly and PD. For the PD group it has been modified based on the current knowledge of the neurophysiology and the inevitable constraints on mobility and postural control resulting from basal ganglia degeneration. The training will be conducted as a progressive individually adjusted group program, led by experienced physiotherapists and researchers in order to challenge the specific balance disorder of every participant and endorse progression. It is progressive and specific balance program including dual- and multitasks. The program is performed 3 times/week for 10-12 weeks.</description>

    <description>To further test the hypothesis that physical activity may enhance the results from the balance training program pole striding will be added to the balance training program, at least 30-45 minutes three times per week during leisure time. Each individual in this group will be provided with individually adjusted poles, a pedometer and a diary to enter when and for how long time they have been walking.</description>
