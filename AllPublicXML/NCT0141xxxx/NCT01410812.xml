    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that healthy behaviors such as exercise could be increased through
      the use of tying devices - mechanisms that force a coupling of addictive activities
      (listening to the next chapter of a page-turner novel) with engagement in a healthy behavior
      (exercise).

      The study will test the effect of the following treatments as a means of increasing gym
      attendance over 10 weeks: 1. Participants receive access to 4 iTunes audio novels on their
      own iPods and prompted to listen to those novels only when exercising at the gym; 2:
      Participants receive 4 iTunes audio novels for a loaned iPod that they will only have access
      to at the gym; 3: Participants receive weekly emails asking them about their exercise.
