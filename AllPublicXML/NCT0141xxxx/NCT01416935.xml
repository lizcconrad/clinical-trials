      The purpose of this study is to determine whether anti arrhythmic medication, specifically
      Amiodarone, is required during the first three months post surgical ablation.

      Hypothesis: Amiodarone will not be required during the first three months as verified by no
      increase in rehospitalizations for recurrent Atrial Fibrillation, and report of sinus rhythm
      at surgical follow up (approximately 3 weeks from date of surgery), 6 weeks and 12 weeks to
      include patients' first follow up with cardiologist at approximately 3 months post surgery.

    <time_frame>3, 6, 12 weeks and 6 months post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate equality in clinically significant recurrence of AF following ablation while showing superiority for complication and side effect rates in those off Amiodarone vs. those on.
•% recurrence AF by telemetry at 3 wks and 24-48 hr Holter monitoring at 6 and 12 wks post procedure, EKG at first visit between 6 and 12 wks post discharge and or ER visit for rapid heart rate in atrial arrhythmia requiring treatment; permanent pacemaker interrogation reports at first follow up visit.
•Post-procedure major adverse event rate at 6 mos post-procedure related to side effects of Amiodarone.</description>

    <description>This is a randomized study whereby patients who would routinely/usually be scheduled to receive Amiodarone as their anti-arrhythmic medication post surgical ablation will be randomly assigned to receive Amiodarone or no Amiodarone, but all other medications would remain as prescribed for patients following surgical ablation which will include beta blockade therapy unless contraindicated which is an American Heart Associated and Heart Rhythm Society recognized treatment.</description>
