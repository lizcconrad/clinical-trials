  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      False positive blood culture results due to specimen contamination with bacteria inhabiting
      patients' skin is a common problem in emergency departments (EDs) in the United States.
      Contaminated blood cultures lead to patient harm through unnecessary hospitalizations and ED
      visits, delays in surgery, unneeded antibiotics, and unnecessary procedures. The
      investigators have developed a multifaceted quality improvement improvement bundle (The Blood
      Culture QI Program) designed to minimize blood culture contamination in the ED. In this
      study, the investigators will implement the quality improvement bundle in six community
      hospital EDs and evaluate its effectiveness at reducing contamination.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Blood Culture QI Program has four components: (1) education: content knowledge and
      standardized experiential training on sterile technique designed for ED nurses; (2) process
      redesign: change in patient safety attitude and conversion of blood culture collection from a
      clean to a sterile technique; (3) checklist use: reinforcement of optimal blood culture
      collection technique at the point of care; (4) feedback: systematic charting and reporting of
      contamination rates to the ED nurses who collect cultures. In order to convert blood culture
      collection into a fully sterile procedure, the investigators developed the Sterile Blood
      Culture Collection Kit, a novel materials kit that contains the equipment needed to collect a
      culture using sterile technique, including: (1) a 3ml solution of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate
      - 70% isopropyl alcohol (Chloraprep, CareFusion) skin prep device; (2) a sterile drape; (3) a
      sterile needle; and (4) gauze.

      The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the Blood Culture QI Program after
      implementing it in six community hospital EDs. Our study will compromise six replications of
      an interrupted time series study wherein each replication will be powered for internal
      validity to test the hypothesis of decreasing the contamination rate by 50% at each site. A
      stepped wedge (also called multiple baseline) design will be used to implement the program
      across hospitals to evaluate the generalizability (external validity) of program
      effectiveness. The primary analysis will be an interrupted time series analysis at each site
      comparing the proportion of ED blood cultures contaminated during a post-implementation
      intervention period with a pre-intervention baseline period.

    <description>In an interrupted time series design, we will compare the proportion of blood cultures contaminated during an intervention period after the implementation of the Blood Culture QI Program to a baseline period before implementation. We will complete six separate interrupted time series analyses with one at each of six hospitals. The intervention and baseline period duration will be approximately one year at each hospital.</description>
