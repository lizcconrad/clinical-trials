  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the superior efficacy and non-inferior safety of
      the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon by direct comparison to standard percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty (PTA) catheter for treatment of stenosis of the femoropopliteal arteries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon is indicated for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of
      obstructive de novo or non-stented restenotic lesions in native femoropopliteal arteries up
      to 15 cm in length and ≥4.0 to ≤6.0 mm in diameter. This study will randomize approximately
      476 patients who will receive either the Moxy balloon or standard balloon angioplasty at 55
      global investigational sites. Subjects will be blinded to treatment until 12 months and will
      participate in long term follow-up for 5 years.

             device size matrix;

         11. Successful, uncomplicated (without use of a crossing device) antegrade wire crossing
             of lesion;

         12. A patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by
             angiography (treatment of target lesion acceptable after successful treatment of
             inflow artery lesions); NOTE: Successful inflow artery treatment is defined as
             attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death or major vascular
             complication.

         13. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%)
             stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been revascularized
             (treatment of outflow disease is NOT permitted during the index procedure);

         14. Contralateral limb lesion(s) cannot be treated within 2 weeks before and/or planned 30
             days after the protocol treatment in order to avoid confounding complications;

         15. No other prior vascular interventions within 2 weeks before and/or planned 30 days
             after the protocol treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded if ANY of the following conditions apply:

          1. Pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant or men intending to father children;

          2. Life expectancy of &lt;5 years;

          3. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or other device study or
             previously enrolled in this study; NOTE: Enrollment in another clinical trial during
             the follow up period is not allowed.

          4. History of hemorrhagic stroke within 3 months;

          5. Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 2 weeks before or
             within 30 days after the index procedure;

          6. History of myocardial infarction (MI), thrombolysis or angina within 2 weeks of
             enrollment;

          7. Rutherford Class 0, 1, 5 or 6;

          8. Renal failure or chronic kidney disease with modification in diet in renal disease
             glomerular filtration rate (MDRD GFR) ≤30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (or serum creatinine ≥2.5
             mg/L within 30 days of index procedure or treated with dialysis);

          9. Prior vascular surgery of the index limb, with the exception of remote common femoral
             patch angioplasty separated by at least 2 cm from the target lesion;

         10. Inability to take required study medications or allergy to contrast that cannot be
             adequately managed with pre- and post-procedure medication;

         11. Anticipated use of IIb/IIIa inhibitor prior to randomization;

         12. Ipsilateral retrograde access;

         13. Composite lesion length is &gt;15 cm or there is no normal proximal arterial segment in
             which duplex flow velocity can be measured;

         14. Significant inflow disease. Successful treatment of inflow disease allowed prior to
             target lesion treatment;

         15. Known inadequate distal outflow (&gt;50 % stenosis of distal popliteal and/or all three
             tibial vessels), or planned future treatment of vascular disease distal to the target
             lesion;

         16. Sudden symptom onset, acute vessel occlusion, or acute or sub-acute thrombus in target
             vessel;

         17. Severe calcification that renders the lesion un-dilatable;

         18. Use of adjunctive treatment modalities (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty,
             scoring/cutting balloon, etc.).
