  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the results up to 12 months with the Protégé EverFlex stent (ev3) in
      patients presenting with a narrowing or blocking at the level of the knee artery, which leads
      to a limited walking distance, rest pain or non-healing ulcers.
