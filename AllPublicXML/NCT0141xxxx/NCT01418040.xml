    <textblock>
      This is a single centre prospective observational noninterventional study of men with
      histological confirmed prostate cancer, high risk disease and not positive for metastatic
      disease planned to receive Radiotherapy and 18 months of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).
      Although ADT improves the chance of cure, it can also have many side effects. One of these is
      bone mineral density loss. When this is advanced, it is called osteoporosis. Men with
      osteoporosis have a higher chance of getting fractures of bones such as the hip and spine.
      Currently, the best way to measure for osteoporosis is to do a bone mineral density scan
      using a DEXA scanner.

      The primary objective of this study is to see if baseline Magnetic Resonance Imager (MRI) and
      a Computer Tomogram (CT) combined with clinical factors predicts which men are at greater
      risk of accelerated ADT induced bone mineral density loss than baseline DEXA scanning alone.
      The data from the patients will be used to construct a model predicting annual rate of bone
      loss based on baseline imaging, clinical and biochemical characteristics.

      Secondary aims for this study are as follows:

        -  Evaluating the feasibility, toxicity (acute and late) and efficacy (5 year biochemical
           control by the Phoenix definition)of multimodality therapy with hypofractionated
           radiotherapy (giving a larger dose of radiotherapy over a shorter time 5½ weeks compared
           with a standard 8 week approach). Although used overseas, this 5½ week regimen has not
           been used widely in Australia, and we would like to see if we gain similar results here
           as have been reported from the US.

        -  Feasibility and efficacy of a risk adapted duration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.
           Usually, ADT is given for between 19 months before radiotherapy is started but there is
           no agreement as to which duration is best. This trial aims to tailor the duration of ADT
           prior to radiotherapy based on blood PSA test results.

        -  Prognostic value of circulating tumour cells (CTCs). This is a blood test which can
           detect cancer cells in the blood which has been used for patients with metastatic
           cancer. The presence of CTCs in men with prostate cancer correlated with poorer overall
           survival. Potentially, high risk prostate cancer patients with CTCs detected may
           represent a very high risk group and could therefore warrant treatment intensification.

        -  To correlate bone marrow changes on MRI with changes in blood counts and patient
           reported fatigue. Measuring bone marrow may help in predicting not just which patients
           are at risk of losing bone faster but also of becoming anaemic, and suffering fatigue. A
           correlation may better explain some of the toxicities associated with ADT.

        -  Implementation of a nomogram based radiotherapy target delineation algorithm. This trial
           aims to use a decision making tool called a nomogram to help tailor the area to treat in
           a more standard way.

      1. ADT induced Osteoporosis

           Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in Australian men. In men with localized disease
           at the time of diagnosis, baseline PSA level, tumour stage and Gleason grade can be used
           to help stratify into risk categories. Men with high risk disease are defined by an
           absence of metastatic disease using conventional imaging, and any one of the following:
           a presenting PSA of &gt;20, Gleason grade 8-10 disease on histology, or stage T3-4
           disease.[1] Such men are often treated with a combination of radiotherapy to the
           prostate and pelvic lymph nodes, in conjunction with a course of adjuvant androgen
           deprivation therapy (ADT) of between 18-36 months.[2] Recent literature suggests that
           the greatest benefit from adjuvant ADT comes from the first 4-6 months of treatment, and
           although there is measurable benefit from prolonging the course of ADT, it follows the
           law of diminishing returns with progressively smaller benefit per unit of increased
           treatment time.[3] This is important, in that if cumulative toxicities are being
           inflicted by prolonging the treatment, there is likely to be a duration where the harm
           of further treatment will start to outweigh the shrinking disease control benefits.

           With greater clinical experience of the use of adjuvant ADT, there has become a better
           awareness of the toxicities associated with this treatment. Accelerated loss of bone
           mineral density has long been recognized as a complication of being hypogonadal. There
           is now good evidence that this leads to an approximately 7% higher risk of fractures for
           men with prostate cancer managed with ADT.[4] Osteoporotic fractures are associated with
           increased morbidity and mortality, and a high proportion of patients who suffer them
           never fully regain their pre-fracture level of functioning.

           There are Australian guidelines for the management of osteopaenia / osteoporosis for men
           managed with ADT.[5, 6] They recommend monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD) using
           annual DEXA scanning, supplementary Vitamin D with Calcium, and the use of
           bisphosphonate therapy for men with prevalent minimal trauma fracture or baseline BMD
           T-Score &lt;-2.0. One point high-lighted is that there is a wide spectrum in the rate of
           bone mineral loss between patients and techniques of measurement, with figures as high
           as 8% per year reported. This is far in excess of a normal rate of bone loss amongst
           males of 0.5% per year.[7]

           Although validated nomograms exist for the general population combining DEXA findings
           with clinical parameters to predict long term fracture risks, no such tool exists for
           men rendered hypogonadal with the use of ADT.[8] Guidelines for men on ADT are
           empirical, and largely copy risk factors from the general population.[9]

           Beyond baseline BMD, the only clinical factor shown to have any accuracy in predicting
           bone loss for men on ADT is the change in serum P1NP (N-Terminal Pro-peptide of Type 1
           Procollagen, a marker of bone formation).[10] One study showed that men in the highest
           tertile for P1NP after 6 months of ADT, had the greatest loss in BMD at 12 months. This
           finding has not been verified, and there remains a need to investigate the utility of
           other clinical parameters either at baseline or early in ADT therapy to find accurate
           predictors of which patients are at highest risk for accelerated BMD loss.

           Osteoporosis Imaging

           Currently, the only method to reliably determine which men are more rapid bone losers is
           to perform serial DEXA imaging. Thus, by the time that rapid bone loss occurs, it is too
           late to take measures to prevent it by interventions such as curtailing the duration of
           adjuvant ADT. Furthermore, we have level 2 evidence from a randomized clinical trial,
           that intervention with a bisphosphonate needs to be instigated at the commencement of
           ADT and continued throughout the duration of ADT to maximize bone density.[10] This
           study will aim to define a predictive tool combining baseline imaging and clinical
           characteristics to help determine which patients are at higher risk of accelerated bone
           loss prior to the initiation of ADT.

           Osteoporosis is a complex condition characterized by loss of both cortical and
           trabecular bone.[11] The structural basis of bone loss is poorly quantified by DEXA
           scanning which combines cortical and trabecular bone density in its measurement.[12]
           However, they can be separately and non-invasively quantified with the use of ultrasound
           (US), computerized tomography (CT), peripheral high resolution quantitative CT (pHR-QCT)
           or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).[13] The last of these methods has the advantages of
           not being operator dependent, not requiring exposure to ionizing radiation and wide
           availability. A disadvantage is the relatively poor characterization of cortical and
           trabecular bone at a field strength of 1.5 T.

           There has been some work using CT imaging to separately quantify both cortical and
           trabecular BMD, as well as other parameters of trabecular bone quality. Much of this
           work has used pHR-QCT, which has revealed detailed changes in the porosity of cortical
           bone for men on ADT which is likely to weaken the bone, and as been termed
           'trabecularization'.[14] Recent studies have compared this technique which has
           relatively limited accessibility, with more widely available technologies such as
           Quantitative CT (QCT) and Multidetector CT (MDCT).[15, 16] A very accurate correlation
           for Trabecular BMD was found between all 3 CT modalities. This raises the possibility
           that BMD can be estimated from the staging MDCT performed on all prostate cancer
           patients, without needing to expose them to the extra radiation dose required to perform
           a QCT.

           An advantage of MRI is that it also allows the collection of additional information
           regarding bone marrow (BM) including fat fraction and perfusions. These measures have
           previously shown some correlation with BMD measured by DEXA imaging, however the
           correlation is relatively poor, with a wide degree of unexplained variation.[17-19] BM
           has intimate proximity with trabecular bone, and paracrine factors such as the
           RANK-Ligand secreted from the BM plays a key role in recruiting bone resorbing
           osteoclasts.[20] It might therefore be that some of the variation in BMD measured with
           DEXA is due to baseline variation in BM quantity. There are also possible correlations
           between BM fat (BMF), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue
           (VAT) and hepatic adipose tissue (HAT), all of which can be separately quantified by
           MRI.[21] This, is turn, may be linked with the deranged insulin levels and response
           linked with ADT administration, and posited as a cause of increased cardiovascular
           morbidity.[22]

           Other evidence shows that ADT induces a drop of haemoglobin from an average baseline
           value of 151 g/L down to 135 within 18 months of starting treatment.[23] No haemolytic
           process is evident, and the circumstantial evidence points to bone marrow suppression as
           being the mechanism for this. Such mild anaemia may also contribute to the insidious
           fatigue often seen in men treated with ADT. There is also some evidence from reanalysis
           of randomized trial data, that men who have the greatest drop in haemoglobin in the 3
           months following initiation of ADT have a poorer overall survival in the setting of
           metastatic disease.[24] As such, measuring BM at baseline may help in predicting which
           patients are at risk of both losing bone faster, becoming anaemic, and suffering
           fatigue. It is therefore plausible that measurement of BM will add an important
           dimension to our knowledge of the bone as a functional unit as well as better explaining
           some of the toxicities associated with ADT.

        2. Circulating Tumour Cells

           For a cancer to metastasize from the primary site of origin to other parts of the body,
           malignant cells must under a series of changes. One crucial step involves being able to
           use blood vessels to transport tumour cells around the body. Assays are now commercially
           available to measure these Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs), including one which has FDA
           approval with the brand-name 'CellSearch'.[25, 26] This has superceded older approaches
           using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect CTC in men with prostate
           cancer.[27]

           Work over the last decade in patients with metastatic cancer has shown that the presence
           of CTCs in men with PC are a bad prognostic factor, with higher levels of CTCs
           correlating with poorer overall survival.[28] On the other side of the spectrum of
           tumour burden, work looking at patients undergoing a radical prostatectomy has shown
           only a very low incidence of CTCs (~20%) prior to surgery, which was no different to
           that measured in a cohort of healthy controls.[29] One issue with this study is that &lt;5%
           of the patients involved would be predicted to eventually suffer metastatic failure,
           hence the chance of finding CTCs was likely to be very low based on the mainly low to
           intermediate risk patient cohort examined.

           Men with high risk PC have a much higher chance of eventual metastatic failure, of the
           order of 20-30%, or higher depending on their initial risk factors (PSA level, tumour
           stage and Gleason grade). At the time of diagnosis these men may therefore exhibit CTC
           levels intermediate between the metastatic and surgical cohorts previously considered.
           It may be that high risk PC patients with CTCs detected represent a very high risk
           group, and apart from providing important prognostic information for men, it could
           therefore warrant treatment intensification with increased duration of adjuvant ADT, or
           entry into clinical trials.

        3. Prostate Radiotherapy Hypofractionation

           Radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to independently improve overall survival for men with
           high risk PC managed with ADT.[30] As such, standard of care for these men remains
           bimodality treatment with both RT and ADT.[1]

           RT has traditionally been given at doses of 1.8-2 Gy per day due to concerns about the
           potential for larger fraction sizes to cause late toxicity. Over the last 10 years
           multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that higher doses of RT (of the
           order of 74-80 Gy) lead to better rates of no biochemical evidence of disease
           (bNED).[31, 32] Due to the long natural history of PC, bNED is a validated surrogate
           endpoint looking at PSA control,[33] however the trial with the longest follow-up is now
           also beginning to show an improvement in Prostate Cancer Specific Survival (PCSS).[31]
           The use of such regimens leads to treatment durations of 8-10 weeks, which can be
           inconvenient for patients, consume a large proportion of the capacity of a RT
           department, and consequently be a significant factor in the existence of waiting lists
           for radiotherapy.

           There is strong data for PC suggesting that hypofractionation (that is, daily fraction
           sizes of &gt;2 Gy) is particularly effective at maximizing tumour effect. Newer
           technologies such as image guided RT (IGRT) which ensures more accurate delivery of the
           RT, and intensity modulated RT (IMRT) which reduces unwanted radiation dose to adjacent
           normal structures are now in clinical use in Australia. They both have been used in
           phase 2 trials of Hypofractionated RT (HypoRT), with results for efficacy and late
           toxicity comparable to those reported in the literature for conventionally fractionated
           cohorts.[34, 35] There have been two small RCTs recently reported comparing HypoRT and
           conventionally fractionated populations, both showing no increased toxicity with the
           HypoRT, and better bNED.[36, 37] One of these focused mainly on high-risk men and
           included ADT, similar to the patient population eligible for PROCITT.[36]

        4. Radiotherapy Volume

           When defining the RT treatment volume for a man with PC, traditional thinking has been
           to treat the prostate alone. However, for a local treatment modality such as RT or
           surgery, it is important to appreciate the natural patterns of spread of the disease.
           For instance, there are good consensus guidelines for patients with head and neck cancer
           to help radiation oncologists to know who are most likely to benefit from elective
           treatment of their cervical neck lymph nodes. This is because, despite the neck being
           negative at the time of diagnosis, surgical neck dissection series have helped to inform
           decision aids regarding the chance of a clinically normal neck harbouring sub-clinical
           disease.

           Nomograms have been constructed from large surgical PC cohorts to help define the risk
           of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node involvement based
           on initial clinical parameters. Trying to treat all patients with the progressively
           larger treatment volumes required to include these areas would potentially increase
           toxicity without a high chance of improving efficacy. However, if a threshold risk level
           of 15-25% were required prior to including each elective target volume, we would aim to
           apply such treatments to patients most likely to benefit. Such concepts are already
           beginning to enter into consensus guidelines,[1, 38] and clearly represent a promising
           avenue of investigation.

           Of all of these expanded treatment volumes, only Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy (WPRT) has
           been investigated in men with PC in RCT.[39] Neither RCT found a significant benefit for
           the use of WPRT. However, many practice changing RCTs have used WPRT on all patients.[2,
           40-42] One of the reasons for this discrepancy is likely to be that entry criteria for
           the largest WPRT RCT estimated a 15% risk of pelvic lymph node involvement.[39] Later
           work has shown that this only corresponded to a 2% pathological risk of nodal
           involvement. This emphasizes the need to use validated decision tools to select
           appropriate treatments.

        5. Duration of neoadjuvant ADT

      Often adjuvant ADT is given prior to commencing RT. This is known as neoadjuvant hormonal
      therapy (NHT). There is no clear guidance on what duration to give this for, although 3-6
      months is a common approach. Results from an Australian randomized trial have shown 6 months
      of NAT to result in superior survival than 3 months.[43] Intuitively, it would seem that some
      patients would benefit from a shorter duration of NHT than others depending on their tumour
      response. There has been some preliminary work looking at an adaptive approach for this,
      where RT is started once a maximal PSA response has been achieved.[44] This has been shown to
      be feasible and effective in the phase 2 setting.
