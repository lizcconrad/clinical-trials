  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify the role of PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
      polypeptide) deficiency in patients with nephrotic syndrome. PACAP is a neuropeptide that has
      a putative role as an inhibitor of megakaryopoiesis and platelet function. Patients with
      nephrotic syndrome show decreased PACAP plasma levels, due to urinary loss. We hypothesize
      that in severe nephrotic syndrome, plasma deficiency of PACAP enhances megakaryopoiesis and
      causes blood platelet activation, which contribute to the increased rate of thromboembolic
      disease in these patients.

      To test our hypothesis, the role of PACAP deficiency on pro-thrombotic state in patients with
      nephrotic syndrome will be studied using patient blood and urine samples.
