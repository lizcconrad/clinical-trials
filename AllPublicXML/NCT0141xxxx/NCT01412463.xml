    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the immediate and long-term (up to 12 months)
      safety and effectiveness of primary stenting with the Protégé Everflex+ stent system for the
      treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions (without involvement of the popliteal
      artery) between 40 mm and 180 mm in length.
