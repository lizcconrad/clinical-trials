  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center clinical trial done recently by us(NCT00508482) shows that needling on ST25
      has the same effect as lactulose in unaided self-defecation frequency of a week and has
      better effect in symptoms improvement (in press). The object is to evaluate whether
      acupuncture is effective for functional constipation. As an explanatory research, it took one
      single point as its intervention and sham acupuncture as its control group (patients were
      blinded). On the basis of its confirmed effect, we are taking a pragmatic randomized
      controlled trial to further evaluate whether acupuncture is more effective than routine
      treatment. Acupuncture prescriptions used in this trial are individually prescribed according
      to syndrome differentiation, which can improve clinical effect. .
