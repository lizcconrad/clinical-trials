    <textblock>
      Nickel contact dermatitis (eczema) is one of the most common allergic conditions affecting
      the skin. This is a study looking at potentially desensitizing nickel-allergic patients to
      their allergy using anti-inflammatory ointments applied to the skin (arm). Application of
      these ointments (ie. modified Vitamin D) has been shown to increase specific immune cells (T
      regulatory cells), which play a role in preventing immune activation and subsequently
      inflammation. The investigators propose use of topical anti-inflammatory agents
      (corticosteroids, modified Vitamin D, or both) may desensitize patients with nickel allergy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Purpose: To evaluate whether topical anti-inflammatory ointments (calcipotriol,
           betamethasone dipropionate, or a combination of both) can decrease sensitivity to nickel
           in known nickel allergic patients. Optional blood samples will be part of the protocol
           to measure immune responses.

        2. Hypothesis: Use of these topical agents will prevent sensitization to nickel sulfate
           upon re-exposure.

        3. Justification: Currently, no cure can yet be offered to nickel sensitive patients.
           Standard treatment only involves avoiding nickel-containing products. However, this is
           not always easily achieved depending on patient awareness and environmental exposures.
           Topical desensitization has not yet been explored in patients with pre-established
           contact allergy. This research will be placebo-controlled with Vaseline petroleum jelly
           to compare reactions to nickel in those treated with anti-inflammatory ointments.

        4. Objectives: a) To evaluate the use of topical anti-inflammatory agents and its role in
           desensitizing known nickel allergic patients to nickel. b) To measure immune cell
           responses to nickel allergen from a blood sample taken before and after topical
           anti-inflammatory application.

        5. Research Method: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, proof of principle
           study. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria with known nickel sensitivity
           will be recruited into the study. Those who consent will undergo 3 sets of nickel patch
           testing: At week 1 to confirm nickel allergic status, week 3 to induce tolerance by
           patch testing at the site of topical ointment application, and finally at week 5 to test
           for desensitization. (Week 2 is self-application with topical ointment; Week 4 is a rest
           week).

        6. Statistical Analysis: a) Primary end-point: Clinical responses measured by standard
           patch testing scores will be documented and photographed for comparison. b) Secondary
           end-point: Levels of T regulatory cell responses before and after topical treatment. c)
           Planned sample size: 24 patients. Given that this is a proof-of-principle study, the
           investigators are choosing to study a small sample size to detect any differences
           amongst treatment arms, if any. A larger-scale, adequately-powered study would be needed
           to detect any statistical significance.

    <description>Erythema, induration, blistering of the skin will be noted. The standardized Likert scale (0-3+) will be used as follows:

    <description>Peripheral T cells will be separated and responses will be determined by flow cytometry after nickel desensitization therapy. Approximately 50 ml of blood will be drawn from consenting subjects. Absolute cell numbers and immunophenotypes of cells will be reported.</description>

    <description>All study patients will be randomized to receive one of four topical ointments (calcipotriol, betamethasone dipropionate, combination of both calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate, or Vaseline petroleum jelly). Each subject will receive one unlabelled 5g tube for application to be dispensed by pharmacist, Rudy Chin. We expect approximately 2g of TOTAL use (0.125g applied twice daily over a 5 cm x 5 cm area on one forearm for 7 days). Typically, topical steroids such as betamethasone dipropionate have been used for treating a number of inflammatory skin conditions, including eczema. In addition, vitamin D analogues such as calcipotriol are used to treat psoriasis. Both agents, in our study, will be used on a small area of normal skin for a short 7 day course.</description>
