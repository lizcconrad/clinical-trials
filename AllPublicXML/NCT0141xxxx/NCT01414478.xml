  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine if the incidence of emesis can be lowered with the
      addition of a high protein drink during labor. Emesis and nausea are the leading causes of
      parturient dissatisfaction, results in a delay of returning to normal, daily living and can
      hugely impact the mother's postpartum experience. To date, no studies have been done on the
      relationship of protein intake during labor and incidence of emesis. To the best of our
      knowledge, the use of a high protein drink during labor has not been evaluated in the
      literature.

      The investigators plan to enroll women (n=150) who requested epidural anesthesia for labor.
      After placement of their labor epidural catheter, parturients will be randomized by a
      computer generated number table into one of two groups. Group P - high protein drink with 30
      grams of protein and ice chips PRN, or Group C - control group consisting of ice chips PRN.
      The protein drink that will be used is Premier Nutrition Protein Shake, which contains 30
      grams of protein in 11 ounces. Measured variables will include; nausea and emesis at epidural
      placement, at hourly intervals until delivery, and 1 hour post delivery. Nausea will be
      evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS); 0 = no nausea and 10 = worst nausea ever.
      Episodes of emesis will be recorded as (yes/no). The parturient will be seen the day
      following delivery and evaluated for overall patient satisfaction. Parturients will rate
      their satisfaction level using a scale from 0-100 with 0=not satisfied and 100=very
      satisfied. The investigators believe that the incidence of emesis will be decreased in
      parturients who receive high protein intake during labor, and overall patient satisfaction
      will be increased.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All women of childbearing age who request labor epidural analgesia, â‰¤ 5cm cervical
        dilatation at the time of epidural insertion, &gt; 36 weeks gestation, singleton pregnancy,
        vertex presentation, and NPO more than 4 hours prior to epidural insertion. Both
        nulliparous and multiparous women will be included. Minors under the age of 18 years will
        be included and a separate informed consent will be presented to these individuals.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women with diabetes (at increased risk for gastroparesis and fetal macrosomia), multiple
        gestation, non-vertex fetal presentation, chronic opioid use (delayed gastric emptying),
        history of gastric bypass surgery (abnormal anatomical stomach), severe morbid obesity (BMI
        &gt; 40kg/m2 due to increased intragastric pressure), and history of known obstetric or
        medical complication (i.e. preeclampsia) that may increase the likelihood of a complicated
        or operative delivery (i.e. cesarean section).
