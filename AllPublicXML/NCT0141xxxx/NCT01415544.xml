    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to prospectively evaluate a noninvasive, near-infrared based
      method for measuring glucose concentration relative to invasive blood reference measurements.
      The initial phase of the study will be focused on procurement of the data needed to develop a
      robust, accurate calibration. The second phase will be focused on performance evaluation of
      the system.

      Currently, individuals with diabetes must use an invasive finger stick methodology for the
      determination of their blood glucose levels. Although current technology glucose meters use a
      smaller amount of blood than older generation meters, the pain and inconvenience associated
      with this invasive measurement is the number one reason cited for inadequate or infrequent
      blood glucose monitoring. In fact up to 67% of patients with diabetes fail to routinely
      monitor their blood glucose levels. A survey of 1895 patients showed that finger soreness was
      the most common reason given for self-reported noncompliance with testing recommendations,
      followed by pain, inconvenience, fear of needles, and &quot;other&quot; (including cost), (Diabetes
      Care August 2001 vol. 24 no. 8 1502-1503). The ability to make a painless blood glucose
      measurement using only light would address the pain and inconvenience issues associated with
      current technology glucose meters.

      The initial application of the technology is associated with the monitoring of Gestational
      Diabetes. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG)
      recently released recommendations for diagnosing gestational diabetes, as well as clarifying
      the benefits of treatment (Diabetes Care, 2010;33:676-682). The IADPSG cited research that
      found significant graded relationships between increasing maternal glucose levels and the
      frequency of four primary and five secondary outcomes. For example, with a 1-standard
      deviation increase in maternal fasting, 1-hour, and 2-hour plasma glucose levels, there was a
      corresponding 38%, 46%, and 38% increased risk, respectively, in the primary outcome of birth
      weight &gt;90th percentile, and a 5%, 18%, and 16% increased risk, respectively, of the
      secondary outcome of premature delivery before 37 weeks gestation (N Engl J Med
      2008;358:1991-2002).

    <description>The collection of capillary blood glucose and noninvasive data will allow the calibration of the noninvasive systems and subsequently evaluate performance via a validation study. The paired NIR spectrum and blood reference data acquired during calibration will be processed using multivariate regression techniques to create a calibration model. Results will be compared using a Clark error grid.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of noninvasive glucose measurement performance versus standard invasive reference. Invasive measurements are made by obtaining capillary blood glucose measurements and then measuring blood on a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI). Due to the fact that instrumentation drift and subject physiological changes can adversely influence measurement performance, the study is specifically designed to examine performance over an appropriate period of time with a reasonable distribution of subject variance. Results will be compared using a Clark error grid.</description>

        The Human Subject population consists of female subjects between the ages of 20 and 50.
        Subjects must have been diagnosed with either Type I, Type II, or Gestational diabetes and
        may utilize healthy individuals for the validation phase. Up to 100 subjects may be
        recruited to participate in this study. Subjects will be recruited from the community and
        will be selected to ensure a representative sample of the projected intended use
        population. Efforts will also be made to ensure a broad and even distribution of ages
        (between 20 and 50 years old) and ethnicities.
