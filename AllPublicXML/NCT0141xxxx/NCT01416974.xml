  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to test the safety and effect of specially prepared
      cells collected from the patients called &quot;modified T cells.&quot; We want to find a safe dose of
      modified T cells for patients who have disease remaining after initial chemotherapy. We also
      want to find out what effects these T cells have on you and your leukemia.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The major criteria for determination of response to therapy in patients with CLL include physical examination and examination of the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Radiographic studies are not required but those that were abnormal pre-treatment will be repeated to document the degree of maximal response.</description>

    <description>Cellular tumor microenvironment analysis: The presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as well as the presence of immune effector cells including dendritic cells, NK cells, and effector T cells will be assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).</description>

    <description>Persistence of gene-modified T cells is defined by the presence of any percentage of detectable cells. The percentage of gene-modified T cells/ total T cells will be recorded for all patients treated at each dose level. In addition, gene-modified T cells will be measured daily for two days, weekly for eight weeks and monthly for six months (by FACS and RT-PCR).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CLL patients with evidence of residual disease, who have achieved PR, nPR or CR with
             detectable MRD following upfront therapy consisting of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide
             and rituximab.

          -  The presence of MRD will be assessed by the flow cytometry and polymerasechain
             reaction at the MSKCC Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Laboratory.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Creatinine ≤2.0 mg/100 ml, bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/100 ml, AST and ALT ≤3.0x normal, PT and
             PTT ≤2x normal outside the setting of stable chronic anticoagulation therapy, absolute
             neutrophil count ≥500/mm3, platelets ≥50,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥8.0g/dl with transfusion
             support.

          -  Adequate pulmonary function as assessed by ≥92% oxygen saturation on room air by pulse
             oximetry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Karnofsky performance status &lt;70.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women and men of childbearing age should use effective
             contraception while on this study and continue for 1 year after all treatment is
             finished.

             are ineligible.

          -  Patients who are immediate candidates for allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell
             transplantation. Patients who refuse this option remain eligible and need to be
             documented as such in patient medical record.

          -  CLL patients with transformed disease (Richter's transformation) are ineligible for
             enrollment on this study.

          -  Patients with following cardiac conditions will be excluded:

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III or IV congestive heart failure

          -  Myocardial infarction ≤6 months prior to enrollment

          -  History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or unexplained syncope, not
             believed to be vasovagal in nature or due to dehydration

          -  History of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ≤20%

          -  Patients with HIV and active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection are ineligible.

          -  Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring
             any therapy other than expectant observation, with the exception of squamous and basal
             cell carcinoma of skin.

        STEP 2 REGISTRATION (Treatment):

        The following additional criteria must be met in order for a patient to be eligible to

        cell infusion.

          -  Creatinine ≤2.0 mg/100 ml, bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/100 ml, AST and ALT ≤3.0x normal, PT and
             PTT ≤2x normal outside the setting of stable chronic anticoagulation therapy, absolute
             neutrophil count ≥500/mm3, platelets ≥50,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥8.0g/dl with transfusion
