      Background: Therapeutic outcomes of leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) vary in
      asthmatics，and there's not an ideal and simple way for prediction at present.

      Objective：To investigate whether leukotriene D4 bronchial provocation test (LTD4-BPT) could
      be an indicator of actual therapeutic outcome of LTRA.

      Methods：A single centre, open-labeled trial was performed in 32 asthmatics with positive
      LTD4-BPT result for a month. All subjects were categorized according to airway responsiveness
      to leukotriene D4（PD20FEV1-LTD4）. Subjects received montelukast therapy (10mg, once per
      night), and reassessment was performed (3~5) days after withholding LTRA. The primary
      end-point was the difference in monthly PEFR. Secondary endpoints included the difference in
      FENO, PD20FEV1-LTD4, PD20FEV1-MCh, pre-test FEV1, ACT score, AQLQ symptom score, week 4
      PEFmax and PEFmin as compared with week 1, gradual decrease in the use of salbutamol and the
      days without using salbutamol.

      Our primary goal was to determine whether LTD4-BPT could be a clear indicator for assessing
      efficacy of LTRA. Logistic regression model was adopted for statistical analysis. In this
      model, pre-treatment PD20FEV1-LTD4 represented anticipated efficacy. The median of
      PD20FEV1-LTD4 was used for classification of asthmatics, with a lower figure representing a
      better anticipated outcome. Various variables, including the difference in pre- and post-
      treatment FENO, PEFmax, PEFmin, PEFR, PD20FEV1 and asthma scores, were introduced in the
      model representing the actual efficacy of LTRA. We aimed to test whether there would be
      certain parameters that assist prediction of anticipated outcome.

    <measure>whether there was improvement in weekly PEFR</measure>
    <time_frame>from commencement of LTRA therapy to (28±7) days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was a qualitative measure, with the results being expressed as either yes or no ('1' or '0' in Logistic model).PEFR was defined as the changed rate of peak expiratory flow, which was calculated using the formula according to maximal PEF (PEFmax) and minimal PEF (PEFmin) measured by portable PEF monitor: 100%*(PEFmax-PEFmin)/[(PEFmax+PEFmin)*1/2]. A higher PEFR is more suggestive of instability of asthma control.</description>
