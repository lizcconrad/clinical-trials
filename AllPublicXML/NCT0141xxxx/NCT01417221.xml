      The purpose of this study is to observe the incident of composite cardiovascular events after
      renal sympathetic modification using THERMOCOOL® catheter in patients with essential
      hypertension, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a common cardiovascular disease, and is also an important risk factor for
      heart-brain-renal diseases, with relatively low controlled rate. Traditional pharmacological
      therapies are used in clinical practice without breakthrough for long time. Previous studies
      confirmed that sympathetic nerves activity contributed to development and perpetuation of
      hypertension. Renal ablation for sympathetic modification is a new method which is proved to
      be effective in decreasing sympathetic nerves activity. We assume that modifying renal
      sympathetic activity by ablation is effective and safe in treatment of hypertension. This
      trial is going to recruit 200 patients (Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a
      follow-up duration of 3 years. Patients in ablation group will receive additional necessary
      anti-hypertensive medications besides expectant intervention, and patients in control group
      will receive appropriate anti-hypertensive medications only. We aim to observe the incident
      of composite cardiovascular events after renal sympathetic modification using THERMOCOOL®
      catheter in patients with hypertension, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.
