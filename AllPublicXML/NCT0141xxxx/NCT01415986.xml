  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presently, there is no effective treatment for patients with advanced head and neck cancer
      (AHNC) that failed to respond to the standard therapy (radiation, chemotherapy and surgery)
      in the US. These patients are deemed incurable AHNC. In the European Union (EU), interstitial
      photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) with Temoporfin is approved for the treatment of patients with
      incurable AHNC. Well designed EU studies have shown that I-PDT with Temoporfin can provide
      worthwhile palliation by reducing tumor size, bleeding and pain in 53% - 60% of patients with
      incurable AHNC. This is a significantly higher rate in comparison to the reported response
      rate of palliative chemotherapy (6-30%). However, the EU studies did not correlate
      quantitative tumor response with clinical outcome. In addition, quality of life (QoL)
      improvements associated with I-PDT of AHNC using Temoporfin were also not evaluated.

      The objective of this study is to quantify the tumor response and patient's QoL to I-PDT with
      Temoporfin. Successfully meeting this objective will give us the tools the investigators need
      to design larger studies to significantly improve the management and QoL of patients with
      AHNC.

      This is a non-randomize, open label, Pilot phase II study with 5 consenting subjects. The
      specific aims of this study are:

      Aim 1: Quantitate local tumor response in patients with incurable AHNC treated with I-PDT
      with Temoporfin.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the changes in QoL in patients with incurable AHNC treated with I-PDT with
      Temoporfin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age and older, male or female, of all races and ethnicities.

          -  Prior histologically confirmed advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
             that failed standard therapy (radiation, chemotherapy, surgery).

          -  Must have a Karnofsky performance status higher than 70%.

             interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT).

          -  Deemed unsuitable, by multidisciplinary tumor board, for curative treatment options
             such as radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or a combination of these modalities. This
             will include patients who have exceeded the maximum radiation dose and are not
