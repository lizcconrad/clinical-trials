  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research trial is studying how Ch14.18 acts in the body of younger patients with
      high-risk neuroblastoma. Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer receiving
      Ch14.18 may help doctors learn more about how this drug is used by the body to develop better
      ways to give the drug to potentially improve its effectiveness and lessen its side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the pharmacokinetics of ch14.18 (monoclonal antibody Ch14.18) in children with
      high-risk neuroblastoma.

      II. Quantify the degree of inter-patient and intra-patient variability in the clearance of
      ch14.18, and correlate ch14.18 clearance with patient characteristics, the presence of human
      anti-chimeric antibody (HACA), tumor burden (assessed on scans), and plasma GD2 levels to
      identify sources of variability in the clearance.

      III. Develop a pharmacokinetic model to describe the pharmacokinetic profile of ch14.18 and
      derive pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate plasma concentrations of ch14.18 with the severity of neuropathic pain, which is
      being quantified using an observational pain scale, and the total dose of morphine
      administered to control pain.

      II. Develop a limited sampling strategy that will accurately quantify the area under the
      curve (AUC) of ch14.18.

      III. Simulate alternative dosing strategies with the pharmacokinetic model in order to reduce
      variability and simplify drug administration.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and during and after course 1, 3, or 5
      of treatment for pharmacokinetic analysis. Some patients undergo blood sample collection at
      baseline and during and after two treatment courses (1 and 3, 1 and 5, or 3 and 5).

    <description>The coefficient of variation of Ch14.18 clearance is used to quantify the degree of inter-patient and intra-patient variability of monoclonal antibody ch14.18 pharmacokinetics. The relationship between patient characteristics, HACA, tumor burden, and plasma GD2 levels will be assessed graphically in an exploratory fashion with regression models.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PK parameters of monoclonal antibody ch14.18 in children with high?risk neuroblastoma during and after 4 daily 10?hour infusions</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after infusion on days 3-5; before, after, 4-6 hours after, and 12-14 hours after infusion on day 6; on the morning of days 10, 14, 17, and 24; and before infusion on day 31</time_frame>
    <description>PK parameters include the peak concentration, trough concentration, AUC, clearance, volume of distribution, half-life, and mean residence time. PK parameters will be derived from the plasma concentration-time data. A one-compartment model fit to the concentration-time data will estimated the volume of distribution and the first order elimination rate constant, which will in turn be used to calculate clearance, half-life, AUC0-infinity, AUC0-last, and the mean residence time. An error function and the dependency for each fitted parameter will be reported.</description>

    <measure>AUC of Ch14.18</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 58 days</time_frame>
    <description>A limited sampling strategy that will accurately quantify the AUC of monoclonal antibody ch14.18 will be developed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of neuropathic pain, quantified using an observational pain scale based on the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale (FLACC) and the total dose of morphine delivered</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 58 days</time_frame>
    <description>The pain measures will be correlated with plasma concentrations of monoclonal antibody ch14.18 simulated using the PK model and the monoclonal antibody ch14.18 AUC0-96 hours. The overall drug exposure during the infusion will be correlated with the total morphine dose administered over the 4 days of treatment.</description>
