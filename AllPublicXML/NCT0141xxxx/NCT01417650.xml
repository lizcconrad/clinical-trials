  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is the major cause of nondental pain in orofacial area.
      Laser therapy can be considered as one of the most popular methods of pain relief in TMD
      patients. The special features of laser light such as coherence, monochromaticity, and
      collimation can result in the ability of laser light to modify cellular metabolism, increase
      tissue repair and reduce edema and inflammation. The effectiveness of low level laser therapy
      in reducing the signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorders has been investigated
      in a few studies. But, in most of the previous studies the etiology of TMD has not been
      considered in patient selection. Furthermore, there are some controversies in the results of
      these studies. According to our data, there is no study evaluating the effects of low level
      laser therapy on patients having TMJ osteoarthritis.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of low level laser therapy in
      improving osteoarthritis of temporomandibular joint and also to evaluate the long term
      effects of laser therapy on the morphology of the joint.

      Project method: This study will be implemented on 20 patients aged 35-60 years referring to
      Department of Prosthetic Dentistry of Mashhad Dental School. The patients are selected
      according to the RDC/TMD criteria to include those having temporomandibular osteoarthritis
      with unknown etiology. The patients will be asked to take cone beam CT of temporomandibular
      joint to evaluate any changes in morphology of the TMJ. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to two groups: Group 1 (treatment group) will receive low level laser therapy. The
      laser light will be applied with 890 nm diode laser (Mustang 2000+, Russia) with frequency of
      1500 Hz, and dose of 2 J/cm2 per point in the joint area and painful muscles if any. In Group
      2 (placebo) the low power laser will be applied with a minimal dose that is very lower than
      the threshold necessary for therapeutic effects. Laser therapy for both the treatment and
      placebo groups will be applied in the back, front, and above the mandibular condyles and
      inside the external auditory meatus and also on painful muscles three times a week for four
      weeks. Patients will be evaluated at the start of the treatment, after the 6th and 12th
      sessions of laser therapy and also one month after the end of the treatment. At each
      evaluation, the pain level in opening the mouth and masticatory muscle tenderness will be
      measured according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The range of lateral and protrusive
      mandibular movements, the difficulty in chewing food and the the presence or absence of sound
      joints will also be evaluated. One year after treatment, the patients will be referred for
      taking the second cone beam CT of the TMJ to seek any change in morphology of the joint.
