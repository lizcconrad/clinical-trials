    <textblock>
      Anthracyclines have been used commonly to treat children with solid tumours and
      haematological malignancies and have led to their increased survival. Nonetheless,
      anthracycline has the side effect of cardiotoxicity. The purpose of this study is to assess
      the impact of anthracycline therapy on heart deformation and fibrosis, heart-vessel
      interaction, usefulness of circulating biomarkers in the assessment of heart function and
      potential genetic predisposition to heart failure in adult survivors of childhood cancers.

      Incorporation of anthracyclines into chemotherapy protocols has improved the survival of
      children with solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Nonetheless, longitudinal
      studies have implicated the absence of a safe anthracycline dose that is free of
      cardiotoxicity. Substantial risk for cardiovascular disease has been shown recently in large
      cohorts of adult survivors of childhood and adolescent survivors. Serial monitoring of
      cardiac function is hence of paramount importance in childhood cancer survivors for early
      detection of myocardial damage and timely institution of interventions. The optimal
      monitoring of cardiac function in the long term in these at-risk patients remains to be
      established. Novel noninvasive imaging modalities including echocardiography and cardiac
      magnetic resonance allow interrogation of myocardial deformation and fibrosis, while
      circulating biomarkers are increasingly used to monitor the cardiac status in heart failure
      patients. Additionally, genetics of heart failure are increasingly unveiled.

        Patients will be recruited from the 5 public hospitals in Hong Kong (Prince of Wales
        Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and
        Tuen Mun Hospital) that treat the vast majority of childhood cancers, with the number of
        patients recruited from each hospital proportional to the respective new case-loads in the
        past 10 years.
