  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sub-Saharan Africa is the region most affected by the global Human Immunodeficiency Virus
      (HIV) epidemic. A vaccine is the most promising preventive approach against new HIV
      infections. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 4
      experimental preventive HIV vaccine regimens in HIV-uninfected adults in South Africa.

    <textblock>
      The worldwide Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)
      epidemic may only be controlled through development and utilization of a safe and effective
      vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. Due to the high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in
      southern Africa, the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI), the HIV Vaccine Trials
      Network (HVTN), Novartis, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
      (NIAID) are evaluating three subtype C HIV vaccines, SAAVI DNA-C2, SAAVI MVA-C, and Novartis
      Subtype C gp140 through this study. These vaccines will be used together in four prime-boost
      regimens. The SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine is a multigene deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine
      consisting of two DNA plasmids in equal amounts that express an HIV-1 subtype C polyprotein
      comprising of Gag-Reverse Transcriptase-Tat-Nef and an HIV-1 subtype C truncated Env. SAAVI
      MVA-C is a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine expressing the same immunogens
      as the SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine. MVA is a highly attenuated vaccinia virus. The Novartis protein
      subunit vaccine is a Subtype C oligomeric V2 loop deleted glycoprotein 140 (gp140) vaccine
      (gp140[delta]V2.TV1), given with MF59 adjuvant.

      This trial is designed to build upon the Thai RV144 HIV vaccine trial, which demonstrated an
      efficacy of 31.2% among participants who received a different vaccine regimen of a pox prime
      followed by a concurrently-administered protein boost. This primary purpose of HVTN 086 is to
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of SAAVI DNA-C2, SAAVI MVA-C and Novartis Clade C
      gp140TV1ΔV2 with MF59 adjuvant in various vaccination regimens. The primary analysis will
      focus on a ranking strategy of the vaccine regimens that is guided by measurements of the
      immune responses elicited by these vaccines and their respective modes of delivery in various
      combinations, both sequential and concurrent.

      Participants will actively participate in this study for 12 months. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either a prime-boost preventive vaccine regimen or placebo. Four
      prime-boost preventive vaccine regimens will be compared; each participant will be randomized
      to one of 4 groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive MVA-C at months 0 and 1, and
      gp140/MF59 at months 3 and 6. Group 2 will receive MVA-C and gp140/MF59 at months 1 and 3.
      Group 3 will receive DNA-C at months 0 and 1, and MVA-C at months 3 and 6. Group 4 will
      receive DNA-C at months 0 and 1, and both MVA-C and gp140/MF59 at months 3 and 6. Additional
      study visits will occur at Weeks 2, 6, 13, 14, 26, 28, 36, and 48. All participants will be
      contacted once annually for 3 years and asked questions about their health. Study procedures
      include physical exams, blood and urine collection, HIV testing, an electrocardiogram, and
      questionnaire. Some blood collected from participants will be stored and used in future
      research. Risk-reduction counseling will be conducted at all study visits.

          5. HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For potential participants who
             have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 086 / SAAVI 103 PSRT
             will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis.

          6. Non-HIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine
             trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure

             experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 086 / SAAVI 103 PSRT will determine eligibility
             on a case-by-case basis. For potential participants who have received an experimental
             vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by

         23. Immunodeficiency

         24. Asthma other than mild, well-controlled asthma. Exclude a participant who:

               -  Generally uses a bronchodilator (beta2 agonist) daily, or

               -  In the past year, has (any of the following):

               -  Had &gt; 1 exacerbation of symptoms treated with oral steroids (Note:
                  oral/parenteral steroid use for asthma is exclusionary within 168 days before
                  first vaccination.);

               -  Routinely used moderate to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (eg, more than the
                  equivalent of 250 µg fluticasone; 400 µg budesonide; 500 µg beclomethasone; or
                  1000 µg triamcinolone/flunisolide, as a daily dose) or theophylline for asthma;
                  or

               -  Needed emergency care, urgent care, hospitalization, or intubation for asthma.

         25. Diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet alone. (Not
             excluded: history of isolated gestational diabetes.)

             medication within the last 2 years

         28. Hypertension:

               -  If a person has been diagnosed with hypertension during screening or previously,
                  exclude for hypertension that is not well controlled. Well-controlled
                  hypertension is defined as blood pressure consistently = 140 mm Hg systolic and =
                  90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without medication, with only isolated, brief
                  instances of higher readings, which must be = 150 mm Hg systolic and = 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these participants, blood pressure must be = 140 mm Hg systolic
                  and = 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been diagnosed with hypertension during screening or
                  previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure = 150 mm Hg at enrollment or
                  diastolic blood pressure = 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

         29. Body mass index (BMI) = 40

         30. Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

         31. Malignancy (Not excluded: a participant with a surgical excision and subsequent
             observation period that in the investigator's estimation has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure or is unlikely to recur during the period of the study.)

         32. Seizure disorder (Not excluded: a participant with a history of seizures who has not
             required medications or had a seizure within the past 3 years.)

         33. Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

         34. Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are persons with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide,
             or history of suicide attempt or gesture within the past 3 years.
