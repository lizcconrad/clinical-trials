  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this trial is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of allogeneic HCT
      for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive hematological malignancies and coincident
      HIV-infection. In particular, the trial will focus on the 100-day non-relapse mortality as an
      indicator of the safety of transplant in this patient population. Correlative assays will
      focus upon the incidence of infectious complications in this patient population, the
      evolution of HIV infection and immunological reconstitution. Where feasible (and when this
      can be accomplished without compromise of either the donor quality or the timeliness of
      transplantation), an attempt will be made to identify donors who are homozygotes for the
      delta32 mutation for CCR5.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of reduced-intensity and
      fully-ablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients with
      hematological malignancies or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who have HIV infection. The
      goal of the study is to assess the 100 day Non-relapse Mortality as well as immunological
      reconstitution in this patient population. Where feasible, an attempt will be made to
      identify human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible hematopoietic stem cell donors who are
      homozygotes for the delta32 mutation of the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5delta32). Patients will
      undergo a treatment plan review prior to registration on the trial. All patients will undergo
      allogeneic HCT from a matched sibling or unrelated donor.

             detectable viral load &gt; 750 copies/ml should be evaluated with an HIV drug resistance
             test (HIV-1 genotype). The results should be included as part of the Antiretroviral
             Review (described in Appendix D). This Review Committee will make the final
             determination as to whether HIV viremia could potentially be suppressed with alternate
             antiretroviral therapy. .

        <description>This will be measured in all patients at 8 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post-transplant. Tests to be performed on peripheral blood at those time points include CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD3+/CD25+, CD45 RA/RO, CD56+/CD3-, and quantitative immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG and IgA).</description>

        <title>Impact of Therapy on the HIV Reservoir</title>
        <description>HIV-1 RNA in plasma will be measured by standard real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (detection limit 40 copies/ml) and by the investigational single copy assay (SCA, detection limit 0.38 copy/ml). HIV-1 DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and other cells will be quantified using the same primers and probes used for SCA but without a reverse transcription step. HIV-1 RNA levels will be measured in plasma prior to the initiation of ablative chemotherapy, and at Day +100, 1 and 2 years post-transplant.</description>

        <title>Hematologic Function</title>
        <description>Hematologic function will be defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1500, Hemoglobin greater than 10g/dL without transfusion support, and platelets greater than 100,000 and measured at Day 100 and 6 months. Use of growth factors will be noted.</description>
