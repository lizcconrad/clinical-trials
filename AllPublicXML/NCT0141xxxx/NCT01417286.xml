      This phase II trial studies how well giving accelerated radiation therapy (RT) after surgery
      works in treating patients with breast cancer. RT uses high energy x rays to kill tumor
      cells. Giving RT after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Freedom from local failure and freedom from regional failure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Acute toxicity and late toxicity using previously published toxicity scales. II. To
      identify co-variates responsible for poor cosmetic outcome in women with reconstructed chest
      walls when treated with accelerated, hypofractionated radiotherapy.

      III. To correlate toxicity, cosmesis, and local control with molecular markers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo hypofractionated accelerated RT over 11 weekdays (for 15 elapsed days)
      within 21-63 days after last surgery or last course of chemotherapy. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-8 weeks, every 3-6 months
      for 3 years, every 6-12 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

             carcinoma of the breast treated with mastectomy and either sentinel node biopsy or
             axillary dissection; inflammatory carcinoma (T4d) is allowed

          -  Patients with locally advanced breast cancer on clinical exam and diagnostics ( &gt; 3 cm
             and/or clinically node-positive) who have mastectomy after induction chemotherapy are
             allowed

          -  Multifocal/multicentric disease is allowed
