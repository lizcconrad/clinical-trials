  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post market clinical study is to collect prospective clinical data to
      confirm the efficacy of RF Kyphoplasty for the treatment of pathological fractures of the
      spine caused by multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myeloma is the commonest primary cancer affecting the spine. Painful vertebral compression
      fractures (VCFs) affect approximately 30% of myeloma patients. As myeloma patients live
      longer, it is especially relevant to provide the best available treatment for pain and reduce
      disabilities that can result from VCFs.

      Cement delivery is a well established treatment method for treating painful vertebrae
      compromised by tumor and/or osteoporosis. The StabiliT Vertebral Augmentation System (DFine
      Inc.) is a unique percutaneous vertebral augmentation system designed to provide the
      physician a means of creating targeted cavities and an ultra-high viscosity cement (using RF
      Energy) that can be delivered over an extended period of time in order to allow for
      controlled, targeted vertebral augmentation in multiple myeloma patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of multiple myeloma and evidence of myelomatous lesions in the spine,
             including plasmacytomas, lytic lesions and fractures.

          2. One to 6 painful (pain on palpation/percussion over fractured vertebral body) VCF(s),
             T3-L5, with bone marrow edema imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Subjects
             with 4-6 fractures treatment will be divided into two sessions 1- 7 days apart)

          3. History of fracture related pain less than ≤ 3 months old

          4. Pain VAS score ≥4 on a scale of 0 to 10. When the subject is newly diagnosed with
             multiple myeloma, the pain assessment must not be done until after completion of at
             least one pulse of steroid therapy or one week after the initiation of active multiple
             myeloma chemotherapy. Pain represents worst pain without use of narcotic medications.

          5. Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score ≥ 10 on 0 to 24 scale

          6. Subjects is ≥ 21 years old.

          7. No change in chemotherapy regimen (change in dose(s) permitted) for 1 month prior to
             enrollment

          8. No change in chemotherapy regimen (change in dose(s) permitted) planned for at least 1
             month following enrollment

          9. Subject has no major surgery to the spine planned for at least 1 month following
             enrollment

         10. Subject has sufficient mental capacity to comply with the protocol requirements

         11. Subject must be willing and able to comply with specified follow-up evaluations

         12. Subject understands the potential risks and benefits of participating in the study and
             is willing to provide written informed consent.

         13. Female subjects must either be no longer capable of reproduction or taking acceptable
             measures to prevent pregnancy during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with primary tumors of the bone (e.g., osteosarcoma) or osteoblastic
             metastases at site of the index VCF. Subjects with these tumors in anatomic sites
             other than the index VCF are eligible.

          2. Subject is concurrent Phase I investigational anti-cancer treatment

          3. Subject has significant clinical morbidities (aside from the index fracture(s) and
             cancer) that may potentially interfere with the collection of data concerning pain and
             function

          4. Subject has VCF morphology deemed unsuitable for RF Kyphoplasty (e.g. vertebral
             planna)

          5. Additional non-kyphoplasty surgical treatment is required for the index fracture

          6. Subjects requiring the use of high-dose steroid (≥ 100 mg prednisone or 20 mg
             dexamethasone per day), intravenous (IV) pain medication, or nerve block to control
             chronic back pain unrelated to index VCF(s). Subjects who receive high-dose steroids
             for treatment of their cancer (for at least 30 days) are eligible.

          7. Subjects with a platelet count of &lt; 20,000

          8. Subject has spinal cord compression or significant canal compromise requiring
             decompression

          9. Subjects with VCFs due to osteoporosis

         10. Subject has medical/surgical conditions contrary to the kyphoplasty procedure (e.g.,
             in the presence of active or incompletely treated local infection)

         11. Positive baseline pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential)

         12. Subject has neurologic deficit associated with the level(s) to be treated more severe
             than radiculopathy (e.g. myelopathy, cauda equina syndrome)

         13. Subject has segmental kyphosis &gt; 30° in area of treatment

         14. Subject has uncontrolled coagulopathy

         15. Subject cannot temporarily discontinue anticoagulation therapy
