      This study is a regulatory post marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
      (CAPD) who have received Fosrenol for hyperphosphatemia. The objective of this study is to
      assess safety and efficacy of using Fosrenol in clinical practice. This study is also all
      case investigation of which the enrollment period is one year, and all patients in CAPD who
      received Fosrenol for hyperphosphatemia will be recruited and followed one year.
