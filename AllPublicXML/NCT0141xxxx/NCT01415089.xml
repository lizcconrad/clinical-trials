    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to develop a personalized, interactive, and web-based
      module for cancer patients and a family caregiver. The three-session module will be designed
      to help patients and family caregivers improve their communication and support.

      This R21 will be used to develop an individually tailored, interactive, web-based
      intervention for cancer patients (lung, colorectal, breast, prostate) and their family
      caregivers. This intervention is based on an efficacious, family-based program of care (the
      FOCUS Program) that has been tested previously in three large randomized clinical trials with
      positive outcomes for patients and their caregivers. In this R21 we will translate this
      primarily face-to-face, family-based program to an internet-based version.

      The objectives are: Objective 1. To develop an individually-tailored, interactive, web-based
      and email-based, Family Involvement Module. We will conduct formative testing while
      developing the module using qualitative data obtained from four focus groups. We will conduct
      usability testing of the near final module with data obtained from qualitative interviews
      with patients and caregivers as they complete web-based task assignments using a &quot;think
      aloud&quot; protocol while they navigate the module. Objective 2. To conduct a Phase II study with
      cancer patients and their family caregiver (N = 40 dyads) using baseline (Time 1) and
      two-month follow-up assessments (Time 2). Between Times 1 and 2, all participants jointly
      will complete the web-based Family Involvement Module. We will determine the feasibility of
      delivering the web-based module and will obtain a process evaluation completed by study
      participants. Data will be obtained from three large cancer centers using established
      instruments, and analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Findings from this
      R21 will provide data that are essential to test this innovative, tailored, interactive
      web-based intervention with a larger sample in a R01.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  cancer patients with confirmed diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung or prostate
             cancer

          -  early stage (I or II, diagnosed within past 2 to 12 months) OR advanced stage (III or
             IV, diagnosed or progressed within past 2 to 12 months)

          -  age 18 or older

          -  physically/mentally able to participate

          -  speak/read/write English

          -  have access to internet at home

          -  have a family caregiver willing to participate

          -  family caregivers must be age 18 or older, physically/mentally able to participate,
             able to speak/read/write English, identified by the patient as his or her primarily
             family caregiver, and have access to and willing to use the internet. &quot;Family
             caregiver&quot; is defined as the family member or significant other identified by the
             patient as his or her primary source of emotional or physical support during the
             current cancer experience and confirmed by the designated individual.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Family caregivers will be excluded from the study if they themselves have been
             diagnosed with cancer in the previous year or are receiving active treatment for
             cancer. This criteria was established so all dyads are managing effects of cancer in
             patients, not the family caregivers.
