  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV in high prevalence
      countries, the majority of people with HIV infection still initiate treatment at an advanced
      stage of disease. This leads to a high risk of death soon after HIV diagnosis. Prompt HIV
      diagnosis is, therefore, necessary for both individual and public health benefit and is being
      strongly promoted as international and national policy in Malawi. However timely HIV
      diagnosis may not in itself be sufficient to ensure ART initiation: this is reflected by the
      relatively high proportion of individuals who defer treatment-seeking for months or years
      following diagnosis of HIV.

      Here the researchers investigate the extent to which home assessment and initiation of ART
      adds to the effectiveness of a home-based HIV testing and counseling strategy, using entry
      to, adherence with, and retention in HIV care as the outcome of interest.

    <description>Participants with a positive home-based HIV test result will receive a home visit from a study nurse who will complete the following on the first home visit:
Confirmatory fingerprick HIV testing
TB symptom screening
ART eligibility assessment (Word Health Organization clinical staging, sampling of blood for measurement of CD4 count and treatment education)
At a second home visit (within 5 days), participants who are ART eligible (as defined in National ART guidelines) will be initiated onto ART (using National Treatment Programme ART regimens).
Following home initiation of ART, participants in the intervention arm will receive detailed counselling from the study nurse about the need to attend their first 2-week follow-up appointment at the primary health care clinic that serves their household's residence. They will receive a referral slip detailing the date, time and place of their appointment.</description>
