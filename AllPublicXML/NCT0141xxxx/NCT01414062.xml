  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic women are 20% more likely to die of breast cancer than non Hispanic white women who
      are diagnosed at a similar age and stage. One reason for this disparity may be differences in
      post diagnosis dietary behaviors. In order to reduce this disparity, and to improve overall
      survivorship, culturally appropriate dietary interventions that teach women how to eat a diet
      high in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated fat need to be developed for Hispanic
      breast cancer survivors. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled study
      (n=70, 35 per arm) to test the effects of the ¡Cocinar para su salud! program on changing
      dietary behaviors among Hispanic breast cancer survivors who have recently completed
      treatment. The ¡Cocinar para su salud! program is a 12 week course that provides hands on
      education and instruction in nutrition education, meal preparation, and food shopping in a
      group setting. All participants will be followed for a total of 12 months, have clinical
      assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, and monthly telephone contacts using
      motivational interview techniques. The Primary Aims are to determine the effect of the
      dietary intervention (¡Cocinar para su salud! program) vs. control (standard written
      nutrition education materials for cancer survivors) on 1) daily servings of fruit/vegetable,
      and 2) daily servings of fat intake from baseline to 6 months. The investigators hypothesize
      that the dietary intervention will result in a larger increase of fruit and vegetable intake
      and a larger reduction of fat intake, when compared to the control group. Secondary Aims are
      to determine the effect of the dietary intervention vs. control on 1) biomarkers of fruit and
      vegetable intake, molecular biomarkers associated with breast cancer risk, and anthropometric
      measures at 6 and 12 months; 2) fruit/vegetable and fat intake at 12 months; 3) mediators of
      dietary change, including readiness to change, outcome expectations, perceived self efficacy,
      food and nutrition skills, self regulation skills, and barriers to adherence; and 4) changes
      in quality of life and anxiety/depression at 6 and 12 months.

      This trial is a randomized, controlled 2-arm study of a 3-month dietary change counseling and
      instruction intervention among Hispanic breast cancer survivors (n=70, 35 per arm). The study
      is comparing Arm A: standard of care written dietary recommendations for cancer survivors,
      with Arm B: the 12-week ¡Cocinar para su salud!. ¡Cocinar para su salud! will provide
      hands-on education and instruction to Hispanic breast cancer survivors in nutrition
      education, food shopping, and meal preparation in a group setting. Participants will be
      followed for a total of 12 months, have clinical assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12
      months, and will have monthly telephone contacts using motivational interviewing. The primary
      endpoint is at 6 months because the investigators hypothesize that it will take participants
      at least 3 months to adapt some of the dietary behaviors taught in the 3-month intervention.

      A total of 70 women with a history of histologically-confirmed early stage breast cancer will
      be randomized to Arm A or Arm B. Assuming an accrual rate of approximately 2-4 participants
      per month, the investigators expect to complete enrollment within 24 months.

    <description>A series of 9 Cocinar Para Su Salud intervention sessions held over a 12-week period. The 12-week intervention period will be divided into 3 groups: motivation, action, and environment. Each topic will use a nutrition roundtable, food shopping field trip, and a cooking class to teach pertinent points, in order to enable participants to progress from the precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation stages of change to the action and maintenance stages.</description>

          -  Willing and able to participate in all study related activities, including study
             clinic visits, phone interviews, and nutrition counseling sessions.

             patients receiving active chemotherapy or radiotherapy; or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
