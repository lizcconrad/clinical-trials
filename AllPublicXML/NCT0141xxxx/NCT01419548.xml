  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Paclitaxel and carboplatin are two standard drugs that stop cancer cells from reproducing.
      ABT-888 is an experimental cancer drug that may prevent cancer cells from &quot;fixing&quot; the damage
      done by chemotherapy drugs. This may make the chemotherapy work better. More tests are needed
      to determine the safety and effectiveness of ABT-888 plus chemotherapy. Researchers also want
      to find the best dose of ABT-888 for people who have kidney or liver problems in addition to
      cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of ABT-888 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in people
      who have both cancer and kidney or liver problems.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors that have not responded to
           standard treatment, and who also have kidney or liver problems.

        -  A small group of people with solid tumors and normal kidney and liver function may also
           receive treatment for study comparison purposes.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have
           blood and urine tests, tumor samples, tests of liver and kidney function, and imaging
           studies. Participants will also provide a hair sample at the start of the study.

        -  Participants will take one dose of ABT-888 1 week before starting chemotherapy. The two
           chemotherapy drugs will be given on day 3 of a 21-day cycle. Participants will take
           ABT-888 daily for the first 7 days of each cycle.

        -  They will keep a diary to record medication doses and any side effects. They will also
           have frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Participants will provide more hair
           samples on day 3 of cycle 1 before and after having paclitaxel.

        -  Participants will continue treatment for up to 18 weeks as long as the cancer stops
           growing or shrinks and there are no serious side effects. Participants may have the
           option to continue treatment after the study is done.

      Background:

      The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes is critical for maintaining genomic
      stability by regulating a variety of DNA repair mechanisms. The carboplatin/paclitaxel
      combination has demonstrated a wide spectrum of clinical antitumor activity, making it an
      ideal platform for evaluation with novel agents, such as the PARP inhibitor ABT-888.

      Objectives:

      To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ABT-888 in patients with varying
      degrees of renal or hepatic dysfunction.

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 in combination with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel for patients with varying degrees of liver or kidney dysfunction.

      To provide dosing recommendations for ABT-888 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel
      based on degree of hepatic and renal impairment.

      To define the dose-limiting toxicity and other toxicities associated with the use of this
      combination in patients with varying degrees of renal or hepatic dysfunction.

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of ABT-888, carboplatin and paclitaxel when
      administered as a combination in patients with varying degrees of renal or hepatic
      dysfunction.

      To evaluate the pharmacodynamic measurement of PAR and platinum adducts in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumor cells associated with the use of this combination

      in patients with varying degrees of renal or hepatic dysfunction.

      Eligibility:

      Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable,
      for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective,
      and for which there is expectation of response to the combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel
      (e.g., lung, ovarian, breast, and melanoma).

      Patients must have adequate bone marrow function.

      Patients with normal organ function, patients with all degrees of renal dysfunction, and
      patients with mild to severe hepatic dysfunction are allowed.

      Study Design:

      ABT-888 (80 mg) will be given orally on day -6 ( 1 day) of cycle 1 in all cohorts. ABT-888 in
      varying doses will then be given on days 1-7 of each cycle, with the dose depending on each
      patient's degree of renal or hepatic dysfunction.

      Fixed doses of chemotherapy will be given intravenously on day 3 of each cycle. For patients
      with renal dysfunction, carboplatin will be given at AUC of 6 and paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2.
      For patients with hepatic dysfunction, carboplatin will be given at AUC of 6 and paclitaxel
      at doses adjusted to each patient's degree of hepatic dysfunction.

      The dose of ABT-888 will be escalated to determine the MTD of the combination.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable, for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are
             no longer effective, and for which there is expectation of response to the combination
             of carboplatin/paclitaxel (e.g., lung, ovarian, breast, melanoma).

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of ABT-888 in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are
             excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric phase 1 combination
             trials.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have marrow function as defined below:

        absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

        platelets greater than or eqaul to 100,000/mcL

        hemoglobin greater than or eqaul to 8.0 g/dL

          -  Patients with all degrees of renal dysfunction are allowed including patients on
             hemodialysis. Patients with mild to severe hepatic dysfunction are allowed as defined
             below:

          -  total bilirubin less than or eqaul to 5 times ULN AND AST and ALT less than or eqaul
             to10 times ULN

        For patients with a recently placed biliary stent, patients should have consistent results
        within a hepatic group from two laboratory readings within 3 days apart, taken at least 10
        days following biliary stent placement. For patients with a biliary stent placed over 2
        months ago, no obstruction or blockage can have occurred within the last 2 months.

        -The effects of ABT-888 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
        because other therapeutic agents or modalities used in this trial are known to be
        teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
        contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
        entry and for the duration of study

        participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        -Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those whose adverse event
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier have not resolved or stabilized.
             Patients who have been administered ABT-888 as part of a single or combination, Phase
             0 or I study, should not necessarily be excluded from participating in this study
             solely because of receiving prior ABT-888.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ABT-888 or other agents used in study.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy of severity greater than grade 1.

          -  Inability to take oral medications on a continuous basis.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis.

          -  Patients with brain metastasis should have stable disease for at least 4 weeks
             following therapy for brain metastasis (such as surgery, radiotherapy or stereotactic
             radiosurgery).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ABT-888 is PARP inhibitor with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with ABT-888, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with ABT-888. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for PK interactions with ABT-888 as well as possible interactions with
             paclitaxel. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. However, HIV-positive patients without
             an AIDS-defining diagnosis who are not receiving agents with the potential for PK
             interactions with ABT-888 may be eligible.

          -  Patients with both hepatic and renal dysfunction will also be excluded.

          -  Patients who received and progressed on the combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel will
             not be eligible.
