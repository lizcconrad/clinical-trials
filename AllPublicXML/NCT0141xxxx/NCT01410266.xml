    <textblock>
      Medical abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol is a highly effective procedure, but
      access to it may be impeded by the fact that not all women can afford or want to return for a
      follow-up visit. This often results in a high loss to follow-up rate. Additionally, with
      medical abortions of those women who do return for follow-up, higher costs are borne by both
      the woman and the healthcare system.

      This study compares two methods of follow-up after medical abortion: standard of care versus
      alternative follow-up. The former involves a routine clinic visit two weeks after misoprostol
      administration. The latter consists of a low-sensitivity pregnancy test and a
      self-administered questionnaire. Based on the results of the test and questionnaire, women
      may be flagged as needing in-clinic follow-up or discharged from the study if their abortion
      is complete.

    <description>Standard of care includes a routine clinic visit two weeks after misoprostol administration. At the clinic visit, the woman undergoes a bimanual examination. In the event the woman fails to return for the follow-up visit, clinic procedure is followed for contacting her to determine abortion status and the need for further intervention, if any.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>At a clinic visit, before mifepristone administration, the woman completes a semi-quantitative pregnancy test. After mifepristone administration, she is provided with another pregnancy test and a checklist to be self-administered two weeks after she takes misoprostol. On an assigned date, the woman is contacted by phone by the clinic staff and asked to report on the results of both tests. The provider then confirms whether, based on the woman's responses, she should return for a follow-up visit.</description>

  <intervention>

    <intervention_name>Alternative follow-up</intervention_name>
    <description>Alternative follow-up consists of a self-administered semi-quantitative pregnancy test designed to measure urine beta-hCG levels, and a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 7 questions. Results of both are reviewed by the provider to determine if in-clinic follow-up is needed.</description>
