  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is needed to assess the feasibility of integrating this therapy with current
      treatment regimens. If this study shows success a formal phase II test study to conduct
      feasibility will be the next step. The first dose level chosen for this study is 66Gy of
      radiation to the tumor between LET and standard photon therapy. This dose is the current
      standard of care for stage III . If this dose is found to be feasible then the dose of LET
      will escalate to the total dose of 74Gy.

    <description>Concurrent chemo and photon radiation therapy will start within 7 days of completing neutron therapy. There will be a Day 1 of neutron therapy and a Day 1 of concurrent therapy.Photon radiation therapy will begin within 24 hours of the first cycle of chemotherapy and will be delivered 5 days per week, one fraction per day, in 1.8 Gy per fraction. High LET radiotherapy will be delivered in 1 NGy per fraction five days per week. High LET radiotherapy will be delivered first followed by combined chemoradiotherapy.</description>
