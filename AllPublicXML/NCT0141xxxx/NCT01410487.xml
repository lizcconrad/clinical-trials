  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a medical problem of epidemic proportions and is associated with high mortality.
      Obesity has significant effects on the cardiovascular system, producing structural
      cardiovascular changes including myocardial hypertrophy, fatty infiltration, and fibrosis;
      diastolic and systolic dysfunction; changes in pulmonary artery compliance; and increased
      aortic stiffness - all of which can lead to heart failure. Indeed, evidence suggests that
      obesity increases the risk for heart disease independent of other known risk factors such as
      coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea.
      Obesity also causes significant changes in pulmonary function, including a decrease in
      expiratory reserve volume and functional residual capacity and closure of peripheral airways.
      The exact mechanisms for the development of cardiopulmonary disease are not well understood -
      the pathophysiology is complex and likely multifactorial, related to altered hemodynamic
      load, altered metabolic activity, underlying inflammation, and increased cardiac output.

      Newer diagnostic modalities available at our institution such as cardiac MRI and pulmonary
      function tests with impulse oscillometry allow us to better evaluate cardiopulmonary
      dysfunction in patients with severe obesity. Cardiac MRI is especially promising as a
      non-invasive imaging modality in obese individuals, providing more reproducible measurements
      of cardiac and vascular anatomy and function relative to echocardiography. Similarly,
      pulmonary function testing with impulse oscillometry is more sensitive for detection of
      abnormalities in the distal airways especially when spirometry is normal, as frequently
      occurs in the severely obese symptomatic patients. The main objective of the proposed study
      is to evaluate the effect of obesity on quality of life and health care utilization and its
      relationship to cardiopulmonary disease in an ethnically diverse, underserved obese
      population by using state-of-the-art diagnostic modalities before and after significant (20%)
      weight loss.

      The investigators propose to perform stress cardiac MRI and pulmonary function testing with
      oscillometry before and after significant surgical weight loss in 150 severely obese patients
      with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Patients evaluated in the comprehensive Obesity Center at
      Bellevue Hospital who meet NIH Consensus Guidelines for Bariatric Surgery, who have
      cardiopulmonary symptoms, and who meet clinical criteria for cardiac stress testing and
      pulmonary function testing will be approached by the study personnel and offered enrollment.
      Informed consent will be obtained. Enrolled patients will undergo clinical evaluation with a
      detailed medical history including the Borg dyspnea scale, physical examination, laboratory
      testing including cardiopulmonary biomarkers (brain natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein,
      atrial natriuretic peptide), and non-invasive cardiovascular stress MRI and pulmonary
      physiologic evaluation including spirometry, plethysmography and impulse oscillometry (IOS).
      Patients with active smoking history and/or asthma will be identified clinically.

      Cardiovascular MRI will be performed using a 1.5T (Avanto or Espree, Siemens Healthcare)
      system. Standard cardiovascular techniques will be used for the assessment of myocardial and
      vascular structure and function, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, late gadolinium
      enhancement, cine, tagged and phase contrast imaging in selected planes. Adenosine stress MRI
      will be performed for evaluation of underlying coronary artery or microvascular disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligible patients for this study are patients who are booked for bariatric surgery and who
        have cardiopulmonary symptoms that require further cardiopulmonary testing prior to
        bariatric surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with contraindications to MRI examination with gadolinium contrast and adenosine
        administration will be excluded. Additional exclusions include being deemed unable to
        comply with the study protocol (either self-selected or by indicating during screening that
        s/he could not complete all requested tasks), participation in other obesity- or
        diabetes-related clinical trials, or diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction or significant
        psychiatric comorbidity.
