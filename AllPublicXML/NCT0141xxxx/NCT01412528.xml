  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today a variety of diagnostic tools to detect allergenic agents are available such as skin
      tests, provocation tests and blood tests. Due to its high sensitivity and low costs the skin
      prick test is the most commonly used test to identify allergies in patients. By using this
      kind of skin test, up to 25 different agents can be tested in parallel, rendering the skin
      prick test a cheap, easy-to-handle and rapid diagnostic tool. However, as research proceeds,
      new tools appear with the intention to make future applications even more convenient -for
      both, the patient and the physician. For that purpose the development of the so called
      &quot;Easyprick&quot; Allergen Test System is under way, consisting of a foil that carries
      ready-to-use, allergen-soaked sponges which can easily be applied to the skin after pricking.

      Allergen extracts are complex mixtures of proteins and contain varying amounts of allergenic
      and non-allergenic components. In order to control variability and to achieve consistency and
      reproducibility for optimal safety and sensitivity/specificity, it is essential to
      standardize the amount of allergen used in prick tests. The present study aims to standardize
      eight allergen extracts by using this method. Standardized extracts will then be applied in
      the Easyprick Allergen Test System which will be evaluated and compared to the conventional
      prick test in a second study.
