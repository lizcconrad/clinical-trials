  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the mechanisms by which stimulant medications reduce
      symptoms in patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Using Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI), the investigators have found that the volumes of certain brain
      regions are reduced in patients with ADHD. The reduced volumes were much less pronounced if
      patients had been treated with stimulant medications, suggesting that stimulants may reduce
      the symptoms of ADHD by reversing these volume reductions. In a second and related study, the
      investigators found that in patients with ADHD, emotional processing was normalized when
      patients were taking stimulant medications. Both studies point to possible mechanisms by
      which stimulants are effective; however, a significant limitation of these findings is that
      they were derived from cross-sectional studies.

      In this current study, the investigators hope to replicate these treatment effects of
      stimulants in a prospective, controlled manner. The investigators plan to measure ADHD
      symptom severity in patients before and after 12-weeks of controlled treatment with either a
      stimulant medication or placebo while utilizing structural and functional MRI. Combining
      imaging with a randomized controlled trial will allow us to better assess the effects of
      stimulants on brain function and structure.

      A cohort of 100 patients with ADHD will be recruited for a 12 week, double-blind, parallel,
      randomized controlled trial of Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) versus placebo, with 50 patients
      randomized to Lisdexamfetamine and the other 50 patients to placebo. The investigators will
      acquire high-resolution, anatomical and functional MRI images at baseline and after 12 weeks
      of treatment.

      In addition, 75 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects will be imaged at baseline.
