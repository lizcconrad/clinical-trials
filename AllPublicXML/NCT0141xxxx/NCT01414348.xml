      Successful community participation following acquired brain injury (ABI) continues to be an
      elusive goal for patients, clinicians and researchers. Our pilot work shows that community
      dwelling survivors of ABI can significantly improve performance on self-identified real-
      world performance problems and that they can transfer this learning to improve goals not
      trained in the treatment sessions. We will compare two types of rehabilitation intervention
      using a randomized controlled trial. We will also interview survivors, their significant
      others and clinicians regarding their experiences with each intervention to help us discover
      what works best.

      Executive dysfunction is endemic after severe acquired brain injuries (ABIs) and is highly
      associated with long-lasting psychosocial distress, problems in a multiplicity of everyday
      activities and overall reduced quality of life. There is increasing evidence to suggest that
      a novel behavioral intervention is a treatment of choice for executive dysfunction. However
      few studies have addressed ecological relevance: failing to take into account the significant
      impact of the complex settings of real life on executive function. More data are desperately
      needed in this area given the devastating consequences of ABI. We propose to investigate the
      benefits of two community- based interventions.
