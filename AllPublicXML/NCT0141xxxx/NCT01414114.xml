  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of thrice weekly intravenous (IV)
      administration of etelcalcetide in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in
      hemodialysis patients with chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).

    <description>Participants received etelcalcetide three times a week (TIW) administered by intravenous bolus injection at the end of each hemodialysis session for 12 weeks. The starting dose was 5 mg and may have been titrated every 4 weeks based on the preceding serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and corrected calcium (cCa) levels to a maximum dose of 20 mg per hemodialysis session in order to achieve the targeted PTH range while maintaining serum calcium within an acceptable range.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
