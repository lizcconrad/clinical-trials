      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the intrauterine adhesion rate after the application
      of HYALOBARRIER Gel at the end of hysteroscopic myomectomy. Secondary endpoints were
      tolerance and side effect and subsequent fertility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hysteroscopic myomectomy is the referent surgical treatment for submucous myoma. But
      intrauterine adhesion rate was evaluated about 7 to 15% after this procedure. The
      investigators hypothetically believe that application of HYALOBARRIER Gel at the end of the
      procedure, could be reduce the mean intrauterine rate to 50%. Thus, the investigators
      performed a multicenter (n = 20) prospective study non randomized in 220 patients with
      submucous myoma &lt; 3 cm of diameter, evaluated by preoperative ultrasound. The investigators
      prefer this study design, because the principal reason is the number of enrolled patient were
      more 200 patients in each group with a double blind randomized study. Now, in all patients,
      after hysteroscopic myomectomy which performed with a same technique in each center (bipolar
      coagulation and physiologic serum), a diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed at 2 month to
      determinate the existence of intrauterine adhesion. Secondary end points were in this study
      the tolerance and side effects of HYALOBARRIER Gel and the subsequent fertility at 2 years.
