  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the researchers investigated the feasibility of a closed-loop
      electroencephalography (EEG) / transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) system for
      treatment of epilepsy. They looked to see the feasibility of triggering tDCS stimulation
      within 10 seconds of a detected EEG partial-onset seizure, and also a proof-of-principle
      determination of whether tDCS applied during this vulnerable period may be feasible to
      prevent the oncoming seizure.

      This study required 5 visits over the course of approximately 8 weeks. Each visit was
      separated by at least 2 weeks. Two of the visits had 24-hour EEG monitoring sessions. During
      these two sessions, the EEG and tDCS were hooked into a closed loop system, such that when
      seizure activity wasdetected, the tDCS was triggered to deliver stimulation. Subjects
      received active stimulation or sham stimulation sessions during the first 24-hour visit, and
      the opposite during the second. The subjects were randomized and counterbalanced.

      We have also added a healthy subjects cohort to assess the feasibility of the closed loop
      system. In order to test the proof-of-concept of this system, the experiment will focus on
      detecting and acting upon alpha- and beta-band changes traced in the EEG activity that is
      being recorded, and provide tDCS stimulation based upon those changes. We will enroll 6
      subjects who will have 2 visits each. During these two visits subjects will be randomized to
      active or sham stimulation sessions and receive the opposite during their second visit.

    <description>Measurement of seizure activity will take place in two visits of 24-hour seizure monitoring. During these visits, the EEG will record seizure information including (1) number of seizures, (2) severity of seizures, and (3) latency of seizures between sessions of stimulation.</description>

    <description>Subject will keep a diary to monitor baseline seizure activity between study visits. This will be measured daily for the 8 weeks the subject will participate.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of healthy subjects EEG changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare changes in EEG from before stimulation to after stimulation in a healthy cohort. We will test the system to trigger in healthy subjects when there is an increase of beta frequency power and decrease of alpha frequency power. We will also assess whether the tDCS stimulation will return the background EEG rhythm toward a baseline pattern (increasing alpha, decreasing beta)</description>

    <description>For both active and sham tDCS, the device will be hooked up to the closed loop system, using electrodes of 35cm^2. During active tDCS, the subject will receive 2mA for 5 min. During sham tDCS, the current will only be active for 30 seconds (current ramping up and then down) to simulate the sensations of active tDCS.
The subject will undergo either active or sham stimulation for their first 24-hour EEG monitoring visit, and the opposite intervention on the second 24-hour EEG monitoring visit.</description>
