    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to explore whether human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) implantation
      could prevent infraauricular depressed deformities and Frey's syndrome following total
      parotidectomy.

      Seventy patients who underwent total parotidectomy were selected for inclusion in the study.
      We analyzed 41 cases of total parotidectomy (control group) and 29 cases of simultaneous ADM
      implantation following total parotidectomy (ADM group) for infraauricular depressed
      deformities and the presence of gustatory flushing or sweating. The follow-up periods ranged
      from 6 months to 7 years.

      The Results showed facial contours and bilateral symmetry improved after surgery in the ADM
      group. In the control group, an infraauricular depressed deformity was evident in all 41
      cases. Frey's syndrome was recorded in one patient (3.4%) from the ADM group and 14 patients
      (34.1%) from the control group. No cases of immune rejection, infection, hematoma, or
      salivary fistula were observed in either group.
