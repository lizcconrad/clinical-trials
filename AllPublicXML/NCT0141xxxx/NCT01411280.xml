  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether methylphenidate is effective in enhancing the
      cognitive performance of children with the HbSS or HbSC genotype of SCD who have sustained
      neurological complications on laboratory-based measures of sustained attention, reaction
      time, and executive functions, and indirectly, verbal short-term and long-term memory.

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders, affecting an estimated
      1 in 400 African American newborns annually. The pathophysiology of this group of disorders
      involves the production of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), which causes red blood cells to assume
      a rigid, sickled shape upon release of oxygen, thereby reducing their viability in
      circulation. Consequently, chronic anemia and system-wide ischemia result in acute painful
      episodes, organ system failure, and neurological complications. Among the most debilitating
      effects of SCD are neurological complications. Despite the mounting evidence for structural
      and functional involvement of the frontal systems in pediatric SCD, there have been no
      clinical trials designed to manage the cognitive and behavioral sequelae associated with
      pediatric SCD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed Consent can be obtained from parent or care-giver and Assent can be obtained
             from the child

          -  Children with sickle cell disease (HbSS or HbSC)
