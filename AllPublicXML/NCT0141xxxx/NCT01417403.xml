    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of hydroxychloroquine in treating
      patients with solid tumors undergoing radiation therapy for bone metastases. Drugs, such as
      hydroxychloroquine, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxychloroquine that can safely be
      administered to cancer patients in association with radiation prior to developing this
      approach for disease treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Beginning 3 days before the initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive hydroxychloroquine
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). Treatment continues until completion of
      radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.

  <why_stopped>
    Recently published data that has shown HCQ to be safe when combined with chemo and or radiation
    at even higher doses than what is used in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor with radiographic evidence
             of bony metastatic disease and symptoms requiring palliative radiotherapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 weeks

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT])
             =&lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with calculated creatinine levels above institutional
             normal limits

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those
             who have not recovered from acute adverse events due to agents administered more than
             4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not have received prior radiotherapy to the intended site

          -  Patients who have not recovered from acute adverse events due to previous radiotherapy

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients who are neurologically unstable due to uncontrolled brain metastases are
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events. - - History of allergic reactions attributed to
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to hydroxychloroquine

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients who are pregnant or may become pregnant during treatment

          -  Patients with severe psoriasis who may experience a flare of disease with
             hydroxychloroquine use

          -  Patients with known liver dysfunction (elevated transaminases or abnormal coagulation
             studies); patients with metastatic disease to the liver with normal liver function
             studies may be enrolled

          -  Patients with retinopathy
