      This is a phase I study of the investigational drug AC220 combined with cytarabine and
      etoposide in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous
      leukemia (AML).

      This is a study for patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML). Some people diagnosed with leukemia have changes in a receptor
      located on the surface of white blood cells called FLT3. This is known as a FLT3 mutation.
      FLT3 plays an important role in the way cells grow and divide. In normal cells, the FLT3
      receptor is switched off most of the time and only switches on when it gets a chemical signal
      from outside. But cells with the FLT3 mutation have the grow signal permanently switched on.
      This means leukemia cells with the FLT3 mutation are growing and dividing all the time.
      Doctors have found that people with leukemia cells that carry FLT3 mutations are less likely
      to go into remission with chemotherapy and have a higher risk of the leukemia coming back
      after treatment.

      This is a study of an investigational drug called AC220. AC220 is considered investigational
      because it has not been approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA). AC220 is a drug which is able to &quot;turn off&quot; the FLT3 grow signal. AC220 will be given
      with cytarabine and etoposide to treat the relapsed leukemia. This is a phase I study, which
      means that the study is being done to find the highest dose of AC220 that can be given safely
      with the drugs cytarabine and etoposide to children and young adults.
