      Background: A novel milk peptide has been shown in laboratory setting to have natural
      anti-cancer properties and extend lifespan and improve metabolism in animal models. The
      purpose of this study was 1.) to determine the safety dosage range and, 2.) to determine
      whether this novel milk peptide positively influence blood markers, metabolism and improve
      quality of life.

      The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in a
      university research setting. Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to ingest in a
      double-blind and randomized manner either a placebo or milk peptides. Outcome measures were
      assessed at 0, 3, and 6 weeks of supplementation.

    <description>Participants ingested 6ml - 21ml (based on participants' weight) of clear, sugar-less liquid placebo mixed with 1/2 cup milk twice daily (once immediately after breakfast and once immediately after dinner). The supplements were prepared in liquid form and packaged in generic bottles for double blind administration. The placebo was a glycerol-based placebo matched for color, texture, and taste to the active supplement.</description>
