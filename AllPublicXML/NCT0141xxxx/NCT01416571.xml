        <title>Number of Subjects With Normal and Abnormal Biochemical and Haematological Parameters.</title>
        <description>Assessed biochemical and haematological parameters were alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), basophils (BAS), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CREA), eosinophils (EOS), haematocrit (HCRIT), haemoglobin (HBIN), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON), neutrophils (NEU), platelets (PLA), red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), total bilirubin (Total BIL), bilirubin conjugated/direct (BIL con/dir). Per parameter, it was assessed whether subjects had laboratory values unknown, below, within or above the normal ranges. This outcome presents Total BIL, BIL con/dir, CREA and BUN results.</description>
        <time_frame>At Day 0 and Day 42</time_frame>
