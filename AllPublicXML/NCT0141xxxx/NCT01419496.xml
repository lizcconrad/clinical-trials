      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about cancer and development of drug resistance in patients.

      PURPOSE: This research trial is studying proteins that may promote chemotherapy resistance in
      samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Investigate whether changes in prosurvival signaling occur by comparing activation of
           the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) and Stat5 pathways in
           paired diagnostic and relapse samples.

        -  Investigate changes in leukemia cell responses to extrinsic cues from the environment
           change, using a bone marrow stromal-cell co-culture model of chemotherapy resistance.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved samples are analyzed for Stat3 and Stat5 expression by flow cytometry
      and in vitro chemotherapy sensitivity.
