      Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) and Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) can be
      diagnosed noninvasively by Exercise Echocardiography (ExE) and Cardiopulmonary Exercise
      Testing (CPX) as compared with gold standard invasive hemodynamic assessment.

      -  The broad objective of this proposal is to characterize the dynamic changes in
           cardiopulmonary mechanics during stress in patients with exertional dyspnea,
           establishing a comprehensive multimodality diagnostic approach to the evaluation of
           exercise intolerance.

        -  The specific objective is to prospectively compare established and novel parameters
           derived from echocardiography and CPX with simultaneous, gold standard invasive measures
           of cardiovascular hemodynamics at rest and with exercise stress to define the role of
           noninvasive testing in the diagnostic workup.

        -  The primary hypothesis is that combined ExE and CPX can noninvasively identify HFpEF.
