  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of patients with recurring Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) after stem cell transplantation
      failure represents a typical unmet medical need prompting active development and validation
      of new agents and treatment strategies. The LEBEN protocol combines two agents, lenalidomide
      and bendamustine, framing different targets on both tumor and microenvironmental cells of HL.
      These agents, while showing a low risk of overlapping extrahematologic toxicities, may hit
      the proliferation machinery of H-RS cells and/or their progenitors, synergistically inhibit
      tumor-related angiogenesis and interfere on cytokine-mediate circuitries operating in the
      microenvironment to support tumor cell survival.

      A weekly schedule of bendamustine, at 60 mg/m2, is combined with the continuous
      administration of increasing dose of lenalidomide (10, 15, 20 e 25 mg dose levels in a 28-day
      cycle). Such schedule of Bendamustine is aimed at enhancing the antiangiogenic and
      immunomodulatory activity of continuous Lenalidomide, as studies have shown that low and
      protracted doses of alkylators induce a decrease in microvascular density of tumor tissues
      and inhibit mobilization and viability of circulating endothelial progenitors.

      The Bayesian phase 1/2 dose finding method of Thall and Cook was employed. This method
      chooses doses based-on both response and toxicity, and accounts for the trade-off between
      these two outcomes.

    <description>According to the Bayesian phase I/II dose finding method of Thall and Cook,a target efficacy-toxicity trade-off contour has been constructed by fitting a curve to target values of pE (probability ofEfficacy) and pT (probability of Toxicity) of 0.30 and 0.40, respectively and probability cut-offs pE (for Efficacy)and pT (for Toxicity) set at 0.10 and 0.10,respectively.The area underneath the target contour has desirable πE, πT pairs. Up to 36 patients can be treated in cohorts of size 3. The 'best' dose is defined as that giving the largest response-toxicity trade-off.</description>
