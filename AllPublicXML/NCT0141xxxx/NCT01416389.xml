    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of LY2523355 relative to
      ixabepilone for the treatment of metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer using change
      in tumor size as a continuous measure of response.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tumor Size (CTS) From Baseline to the End of Cycle 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of Cycle 2 (Day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>The log ratio of tumor size at Cycle 2 to tumor size at baseline is calculated for each participant, where the tumor size is the sum of the target lesion measurements at each assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Response (Overall Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease or date of death from any cause (up to 423 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate is the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) guidelines. CR is a disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with measurable disease, multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease or date of death from any cause (up to 423 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from the date of randomization to the first date of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) guidelines, and is defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition, the sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) (the appearance of 1 or more new lesions was considered progression). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on the observed distribution of PFS. Participants were censored from analysis for the following reasons: lack of disease assessment, lost to follow-up, and further anticancer therapy started. Median PFS is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Clinical Benefit (Clinical Benefit Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease or date of death from any cause (up to 423 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate is the proportion of participants who achieve a best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) guidelines. CR is a disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.
Clinical benefit rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR, PR, or SD divided by the total number of participants with measurable disease, multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LY2523355</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1: Day 1 and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is the maximum plasma concentration of LY2523355 after a 1-hour intravenous infusion of LY2523355 on Day 1 and Day 3 of Cycle 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LSN2546307</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1: Day 1 and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is the maximum plasma concentration of LSN2546307 (metabolite) after a 1-hour intravenous infusion of LY2523355 on Day 1 and Day 3 of Cycle 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics, Intracycle Accumulation Ration (Ra) of LY2523355</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1: Day 1 and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The intracycle accumulation ratio (Ra) is defined as the LY2523355 Cmax on Day 3 of Cycle 1 to the LY2523355 Cmax on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after a 1-hour intravenous infusion of LY2523355 on Day 1 and Day 3 of Cycle 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Deaths on Study Through the Follow-up Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through end of treatment follow-up (up to 423 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who died through the follow-up period of the study; the cause of death was not captured.
A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

          <description>LY2523355 administered intravenously as a 1-hour infusion on Days 1, 2, and 3 of a 21-day Cycle for 2 Cycles. Dosage determined by calculating participant's body surface area (5 milligrams per meter squared per day [mg/m^2/day]). One participant was mistakenly dosed with 6 mg/m^2/day in Cycle 1 and for 2 doses in Cycle 2. The dose was subsequently corrected and the participant is included in this analysis.
Pegfilgrastim or filgrastim administered intravenously on Day 4 of 21-day Cycle for 2 Cycles. Dosage is determined by standard of care.
If at the end of 2 Cycles the participant was receiving benefit, the participant may have remained on study drug for additional cycles until a criterion for study discontinuation was met.</description>

        <description>Overall response rate is the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) guidelines. CR is a disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with measurable disease, multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from the date of randomization to the first date of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) guidelines, and is defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition, the sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) (the appearance of 1 or more new lesions was considered progression). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on the observed distribution of PFS. Participants were censored from analysis for the following reasons: lack of disease assessment, lost to follow-up, and further anticancer therapy started. Median PFS is presented.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Clinical Benefit (Clinical Benefit Rate)</title>
        <description>Clinical benefit rate is the proportion of participants who achieve a best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) guidelines. CR is a disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.
Clinical benefit rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR, PR, or SD divided by the total number of participants with measurable disease, multiplied by 100.</description>
