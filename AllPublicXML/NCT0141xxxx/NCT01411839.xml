  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current HIV treatment adherence project was designed to adapt culturally and then pilot
      test an empirically supported cognitive-behavioral therapy program for adherence and symptoms
      of depression (CBT-AD)with HIV+ Latinos living on the U.S.-Mexico Border.

      Additionally, the investigators will assess the feasibility and efficacy of a novel
      medication monitoring and reminder system (MedSignalsÂ®) in the form of an electronic pillbox
      with monitoring and reminding functions that is available in a Spanish-language version. Our
      hypotheses are grounded in a conceptual model proposing that the CBT-AD intervention will
      improve problem-solving ability and decrease depressive symptomatology, which will directly
      improve biomedical outcomes of HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 as well as indirectly improve
      biomedical outcomes through increased motivation, improved memory, and better medication
      adherence. Evaluating and implementing generalizable and sustainable mental health and
      adherence interventions such as the ones proposed are urgently needed in the region to
      improve HIV treatment outcomes and thwart the development and transmission of drug resistant
      virus.

    <measure>Depression From (1) Clinician-Administered MADRS Measure, and (2) Participant Self-Report Ratings With BDI-1a</measure>
    <time_frame>MADRS and BDI-1a scores at 6 and 9-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician-administered ratings are scored on the MADRS. The MADRS is a 10-item, past 7-day clinician administered scripted rating scale of depressive symptoms (each of the ten items is scored from 0-6, with total scores ranging from 0 to 60). The areas are: apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep/appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. Higher scores indicate the presence of more depressive symptoms.
Participant self-report ratings are scored on the BDI-1a. The BDI-1a is assessed at each time point using the revised Beck Depression Inventory-Ia (BDI-Ia), which consists of 21 items, each with a 4-point response scale anchored with descriptive statements. Scores can range from 0-63, and scores of 10 or higher are presumptive of mild depressive severity. The BDI scores presented were added up and higher scores indicate worse depression. The MADRS and BDI-Ia is scored a total units on the scale.</description>

    <measure>Self-Report Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Self-reported adherence at 6 and 9-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported adherence was assessed with the visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a 10cm line that is shown to patients who then mark on the line (from 0 to 100% in 1cm intervals) how much medication they have taken. Higher scores indicate better adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MedSignals Electronic Pill-box for Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 9 month follow-up adherence scores</time_frame>
    <description>The MedSignals electronic pill-box is a storage bin that allows participants to store medications. In the treatment condition, the pill-box provides audio commands to alarm participants that it is time to take their medication. The pill-box stores adherence data (time, number of openings). In the control condition, the pill-box does not alarm participants but serves in the same capacity otherwise. All data is uploaded electronically. Higher numbers indicate better adherence that correspond to pill-box openings corresponding to the designated time of taking their medication.</description>

The MADRS is a 10-item, past 7-day clinician administered scripted rating scale of depressive symptoms (each of the ten items is scored from 0-6, with total scores ranging from 0 to 60). The areas are: apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep/appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. Higher scores indicate the presence of more depressive symptoms.
Participant self-report ratings are scored on the BDI-1a. The BDI-1a is assessed at each time point using the revised Beck Depression Inventory-Ia (BDI-Ia), which consists of 21 items, each with a 4-point response scale anchored with descriptive statements. Scores can range from 0-63, and scores of 10 or higher are presumptive of mild depressive severity. The BDI scores presented were added up and higher scores indicate worse depression. The MADRS and BDI-Ia is scored a total units on the scale.</description>
