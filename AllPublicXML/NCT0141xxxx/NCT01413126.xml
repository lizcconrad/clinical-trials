  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nut consumption is associated with reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was
      to assess the effects of peanut (whole or peanut butter) to breakfast meals on glycemic,
      insulinemic and selected gut hormone responses, appetite, and food intake over two
      consecutive meals in obese women with high Type 2 diabetes risk. Fifteen women participated
      in a randomized crossover trial where 42.5g of whole peanuts (P), peanut butter (PB), or no
      peanuts (control-C) were added to a 75g available carbohydrate-matched breakfast meal.
      Postprandial concentrations of blood glucose, insulin, non-esterified free fatty acids
      (NEFA), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), appetitive
      sensations and food intake were assessed after breakfast treatments and a standard lunch (75g
      available carbohydrate).
