      Soymilk components such as isoflavones, essential fatty acids, phytoesterols, good fats,
      inositols might have beneficial effects on controlling complication among diabetic
      nephropathy patients(DN).Most studies in this regard have been examined the effect of soy
      consumption on cardiorenal risk factors among patients with DN and there are few data about
      relationship of soy milk consumption and health effect in patients with DN . Therefore, we
      evaluated the effects of soy milk compared to cow's milk on blood pressure, inflammation,
      oxidative stress and fibrinolytic markers and cardiorenal risk factors among these patients.
      This was a cross-over randomized clinical trial which was conducted in Isfahan among diabetic
      nephropathy patients. Patients were randomly assigned to consume a diet containing cow's milk
      or a diet in which only one glass of soy milk was substituted; each one for 4 weeks.
