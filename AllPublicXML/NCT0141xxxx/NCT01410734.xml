  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging Vision System provides
      real-time endoscopic near infrared fluorescence imaging of the biliary anatomy as defined as
      identifying biliary vessels; either cystic duct, common hepatic duct (CHD) or common bile
      duct (CBD). Irradiation given to the patient during a classic cholangiography can be reduced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40 patients will be prospectively enrolled in this multi-centre (up to 5 centres)
      single arm study. After given consent, patients will undergo minimally invasive
      cholecystectomy with da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging using Indocynine green (ICG) and near
      infra-red light (NIR) to identify the surgically relevant anatomy of the biliary tree during
      this procedure.

      Efficacy endpoints The efficacy of the da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging Vision System to
      identify biliary anatomy will be demonstrated by successful detection (90%) of one or more of
      the following biliary vessels: Cystic duct, common hepatic duct (CHD) or common bile duct
      (CBD).

      Safety endpoints To observe and report peri-operative safety outcomes, including but not
      limited to incidence of adverse events and allergic reactions (rare according to the current
      knowledge and applications). Safety endpoints will be met by affirming the safety profile of
      the procedure, compared to currently available literature.
