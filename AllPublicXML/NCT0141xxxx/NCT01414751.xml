  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have explored how specific formats of effectiveness information effect on real
      patients' decisions. We only know little about what kind of format would be the optimal to
      help patients make well-informed real-life decisions corresponding to their preferences.

      The trial is developed in a clinical randomised design to study risk communication in the
      shared decision making between general practitioners (GP) and their patients in primary
      prevention with of cholesterol lowering drug. Endpoints are effect of GPs' information about
      treatment effectiveness and their patients' values on patients' tendency to accept and adhere
      to the treatment as well as their feeling of content with the choice made. GPs are randomised
      to inform about risk and treatment effectiveness by means of either absolute risk reduction
      (ARR) or Prolongation of Life (POL). Afterwards patients are invited to answer questionnaires
      concerning their content with decisions and reflections. Patients' redemption of
      prescriptions during the following week and the first year are recorded through an electronic
      database.

      57 GPs and 248 patients have been enrolled in the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As chronic diseases are steadily increasing in the industrialized countries, there is a
      growing focus on preventive initiatives. This means that risk communication between the
      physician and his patients plays a central role.

      Effective risk communication can enhance knowledge, involvement in decisions about tests or
      treatment, autonomy and empowerment of patients. Poor communication, however, can lead to
      anxiety, lack of confidence in health care professionals, and other adverse outcomes. It is
      vital that we identify the available evidence about how it should best be done.

      The standard formats used to communicate intervention effectiveness are absolute risk
      reduction, relative risk reduction, number needed to treat, and life prolongation of life.

      Few studies have explored the formats' influence on real patient decisions, implying that we
      only know little about what kind of format would be the optimal to help patients make
      well-informed real-life decisions corresponding to their preferences.

      In a clinical randomized design risk communication is studied in the preventive talk between
      the general practitioner (GP) and his patients concerning cardiovascular diseases. Special
      focus is on influence of information format on patients' choice of therapy, adherence to
      therapy and satisfaction with therapy.

      GPs are randomized to one of two groups, being taught in informing their patients by means of
      either absolute risk reduction, ARR or life extension, LE.

      The setting is the preventive talk in the GP's clinic. From a measured total-cholesterol the
      GP informs his patient about the individual risk of getting a cardiovascular disease and the
      possible effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering drug. This is done by means of either ARR or
      LE. After the talk the patient is invited to answer a questionnaire concerning personal
      experience with the information given (deadline 2 weeks after the talk), and again after 3
      months will receive a questionnaire concerning satisfaction with the decision made and
      reflections. Patients' redemption of prescriptions during the following week and the first
      year are recorded through Odense PharmacoEpidemiological Database, OPED. The GPs' opinions,
      experiences and concerns about risk communication, prevention, and usage of statins are
      explored by means of questionnaires.

    <description>After receiving information about effectiveness of a possible therapy, patients fill in a validated questionnaire (&quot;COMRADE&quot;) concerning confidence and satisfaction with the information given. The questionnaire is handed out immediately after information has been given (deadline for answering being two weeks after receiving the effectuveness information), and again after three months to detect adherence with the decision made.</description>

    <description>After patients have received the effectiveness information the secondary study focus will be on tendency to accept the offered therapy according to information format given. This will be studied by means of patients' redemptions of prescriptions, recorded through a pharmacoepidemilogical database, as well as background information about the patients.</description>
