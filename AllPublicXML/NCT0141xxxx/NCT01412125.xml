  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative
      disorder typically becoming noticeable in middle age. It is clinically characterized by
      progressive involuntary movements (bradykinesia and hyperkinesia), neuropsychiatric
      disturbances (depression, irritability), and cognitive impairments progressing to dementia.

      The striatum (caudate and putamen) is the primary area of neuronal degeneration in HD. Today,
      there is no validated curative treatment. HD affects approximately 6 000 patients in France
      and more than 30 000 individuals are considered at risk for this disease.

      While the disease gene is discovered and we are capable to do a predictive genetic diagnosis
      for asymptomatic patients, there is no clinical or biological way to predict the age of onset
      or the progressive profile of patients.

      One of the fundamental characteristics of this disease is its extreme variability from one
      patient to other both in terms of their evolution and their onset of action. Thus, this
      inter-individual variability severely limits the genetic counselling and complicating the
      neurological assessment.

      Increasingly, it has been assumed that modifier genes may be the source of this
      inter-individual variability and that their identification could help the understanding and
      prediction of disease progression.

      Given that the mutant protein is ubiquitous, the molecular dysfunction of neurons could be
      found in peripheral cells from the bloodstream and will be more accessible to investigation.

      In this context, we propose to focus our research not only on biological and genetic markers
      but also on neuroimaging and neuropsychological markers using paradigms of time reactions or
      measurement of evoked potentials. We hope to identify sensitive markers of the degenerative
      process of Huntington's disease even when patients carrying the gene may or may not have
      reported the disease.

      The project is centered on 2 axes:

        1. identification of the genetic polymorphism which may explain the phenotypic variability
           seeing in Huntington's disease

        2. identification of biological, genetic and imaging biomarkers that could be used as
           predictors of clinical progression of Huntington's disease This research is based on the
           existence of a well followed and well characterized cohort of patients through the
           Francophone Huntington Network (&quot;RESEAU HUNTINGTON de LANGUE FRANCAISE&quot;, RHLF).
           Therefore, this will help to combine the clinical and biological expertise of RHLF.
