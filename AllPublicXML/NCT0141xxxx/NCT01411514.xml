  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of MS-patients requires treatment with immune-modifying or immune-suppressive
      agents to prevent new relapses and progression of disability. Several studies have evaluated
      the effect of steroid treatment on clinical recovery after an acute relapse. An important
      unanswered clinical question is, whether or not an oral tapering dose of corticosteroids
      offers any additional advantage over intravenous methylprednisolone alone in improving
      neurologic recovery as well as safety and tolerability after a relapse.

      This study aims to compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of tapering doses of oral
      prednisone and placebo after short-term high-dose i.v. methylprednisolone on the recovery
      from an acute relapse in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS),
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) and primary (PP-MS) or secondary progressive
      multiple sclerosis (SP-MS) with superimposed relapses.

      Patients will be treated during 25 days with de-escaling doses of prednisone or placebo.

      The primary analysis will test whether placebo is equivalent to oral prednisone taper on the
      recovery status as measured by EDSS change from baseline to 3 months after baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, prospective, parallel
      group, single centre study is to evaluate the effect of tapering oral doses of prednisone or
      placebo taken during 25 days following short-term high-dose i.v. methylprednisolone on the
      outcome of a relapse in patients with CIS; RR-MS, PP-MS or SP-MS with superimposed relapses.
      The primary objective is to assess and compare the recovery status in both patient groups 3
      months after baseline by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Secondary
      objectives are the assessments of clinical parameters at the end of oral treatment, 6, 9
      months after baseline, of MRI markers, of mental and cognitive status, quality of life and
      fatigue at the end of oral treatment, 3 and 6 months after baseline in both patient groups.

      After standard treatment of an acute clinical relapse with high dose, short term i.v.
      methyprednisolone patients will be randomised to one of the two treatment arms. Patients
      allocated to prednisone will be treated with tapering oral doses during 25 days. The initial
      dose of 60 mg will be reduced twice by 20 mg, than by 10 and 5 mg. Each dose regimen will be
      taken during 5±2 days. Patients randomised to placebo will receive placebo treatment during
      25 days.
