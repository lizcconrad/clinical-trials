  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced adrenal insufficiency is a serious adverse effect
      of GC treatment. It is today not possible to predict this adverse effect. The project aims at
      investigating a possible individual aspect, which may render subjects more or less sensitive
      to glucocorticoids, and thereby influence development of GC induced adrenal insufficiency.
      The hypothesis is that subjects with one or another of the polymorphisms in the GC receptor
      gene will either have increased or diminished GC sensitivity. This may be responsible for
      differences in development of GC induced adrenal insufficiency.

      Blood is sampled from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria and patients are genotyped for the SNPs N363S, BclI, ER22/23EK and 9β and grouped
      according to haplotypes. SNPs will be determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients
      will be included for a Synacthen test, to evaluate their adrenal function. Information from
      the results of the study will be able to assist clinicians to identify patients at risk and
      thus individualize GC therapy in a tailored fashion. Results of the study will be important
      for all patient groups worldwide on GC therapy.

    <description>Patients with RA treated with prednisolone, minimum 5 mg/day for minimum 6 months. Patients are grouped according to haplotype of 4 SNPs of the glucocorticoid recepror gene. Patients with or without these polymorphisms were invited to a Synacthen® test, but patients with a mixed hetero- and homozygote genotype were not. Adrenal function is evaluated with a Synacthen test.</description>
