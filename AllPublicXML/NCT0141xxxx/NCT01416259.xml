  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I study will be performed in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design in
      healthy male and female subjects. The central ECG laboratory will be blinded to treatment.
      Every effort will be made to enroll equal numbers of males and females into the study.

      Eligible subjects will participate in a screening phase (within 28 days of the dosing day), a
      treatment phase and a final visit, which will be conducted on discharge from the study. Study
      duration will be 32 days with a total of approximately 12 days of confinement. During the
      resting ECG periods, 12-lead digital ECGs will be extracted from continuous telemetry at
      selected time points to assess potential ECG effects. Blood samples for PK evaluation will be
      collected in conjunction with the ECG time points.
