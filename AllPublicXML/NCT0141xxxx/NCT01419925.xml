  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Multimeric-001&quot; (M-001) has been recently developed, containing conserved, common linear
      influenza epitopes that activate both cellular and humoral arms of the immune system against
      a wide variety of influenza A and B strains. Apart from its direct action, M-001 is an
      attractive candidate for priming immune responses to seasonal influenza vaccine in the
      elderly population. The current clinical study was designed to assess M-001's standalone and
      priming action in subjects over 65 years old.

      This is a second Phase II study comprising 120 participants. Eligible subjects were
      randomized to receive to receive either two sequential non-adjuvanted or a single
      non-adjuvanted or a single adjuvanted intramuscular injection of 500 mcg M-001 (treatment),
      or one placebo (saline) injection, before receiving the TIV.

      This was a two-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study. 120 subjects were randomized
      1:1:1:1 into four groups to receive either two sequential non-adjuvanted or a single
      non-adjuvanted or a single adjuvanted intramuscular injection of 500 mcg M-001 (treatment),
      or one placebo (saline) injection, before receiving the TIV. Due to visual differences
      between placebo and treatment the study was partially blinded. Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI)
      was evaluated at baseline and 3 weeks after standard trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
      (TIV) vaccination as a measure of M-001's efficacy. Cell mediated immune (CMI) responses were
      also evaluated in some of the subjects who received non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted M-001
      vaccinations. The subjects were monitored for safety throughout the study.

    <time_frame>21 days after boost immunization with TIV</time_frame>
    <description>Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) test for anti influenza antibodies to TIV strains revealed an elevated proportion of participants achieving seroconversion in the groups primed with M-001 and boosted with TIV, as compared to participants given TIV alone. The viruses contained in the TIV were A/California/7/09, A/Perth/16/09 or B/Brisbane/60/08 . Enhanced Seroconversion and GMT post immunization were found in the experimental group primed with either adjuvanted or non adjuvanted M-001. Note that the superior HAI responses were demonstrated for both seasonal (H3N2 and B strain) and pandemic strains (swine H1N1 strain that is contained in the TIV).</description>

    <measure>Cellular immunity</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days after M-001 immunization</time_frame>
    <description>Intracellular staining followed by FACS analysis of CD4/CD8 lymphocytes secreting IFN gamma showed elevated proportions of CD4+ cells secreting IFN gamma following exposure of PBMC from subjects immunized with M-001 to influenza antigens and to M-001. Note that the test was performed before boosting with TIV and hence demonstrates the cross immunity offered by immunization with M-001 alone and suggests a CD4+ mediated mechanism of action for M-001 as a universal primer.</description>
