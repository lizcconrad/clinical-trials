      A randomised controlled trial in which study group will be given estrogen derivative before
      ovarian stimulation in GnRH antagonist protocol and compared to the classical GnRH agonist
      protocol.Estrogen will be given P.O , &quot;PROGYNOVA' , in a dose of 2 mg /d, starting day 2 of
      menses and until first Monday to follow. Main outcome measure will be ability to control the
      ovum pickup day, calculated as a rate of ideal pickups divided by the entire pickup number.
      All women enrolled will be under 38 years of age, with a clear indication for IVF other than
      ovulatory dysfunction. women with past 4 treatment failures will be excluded as well as cases
      in which sperm achieved in surgical methods.
