      -  The primary objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of
           alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 4000 L scale in patients who have a confirmed
           diagnosis of Pompe disease.

        -  A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate and explore the relationship between
           anti-rhGAA antibody titers and the pharmacokinetics of alglucosidase alfa.

      The total study duration per patient will be 4 to 9 weeks that consist of a screening period
      (from 2 days to 4 weeks), treatment visit (1 day), and a follow up call (â‰¥30 days).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for this study:

          -  The patient and/or the patient's parent/legal guardian is willing and able to provide
             signed informed consent.

          -  The patient has a confirmed GAA enzyme deficiency from skin, blood, or muscle tissue
             and/or 2 confirmed GAA gene mutations.

          -  Infant and toddler Pompe disease patients can be included in the study only under
             condition (minimal body weight) that the trial-related blood loss (including any
             losses in the maneuver) will not exceed 3 percent of the total blood volume during a
             period of 4 weeks and will not exceed 1 percent at any single time.

          -  The patient, if female and of childbearing potential, must have a negative pregnancy
             test (urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) at screening. Note: All female patients
             of childbearing potential and sexually mature males must agree to use a medically
             accepted method of contraception throughout the study.

          -  For patients previously treated with alglucosidase alfa the patient has received
             alglucosidase alfa for at least 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          -  The patient is participating in another clinical study using an investigational
             product.

          -  The patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable to adhere to the
             requirements of the study.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
