  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SRT2379 is a potent small molecule activator of SIRT1 that has been found to inhibit systemic
      inflammation induced by intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. The
      objective of this study is to determine the effect of a single administration of SRT2379, at
      multiple-dose levels, on the inflammatory response to low dose endotoxin.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination (PE) and laboratory tests
             carried out within 21 days prior to Day 1. A subject with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may
             be included only if the Investigator and the Medical Monitor agree that the finding is
             unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures

          -  Male between 18 and 35 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent and able to comply with the requirements
             and restrictions listed in the informed consent form

             - Chemistry panel, including renal and liver function tests, without any clinically
             relevant abnormality as judged by the Investigator

          -  Subjects must agree to use double-barrier birth control or abstinence while
             participating in the study and for 7 days following the last dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had a major illness in the past 3 months or any significant chronic
             medical illness that the Investigator would deem unfavourable for enrolment, including
             inflammatory diseases

          -  Subjects with a history of any type of malignancy with the exception of successfully
             treated basal cell cancer of the skin

          -  Subject has a past or current gastrointestinal disease which may influence drug
             absorption

          -  The subject has a known positive test for hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface
             antigen or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody 1 or 2

               -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary
                  abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic
                  gallstones)

               -  Subject has a history, within 3 years, of drug abuse (including benzodiazepines,
                  opioids, amphetamine, cocaine, THC, methamphetamine) or a positive drug result at
                  the Screening visit

               -  History of alcoholism and/or is drinking more than 3 units of alcohol per day.
                  Alcoholism is defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males. One
                  unit is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 mL) of beer, 1 glass (125
                  mL) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits

               -  The subject has received an investigational product within three months of the
                  first dosing day in the current study; Note: any subject who has participated in
                  a prior human endotoxemia study with SRT2379 or SRT2104 would be excluded from
                  participation in this trial.

               -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs and herbal and dietary supplements
                  within 7 days unless in the opinion of the Investigator the medication will not
                  interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety

               -  Subject has difficulty donating blood or limited accessibility of a vein in left
                  and right arm

          -  Subject has donated more than 350 mL of blood in last 3 months

          -  Subject uses tobacco products

               -  Any clinically relevant abnormality noted on the 12-lead ECG as judged by the
                  Investigator or an average QTcB or QTcF &gt; 450 msec

               -  Any other issue that, in the opinion of the Investigator , could be harmful to
                  the subject or compromise interpretation of the data

          -  Prior participation in a trial where the subject received intravenous endotoxin (LPS)
             infusion
