  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening relies on early identification and removal of
      both polypoid and non-polypoid lesions with neoplastic potential. The investigators
      hypothesize that an intensive training program designed to enhance both recognition and
      classification of lesions with neoplastic potential, will result in an increase in
      non-polypoid adenoma detection in addition to and independent of an increase in overall
      adenoma detection rates.

      Our Endoscopic Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP) was a prospective educational intervention
      with our staff endoscopist as our study population. The investigators measured adenoma
      detection rates for a baseline period then randomly assigned half of the endoscopists to
      undergo EQUIP training. The investigators then examined baseline and post-training study
      adenoma detection rates (ADR's) for all endoscopist (trained and un-trained) to evaluate the
      impact of training.
