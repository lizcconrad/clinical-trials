  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has gained wide acceptability among colorectal surgeons because of
      less postoperative pain compared with excisional surgery, however a still relevant percentage
      of postoperative bleedings and long-term hemorrhoid recurrence are reported. A new stapler
      device has been designed to overcome these drawbacks by modifying the stapled sutures and by
      increasing the space for mucosal resection in the case of the stapler.

      This randomized controlled study was aimed to demonstrate whether the new EEA stapler
      Covidien was able to resect more quantity of prolapsed mucosa than the traditional PPH 01/03
      Ethicol Endosurgery by measuring the surface of the resected specimen and to demonstrate if
      the modified stapled sutures can ensure better intraoperative hemostasis by measuring the
      number of overstitches required to get perfect hemostasis during the operation.
