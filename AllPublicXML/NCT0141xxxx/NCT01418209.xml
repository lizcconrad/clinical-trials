  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of both low-dose oral (by
      mouth) 17-ß-estradiol and the non-hormonal drug venlafaxine XR compared to placebo in
      reducing hot flashes. Included in this objective is the intention to compare venlafaxine XR
      to estradiol therapy, to provide evidence of the relative efficacy of venlafaxine to what is
      currently considered the most established but also a controversial therapy. 17-ß-estradiol is
      a type of estrogen. Venlafaxine XR is the extended release (XR) version of venlafaxine.
      Venlafaxine XR is an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). A placebo is a
      substance containing no medication.

      The MsFLASH-03 study (Menopausal Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health
      - 03), Comparative Efficacy of Low-Dose Estradiol and the SNRI Venlafaxine XR for Treatment
      of Menopausal Symptoms, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three arm clinical
      trial. The design includes: 3 weeks of daily recording of hot flashes prior to drug
      treatment; 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with oral estradiol, venlafaxine, or placebo;
      followed by 14 days of drug taper for those on venlafaxine and 14 days of progesterone
      treatment for those on estradiol; followed by 2 weeks with no treatment for all groups; and a
      telephone follow-up post-treatment.

After the 8-week treatment, women with a uterus will receive medroxyprogesterone 10 mg once per day for 2 weeks (14 days). 17-ß-estradiol is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is indicated for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. ß is the Greek symbol for beta; the symbol and the word are used interchangeably.</description>

          <description>Venlafaxine XR: Venlafaxine oral (by mouth) 37.5 mg once per day for 1 (one) week, then 75 mg once per day for 7 (seven) weeks. Venlafaxine XR should not be taken while also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Venlafaxine XR is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder, and is available by prescription. Venlafaxine XR is not FDA-approved for the treatment of hot flashes, although prior studies have indicated that it is useful for treating hot flashes and vasomotor symptoms. After the 8-week venlafaxine XR study treatment period, women will receive a tapering dose of venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg once per day for 14 days (2 weeks).</description>

Venlafaxine XR is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder, and is available by prescription. Venlafaxine XR is not FDA-approved for the treatment of hot flashes, although prior studies have indicated that it is useful for treating hot flashes and vasomotor symptoms. After the 8-week venlafaxine XR study treatment period, women will receive a tapering dose of venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg once per day for 14 days (2 weeks).</description>

        <title>Bothersomeness of Hot Flashes -- Week 8</title>
        <description>Measured by self-report diary twice daily (day and night) for 7 days. Bothersomeness ratings ranged from 0 to 3 with lower numbers being less bothersome and higher numbers being more bothersome. Data from the day and night bothersomeness ratings were averaged for a single daily score. The single daily scores for the week prior to the week 8 study assessment were summed and averaged to produce a mean daily VMS bothersomeness for week 8.</description>
