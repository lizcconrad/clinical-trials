  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central sleep apnea (CSA) has been associated with increased mortality and primarily occurs
      in patients with heart failure (HF). The primary purpose of this study is to document the
      natural progression of moderate to severe CSA in heart failure patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with this protocol and has signed an IRB/MEC
             approved informed consent (as well as Privacy Protection Authorization in the United
             States)

          -  Age is greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Known recent history of sleep disordered breathing of predominantly central origin, as
             evidenced by an overnight PSG with EEG and at least 4 hours of recording that was
             conducted within 60 days of enrollment and demonstrating the following
             characteristics:

          -  AHI greater than or equal to 20

          -  greater than or equal to 50% of classified events of a central nature

          -  less than 20% of the total AHI comprised of obstructive apnea events

          -  Diagnosed chronic heart failure, with medications optimized and stable for at least 30
             days prior to the screening PSG, or since the date of the earliest test used for
             baseline, whichever is longer. Optimal medications include: beta blockade, ACE-I or
             ARB and diuretics unless contraindicated or not considered medically necessary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or intended use of any mask-based therapy for central sleep apnea

          -  Baseline oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90% on a stable FiO2

          -  Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (per GOLD classification system)

          -  History of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery
             bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or any
             cardiac ablation procedure within the 3 months prior to the study

          -  Unstable angina

          -  History of primary pulmonary hypertension

          -  Currently enrolled in a non-observational (ie, interventional) clinical study that
             could confound the results of this study

          -  If subject has an implanted cardiac resynchronization device (CRT), it must have been
             implanted at least 3 months before enrollment; any other device must have been
             implanted at least 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Life expectancy of less than 6 months
