      Assessment of Right Ventricular Volume using the VentriPoint Medical system in patients with
      Tetralogy of Fallot following repair; a comparison study to cMRI.

      The objective of this study is: To evaluate the accuracy of the VentriPoint Medical System to
      calculate right ventricular volumes in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot following surgical
      repair.

      Secondary objectives are: To validate Inter and Intra observer variability at 3 clinical
      sites.

      The analyses will be the same for EDV and ESV. For either right ventricular volume, the
      primary effectiveness measure is the % difference between VMS and cMRI results, i.e.
      (VMS-cMRI)*100%/average of VMS and cMRI results. There will be two null hypotheses for the
      primary analysis:

      H0+: true mean % difference &gt; 10% and H0-: true mean % difference &lt; -10%

      The observed mean % difference will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. The VMS right
      ventricular volume estimates will be regarded as equivalent to cMRI estimates if both H0+ and
      H0- are rejected at a 1-sided 0.025 level by a paired t test for both EDV and ESV. Since H0+
      and H0- cannot both be true, the total type I error rate for each measure is 0.025 and the
      overall type I error rate for both EDV and ESV is 0.05.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint of this study is the percent difference between the VentriPoint Medical System (VMS) and cMRI for estimating the end diastolic and end systolic right ventricular volumes (EDV and ESV) in subjects following repair for TOF.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The trial will be regarded as successful if it demonstrates the mean VMS-cMRI percent difference to be &lt;10% and &gt;-10% at a 1-sided 0.025 statistical significance level for each of EDV and ESV, with no safety concerns for the VMS procedure.</description>

Instead KBR reconstructs a new patient's ventricular surface from the placement of anatomic landmark points on a 2D ultrasound image</description>
