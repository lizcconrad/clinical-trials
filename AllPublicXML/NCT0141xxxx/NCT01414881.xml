  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Phase I exploratory study is to determine the effects of
      mipomersen on the hepatic production of apolipoprotein-B (apo B) in very low density
      lipoprotein (VLDL) compared to baseline levels. The study will consist of a Screening Period,
      a 1-week Run-in Period to establish a stable diet, an approximate 11-week Treatment Period
      with Placebo or Mipomersen, and a 25-week Post-Treatment Follow-up Period. The total duration
      of any given subject's participation will be approximately 40 weeks.
