      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Spiracur SNaP® Wound Care System
      for the treatment of acute trauma and acute surgical excision wounds. The secondary purpose
      will be to compare the prospective patients to retrospectively treated acute trauma wounds to
      further evaluate efficacy and safety.
