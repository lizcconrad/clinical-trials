      This study is a regulatory post marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients in hemodialysis who received Fosrenol for
      hyperphosphatemia. The objective of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of using
      Fosrenol in clinical practice. A total 3,000 patients will be recruited and followed 5 years.
