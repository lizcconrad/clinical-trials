  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is to
      show that a 3rd generation HES (Hydroxyethyl Starch) solution - Tetraspan® is as good as in
      terms of safety and effectiveness as the commonly used albumin based solution for volume
      replacement after the surgery.
