      Background:

      The investigators have previously documented that patients at nutritional risk lack
      sufficient energy and protein intake. In 2009 the investigators conducted a non-randomized
      historically controlled intervention study of 40 patients at nutritional risk. The study
      indicated that a tailored food concept increased nutritional intake in this patient group.

      The objective of the current study is therefore to investigate these findings in a randomized
      clinical trial. Our target is for 75% of patients in the intervention group to reach 75% of
      their energy and protein requirements.

      Methods:

      The study will compare standard nutritional care (control group) with tailored nutritional
      care (the possibility to order small energy and protein-enriched dishes called &quot;Delights of
      Herlev Hospital&quot;). 96 patients at nutritional risk, according to the NRS-2002 criteria, will
      be included in the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients reaching &gt;75% of their protein and energy requirements.</measure>
    <time_frame>Energy and protein intake will be calculated on an average of 3 and up to 7 days of dietary. Number of days of food intake recording depends on how long the patient is hospitalized.</time_frame>
    <description>The patients energy requirement will be estimated both from the factorial method and by Harris and Benedicts formula. Protein requirement will be 18E% of the energy requirement.
Recording of the dietary intake will be carried out on a daily basis over a periode of minimum 3 days and maxium 7 days</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>handgrip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 3, 5 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip strength (HGS)will be measured with a Jamar Digital Hand Dynanometer. HGS will only be measured in the right hand because the right hand i significantly stronger in right-handed subjects and there is no significant difference between the two sides in left-handed subjects. Subjects will be encouraged to perform maximal contractions three times with a 15-s interval and the average value will be recorded.</description>
