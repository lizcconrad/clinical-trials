  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test whether repeated sessions of tDCS result in long-lasting improvements
      in motor function in patients with chronic stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research that utilises single sessions of tDCS have demonstrated functional
      improvements; however, these improvements are usually short-lived, lasting less than one hour
      before the patient's performance returns to baseline. It has been suggested that repeated
      stimulation sessions are required to elicit long-lasting improvements. We aim to consider
      these details over the duration of this research, during which patients with chronic stroke
      will attend for 16 sessions over the course of 3 months.

      This research has important implications; previous studies suggest that such an approach has
      the potential to facilitate physical rehabilitation post-stroke and establish tDCS as a
      clinically viable rehabilitative tool. Recovery of motor skills may take many months to
      acquire and therefore strategies that have the potential to enhance acquisition of skill are
      of practical and scientific interest.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study.

          -  Male or Female, aged 18 - 80 years.

          -  Patients should be at least six months post first symptomatic stroke affecting motor
             function of the hand.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anyone who does not have adequate understanding of verbal and written information in
             English, sufficient to complete any of the safety screening forms.

          -  Anyone who has a previous history of epilepsy, febrile convulsions as a child or
             recurrent fainting fits. Likewise, anyone who has a significant family history of
             epilepsy would be excluded as all these conditions carry a theoretical risk of
             increasing susceptibility to seizures.

          -  Any person who has a history of drug abuse or a previous history of a neurological or
             psychiatric illness, or has a history of neurosurgical procedure is excluded as they
             may be at increased risk of epilepsy and data collected may be influenced by their
             condition.

          -  Patients on some prescription medications such as anti-depressants may be excluded as
             they may be at an increased risk of seizures.

          -  Anyone who is currently taking or who has taken anti-malarial treatment in the last 72
             hours.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded as a precaution as there is no data on the effect on
             maternal cranial stimulation on the fetus.

          -  Any metallic implant in the neck, head, or eye and anyone with any implanted
             electrical devices would be excluded as there is a risk of heating with both TMS and
             TDCS stimulation.

          -  Anyone with any metal implants or implantable device would be excluded as indicated by
             the MRI safety screening form. People who suffer with claustrophobia as they are
             unable to tolerate the scanner.

          -  Patients who have had more than one stroke. Patients who have had a stroke will also
             be excluded if they have limited communication in the form of aphasia or a history of
             dementia.
