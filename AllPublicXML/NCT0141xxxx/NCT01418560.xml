      The purpose of this study is to observe the incident of uremia and dialysis requirement after
      renal sympathetic modification using THERMOCOOL® catheter in patients with chronic renal
      failure, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.

    <textblock>
      Chronic renal failure is serial clinical manifestations because of kidney damage. Previous
      studies found sympathetic nerves over activity in chronic renal failure patients. Traditional
      therapies included medications and dialysis replacement therapy need to spend much money.
      Renal ablation for sympathetic modification is a new method which is proved to be effective
      in decreasing sympathetic nerves activity. We assume that modifying renal sympathetic
      activity by ablation is effective and safe in treatment of chronic renal failure. This trial
      is going to recruit 200 patients (Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow-up
      duration of 3 years. Patients in ablation group will receive additional necessary medications
      besides expectant intervention, and patients in control group will receive appropriate
      medications only. We aim to observe the effect of serum creatinine, creatinine clearance
      rate, glomerular filtration rate, urine microalbumin, urine microalbumin/creatinine, and
      composite cardio cerebrovascular events after renal sympathetic modification using
      THERMOCOOL® catheter, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.
