      Objective: To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of a
      parent support intervention consisting of periodic text messages and educational support
      (video, collateral materials),and usual care on the healthcare engagement of limited English
      proficient (LEP) Latino parents during their child's first year and to examine its impact on
      healthcare utilization and primary care quality.

      Lessons learned in organizational engagement reveal a critical need to increase healthcare
      engagement among LEP Latino parents. LEP Latina mothers who were founding members of Latino
      Family Advisory Board (LFAB) at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center identified the
      health system knowledge that enabled them to more effectively use the healthcare system as
      one of the key benefits of board membership. The gains in knowledge, skills, and confidence
      demonstrated in the LFAB evaluation mirror qualitative evaluation findings of other
      ambulatory care advisory boards, and reflect the concept of patient activation. Patient
      activation, a component of individual patient engagement, is defined as the patient's
      willingness to manage their health and healthcare based on understanding one's role in the
      care process and having the knowledge, skills, and confidence to do so. Interventions focused
      on increasing activation, using both in-person and mHealth support, have demonstrated
      efficacy and have led to improvement in health and healthcare quality. mHealth-based
      interventions have the ability to reach larger populations at lower cost, with the potential
      for increased tailoring and interactivity, especially as the use of cellular phones becomes
      nearly universal, even among low-income populations. For example, Text4baby, a perinatal
      health education program delivered through passive educational text messages, has
      demonstrated success at reaching low-income Spanish-speaking parents with positive user
      assessments.

      A recent study of parent healthcare activation among low-income parents (conducted by PI:
      DeCamp) demonstrated that parent activation among parents whose preferred healthcare language
      was Spanish was significantly lower than that of parents whose preferred healthcare language
      was English. These findings further support targeting increasing the healthcare engagement of
      LEP Latino parents.

      This novel intervention will integrate mobile health (mHealth) technology and culturally- and
      linguistically-tailored interpersonal support to increase healthcare engagement of LEP Latino
      parents and to enable them to overcome barriers to effective healthcare access and use. We
      hypothesize that this intervention will measurably increase parent healthcare engagement and
      that this will positively impact healthcare utilization, quality and the patient/family
      experience. Increasing healthcare engagement of LEP Latino families and demonstrating
      positive healthcare impact through a tailored, scalable intervention would create a
      foundation for larger-scale impact on healthcare disparities for Latino children and a model
      for increasing engagement of other vulnerable populations.

    <description>The participants in the intervention group will receive interactive text-messages with a link to support if needed for: clinic appointment reminders, follow-up on medicine and referral adherence, and illness care needs and use. Participants will additionally receive reminders for insurance renewal, food stamp applications, and health-promoting community events. Participants in this arm will complete a baseline survey when their infant is ≤ 2 months of age, a mid-point survey at 7-9 months, and a follow-up survey at by age 15 months.</description>
