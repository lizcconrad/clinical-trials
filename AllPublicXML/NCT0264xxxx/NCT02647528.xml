          -  Subject must have at least eight and not more than fifty inflammatory facial lesions
             (i.e., papules/pustules) and no nodules on the face. For the purposes of study
             treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to the facial treatment area

             sterilized or postmenopausal for at least 1 year), in addition to having a negative
             urine pregnancy test, must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control
             during the study from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the
             last administration of study drug.

          -  Subjects who use make-up must have used the same brands/types of make-up for a minimum
             period of 14 days prior to study entry and must agree to use the same make-up
             brand/type and frequency of use throughout the study.

          -  Subjects must agree not to have any other procedures affecting skin quality
             (microdermabrasion, peels, acne treatments, etc.) for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects who agree to be photographed for research purposes and their identity may not
             be concealed in these photographs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             control (oral contraceptives, IUD, contraceptive implant, barrier methods with
             spermicide or abstinence). Females of non-childbearing potential are defined as
             post-menopausal (absence of menstrual bleeding for one year), hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  Subjects who cannot understand or are not willing to comply with the requirements of

             assessment of acne.

          -  Excessive facial hair (e.g. beards, sideburns, moustaches, etc.) that would interfere
             with diagnosis or assessment of acne.

          -  The use within 6 months prior to baseline of oral retinoids (e.g. AccutaneÂ®) or
             therapeutic vitamin A supplements of greater than 10,000units/day (multivitamins are

               -  systemic corticosteroids (Note: intranasal and inhalational corticosteroids do
                  not require a washout and maybe used throughout the trial if the subject is on a

             sunlight or weather extremes, such as wind or cold.

          -  A subject who has any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the

             inclusion.

          -  Subjects who have been previously enrolled in this study.

          -  Subjects who have had laser therapy (for telangiectasia or other conditions),

          -  Subjects who have had cosmetic procedures (e.g., facials) which may affect the

          -  Subjects who have had any kind of facial dermabrasion, chemical peel, laser, IPL or
