      Prospective, bicentric observational study to assess a novel system for automated control of
      mechanical ventilation (Smart Vent Control, SVC) during general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Automated control of mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia study (AVAS study)
      is an international investigator-initiated bicentric observational study investigating the
      application of Smart Vent Control (SVC) during general anesthesia. The main objective of this
      study is to describe the application of SVC and to assess its safety and efficacy.

    <description>The responsible anesthesiologist defines a target range for the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2_target) before the induction of the general anesthesia and sets up the corresponding endtidal CO2-range in the automated ventilation system. 15 minutes after the begin of the surgical procedure an arterial blood gas analysis will be performed and the PaCO2 will be measured. Then patients will be classified as follows:
hypoventilated patient: PaCO2 &gt; (PaCO2_target+5)
hyperventilated patient: PaCO2 &lt; (PaCO2_target-5)
normoventilated patient: (PaCO2_target-5) ≤ PaCO2 ≤ PaCO2_target+5</description>

    <description>Smart Vent Control (SVC) was designed to automatically control the following ventilator settings: mechanical breathing frequency, inspiratory pressure, pressure support, inspiratory time, trigger sensitivity. SVC adjusts the ventilator settings with the aim to keep a patient stable in a target zone (TZ). Numerous predefined TZs exist that can be set according to the current therapeutic situation. All TZs are adoptable by the user for each individual patient and consist of upper and lower limits for tidal volume and for the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2). Based on these limits, the system classifies the current quality of ventilation, called Classification of Ventilation, and derives new ventilator settings accordingly. SVC is available as a software option on Zeus Infinity Empowered anesthesia machines (Drägerwerk AG &amp; Co. KGAa, Lübeck, Germany) and is approved as a medical product according to 93/42/European Economic Community.</description>
