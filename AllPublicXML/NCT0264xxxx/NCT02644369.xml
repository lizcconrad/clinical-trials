  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study whose main purpose is to evaluate gene changes and immune biomarkers
      in patients with solid tumors during treatment with pembrolizumab and in relation to response
      to treatment.

      Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is designed to block a protein called programmed
      cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) which will allow the body's immune system to kill the cancer
      cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve treatment with pembrolizumab, tests and procedures done for safety,
      and the collection of archival tumor tissue, fresh tumor biopsies, and blood samples for
      biomarker research (including genetic testing).

          -  Have histologically or cytologically-documented, locally-advanced, or metastatic solid
             malignancy that is incurable and has either (a) failed prior standard therapy, (b) for
             which no standard therapy exists, or (c) standard therapy is not considered

             prior treatment regimens.

          -  Have one of the following advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) solid tumor
