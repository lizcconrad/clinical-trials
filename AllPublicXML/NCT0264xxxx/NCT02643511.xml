  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole gland LDR brachytherapy has been a well established modality of treating low risk
      prostate cancer. Treatment in a focal manner has the advantages of reduced toxicity to
      surrounding organs.

      AIM: To determine the utility of focal LDR brachytherapy in form of hemiablative treatment
      for localized prostate cancer demonstrating the feasibility of the delivery of the
      prescription dose to the half of the prostate in terms of meeting standard dosimetric
      parameters while respecting same or lower tolerance doses of adjacent normal organs.

      To determine acute and late rectal, urinary and sexual toxicity after this procedure.

      To assess the change from baseline in QOL indicators at specific time intervals using
      validated international questionnaires [International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS),
      International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF ), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC)]
      after this treatment.

      To evaluate the local tumour control in terms of biopsy outcomes after focal brachytherapy 36
      months after the treatment.

      To compare target coverage and relative doses to the rectum and the urethra for the same
      patient performing a hemigland treatment planning vs Whole gland treatment planning.

      STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institution prospective trial to determine whether hemiablative treatment
      with LDR for prostate cancer is dosimetrically safe and feasible.This study will record data
      for 20 patients with ipsilateral with low and low tier intermediate risk disease.The study
      will record quality of life parameters in particular in terms of urinary, rectal and sexual
      function side effects.

      INTERVENTION:

        -  Baseline Transperineal Template guided mapping prostate biopsy with &gt;20 cores (not
           required if already performed)

        -  Multiparametric MRI within the 3 months prior to registration and at 18 &amp; 36 months.

        -  Hemigland prostate region will be targeted with the prescription dose and receive 144 Gy
           of Iodine125 (I125).

        -  The quality of life assessment will focus on erectile function, urinary function, bowel
           function, and general health related quality of life

        -  Postimplant CT Planning day 30 after the implant for quality assurance.

      MEASUREMENT OF ENDPOINTS :

      Dosimetric parameters record, Toxicity and QOL evaluation forms, PSA follow up and biopsies
      at 36 months to assess local control.

    <description>A re-staging transperineal template guided mapping prostate biopsy as currently performed at participating institutions. Hemiablative Focal brachytherapy will be performed . The affected half of the prostate will be targeted with the prescription dose and receive 145 Gy of Iodine-125 (I-125). A postimplant dosimetry will be performed 30 days after procedure. The quality-of-life assessment will focus on erectile function, urinary function, bowel function, and general health related quality of life.
