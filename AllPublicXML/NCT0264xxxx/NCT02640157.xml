  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of ABT-493/ABT-530 to the
      combination of sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) in adults with genotype 3 (GT3) chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

      This study was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled multicenter study to
      compare efficacy and safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 to SOF and DCV in treatment-naïve chronic HCV
      GT3-infected participants without cirrhosis. The study consisted of 2 periods, a treatment
      period (participants received 8 or 12 weeks of ABT-493/ABT-530 or 12 weeks of SOF with DCV)
      and a post-treatment period (participants who completed or prematurely discontinued the
      treatment period were followed for 24 weeks after their last dose of study drug to evaluate
      efficacy and to monitor HCV RNA and the emergence and persistence of viral variants).

    <description>SVR12 was defined as plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than the lower limit of quantification [&lt;LLOQ] 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint was noninferiority in the percentage of participants achieving SVR12 of the 12-week regimen (Arm A) to the standard of care (Arm B: 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir [SOF] + daclatasvir [DCV]), defined as: a) the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference was above the non-inferiority margin of -6% and the lower bound of the 95% CI for the SVR12 rate within Arm A was greater than 92%; OR b) the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference was below the non-inferiority margin of -6% and the lower bound of the 97.5% CI for the SVR12 rate within Arm A was greater than 92%; OR c) the lower bound of the 97.5% CI for the difference was above the non-inferiority margin of -6% and the lower bound of the 95% CI for the SVR12 rate within Arm A was below 92%.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as plasma HCV RNA level &lt;LLOQ 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. If the first primary efficacy objective (noninferiority of Arm A to Arm B) was achieved, then the second primary efficacy objective, noninferiority in the percentage of participants achieving SVR12 of the 8-week regimen (Arm C) to the 12-week regimen (Arm A) was to be tested. Noninferiority was defined as: a) the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference was above the noninferiority margin of -6% and the lower bound of the 95% CI for the SVR12 rate within Arm C was greater than 92%, OR b) the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference was below the noninferiority margin of -6% and the lower bound of the 97.5% CI for the SVR12 rate within Arm C was greater than 92%, OR c) the lower bound of the 97.5% CI for the difference was above the noninferiority margin of -6% and the lower bound of the 95% CI for the SVR12 rate within Arm C was below 92%.</description>

    <description>SVR12 was defined as plasma HCV RNA level &lt;LLOQ 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Per statistical analysis plan to adjust for multiplicity among the primary and first secondary hypothesis tests, the test for superiority of Arm A to Arm B was not conducted.</description>

    <description>On-treatment virologic failure was defined as confirmed increase of &gt; 1 log(subscript)10(subscript) IU/mL above the lowest value post-baseline in HCV RNA during treatment; confirmed HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL after HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ during treatment, or HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ at end of treatment with at least 6 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <description>Post-treatment relapse was defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ between the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug among participants who completed treatment with HCV RNA levels &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment, excluding reinfection.</description>
