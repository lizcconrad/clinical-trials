    <textblock>
      Muscle tension dysphagia is a novel diagnostic taxonomy describing a subset of patient
      population with reported dysphagia who exhibit normal oropharyngeal and esophageal swallowing
      function as evidenced by videofluoroscopic swallow study. These patients also demonstrate
      abnormal supraglottic muscle tension during laryngoscopy as well as signs of laryngeal
      hypersensitivity and laryngopharyngeal reflux. Treatment of these patients with Proton Pump
      Inhibitor (PPI) therapy is a common practice however voice therapy invention targeting the
      unloading of the supraglottic muscle tension has been shown to be highly effective in symptom
      resolution per the investigators' clinical experience. The study is designed to answer
      efficacy of treatment being offered to patients with muscle tension dysphagia.
