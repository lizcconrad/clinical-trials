  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, two-stage, open-label, single-arm, dose escalation study of DFP-13318
      intravenous infusion administered to patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors. This
      study will explore two different dosing schedules- once every 3 weeks (q3w) and once every 2
      weeks (q2w) - during Stage 1 and Stage 2, respectively.

      DFP-11318 is an investigational drug product that has demonstrated reasonable antitumor
      activity in preclinical colorectal, gastric and lung tumor models in animals. This is a first
      in human trial to determine the maximum, safest dose of DFP-11318 IV that can be administered
      to patients either once every 3 weeks or once every 2 weeks.

               -  bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x ULN (&lt; 5 x
                  ULN if documented hepatic metastases)

               -  Serum sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium within normal limits for the
                  institution (supplements may be given to correct values)

             cardiac conditions, or other organ dysfunctions.

          -  Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.

          -  Signed informed consent prior to the start of any study specific procedures.
