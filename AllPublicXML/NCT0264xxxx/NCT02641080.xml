      For patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty, does the use of Aspirin alone
      compared to using Aspirin along with a mobile compression device provide equivocal results
      for preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after total joint
      arthroplasty? The investigator will evaluate the prevention of DVT/PE after total hip and
      knee arthroplasty will be evaluated to see if there is a decreased risk of bleeding while
      continuing to prevent thromboembolic disease. The equivalency of using the mobile compression
      devices with aspirin compared to aspirin alone in patients undergoing total hip and knee
      arthroplasty will be evaluated. A previous study has shown that patient compliance with the
      pneumatic compression device is less than 80%.
