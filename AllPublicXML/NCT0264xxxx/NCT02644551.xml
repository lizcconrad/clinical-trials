  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an interventional safety and efficacy study of CELENT07 when used as a topical
      treatment of onychomycosis in the toenails (tinea unguium) of adults 18 years and older. This
      is randomized, double-blind, parallel design, placebo and active controlled study in patients
      with mild to moderate toenail distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) (n=120). Subjects
      will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive CELENXT07, placebo of CELENXT07 or PENLAC®, daily for
      52 weeks. Efficacy assessments will include complete cure, mycologic cure and clinical
      efficacy and safety and tolerability.
