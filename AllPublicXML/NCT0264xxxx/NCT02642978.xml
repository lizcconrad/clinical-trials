  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of robot-assisted
      simultaneous resection in selected patients with sigmoid colon cancer or rectal cancer liver
      metastases, and compared with the traditional open procedure.

      The Da Vinci Surgical System may help to overcome some of the difficulties of laparoscopy for
      complicated abdominal surgery. The aim of this study was to present an innovative technique
      that is robot-assisted, simultaneous radical resection of both colorectal cancer and liver
      metastasis (RSRCLM).

    <description>robot-assisted, simultaneous radical resection of both colorectal cancer and liver metastasis (RSRCLM).Three different liver resection procedures were chose to personalized patients. Generally, when the size of liver metastasis was ≤ 3 cm, a wedge resection was chose without Hilar vessels blocking. The segmentectomy was performed using the Glissonian approach when tumor size was among 3-5 cm, and Hilar vessels was blocked, if necessary. For resection of Couinaud's segments II and III, left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) was performed commonly. Intraoperative ultrasound can help us find intrahepatic pedicles and follow the proper resection line. When liver tumor size was more than 5 cm or more than 3 tumors with the size over 3cm, hemicolectomy was applied usually.</description>

          2. Primary tumor has undergone histologically confirmed colon adenocarcinoma; Colon
             cancer was defined by the presence of the inferior pole of the tumor above the
