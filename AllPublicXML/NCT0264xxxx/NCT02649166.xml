  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor is an incurable, degenerative brain disorder that results in increasingly
      debilitating tremor, and afflicts an estimated 7 million people in the US. In one study, 25%
      of essential tremor patients were forced to change jobs or take early retirement because of
      tremor. Essential tremor is directly linked to progressive functional impairment, social
      embarrassment, and even depression. The tremor associated with essential tremor is typically
      slow, involves the hands (and sometimes the head and voice), worsens with intentional
      movements, and is insidiously progressive over many years. Deep brain stimulation has emerged
      as a highly effective treatment for intractable, debilitating essential tremor. However,
      since the intention tremor of essential tremor is typically intermittent, and commonly absent
      at rest, the currently available continuous deep brain stimulation may be delivering
      unnecessary current to the brain that increases undesirable side effects such as slurred
      speech and walking difficulty, and hastens the depletion of device batteries, necessitating
      more frequent surgical procedures to replace spent pulse generators. The overall objective of
      this early feasibility study is to provide preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of
      &quot;closed-loop&quot; deep brain stimulation for intention tremor using novel deep brain stimulation
      devices capable of continuously sensing brain activity and delivering therapeutic stimulation
      only when necessary to suppress tremor.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate brain signals related to intention tremor in
      essential tremor in order to deliver deep brain stimulation only when the patient is showing
      symptoms. By delivering stimulation only when needed, the investigators hypothesize that the
      treatment will be more effective, will cause fewer adverse side effects and will increase
      battery time of the device (reducing the number of battery replacement surgeries).

      Participation in this study will require extensive pre-surgical screening to determine
      eligibility for deep brain stimulation surgery, a deep brain stimulation surgical procedure,
      and regular follow-ups. Subjects will be seen monthly post surgery for 6 months. After 6
      months, data will be assessed and closed-loop deep brain stimulation may be offered as a
      stimulation setting. If so, the stimulator settings will be changed from chronic to
      responsive. If not, the subject will continue to receive chronic deep brain stimulation
      stimulation. Subsequent visits will be scheduled every 6 months until a total of 24 months of
      study participation (also at month 9).

      At the end of the initial 24-month study period, subjects will have the choice of 1)
      continuing active stimulation at the current setting, 2) continuing stimulation but searching
      for a new setting, 3) discontinuing stimulation (turning the device off), 4) having the
      device removed. If the subject continues to receive active stimulation, they will be followed
      by the investigators and seen at yearly intervals.

    <description>- Reduction in Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor after 6 months as an effect of continuous Vim deep brain stimulation
The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale is a clinical rating scale assessing severity of tremor by body part from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The scale is divided into three parts, where Part A assesses tremor severity at rest, during posture, and kinetic maneuvers for nine body parts; Part B assesses ability to perform specific motor tasks/functions (writing, drawing, and pouring with dominant and nondominant hands); and Part C assesses patient-reported functional disability resulting from the tremor. Score ranges from 0 to 80 for Part A, from 0 to 36 for Part B, and from 0 to 28 for Part C. The total score obtained by adding the three parts is 144. A higher score indicates a higher severity of the tremor. Finally, the scale includes one separate item dealing with global assessment of tremor-related disability, rated by both patient and examiner on a 5-point scale.</description>

    <description>All participants will undergo unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation for essential tremor. Medtronic Activa PC+S devices will be used because these are capable of recording brain signals, as well as delivering DBS. Participants will receive continuous (open-loop) and closed-loop deep brain stimulation interventions, which will be compared for efficacy.</description>

    <description>The deep brain stimulation system includes an implantable neurostimulator, thalamic leads to be implanted in the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim), and subdural cortical strips. The deep brain stimulation system will be set to provide continuous stimulation for the 6 months following surgery. Subjects will be seen monthly for evaluation as a part of normal clinical care for deep brain stimulation. At 6 months, the investigators will determine whether or not the subject is a candidate for closed-loop deep brain stimulation. Qualifying subjects will have the option to have their settings changed in order to participate in the RBS stimulation intervention. These subjects will been seen every 6 months for evaluation as part of normal clinical care for deep brain stimulation.</description>

    <description>The deep brain stimulation system includes an implantable neurostimulator, Vim thalamic leads, and subdural strips. Six months post-surgery, the deep brain stimulation system will be set to provide responsive stimulation for the duration of the study. Subjects will be seen every 6 months for evaluation as a part of normal clinical care for deep brain stimulation. Data gathered from the subject during the first 6 months will be used to determine if this intervention is applicable for each individual subject. Subjects who do not qualify will continue to receive the other study intervention.</description>
