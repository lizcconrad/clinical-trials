  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, clinical trial will take place over a 90 day course followed by 1-month
      and 6-month post treatment visits to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the SkinPen
      device when used on both men and women on the face and/or back.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 20 subjects of varying Fitzpatrick skin types will be admitted to the trial for
      treatment on their moderate to severe acne scars on the face and/or back. Implementation of
      needle depths ranging from 0.25 mm to 2.0 mm will depend on severity of scars and their
      location. Each subject will undergo 3 treatments in 30 day increments and will take
      pre-treatment images as well as 1-month and 6-months post treatment images. Assessment will
      be based on the Goodman and Baron's grading system, the Clinician's Global Aesthetic
      Improvement Scale, as well as a self-assessment.
