  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to compare the effects of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (rTMS) combined with sensory cueing (SC), rTMS alone, and conventional rehabilitation on
      reducing unilateral neglect (UN) and improving hemiplegic arm functions and performance of
      activities of daily living (ADL). Sixty subacute patients with left UN after
      right-hemispheric stroke were randomly assigned to three groups; rTMS combined with SC, rTMS
      alone, and conventional rehabilitation. rTMS at 1 Hz was applied over P5 of the
      contralesional hemisphere while vibration cueing was emitted using a wristwatch device on the
      hemiplegic arm, five days per week for two weeks. The first two groups received the same
      dosage of conventional rehabilitation on top of their experimental interventions. Blinded
      assessments were administered at baseline, 2 weeks postintervention, and four-week follow-up
      upon completion of training.
