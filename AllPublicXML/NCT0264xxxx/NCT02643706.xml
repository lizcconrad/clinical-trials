  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the relationship between the gene
      polymorphism of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and contrast induced nephropathy and its mechanism.

      Patients undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention will be
      recruited in this study after they sign the informed consent.5ml venous blood was extracted
      from the peripheral vein before the operation to detect the renal function, the genotype and
      enzyme activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ,and the levels of oxidative stress and
      inflammation.Another 5ml venous blood was extracted from the peripheral vein 24-72 hours
      after the operation to detect the renal function and the levels of oxidative stress and
      inflammation.Activated oxygen protein products , 4-HNE and hs-CRP as markers for oxidative
      stress and inflammation.The renal function index contains serum creatinine，urea nitrogen and
      cystatin C.

      5 ml vein blood samples were collected from peripheral vein before coronary angiography or
      percutaneous coronary intervention.The blood is used to detecte the renal function , the
      genotype of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. Another 5 ml vein
      blood samples were collected from peripheral vein to detecte the renal function 24-72 hours
      after the surgery. The samples would be centrifuged and saved in a -80℃ ultra-low temperature
      refrigerator.
