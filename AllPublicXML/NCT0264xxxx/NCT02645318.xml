  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conduct a prospective study to compare gene detection by ctDNA with tumor tissue DNA via
      targeted DNA sequencing in surgical NSCLC patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown the feasibility of detecting mutation status by circulating tumor
      DNA (ctDNA)in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, no clinical standard
      method has been established, and most previous studies were lack of prospective clinical data
      and aimed at advanced NSCLC.

      We plan to perform a prospective study including consecutive cases of NSCLC patients who
      underwent surgical treatments. Primary tumor and plasma samples were collected in each
      patients and gene mutation analysis were performed immediately after surgery. We utilized the
      targeted DNA sequencing with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform to detect driver
      somatic mutations in matched tumor DNA (tDNA) and plasma ctDNA samples with matched white
      blood cell (WBC) DNA as a control. A panel of genes were identified.
