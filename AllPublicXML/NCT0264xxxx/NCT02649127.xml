      This is an 8-week experimental, repeated-measures clinical trial randomizing 120 Service
      Members with symptoms of PTSD into one of four groups: 1) imaginal exercises of exposure
      therapy only, 2) aerobic exercise only, 3) imaginal exercises augmented with aerobic
      exercise, or 4) self-care.

    <textblock>
      One of the signature injuries of combat operations following 9/11 is posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). The most effective treatment for PTSD is exposure therapy where, under the
      supervision of a trained therapist, individuals are exposed to prolonged and repeated
      imagined images of the trauma until the images no longer cause severe anxiety. Various forms
      of exercise have been used to treat a broad range of depression and anxiety disorders and
      exercise has been used with some success to treat individuals with PTSD. Considering the
      population of otherwise healthy and physically active Service Members suffering from symptoms
      of PTSD, it seems possible that exercise might serve as an outlet for the emotional reactions
      experienced during therapy, decreasing emotional distress, and increasing the individual's
      tolerance to imaginal exposure serving as a powerful adjunct to exposure therapy. The purpose
      of this study to explore the role of exercise in the treatment of symptoms of posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), specifically determining if the efficacy of imaginal exercises, part
      of exposure therapy for PTSD, can be improved by augmenting the therapy with aerobic
      exercise. Towards this end, this 8-week experimental, repeated-measures clinical trial will
      randomize 120 Service Members with symptoms of PTSD into one of four groups: 1) imaginal
      exercises of exposure therapy only, 2) aerobic exercise only, 3) imaginal exercises augmented
      with aerobic exercise, or 4) self-care.

    <description>The imaginal exercise of exposure therapy will be manualized (Rothbaum, Foa &amp; Hembree, 2007) and adapted with the permission of Dr. Foa for combat-related stress disorders (Peterson, Cigrang &amp; Riggs, 2008). While traditional exposure therapy includes both imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure, this study will use only the imaginal exposure components. Participants will meet with a therapist the first week of treatment and every-other week for a total of five appointments over eight weeks. During the second session, the therapist will help the participant make an approximately 20-minute voice tape recording of their traumatic experience which they will listen to 5-days/week. A new recording will be made with the therapist during sessions 3 and 4 also, for a total of three tapes.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Exercise Only</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The aerobic exercise regimen will be standardized according to the American College of Sports Medicine recommendations: frequency of a minimum of 5 sessions per week, at a vigorous intensity [&gt;60% of oxygen uptake reserve (VO2R)], time of 20-25 minutes per exercise session. To determine the exercise heart rate intensity, the Karvonen formula for heart rate reserve will be used. The mode of exercise will be purposeful walking or jogging. The goal of the exercise is not training, but rather to keep the participant's heart rate &gt;60% of their individually-determined heart rate reserve.</description>

    <description>Participants will meet with a therapist the first week of treatment and every-other week for a total of five appointments over eight weeks. During the second session, the therapist will help the participant make an approximately 20-minute voice tape recording of their traumatic experience which they will listen to 5-days/week. A new recording will be made with the therapist during sessions 3 and 4 also, for a total of three tapes. Participants will exercise listening to their tape at least 5-times/week outside of scheduled unit Physical Training. Participants will wear the heart rate monitor to record their exercise activity.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Nurse-led Self-Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Self-Care Group will use written materials that outline the benefits of thinking about problems the individual is facing as well as the benefits of exercise, however doing the two activities together will not be advocated as part of the material. A fact sheet prepared by the National Center for PTSD, Returning from the War Zone: A Guide for Military Personnel as well as a list of coping strategies and self-care behaviors adapted from the National Center for PTSD guide, Self-Care and Self-Help Following Disasters, will be used to guide the discussion. The research nurse will meet with the participant five times over 8-weeks at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 to encourage use of the self-care fact sheet and assess the participant for safety.</description>
