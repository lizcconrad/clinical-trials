    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that acupuncture is equally effective as metformin (both treatments
      combined with lifestyle management) in improving whole body glucose homeostasis in insulin
      resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and that both are superior to
      lifestyle management alone. The investigators hypothesize that acupuncture and metformin
      induce ovulation and improve hyperandrogenism, as well as health related quality of life
      (HRQoL) and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although equally effective (acupuncture and
      metformin), the investigators hypothesize that acupuncture is associated with less negative
      side-effects. The investigators also hypothesize that these treatments have the potential to
      restore epigenetic and molecular alterations in target tissues (endometrial-, adipose-, and
      skeletal muscle tissue) and thus have the potential to prevent the development of type 2
      diabetes (T2D).

      Specific Aims The purpose of the study is to perform a randomized controlled trial of women
      with PCOS, comparing the effectiveness of lifestyle management alone, and in combination with
      acupuncture or metformin treatment on whole body glucose homeostasis, with the ultimate goal
      to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.

      Primary aim

      1. To determine the clinical effectiveness of 4 months of 1) electroacupuncture + lifestyle
      management and 2) metformin + lifestyle management, compared to 3) lifestyle management only,
      for improvement of insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA-IR, by the insulin response to
      glucose assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUCinsulin) during the oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT), and by glucose regulation (assessed by analyzing Hba1c levels).

      Secondary aims

        1. To evaluate changes in secondary metabolic measures, including fasting insulin,
           c-peptide, glucose, and adipokines, calculation of HOMA-B (i.e. the Islet β-cell
           function) and the c-peptide index, assessment of the adipokines and lipid profile, body
           size and proportions and body fat distribution.

        2. To determine changes in genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles related
           to insulin sensitivity in fat, muscle and endometrial tissue biopsies, and biomarkers in
           whole blood.

        3. To evaluate endocrine measures including menstrual pattern and ovulation frequency,
           circulating hormones (sex steroids, AMH, gonadotropins), and excretion of metabolites of
           sex steroids in urine.

        4. To determine changes in women's HRQoL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, dieting and
           eating patterns, and negative side-effects.

        5. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different treatments.
