      Investigative trial with aim of

        1. the description of the hormonal and metabolic response to meals containing different
           compositions of macronutrients

        2. the metabolic response to these test meals in dependance of the hepatic and muscular
           insulin sensitivity and abdominal adipose tissue and

        3. effects of a weight loss on the hormonal response to these test meals containing
           different compositions of macronutrients

      Primary endpoint:

      Glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), Glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and Ghrelin
      response to a nutritive stimulation characterized by different nutritional composition

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  differences of substrate utilization depending on the nutritive composition

        -  effects of different hepatic and muscular insulin sensitivity as well as impact of
           visceral fat mass on the hormonal and metabolic response

        -  effect of weight loss on the hormonal and metabolic response to different test meals

      Study procedure:

      After primary characterization 50 probands (male and female) will receive 3 different test
      meals within a randomised (meal order) controlled trial.

      The three different test meals differ in nutritional composition. During consumption of the
      test meal a characterization of the endogenous hormonal response and appetite behaviour is
      performed.

      A nutritional counselling is performed according to the guidelines of the German Nutrition
      Society (DGE) to ensure a stable nutritive behaviour in the three days before the test meal
      administration.

      After analysis of the hormonal response to these 3 different testmeals follows a weight
      reduction period over 3 months. Afterwards reevaluation of the probands (again administration
      of 3 different test meals over a period of 3 weeks) will be performed.

      Principal aim of the study:

      Gain of information leading to the understanding of the hormonal regulation of food intake.
      The individual variability shall be determined with the aim of an identification of patient
      groups which show various intensities of the responses to different macronutrients.
