  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Warts are benign epidermal tumors caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). The active
      pharmaceutical ingredient DPCP has been used for many years as a compounded formulation in
      acetone for the treatment of warts, alopecia areata and more recently, cutaneous metastatic
      melanoma lesions. An improved topical ointment formulation of DPCP called Samcyprone™ will be
      evaluated for the treatment of common warts.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effectiveness of Sensitizing DPCP Ointment in eliciting a sensitization response in healthy subjects with common warts by assessing the immunotherapeutic response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of immunotherapeutic response per subject will include gauging the Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) response after application sensitizing DPCP ointment. A minimum +2 DTH response will be considered a positive sensitization result</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effectiveness of Treatment DPCP Ointment will be measured by the Investigator's Global Assessment Score (IGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>11 to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator's Global Assessment Score (IGAS) is a 4-point scale that will be used to evaluate wart clearance for all treated warts separately. Results will further be utilized to determine overall clearance of treated warts in total. Wart lesion surface area will be measured and used to assist in determining IGAS Score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety and tolerability of a treatment regimen for common warts consisting of a sensitization dose with Sensitizing DPCP Ointment and ten weekly treatments with Treatment DPCP Ointment, assessed by reported adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reported adverse events and clinically-relevant changes in laboratory testing after treatment will be monitored for severity and frequency; incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events will be assessed</description>

    <description>Up to two doses of Sensitizing DPCP Ointment will be applied and subjects who exhibit a sensitization response will enter the Treatment Phase. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Sensitizing DPCP Ointment will be measured in a subset of subjects. For PK, blood will be collected prior to application of the Sensitizing DPCP Ointment and again at 1, 2, and 24 hours after application.</description>

    <description>In the Treatment Phase, subjects will receive doses of Treatment DPCP Ointment weekly for 10 weeks. Subjects who at the end of the Treatment Phase have exhibited partial clearance of warts may be given the option to continue with an additional 10 weekly treatments.</description>
