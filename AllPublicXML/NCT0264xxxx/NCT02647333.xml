  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to reduce cardiovascular risk, current European guidelines recommend a diet low on
      saturated fatty acid through replacement with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).
      Polyunsaturated fatty acids can be classified into omega-3 and omega-6. However the results
      from recent meta-analyses investigating coronary risk outcomes did not clearly support a low
      intake of saturated fatty acids and a high intake of omega-3 or omega-6. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the short term effects of a high intake of PUFAs on microvascular
      function, lipids, inflammation and other cardiovascular risk factors in inactive patients
      with increased waistline.
