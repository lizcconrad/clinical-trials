  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop pilot data on the potential efficacy of
      computer-based cognitive training or the combination of computer-based cognitive training
      with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in improving cognitive function in
      persons with HIV-related mild neurocognitive disorder (MND). tDCS is a noninvasive brain
      stimulation technique in which a small direct current (1-2 mA) is applied to the scalp during
      a cognitive or motor activity, inducing a very small current that affects specific neural
      circuits related to the site at which electrodes are placed. tDCS has been judged safe and
      has shown significant treatment effects in studies with other populations, but has not been
      extensively studied in individuals with HIV infection. tDCS has been shown to facilitate
      learning in a number of studies, suggesting that it may improve or enhance learning in those
      with cognitive problems. As HIV infection is associated with decrements in a number of
      cognitive skills, including working memory, executive functions, and psychomotor speed that
      are related to individuals' functional status and medication adherence, the demonstration of
      a technique to enhance the effects of cognitive training in this population would have
      substantial clinical benefits as well as scientific value.
