  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody Injection (T1h) has been approved for
      psoriasis in India. The first trial in China is to evaluate the tolerability, safety,
      pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of T1h for patients with
      psoriasis.

      The humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (T1h) is developed whose ligand
      binding properties of the original murine monoclonal antibody are preserved on the CD6
      molecule. T1h monoclonal antibody has been approved for clinical studies of autoimmune
      diseases in Cuba and India, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      Single and multiple dose based tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic phase 1 Study of
      Humanized Anti-CD6 Monoclonal Antibody Injection in Chinese patients with psoriasis, 40
      patients are enrolled. They are divided into 4 groups (0.2mg/kg, 0.4mg/kg, 0.8mg/kg,
      1.6mg/kg) and each group includes 10 patients. First, these doses are all single-dose
      administration gradually from low then the doses 0.4mg/kg, 0.8mg/kg and 1.6mg/kg are
      multi-dose administration gradually from low.
