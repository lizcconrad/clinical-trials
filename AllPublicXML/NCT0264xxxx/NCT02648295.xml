  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood management is an important part of successful total joint replacement. Loss of blood
      and transfusion can lead to poor outcomes for patients. The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) has
      become a standard component to many blood management programs. It is used to treat or prevent
      excessive blood loss during surgery and in various medical conditions such as excessive
      bleeding or hemorrhage. A normal body process prevents blood clots that occur naturally from
      growing and causing problems. When this process becomes overactive it can result in excessive
      bleeding, leading to increased blood transfusions. The proposed study seeks to evaluate the
      relationship between TXA and thromboelastogram (TEG) results.
