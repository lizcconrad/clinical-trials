      Study CC-90002-AML-001 is an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation (Part A) and expansion (Part
      B), clinical study of CC-90002, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, in subjects with
      relapsed and/or primary refractory AML and high-risk MDS. The study will explore escalating
      doses of CC-90002 using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design in Part A, followed by dose expansion
      in Part B.

      The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of CC-90002 and also to
      define the non-tolerated dose (NTD), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CC-90002.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In both Part A and Part B, treatments will be administered in two phases starting with an
      induction phase followed by a maintenance phase. During the induction phase, treatments will
      be administered in 42-day cycles in Cycles 1 through 4. Following completion of Cycle 4 in
      the induction phase, subjects with non-progressive disease will enter the maintenance phase.
      During the maintenance phase, treatments will be administered in 28 day cycles. Subjects may
      continue CC-90002 for up to a maximum of 2 years (eg, induction phase Cycles 1 through 4 and
      maintenance phase Cycles 5 through 24) or until clinically significant disease progression,
      the occurrence of intolerable toxicity, or physician/subject decision to discontinue
      CC-90002, whichever comes first.
