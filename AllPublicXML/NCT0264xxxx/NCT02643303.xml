      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 study of the CTLA-4 antibody, tremelimumab, and
      the PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab (MEDI4736), in combination with the tumor microenvironment
      (TME) modulator polyICLC, a TLR3 agonist, in subjects with advanced, measurable,
      biopsy-accessible cancers.
