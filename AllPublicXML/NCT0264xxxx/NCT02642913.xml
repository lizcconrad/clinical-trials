  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of enzalutamide with or without sorafenib at
      different doses. Enzalutamide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Enzalutamide blocks a protein called the androgen
      receptor. Experiments on liver cancer cells and animal models show that blocking the androgen
      receptor causes liver cancer to stop growing. Enzalutamide has not been approved to treat
      liver cancer. The investigators want to see if enzalutamide is safe for patients with liver
      cancer who have had their tumors grow on sorafenib. The investigators also want to see how
      safe and effective sorafenib and enzalutamide are for liver cancer patients that have never
      been treated with sorafenib. This is the first time enzalutamide and sorafenib are being used
      together. This treatment may not help treat the participant's cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, phase I/II study of enzalutamide with or without sorafenib
      to define the safety, MTD, and pharmacokinetic parameters of each regimen in advanced HCC
      patients.

      The study will have 4 parts as indicated in the Study Schema, an enzalutamide dose escalation
      (Part 1A), a sorafenib and enzalutamide dose escalation (Part 1B), and dose expansion cohorts
      for the Part 1A and Part 1B MTDs (Part 2). Dose escalation will occur using a standard 3 + 3
      design and is described in Section 4.2.1. For Part 2, the enzalutamide expansion cohort (Part
      2A), will enroll 10 patients and is exploratory in nature; however, it will allow for
      acquisition of additional PK sampling at the MTD, for determination of safety and efficacy.
      The MTD sorafenib and enzalutamide combination expansion (Part 2B) will be designed using a
      Simon minimax design to formally evaluate the 4-month PFS.

    <description>survival is defined as the time from the initiation of study treatment to HCC radiographic progression or death. Four month PFS is defined as the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 4 months. Patients that come out of study before evaluation of the 4 month endpoint without documented progression will be considered as events for the primary endpoint of 4 month PFS. Progression will be by RECIST 1.1.</description>

    <description>Will get enzalutamide, at the dose approved by the FDA for prostate cancer. If this dose has serious side effects, a lower dose will be given to new patients as they take part in the study. At the end of this part of the study, the recommended dose of enzalutamide will be set for all patients on this study. More patients will then be treated with this dose.</description>

    <description>Will get enzalutamide and sorafenib. The first group of patients will get the recommended dose of enzalutamide with sorafenib by mouth either once or twice daily. The dose of sorafenib you receive will depend on when the patient starts the study. At the beginning of the study, patients will be treated with a lower dose of sorafenib. If this dose does not have serious side effects, a higher dose will be given to new patients as they take part in the study.</description>

                  (using the Cockcroft-Gault equation)

          -  Patients must be on antiviral therapy per the local standard of care if active or
             occult hepatitis B (HBV) infection.

          -  Patients with active hepatitis C (HCV) may not be antiviral therapy.

          -  Patients with a history of hypertension should be well controlled (BP ≤ 140/90) on a

             absorption.

             methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study.
             All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a
             second method of birth control during the course of the study.

          -  Patients with history of liver transplantation may be eligible for the dose expansion
             cohorts (Parts 2A and 2B) of this study provided all eligibility criteria are met and
             provided the subject has not had any episodes of acute rejection or serious
             opportunistic infection within 3 months from enrollment.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating at
             screening.

               -  Certain immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus and sirolimus are prohibited
                  due to drug interaction risk thus liver transplant patients who require these
                  medications for immunosuppression are not eligible.

               -  Patients receiving everolimus at immunosuppressive dosages are eligible since the
                  everolimus doses used are lower than standard anti-neoplastic dosages and this
                  agent does not demonstrate anti-cancer activity in HCC. Everolimus does not
                  interact adversely like other immunosuppressive agents.
