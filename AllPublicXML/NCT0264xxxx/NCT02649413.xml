      The initial steroids dose for Nephrotic Syndrome is 60mg/1m2 for 6-4 weeks and the duration
      of the first steroid course is between 8 weeks to 6 months. The base of the initial dose for
      steroids Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome been put in the early 70s. In our study the
      investigators will adjusted the first steroids does to the response day. Our primary end
      point is : a lower adjusted dose is as good as the fix dose in the first year after
      diagnosis.

      About 90% of the patients will response to steroid therapy. The initial steroid dose is
      between 2mg/kg or 60mg/1m2 for 6-4 weeks and the duration of the first steroid course is
      between 8 weeks to 6 months. The bases of this treatment have been put in the early 70s.
      Since then most of the study were focused on the duration of the therapy with a results that
      8-12 weeks course is as good as 6 month. Studies have showed no difference in response rate
      between 2mg/kg to 60m2' although the difference in the dose in young children can rich to
      25%. Other retrospective analysis been show that patients who response in the first 7-9 days
      tend to have lass relapses than other patients. In our nephrology clinic the investigators
      there is ongoing clinical study on low doses of steroid therapy for relapse of nephritic
      syndrome with good results.
