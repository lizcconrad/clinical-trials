    <textblock>
      With rapid advances in molecular oncology, the availability of preclinical in vitro cell
      models and in vivo animal models with specific genomic aberrations is critical for improved
      prediction of clinical outcomes in cancer patients. One of the most widely used preclinical
      models is conventional cell lines, such as the NCI-60 panel of cell lines;these cell lines
      are widely used in preclinical testing for novel targeted drugs, partially owing to the low
      expense and reduced labor associated with cell culture compared with other preclinical
      models, such as animal xenografts. However, recent studies have shown that accumulation of
      genetic aberrations in cancer cell lines occurs with increasing passage number. These models
      also lack the heterogeneity of tumors and do not exhibit a proper microenvironment,
      highlighting the limitations of cell-based models. Consistent with this, Johnson et al.
      demonstrated that in vivo activities of the cell lines within the NCI-60 panel did not
      closely correlate with corresponding human cancers.

      Therefore, to better preserve the genomic integrity and tumor heterogeneity observed in
      patients, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are being used more frequently. PDX is
      generated by directly transplanting freshly resected patient tumors into immunocompromised
      murine hosts with or without an intermediate in vitro culture step. This PDX model is an
      improvement over cell lines because it can provide both an appropriate tumor microenvironment
      and heterogeneity of tumor cells. However, the engraftment success rates and growth rates of
      implanted tumors are highly variable depending on the tumor type, possibly due to
      insufficient numbers of hematopoietic cells and/or ineffective microenvironmental cues in the
      mouse stroma. The extent to which tumor cells from freshly resected tumors are able to
      withstand mechanical stresses and xenotransplantation barriers is also unclear. Furthermore,
      the use of PDX models for application in clinical oncology is limited owing to the time
      required for PDX establishment (&gt; 4 months) since most patients with refractory cancer live
      less than 1 year. Recently, PDC line models have been suggested as an alternative preclinical
      model to be used as a prediction tool for preclinical drug sensitivity.

      Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to overcome these potential barriers of
      pre-existing models by examining the capacity of PDC line models to recapitulate the
      histological and genomic features of primary patient tumors. In selected cases, the
      investigators screened drug sensitivity in vitro using PDC lines and compared the results
      with real-life clinical treatment outcomes.
