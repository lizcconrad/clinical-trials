      Background:

      Direct anterior approach to the hip (DAA) is being considered as one of the most promising
      minimally-invasive approaches in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Purpose of this study is to
      analyse influence of learning curve on clinical and radiographic outcome in direct anterior
      approach (DAA) for total hip replacement.

      Methods:

      The first 30 patients operated with DAA (group B) were compared to 39 patients operated by
      Hardinge approach (group A). Peri-and postoperative complications, Harris Hip Score (HHS),
      implant positioning, experienced pain and patient satisfaction were evaluated at a mean
      follow-up of 32 months.
