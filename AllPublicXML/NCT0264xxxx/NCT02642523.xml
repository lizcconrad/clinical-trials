  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are examining:

        1. the relationships of insulin levels and natriuretic peptide hormone levels, and

        2. the effects of administering an infusion of natriuretic peptide hormone on the breakdown
           of fat

      in healthy lean and otherwise healthy obese individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cardiac natriuretic peptide hormonal system may protect against the development of
      cardiometabolic risk. Epidemiologic studies have shown that in relatively healthy individuals
      without heart failure, low natriuretic peptide levels are associated with unfavorable
      cardiometabolic phenotypes, including higher blood pressure, obesity, higher insulin levels,
      and diabetes mellitus. Understanding the mechanisms behind the &quot;natriuretic peptide
      deficiency&quot; of obesity would illuminate an important way in which obesity interacts with the
      cardiovascular system.

      The investigators propose a prospective cross-over design in 40 healthy lean and otherwise
      healthy obese individuals. The investigators propose the following specific aims and
      hypotheses:

      Aim 1: To study the effect of hyperinsulinemia on the response of the natriuretic peptide
      system to salt loading.

      Hypothesis 1: Hyperinsulinemia will suppress natriuretic peptide levels in both obese and
      lean individuals.

      Aim 2: To examine the effect of an intravenous infusion of natriuretic peptide on acute
      markers of lipolysis.

      Hypothesis 2: An intravenous infusion of natriuretic peptide will raise acute markers of
      lipolysis in both obese and lean individuals.

    Preliminary data run on rat samples showed that this study question and design would not

    <description>Subjects will receive an intravenous infusion of recombinant human b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (Nesiritide) over 2 hours at 2 doses: 0.003 ug/kg/min for 1 hour, followed by 0.01 ug/kg/min for 1 hour. Nesiritide (Johnson and Johnson) is FDA-approved for the treatment of heart failure. Study investigators received approval from the FDA for an IND exemption for nesiritide in this study. While receiving the BNP infusion, subjects will also receive an intravenous infusion of normal (0.9%) saline over 2 hours. Subjects will receive a standardized high-salt diet for at least 6 days prior to this study visit.</description>
