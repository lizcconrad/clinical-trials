    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind (Sponsor unblinded), placebo controlled,
      dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile
      of GSK3389404 as single (Part 1) and multiple subcutaneous (SC) injections (Part 2) in
      healthy subjects. This study represents the first administration of GSK3389404 in humans to
      define the safety, tolerability and PK following single and multiple doses of GSK3389404 in
      healthy subjects.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to meet one
             of the contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study treatment until
             the last follow-up visit (Part 1 Day 60; Part 2 Day 113).

               -  Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia.

               -  Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below that meets
