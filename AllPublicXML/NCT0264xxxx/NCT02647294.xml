    <textblock>
      Patients with metabolic syndrome and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) will be
      randomly allocated for the treatment with n-3 PUFA (3.6 g/day) or placebo for 12 months. At
      the beginning and at the end of the study basic clinical and anthropometric data, as well as
      parameters of liver steatosis and fibrosis will be tested.

      Patients with metabolic syndrome and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) will be
      randomly allocated for the treatment with n-3 PUFA (3.6 g/day) or placebo for 12 months. At
      the beginning and at the end of the study basic clinical and anthropometric data will be
      recorded and the following parameters will be tested:

      panel of biochemistry and liver function tests: triglycerides, cholesterol, HDLcholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, serum bilirubin, liver tests, thyroid hormones, bile acids
      and their metabolites, albumin, total protein.

      Bioactive metabolites, Inflammatory markers Non-invasive serum markers of liver fibrosis and
      steatohepatitis. Hyaluronic acid, NAFLD fibrosis score, cytokeratine-18 fragments.
      Ultrasonography with non-invasive measurement of fibrosis and steatosis, magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy for visceral and liver fat determination.
