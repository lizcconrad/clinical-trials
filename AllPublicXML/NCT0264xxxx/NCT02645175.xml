  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study to evaluate the safety profile
      and ability of TW1025 oral solution to decrease fatigue in HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population designed to be enrolled is patients with histologically and/or
      cytologically confirmed breast cancer with clinical evidence of recurrent or progressive
      HER2-negative metastatic disease and planning to begin a chemotherapy regimen of physician's
      choice for HER2-negative MBC who have evidence of fatigue.

      An add-on study design to assess the superiority of TW1025 over placebo will be utilized in
      this study to evaluate whether TW1025 can decrease fatigue in patients with fatigue. The
      study will be conducted as a double-blind, randomized trial.

    <description>The Subject Global Impression of Change is a 7-point instrument in which the patient rates the change in their overall status since beginning the study drug (ranging from very much better, moderately better, a little better, about the same, a little worse, moderately worse, to very much worse). It has been used extensively for determination of minimally clinically significant differences in numerous oncology clinical trials. Patients will be asked to fill out the Global Impression of Change scale at week 9 after starting study therapy only.</description>
