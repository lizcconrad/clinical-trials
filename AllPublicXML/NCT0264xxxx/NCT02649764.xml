      The goal of this clinical research study is to study the safety of LY2606368 when given in
      combination with fludarabine and cytarabine. The effectiveness of the study drug combination
      when given to patients with relapsed or refractory AML or HRMDS will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of LY2606368 based on when you join the study. Up to 5 dose levels of LY2606368 will be
      tested. The first group enrolled will receive a low dose level. If no intolerable or serious
      side effects are seen in this group, the next group will receive a higher dose level. This
      will continue until the highest tolerable dose level of LY2606368 is found.

      Once the highest tolerable dose of LY2606368 is found, up to 20 participants will be enrolled
      to receive the drug at a dose that was found to be well tolerated in the earlier part of the
      study in order to further study the safety and effectiveness of the drug.

      All participants will also receive the same dose level fludarabine and cytarabine.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Treatment on this study is given in 2 phases: Induction and Consolidation. Each cycle is 28
      days.

      Induction Phase:

      You will receive 1 cycle of treatment during the Induction phase. You may be admitted to the
      inpatient leukemia service when you receive the study drugs.

      On Days 1-4, you will receive cytarabine by vein non-stop and fludarabine by vein over about
      2 hours. If you are over the age of 65, cytarabine and fludarabine will be given only on Days
      1-3.

      You will receive LY2606368 by vein over 2 hours for up to 5 days, depending on which dose
      level of LY2606368 you are assigned.

      If the disease does not respond during Cycle 1, you may be allowed to receive an additional
      Induction cycle, which will also be called Cycle 1. If you respond well to the study drug
      during Induction, you can move to Consolidation therapy.

      Consolidation Therapy:

      You may continue with Consolidation therapy for 3 additional cycles.

      During Days 1-3 of each cycle, you will receive cytarabine by vein non-stop and fludarabine
      by vein over 2 hours. On Days 1-2, you will receive LY2606368 by vein over 2 hours.

      Study Visits:

      Induction Phase:

      On Day 1 (or up to 7 days before) of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam.

      On Days 1, 3, and 5 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing.

      On Days 1 and 4 or 5 of Cycle 1, you will have an EKG.

      Every week, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests

      On Day 28 (Â± 3 days) of Cycle 1, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy to check
      the status of the disease.

      Any time the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have additional blood tests.

      Consolidation Therapy:

      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      Every week, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests

      Any time the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 5 cycles (2 cycles during Induction, 3
      cycles during Consolidation). You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days (+/- 5 days) after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan to check your heart function.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      If the disease appears to get better after the end-of-treatment visit, every 2-3 months for
      up to 2 years:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

      These tests can be performed by your local doctor.

      This is an investigational study. LY2606368 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is being used for research purposes only. Cytarabine and fludarabine are FDA approved and
      commercially available to treat certain types of leukemia. Their use in this study in
      combination with LY2606368 is considered investigational.

      Up to 40 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
