  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failure to thrive (FTT) is an expression for inadequate growth in the early childhood and
      thus, a sign of undernutrition. This study will include children with FTT, and compare with
      existing data from children with normal and excessive growth.

      The overall aim of this study is to explore whether 1) children who develop FTT with no
      organic explanation differ from healthy normal weight and overweight children in their basal
      level of appetite-regulating hormones and 2) if inadequate, normal and excessive growth in
      children can be partly predicted by variation in their gut microbiome and metabolome.
