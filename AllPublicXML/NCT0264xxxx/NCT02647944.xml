  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was being done to assess the stomach emptying effect of a maximum dose of 3 mg
      Liraglutide compared to placebo in subjects who are overweight or obese. Liraglutide is a
      medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare effects of liraglutide and placebo over 16 weeks
      on gastric motor functions, satiation, satiety and weight in obese patients. Subjects were
      randomized to liraglutide or placebo. Liraglutide or placebo was escalated by 0.6mg/day each
      week for 5 weeks and continued until week 16. At baseline and after 16 weeks' treatment, the
      investigators measured weight, gastric emptying of solids (GES), gastric volumes, satiation
      (maximum tolerated volume of liquid nutrient drink), and satiety. GES was also measured at 5
      weeks.

      During the study, the subjects received standardized dietetic and behavioral advice for
      weight reduction therapy. All subjects were given a standard text for information and met
      with a behavioral psychologist who has expertise in obesity treatment at the baseline visit
      and at visits at weeks 4,8, and 12. Additionally, the subjects had brief contact with a
      member of the study team every 4 weeks to inquire about their adherence to study protocol,
      any difficulties they were experiencing, whether they were reading their text assignments,
      and to answer any additional questions.

    <measure>Gastric Accommodation Volume at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks (approximately 1 hour after 99mTC injection)</time_frame>
    <description>Change between postprandial and fasting whole gastric volume by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging. A noninvasive SPECT method was used to measure gastric volume during fasting and 32 min after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication was given s.c. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans were obtained. Each scan required 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Overweight and obese adults (≥30 kg/m^2 or ≥27 kg/m^2 with an obesity-related
             co-morbidity).

          -  Subjects residing within 125 miles of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

          -  Healthy individuals with no unstable psychiatric disease and not currently on
             treatment for cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, hematological,
             neurological, or endocrine (other than hyperglycemia type 2 diabetes mellitus on
             metformin) disorders.

          -  Women of childbearing potential will be using an effective form of contraception, and
             have negative pregnancy tests within 48 hours of enrolment and before each radiation
             exposure.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent before any trial-related
             activities.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Weight exceeding 137 kilograms (safety limit of camera for measuring gastric volumes).

          -  Abdominal surgery other than appendectomy, Caesarian section or tubal ligation.

          -  Positive history of chronic gastrointestinal diseases, systemic disease that could
             affect gastrointestinal motility, or use of medications that may alter
             gastrointestinal motility, appetite or absorption, e.g., orlistat.

          -  Patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or Multiple
             Endocrine Neoplasia-type 2.

          -  Patients with a personal history of pancreatitis (acute or chronic)

          -  Significant untreated psychiatric dysfunction based upon screening with the Hospital
             Anxiety and Depression Inventory, a self-administered alcoholism screening test
             (AUDIT-C), and the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns (binge eating disorders
             and bulimia). If such a dysfunction is identified by a Hospital Anxiety Depression
             (HAD) score &gt;8 or difficulties with substance or eating disorders, the participant
             will be excluded and given a referral letter to his/her primary care doctor for
             further appraisal and follow-up.

          -  Intake of medication, whether prescribed or over the counter (except multivitamins),
             within 7 days of the study. Exceptions are birth control pill, estrogen replacement
             therapy, thyroxin replacement therapy and any medication administered for
             co-morbidities as long as they do not alter gastrointestinal motility including
             gastric emptying (GE) and gastric accommodation. For example, statins for
             hyperlipidemia, diuretics, β-adrenergic blockers,Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)
             inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists for hypertension, and metformin for type 2
             diabetes mellitus or prediabetes are permissible. In contrast, resin sequestrants for
             hyperlipidemia [which may reduce GE and reduce appetite, α2-adrenergic agonists for
             hypertension, or other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) receptor
             agonists (exenatide) or amylin analogs (pramlintide) are not permissible because they
             significantly affect GE and/or gastric accommodation.

          -  Hypersensitivity to the study medication, liraglutide.

        <title>Gastric Accommodation Volume at 16 Weeks</title>
        <description>Change between postprandial and fasting whole gastric volume by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging. A noninvasive SPECT method was used to measure gastric volume during fasting and 32 min after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication was given s.c. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans were obtained. Each scan required 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>
