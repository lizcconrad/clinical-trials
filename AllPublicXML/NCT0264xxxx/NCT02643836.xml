  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to evaluate impact of Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy on
      patients with Post-Concussive Syndrome with Rivermead Post Concussion Symptom Questionnaire
      (RPQ) as a primary outcome, followed by fatigue and mood as second and tertiary outcomes
      respectively. The investigators will also investigate brain tissue activity and oxygenation
      by evaluating brain wave activity via non-invasive quantitative electroencephalogram and near
      infrared spectroscopy testing pre and post study to better understand the metabolic effect of
      the PEMF intervention.

      The investigators hypothesize that the PEMF treatment will have an effect on improvement of
      brain metabolism as measured by Near Infrared Spectroscopy which will in turn assist with
      improvement of the chronic symptoms of cognitive deficits, mood and fatigue as related to
      Post-Concussive Syndrome.

      76 subjects will be enrolled for this experiment. Each subject will go through the screening
      procedure as outlined above. After consent and screening are complete each subject will
      receive a hat that delivers three 15 minute stimulations per day for the duration of 6 weeks.
      Each study subject will receive two hats, which contain the integrated PEMF device, this will
      be done to ensure continuity of treatment in case that one of the hats stops working due to
      the battery running out.

      The PEMF device to be used will be an investigational, battery powered custom-made stimulator
      able to deliver an electromagnetic field. This device operates at very low amplitude (0.05
      gauss magnetic field strength) and requires only watch batteries for power, which allows the
      technology to be portable (e.g., used at home), versatile, inexpensive, and safe, (vi) we
      have integrated the PEMF device into a wearable baseball hat to improve tolerance and
      compliance and can also monitor patient use in this configuration.

      The study device consists of a printed circuit board PEMF signal generator and an AAA
      battery-driven power supply encased in high density plastic, a solid wire-loop antenna
      covered in medical grade silicone, all of which are built into a standard baseball-style cap,
      with the antenna fitted around its largest internal circumference. The device was designed to
      be easily used and is activated by donning the cap. Once donned, a 15-minute treatment cycle
      starts and stops automatically. The device requires at least 2 hours between treatments, and
      cannot be activated again until that period has elapsed. A light on the power supply blinks
      while the unit is active. EEG and NIR will be obtained at visits 1, 2 and at three month
      follow up to better evaluate brain oxygenation and metabolism.

    <description>The investigators will recruit and enroll 76 patients (between 18 and 30 years of age) who have had persistent symptoms consistent with PCS for at least 4 weeks, but not more than 6 months, after the initial injury. The experimental group will contain 38 subjects. Each study subject will receive two hats, which contain the integrated PEMF device, this will be done to ensure continuity of treatment in case that one of the hats stops working due to the battery running out. The subjects will receive PEMF treatment for 15 minutes three times per day for 6 weeks. Upon enrollment and at the end of the 6-week treatment period, all subjects will undergo a comprehensive assessment that will include symptom inventories, neuropsychological tests, qEEG measurement and near-infrared spectroscopy. The investigators will conduct a 3-month follow-up to assess longer-term outcomes.</description>

The sham group will contain 38 subjects. Each study subject will receive two hats, which contain a de-activated PEMF device, the device will still be blinking to show sham treatment activity. The sham subjects will receive the sham treatment for 15 minutes three times per day for 6 weeks. Upon enrollment and at the end of the 6-week treatment period, all subjects will undergo a comprehensive assessment that will include symptom inventories, neuropsychological tests, qEEG measurement and near-infrared spectroscopy.

    <description>The PEMF device (Rio Grande Neurosciences - RGN) the investigators would be testing has been shown to have significant anti-inflammatory effects in animals and humans and an excellent safety profile in several clinical studies. Key findings demonstrated that PEMF-treated rodents with a closed-head TBI exhibited a 5-fold decrease in IL-1b in the cerebral spinal fluid, an outcome associated with decreased neuropathology and improved function.</description>
