  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational questionnaire based study measuring the degree of patient
      satisfaction with the outcomes of some expensive cytotoxic agents.

      The tested drugs are trastuzumab, lapatinib, sunitinib, m tor inhibitors, sorafenib,
      cetuximab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, erlotinib, rituximab, imatinib mesylate, gefitinib,
      abiraterone acetate, cabazitaxel, pertuzumab, fulvestrant, pemetrexate and crizotinib.

      The evaluation will be through a predesigned template questionnaire that will be applied to
      all the tested drugs. The questions are divided into five categories measuring five items,
      the negative impact of the drug on patient's finances, satisfaction with drug efficacy,
      toxicity and effect on quality of life, satisfaction with drug availability in the market and
      satisfaction with the received education from the treating physician about the drug before
      usage. A predesigned questionnaire based scoring system will categorizes the processed data
      to low, intermediate and high score for each of the five measured topics. The data will be
      processed and each drug will acquire low, moderate or high score. Subsequent recommendations
      for revision of the drug price, cost effective analysis studies, physician education about
      drug pharmaceutical perspectives will be elaborated for some drugs. The study will clarify
      the most annoying and frequently reported side effect for each drug and will suggest
      recommendations for its treatment.
