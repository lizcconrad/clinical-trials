    <textblock>
      This study provides an evaluation of 30 patients in 3 years, from the Unified Health System
      (SUS) irrespective of region of the country, signed with clinical Parkinson's disease in its
      intermediate stage and that the drug therapy is limited by side effects or beneficial effects
      provided by prior medication no longer be obtained even at high doses and have therefore the
      indication for treatment with deep brain stimulation.

      The aim of this retrospective study is to compare motor and non-motor (olfactory, pain,
      cognition and metabolism) symptoms of the effects of deep brain stimulation target to the
      nucleus globus pallidus versus the subthalamic nucleus in patients with ParkinsonÂ´s disease.
