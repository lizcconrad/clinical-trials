      Primary outcome: Research participants and their network contacts will be followed over 6
      months to assess whether a social work case management protocol results in reduction of
      trauma services recidivism and criminal violence arrests.

    <textblock>
      Allegheny County, PA continues to suffer between 100-120 homicides each year, with perhaps
      2-3 times as many gunshot injuries that require hospitalization. Firearm homicides
      overwhelmingly affect African American men aged 15-35. Building on prior efforts in violence
      prevention, the investigators propose to launch a hospital trauma service intervention that
      will take advantage of a &quot;teachable moment&quot; in the emergency room. All four hospitals
      providing Level I Trauma services in Allegheny County have agreed to host the program, an
      evidence-based effort developed by the National Network of Hospital Violence Intervention
      (NNHVI). Adaptation of the NNHVI model will focus on the social networks of gunshot victims
      as well as the victims themselves. Intervention efforts will range from job training and
      mentoring to relocation to different communities. The investigators will offer the
      opportunity to participate in the research and receive the intervention to all gunshot
      victims identified in county Level I trauma services. Participants in the research protocol
      will be asked to recruit their high-risk social network members for the intervention.

    <description>The National Network of Hospital Violence Intervention (NNHVI) suggests that intervening when gunshot victims are receiving treatment in hospital trauma services may be effective in linking high-risk individuals to appropriate case management services, and that this service linkage may lower the risk of further violence. Our adaptation of the NNHVI model will focus on the social networks of gunshot victims as well as the victims themselves. Intervention efforts will range from job training and mentoring to relocation to different communities.</description>
