      The objective of this study is to compare infection rates between primary, delayed primary
      and vacuum assisted closures in contaminated and dirty/infected laparotomy wounds.

      Social, demographic, surgical, postsurgical and medical variables were registered. A
      descriptive analysis expressed as total and percentages, medians and interquartile ranges.
      Comparison between groups was made using the Kruskal-Wallis, U-Mann Whitney or Chi-squared as
      appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

    <description>A double antibiotic scheme with a cephalosporin and metronidazole is used as prophylaxis, and the fascia is closed with a continuous Polyglycolic Acid 0 suture. The VACÂ® system is then used, with change of dressings every 48 hrs. The wound is closed using Polypropylene 2-0 only after healthy granulation tissue and no signs of infection are present.</description>
