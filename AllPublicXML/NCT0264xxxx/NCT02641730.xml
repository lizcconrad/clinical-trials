      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab for the
      treatment of participants with palmoplantar pustulosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), multicenter (when more than
      one hospital works on a medical research study) placebo-controlled (an inactive substance
      that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a
      clinical study) study in participants with palmoplantar pustulosis. The study will consist of
      3 phases: screening phase (up to 6 weeks), treatment period (week 0 - week 60) and
      observational period (up to week 84). Participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups (200 milligram [mg] guselkumab, 100 mg guselkumab or placebo group) using a stratified
      block randomization method in a 1:1:1 ratio at Week 0 and Group III (placebo) participants
      will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups at Week 16. Participants will
      primarily be assessed for change from baseline in Palmo-Plantar Pustular Area and Severity
      Index (PPPASI) total score at Week 16. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The PPPASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity and area of palmoplantar pustulosis lesions and their response to therapy. The PPPASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. Higher score indicates worsening.</description>
