    <description>AYMES Rome is a powder, designed to be mixed with 250 ml water to make up a juice style ONS. When made up AYMES Rome provides 300 kcal (1 kcal / ml) and 10.7 g protein. It is not designed to be used as a sole source of nutrition. It is a Food for Special Medical Purposes (FSMP) and must therefore be used under medical supervision.</description>
