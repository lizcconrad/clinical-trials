  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the effects of an innovative child-friendly
      remind-to-move treatment (RTM) treatment by comparing it with constraint-induced movement
      therapy (CIMT) on upper extremity outcomes in children with hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy. In an
      evaluator-blinded randomized controlled trial, 73 children, among of whom 20 in Manual
      Ability Classification System level I, 38 level II, and 15 level III, were recruited from 3
      special schools and randomized to receive 75-hour RTM (n=25) and CIMT (n=24) programme over
      15-weekdays, and conventional treatment (n=24). The primary outcomes were Jebsen-Taylor Hand
      Function Test (JTHFT) and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP-II) Subtest 3
      for assessing the motor efficiency at baseline, posttest, and 1- and 3-month follow-up.

    <description>RTM involved a wristwatch device worn on more-affected arm which emitted sensory cueing continuously to remind the children to use the more-affected hand to engage in daily activities or complete bimanual tasks intensively, 5 hour per day, 5 days every week, for 3 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>children were encouraged to wear a customer-made volar resting splint that extended from below the elbow to the fingertips on their noninvolved hands for 5 hour daily except for toileting, writing and specific physical sports, for 3 weeks. Each child was supervised by one therapist to complete structured unimanual practice with the affected hand during the supervised session, 5 days every week, for 3 consecutive weeks.</description>
