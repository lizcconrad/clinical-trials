  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adults between 18- and 65-years in China,the prevalence of migraine is 9.3% in general.
      Migraine is a heterogeneous condition that may produce a range of symptom profiles and
      various degrees of disability.The disability resulting from migraine can be severe imposing a
      considerable health burden upon the sufferer and society. The purpose of this study, using
      topiramate as the control, is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Danzhen for the
      prophylaxis of migraine in a &quot;real-world&quot;setting.Patients are asked to maintain a detailed
      headache diary via headache diary APP throughout the treatment period.
