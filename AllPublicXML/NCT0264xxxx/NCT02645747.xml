      The objective of this retrospective chart review is to evaluate drug utilization, usage
      patterns and indication of effectiveness Eylea in the routine clinical (real-life) management
      of patients who suffer from ME(Macular Edema), secondary to CRVO(Central Retinal Vein
      Occlusion ), and who started treatment with Eylea for this indication.

    <description>The source population of this study is patients who suffer from visual impairment due to ME secondary to CRVO. In order to ensure the representativeness of the study population, the number of Belgian patients which started Eylea treatment during the brief period between the 1st of June 2014 and the 28th of February 2015 were taken into account. However, data of patients diagnosed with neovascular glaucoma secondary to CRVO will be excluded.</description>

    <intervention_name>aflibercept (Eylea, Bay 86-5321)</intervention_name>
    <description>Eylea (intravitreal aflibercept) is an anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) drug indicated for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME) and visual impairment due to macular edema (ME) secondary to central or branched retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO, both branch and central, is the second most common type of retinal vascular disorders after diabetic retinal disease. Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is characterized by an obstruction of the central retinal vein combined with variable amounts of retinal arterial insufficiency.</description>
