  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant obstructive jaundice is a common complication of advanced stage cholangiocarcinoma,
      gallbladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer. In biliary stricture by malignancy, biliary
      drainage with placement of self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) for palliation is the therapy of
      choice in these patients. When compared to plastic stents, SEMS present a significantly
      decreased risk of recurrent biliary obstruction. SEMS are also more cost-effective than
      plastic stents in patients with a life expectancy of longer than 4 months. However, despite
      their numerous benefits, SEMS become occluded in up to 50 % of patients in the first 6-8
      months.

      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been used to treat malignancies of the liver since the
      early 1990s. Other studies have investigated its role in diseases of the colon and esophagus.
      More recently, this technique has been recognized for its potential in palliative treatment
      of malignant biliary strictures. RFA uses a high-frequency alternating current to generate
      heat and achieve coagulative necrosis when in contact with tissue. Within the bile duct, RFA
      appears to be safe and may result in decreased benign epithelial hyperplasia and tumor
      ingrowth. However, RFA along with placement of SEMS has not been well studied. On the other
      hand, newly developed RFA catheter (ELRA®) showed the feasibility and safety in south korea,
      recently.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the Efficacy and safety of endobiliary RFA by
      using a novel RF catheter (ELRA®) on maintaining the patency of endobiliary metal drainage in
      patients with malignant biliary strictures.

    <description>Side viewing endoscope or PTCS scope can be used for all procedures. Cholangiogram is performed to confirm the stricture location, length and diameter. And then, RF catheter (ELRA®) is advanced over a guide wire at the level of the biliary stricture and ablation at 7-10 watts for a time period of 60-120s according to the length is conducted.
After performance of RFA, metal stents are inserted to ensure adequate decompression and bile drainage.</description>
