  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to adapt and preliminarily validate an intervention based
      on evidence based approaches to assist smoking parents and other family members of inner-city
      children ages 4 to 12 with asthma to stop smoking.This study aims (1) to adapt existing
      guideline-based materials used in adult medicine to create a system- and provider-level
      intervention for pediatrics and (2) to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of (a)
      procedures to recruit inner-city, ethnic minority parents and (b) intervention procedures,
      and to estimate intervention effects.

      Investigators will adapt guideline-based interventions used in adult medicine. The
      intervention consists of two system-level interventions (chart reminders to prompt providers
      to ask about in-home smoking and a State Quit-line referral system), and a provider-level
      intervention (training in the PHS Guidelines, in motivational interviewing, and on how to use
      the system-level intervention). Investigators will implement the study in the Bellevue
      Pediatric Asthma Clinic and the pediatric clinic at Lincoln Hospital using a two group (pre
      intervention control group / post-intervention treatment group) pilot study to test the
      feasibility and preliminary effects of a multi-level (i.e., system and provider)
      intervention. The primary outcome is provider adherence to tobacco use treatment guidelines,
      which will be assessed by conducting parent exit interviews with 200 smoking parents (100
      pre-intervention [control group] and 100 post-intervention [treatment group]). Preliminary
      intervention outcomes will be collected through the parent exit interviews (i.e., baseline)
      and 2-month post-baseline interviews with the control and treatment parents. Providers will
      also be interviewed regarding their satisfaction with the intervention.

    <description>Investigators at New York University Medical School, Bellevue and Lincoln Hospital will work closely to (1) develop chart reminders appropriate for each of their clinics (2) to prompt providers to ask about in home smoking at every medical visit and (3) to establish a New York Quit line referral system in the pediatric practice, including clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each step. The New York State Quit line service includes proactive telephone calls with mailings of self-help material, free nicotine replacement therapy for those who qualify, and referrals to local treatment programs, ensuring that health literacy levels of materials is maximized, amending the training curriculum for providers as necessary, and modifying patient education materials that are part of the provider tool kit to focus on the negative impact of secondhand smoke.</description>
