  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial from Asian countries to
      compare the effect and safety of right median nerve stimulation versus traditional treatment
      for comatose patients at the early stage following traumatic brain injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity and one of the
      greatest unmet needs in public health. The most severe injury can lead to a poor outcome and
      prolonged coma of the victims. It is estimated that ten to fifteen percent of the severe TBI
      patients are discharged in a prolonged coma or a vegetative state. However, no treatment
      measure to data has been proven robustly to alter the pace of recovery or improve
      neurological outcome of the comatose patients following TBI.

      Although right median nerve electrical stimulation (RMNS) has been used clinically for more
      than two decades, no strong evidence of efficacy was generated because of the limitations in
      the past trials including a small sample size or the inappropriate study design. In the
      present study, a multicenter research network with inclusion of neurotrauma centers from
      China, India, Nepal and Kazakhstan was established with the aim to validate the efficacy and
      safety of a promising intervention strategy for traumatic coma at early stage. Since RMNS is
      a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive technique with a good safety profile, our study will
      probably add more evidence to the treatment of traumatic coma in Asian countries.

    <description>Right median nerve electrical stimulation (RMNS) is administered via a pair of lubricated one-inch square rubber surface electrodes pasted on the volar aspect of the right distal forearm over the median nerve. An electrical neuromuscular stimulator supplied trains of asymmetric biphasic pluses at an amplitude of 20 milliamps with a pulse width of 300 microseconds at 40 Hz for 20 sec/min. The RMNS treatment continues 8 hours per day for two weeks.</description>
