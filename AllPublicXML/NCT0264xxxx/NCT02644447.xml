  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellular therapies are rapidly progressing fields and have shown immense promise in the
      treatment of damaged ovarian function. The purpose of this study is to determine safety and
      efficacy of intra-ovarian injection of allogeneic HUC-MSCs with injectable collagen scaffold
      in women with Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) and to study the preliminary efficacy of
      HUC-MSCs with injectable collagen scaffold injection on ovarian function improvement.

      The purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic potency of the HUC-MSCs with
      injectable collagen scaffold transvaginal injection for POF women. The serum of each patient
      was kept and sent for laboratory test before the surgery. HUC-MSCs were isolated and cultured
      in vitro and the biomarkers of HUC-MSCs were detected using Flow cytometry detection. The
      HUC-MSCs with injectable collagen scaffold were then injected directly into bilateral
      ovaries. The outcomes of patients were examined after the injection. The patients are
      monitored for signs of follicle growth and growing follicles are stimulated with exogenous
      hormones, followed by oocyte retrieval and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).
