  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Liver cancer begins in the cells of the liver. It can be treated with chemotherapy,
      radiation, or even a liver transplant. A less invasive treatment may be able to help some
      people with liver cancer. It is called percutaneous transarterial embolization (TAE). For
      TAE, a material is injected into blood vessels to block the blood flow that is feeding the
      tumor. Researchers want to test a new material for TAE that may shrink tumors and can be seen
      on x-ray and CT images. The embolization may sometimes be combined with thermal ablation, or
      cooking tumors with needles that deliver heat by electricity or microwave.

      Objective:

      To test an embolization material called an LC LUMI beads. To see if it can block blood
      vessels that provide blood to cancerous tumors and to see how the beads look on x-ray and CT
      images.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 85 years old who have been diagnosed with liver cancer

      Design:

      Participants will have routine blood tests, physical exams, and x-rays.

      Participants will be screened with blood tests, physical exam, and medical history. They will
      have a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis. This will include a contrast
      drink and a contrast (dye) injected in the veins.

      Participants will be admitted to the clinic. They will repeat the screening tests.

      Participants may have other tests. These may include x-rays, other scans, or ultrasound.

      Participants will be evaluated for general anesthesia.

      They will get counseling about the procedure.

      Participants will get anesthesia. The LC LUMI beads will be injected into blood vessels. The
      beads contain iodine, which makes them visible by x-ray and by a CT scan machine.

      Participants will have follow-up visits for 12 months. They will have CT scans and/or other
      radiologic tests.

      Background:

        -  Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer globally with an
           increasing incidence worldwide.

        -  Management of hepatic malignancies from primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) or
           metastatic disease involves a multidisciplinary approach of surgery and chemotherapy and
           in the case of HCC, transplant, anti-VEGF sorafenib, or local or regional image guided
           therapies.

        -  Thermal ablation (RFA or MWA) and transarterial embolization (TAE) are minimally
           invasive image guided local or regional therapies that have been extensively studied for
           decades, and more recently and to a lesser extent have been studied together as a
           combination therapy.

        -  LC Bead LUMI , a radiopaque embolic bead product (company code BTG 13-002), is an
           imageable spherical embolic product that can be visualised by X-ray based imaging (e.g.,
           fluoroscopy and CT).

        -  The beads are non-resorbable microspheres with calibrated size ranges that occlude
           arteries for the purpose of blocking the blood flow to a target tissue.

        -  LC Bead LUMI are intended to be used for the embolization of hypervascular tumors and
           arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

      Objectives:

      -To determine the imaging characteristics of radiopaque beads in the treatment of hepatic
      tumors using bead embolization.

      Eligibility:

        -  At least greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  Patients with pathologically proven hepatic-dominant neoplasm that might otherwise be
           candidates for standard clinical TAE with beads

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2

        -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function per laboratory parameters

        -  Patients with minor allergies to iodine will also be excluded, all other
           non-iodine-related exclusion criteria are standard of care exclusion criteria for TAE

      Design:

        -  Number of Participants: 30

        -  Recruitment Time Frame: 2 years

        -  Type of Study: Feasibility study

        -  This is a pilot study to assess the characteristics of radio-opaque bland beads during
           TAE in the treatment of hepatic malignancies. Patients may also receive thermal ablation
           treatment in conjunction with TAE if clinically indicated, although comparison of bead
           treatment with or without thermal ablation is not part of the study s aim.

        -  Imaging evaluation of this therapy may be performed at regular intervals following
           completion of treatment, and will be governed by standard conventional imaging regimen
           post treatment.

        -  The choice of which combination of imaging (CT, Cone beam CT, or fluoroscopy) and when
           to image, will be made by the clinical care team for the patient, based upon
           multidisciplinary recommendations and NIH Clinical Center customary use and standard of
           care, and will be purely clinical decisions (not research-related).

        -  The participants will have a diagnosed hepatic malignancy, and be eligible to undergo
           transarterial embolization and thermal ablation under general anesthesia. The LC LUMI
           bead will be used in the transarterial embolization procedure.

        -  Study period is 12 months from the time of initial treatment.

        -  Patients will be evaluated in multidisciplinary GI medical oncology clinic and up to 30
           patients will be enrolled over 1 year to accrue 20 evaluable patients.
