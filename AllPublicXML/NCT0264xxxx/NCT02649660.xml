  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether platelets are biochemically and functionally altered in
      Fabry disease (FD) and therefore possibly implicated in FD manifestations such as
      cerebrovascular events. To test this hypothesis the investigators aim to compare platelet and
      plasma lipid profiles, as well as platelet function and coagulation parameters of FD patients
      and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease (FD) is a severe X-linked inborn error of the lysosomal glycosphingolipid
      metabolism. FD patients have significantly increased risks for cardiac and cerebrovascular
      events, which can also occur early and in absence of the typical FD symptoms. However, the
      pathophysiological mechanisms leading to vascular occlusion and ischemia in FD are largely
      unclear. Prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular events is usually based on empirical
      anti-platelet therapy.

      Prothrombotic states and partially activated platelets have been reported for FD patients.
      Platelets contain glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), and have
      lysosomal α-galactosidase activity. To investigate whether the lack of or the reduced
      α-galactosidase enzyme activity present in Fabry disease affects platelet lipid metabolism
      the investigators plan to perform LC-MS-based lipidomics analyses of platelets and plasma in
      FD patients and healthy controls. To assess whether platelets are functionally altered in FD,
      the investigators aim to determine the activation status, activability, aggregability and
      other parameters along with plasma markers of coagulation using flow cytometry, aggregometry
      and immunoassays.
