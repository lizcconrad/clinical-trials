  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to confirm the efficacy of cartilage regeneration (or stem
      cell transplant) simultaneously performed with high tibial osteotomy. Furthermore, as
      conventional microfracture surgery on injured cartilage has a disadvantage of the replacement
      by fibrocartilage, this research intends to prove the excellence over the conventional
      therapy by proving a hyaline cartilage regeneration of injured cartilage by stem cell.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence rate of arthritis in medial knee joint is increasing with an increase in
      senile diseases and there are two main types of therapy: total knee replacement surgery and
      high tibial osteotomy. Generally, the elderly prefer total knee replacement surgery and
      younger people prefer high tibial osteotomy. High tibial osteotomy is a procedure to reduce
      pain and to prevent the progression of osteoarthritis by evenly dispersing excessive load on
      medial knee joint attributed to varus deformity on the overall knee joint through the
      correction of abnormal anatomical axis arising from degenerative changes in articular
      cartilage. The clinical outcomes of high tibial osteotomy are reported as favorable but this
      high tibial osteotomy has a limitation in terms of the regeneration of injured cartilage.
      Thus, a research to concurrently perform additional therapy for the regeneration of injured
      cartilage with the osteotomy was released. Microfracture surgery on injured cartilage,
      autologous chondrocyte implantation, autologous bone marrow injections and adipose derived
      stem cell injections are typical examples. However, there is not any solid proof for the
      excellence of concurrent therapy over a therapy using only the osteotomy in the regeneration
      of injured cartilage. Therefore, this research is designed to conduct a research to prove the
      excellence of the direct transplantation of stem cell into injured cartilage over the
      existing concurrent therapy in the regeneration of injured cartilage. Besides, this research
      intends to compare the cartilage regeneration capabilities of bone marrow and adipose-derived
      stem cell.
