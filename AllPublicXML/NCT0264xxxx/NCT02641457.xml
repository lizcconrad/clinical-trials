      Aflibercept (Eylea®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®) are an anti-VEGF, but there are differences
      between the two drugs. To determine and compare whether intraocular aflibercept and
      ranibizumab decreases rubeosis iridis (RI) in patients with neovascular glaucoma (NVG).

      Aflibercept (Eylea®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®) are an anti-VEGF, but there are differences
      between the two drugs. Lucentis is administered in the form of smaller molecules, which is
      thought to give Lucentis an advantage over Eylea in its ability to penetrate the eye's retina
      and halt abnormal blood vessel growth contributing to advanced macular degeneration and
      scarring that causes blindness. They may have a role in treating ocular disorders involving
      fibrovascular proliferation. To determine and compare whether intraocular aflibercept and
      ranibizumab decreases rubeosis iridis (RI) in patients with neovascular glaucoma (NVG).

        Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Ischemic central retina vein occlusion (CRVO) within 3 months of enrollment as per the
             following inclusion criteria

          -  Three of the following clinical tests must be present to demonstrate ischemic CRVO

          -  Visual Acuity 20/200 or worse

          -  Loss of 1-2e isopter on Goldmann Visual field (Kwon et al. 2001)

          -  Electroretinogram demonstrating b wave amplitude less than 60% of A wave.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Angle neovascularization greater than 3 clock hours with IOP over 30 (Neovascular
             glaucoma)

          -  Any previous retinal laser photocoagulation to the study eye

          -  Any previous intravitreal injection in study eye (triamcinolone or other)
