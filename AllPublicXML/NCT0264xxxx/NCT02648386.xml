  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is one of the commonest complications in men after rectal cancer
      treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous bone
      marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) or allogeneic human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells (HUC-MSCs) combined with NeuroRegen scaffold transplantation in men with erectile
      dysfunction after rectal cancer treatment.
