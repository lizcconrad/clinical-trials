      Dosing regimen will be decided at a dosing conference prior to cohort 2-8. Dose levels can be
      increased, maintained or reduced both between cohorts but also within same cohort. In each
      cohort 3 patients with Parkinson's Disease will be treated for 3 days, with increasing dose
      each day.

      If deemed appropriate the dosing period may be extended to 4 days. In addition, 3 extra
      cohorts 9 to 11 are additional cohorts that might be used, if necessary to address the study
      objectives. Up to 33 patients can be enrolled

Before initiation of cohort 2-8, dosages will be decided at a dosing conference prior to each cohort. Dose levels can be increased, maintained or reduced both between cohorts but also within same cohort. In each cohort 3 patients with Parkinson's Disease will be included
In addition, 3 extra cohorts 9 to 11 are additional cohorts that might be used, if necessary to address the study objectives. Then up to 33 patients can be enrolled.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson Disease (consistent with the UK
             Parkinson`s Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria for the Diagnosis of PD).

          -  The patient's Hoehn and Yahr Staging score is ≤ 3 in the &quot;ON&quot; state.

          -  The patient experiences motor fluctuations with at least 2.5 hours of &quot;OFF&quot; periods in
             the awake time and has predictable morning &quot;OFF&quot; episodes, which have been consistent
             within the past 4 weeks.

          -  The patient currently has a good response to L-DOPA and has been receiving a stable
             dose of L-DOPA (≥3 doses per day of standard L-DOPA or ≥3 doses per day of Carbidopa
