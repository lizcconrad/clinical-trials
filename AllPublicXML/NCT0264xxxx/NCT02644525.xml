  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Many people who live in west or central Africa are at risk for infection from a very small
      worm called Loa loa. This infection is acquired through the bite of a fly. Baby worms called
      microfilariae live in the blood. The infection most commonly causes skin itching, mild
      temporary limb swelling, and sometimes a adult worm can be seen in the white of the eye of an
      infected individual. Very rarely, people with this infection can develop problems with the
      kidneys and heart as a result of the worm s effect on the immune system. Because the vast
      majority of people with the infection have minimal symptoms, people in Cameroon usually do
      not get treated. But infection with Loa loa can cause serious problems in people who are
      being treated for infections with other parasites (namely, river blindness and lymphatic
      filariasis). Researchers want to find out of a drug called imatinib can treat Loa loa
      infection so that patients with this infection can safely receive other drugs to cure river
      blindness and lymphatic filariasis. Researchers believe imatinib can be a safe drug to use on
      Loa loa, because in the lab this drug kills the worms slowly, whereas other drugs which can
      cause treatment reactions usually kill the worms very quickly.

      Objective:

      To test if imatinib can treat Loa loa infection by killing the worms slowly.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-65 with non-severe Loa loa infection who are otherwise healthy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and blood and urine tests.

      Participants will have a baseline visit. This will include a physical exam and blood and
      urine tests. It may include a stool sample. Participants will be randomly assigned to get 1
      dose of either imatinib or a placebo

      Participants will return to the clinic every day for 1 week, then once a week for 3 weeks.
      Visits will include a physical exam and blood tests. They will have urine tests in the first
      week.

      Participants will have follow-up visits 3, 6, and 12 months after taking the imatinib or
      placebo. These include a physical exam and blood tests. They may include urine and stool
      samples.

      If participants develop side effects, they will be treated for them.

    <textblock>
      With the discovery that people experiencing severe treatment reactions following mass drug
      administration (MDA) with ivermectin for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control were
      co-infected with Loa loa, there has been a need for new filaricidal drugs. Currently, Loa loa
      infection, considered relatively nonpathogenic, is not treated in endemic areas. However,
      because treatment for Loa loa can result in toxicity in people who are being concurrently
      treated for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, finding a new treatment for Loa loa has
      become a priority. Imatinib has recently been shown to be microfilaricidal in vitro at
      concentrations physiologically achievable after a single oral dose in humans. Since
      ivermectin-based treatment reactions are associated with microfilarial (MF) concentrations
      &lt;25000 MF/ml and with rapid killing, we are studying subjects with Loa loa infections with
      low microfilarial levels (&lt;2,500 MF/mL), levels that have been safely treated previously with
      ivermectin. We aim to perform a dose escalation study to identify the minimum single oral
      dose that will be effective as a slow microfiaricidal drug against Loa loa. If imatinib is
      found to be effective and have kinetics which favor slow microfilarial killing, then this can
      serve as the basis for a larger study in which patients with very high microfilarial loads
      would be treated, as this is the at risk population in current MDA campaigns. This is a
      double blind, randomized, pilot phase 2 dose-escalation trial. Subjects (n = 5) will receive
      a dose of imatinib at 200, 400, 600, or 800mg. Symptoms and blood microfilarial concentration
      will be assessed at baseline, daily for the first 7 days, then weekly for the next 21 days,
      then at 3, 6, and 12 months. These will be compared against an untreated placebo-controlled
      group of 5 subjects who will have the same data collected at these respective days.
