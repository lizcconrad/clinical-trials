             disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac sprue).

          -  History of hypersensitivity to exenatide.

          -  Contraindications or warnings according to the specific label(s) for EE and/or LNG
             therapy.

          -  Women that are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant.
