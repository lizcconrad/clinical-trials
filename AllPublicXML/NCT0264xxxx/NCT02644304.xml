    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive aged
      women and affects approximately 5-12 % of the female population.

      In 2003 in Rotterdam , Rotterdam diagnostic criteria were redefined PCOS as affected
      individuals must have two out of the following three criteria:

        1. Oligo- and/or anovulation, (ovulation occurs less than once every 35 days).

        2. Hyperandrogenism, clinical signs include hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and frank
           virilization, while chemical indicators include raised concentrations of total
           testosterone and androstenedione , and elevated free androgen index.

        3. Polycystic ovaries on sonographic examination, presence of 12 or more follicles in
           either ovary measuring 2-9 mm in diameter, increased ovarian volume more than 10 cm3
           and/or increase in stromal echogenicity. Clearly, according to the Rotterdam diagnostic
           criteria, the majority of women with PCOS can be diagnosed without the need of
           laboratory examinations.

      Clomiphene citrate (CC) is still the first-line medication for the induction of ovulation. It
      is an anti-estrogenic compound made up of two isomers, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene; the
      latter being the more potent of the two. It is a non-steroidal compound closely resembling
      estrogen. CC acts by blocking estrogen receptors, particularly in the hypothalamus, thereby
      signaling a lack of circulating estrogens and inducing a change in the pulsatile release of
      gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This induces release of follicle stimulating hormone
      from the anterior pituitary and is often enough to set the cycle of events leading to
      ovulation into motion.

      Cabergoline, ergot-derived dopamine agonists with a very long half life, is an effective
      prolactin suppressor. Cabergoline oral administration contains a weekly dose of 0.5 - 3 mg,
      which could be increased, if needed, to twice a week. This medicine has slight dopamine
      agonistic side effects, headache being the most common one. Treatment in the very beginning
      should start with a partial dose (half a pill) at bedtime with a small amount of food. Low
      incidence of side effects and its weekly dose has made Cabergoline a choice drug for
      treatment of related diseases.
