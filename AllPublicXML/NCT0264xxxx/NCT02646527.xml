    <textblock>
      Background: There has been significant progress in symptom management, pain relief and
      improvement of quality of life in patients nearing death by implementing palliative care
      programs. Existential and dignity related issues, such as loss of autonomy and sense of
      meaning or feeling a burden to others are frequent reasons for psychological distress and
      desire for hastened death. Dignity Therapy (DT), developed by Chochinov et al., is a brief,
      individualized psychotherapy for the purpose of relieving distress by directly addressing
      dignity conserving factors.

      Aims: To test whether the inclusion of a patient's partner or designated family member into
      Dignity Therapy (DT+) could mitigate psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in both,
      the patient nearing the end of his life experiencing increased psychological distress and the
      patient's partner/family member compared to the control groups receiving Dignity Therapy in
      the single setting (DT) or standard palliative care (SPC).

      Methods and design: In this randomized controlled trial a total of 159 patients with a
      diagnosis of an advanced disease and poor prognosis (life expectancy &lt; 6 months) who receive
      palliative care either in the Palliative Care Centre of the University Hospital Zurich (USZ)
      or the Clinic Susenberg, Zurich, or in the &quot;Lighthouse&quot; Hospice Zurich, will be randomly
      assigned to either DT+, DT, or SPC in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients will be pre-screened and
      included if they report increased psychological distress (anxiety, depression using the
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale=HADS). The therapy is guided by trained therapists and
      consists of 3 audiotaped sessions. The main focus of the intervention is to invite patients
      to reflect on their most important achievements, roles or other things in their lives or
      things that they would most want remembered. On completion, the audiorecording is transcribed
      and edited to provide a clear and readable narrative, the generativity document, which can be
      passed to a person of the patient's choice. DT+, in contrast to the original intervention
      developed by Chochinov et al., is a systemic approach in which patient's partners or
      designated family members are included.

    <description>Dignity Therapy (DT) is a brief psychotherapeutic intervention developed by Chochinov (2012) which has been shown to enhance the end of life experience in people with life-limiting conditions. DT focuses on helping patients with terminal illnesses to go over things that are most meaningful to them and document their legacy. Dignity Therapy+ (DT+) involves patient and partner/family asking questions about their most important achievements, roles and other important aspects of life. DT+ encourages patients saying things to loved ones that have remained unsaid. DT+ consists of 3 sessions (1. introduction (30'); 2. main session (60'), 3. final session (30')) and will be conducted by a trained therapist. All therapy session will be audio-taped, transcribed verbatim by the study coordinator, edited by the therapist and returned to the patient or the patient and partner/family as a 'generativity document'.</description>
