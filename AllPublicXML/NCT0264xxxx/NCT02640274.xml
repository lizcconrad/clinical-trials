  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The European guidelines of cardiovascular disease prevention recommend treatment modalities,
      such as lifestyle changes in order to minimize the risk of further cardiac event after a
      myocardial infarction (MI). However, a considerable gap exists between guidelines and their
      implementation in clinical practise. Further, less is known about the impact of different
      interventions on patient's knowledge, skills and confidence necessary for self-management
      after MI.

      Aim: To evaluate and compare the short- and long-term effects of an individual nurse-led
      counselling programme together with usual care for patients early discharged after MI on
      self-management behaviour.

    <description>The intervention is an individual nurse-led counselling programme in addition to usual care. The intervention includes 3 outpatient clinic visits (at weeks 2, 14 and 26) and two telephone calls (at weeks 4 and 16) by a cardiovascular nurse during the first 6 months early discharged. The counselling focuses on cardiac risk reduction behaviour based on guidelines issued by European Society of Cardiology and self-management support.</description>
