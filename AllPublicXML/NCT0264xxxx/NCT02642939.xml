  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, multicenter, single-stage phase II study of mifepristone in
      patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have failed two or more previous chemotherapy
      regimens.

      The Investigator plans to enroll 18 evaluable patients in Stage 1, and additionally up to 22
      evaluable patients in Stage 2 for a total of 40 evaluable patients. Participants will be
      followed for overall survival. Current salvage therapy in advanced NSCLC achieves a median
      progression free survival time of 10 weeks and overall survival of 10 months. The
      Investigator would like to provide evidence that mifepristone will increase the median
      progression-free survival time to 15 weeks and overall survival time of 16 months.

    <description>Mifepristone is an antagonist of the GR-II (glucocorticoid) receptor, yet has little affinity for the GR-I (mineralocorticoid) receptor. Mifepristone is also a potent antagonist at the progesterone receptor, and may block the androgen receptor to a limited degree.</description>
