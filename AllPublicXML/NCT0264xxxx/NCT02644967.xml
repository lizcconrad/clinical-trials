  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the recommended dose of the study drug
      IMO-2125 that can be given in combination with ipilimumab or in combination with
      pembrolizumab to patients with metastatic melanoma. Researchers also want to learn if the
      study drug combination can help to control the disease. The safety of the drug combination
      will also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1/2 study to determine the recommended dose and assess the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and efficacy of IMO-2125 when
      administered in combination with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab. The study will be conducted in
      2 parts; a dose-escalation portion (Phase 1) to evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple
      dose levels and a Phase 2 portion to assess efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma with measurable, stage
             III (lymph node or in transit lesions) or stage IVA, IVB, or IVC disease.

          2. Patients must have symptomatic or radiographic progression during or after treatment
             with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor administered either as monotherapy or in combination.

               1. The interval between last PD-(L)1 directed treatment and start of study treatment
                  should be at least 21 days.

               2. Prior BRAF or MEK inhibitor treatment is not required. However, for patients with
                  known BRAF status:

                    -  Those with BRAF wild type may have had a maximum of two previous systemic
                       regimens for the treatment of melanoma.

                    -  Those with a BRAF mutation may have had a maximum of three previous systemic
                       regimens for the treatment of melanoma.

               3. Prior ipilimumab is permitted.

               4. Previous treatment with either a PD-1 inhibitor (for patients enrolling on the
                  IMO-2125 + pembrolizumab combination) or CTLA-4 inhibitor (for patients enrolling
                  on the IMO-2125 + ipilimumab combination if applicable) should not have been
                  accompanied by DLT for which permanent discontinuation is recommended (per USPI).

                    -  Patients with a history of Grade ≥2 gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g.,
