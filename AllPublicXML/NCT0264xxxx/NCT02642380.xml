  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was organized by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to
      report the efficacy and safety of different cycles of high-dose dexamethasone for the
      treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of 200 primary
      ITP adult patients from 11 medical centers in China. One part of the participants are
      randomly selected to receive four cycles of high-dose dexamethasone (given orally at a dose
      of 40mg per day for 4 consecutive days every 14 days for 4 cycles), comparing the others with
      one cycle (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 consecutive days).

      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.
      Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and
      safety of different cycles of high-dose dexamethasone therapy for the treatment of adults
      with ITP.
