  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients complain to clinicians that they have difficulty sleeping appears to be due to
      environmental noise. There is a common perception that acute noises are more troublesome than
      continuous noises in the effect on individual sleep quality. Therefore the goal is to use a
      Marpac white noise maker with a continuous noise to see its effect on individuals that have
      difficulty sleeping in a high noise environment.

      Insomnia patients will be recruited based on their perception of high noise in their
      apartment. The investigators will screen patients during the first meeting using The Mini
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0 (MINI 6.0). At baseline, an Insomnia Severity
      Index will be administered.

      The study will consist of a one week baseline period in which noise levels will be monitored
      using spectral analysis and decibel levels and sleep duration will be recorded using a
      subjective sleep log and wrist actigraphy for objective measurement. At the end of the first
      week an Insomnia Severity Index will be administered.

      During the second week, a treatment period with a white noise machine using a fixed decibel
      level will be installed in the bedrooms of the subjects. The room noise will continue to be
      monitored via spectral analysis as well as decibel levels while the patients are wearing
      actigraphs and keeping a sleep log. At the end of the second week an Insomnia Severity Index
      will be administered.

      During the third week, the white noise machine will be removed and the rooms will still be
      monitored for sound via spectral analysis and decibel levels and the subject will wear an
      actigraph and keep a sleep log. At the end of the third week an Insomnia Severity Index will
      be administered.

      The total numbers of subjects will be 20. The investigators will use Analysis of Covariance
      (ANCOVA) with baseline vs. white noise to analyze differences. The investigators will use an
      Acute Noise Index, in which noise spikes of 2 standard deviations from the mean of the entire
      nights decibel levels count as a noise event.

      Noise levels in subjects bedroom will be collected throughout the study along with subjects
      sleep activity using an actigraph and sleep log.
