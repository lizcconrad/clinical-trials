  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate performance criteria over one week of daily wear to determine if
      the Study Test contact lens performs equivalently to the comfilcon A contact lenses in terms
      of measurement and subjective ratings of visual performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single site, daily wear, double masked, randomized bilateral
      cross over dispensing study of binocular wear of Study Test Lens and comfilcon A sphere
      contact lenses over 1 week of daily wear. Assessments will be obtained upon dispensing each
      lens pair and following 1 week of daily lens use.
