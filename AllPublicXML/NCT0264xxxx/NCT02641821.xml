    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, observational study. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of Nifedipine GITS on lowering blood pressure in Chinese adults with
      mild-to-moderate hypertension.

      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system (GITS) on lowering blood pressure in Chinese adults with mild-to-moderate
      hypertension. The secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Nifedipine GITS
      on lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients with different urinary sodium levels.
      Based on sample size estimation, the plan is to recruit 700 patients from 16 centers. At
      baseline, patients'demographic characters, disease history and anthropometric indices will be
      collected, laboratory tests will be performed for blood routine examination, urinalysis,
      renal function, hepatic function, urinary sodium and 24-hour urinary sodium. All eligible
      patients will be assigned to a treatment of Nifedipine GITS and followed up for 8 weeks. At 0
      day, 2,weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks of the study, seated blood pressure, vital signs,
      medication and adverse events were collected. At the end of the study, 24-hour ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) will be performed for all participants.
