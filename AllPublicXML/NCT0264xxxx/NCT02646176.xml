  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly recognized as a significant public health issue,
      but the most effective rehabilitation methods have yet to be identified. The Institute of
      Medicine and the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research sponsored systematic reviews of
      evidence for comparative effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for TBI. Both reviews
      concluded that substantially more research is needed to identify interventions best suited
      for different individuals. The practice-based evidence (PBE) approach employed to create the
      data used in the proposed study was a research method recommended to provide greater clarity,
      along with use of patient-centered outcomes obtained over a longer period of time than used
      in previous studies.

      The following specific aims will be addressed in the proposed study:

        1. Determine the comparative effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches used in
           inpatient TBI rehabilitation after statistically adjusting for patient need and ability
           to benefit from various approaches.

           Investigators hypothesize:

           1.1. Patients who receive a greater proportion of therapy time in Advanced Training
           (versus Standard of Care) will achieve better outcomes than similar patients who receive
           a lesser proportion of treatment time in Advanced Training.

           1.2. Patients with the greatest initial levels of disability will experience larger
           effects from Advanced Training therapeutic approaches in comparison to the effects
           experienced by patients with less disability at admission.

           1.3. Patients who receive a greater proportion of therapy in contextualized treatment
           (versus decontextualized) will achieve better outcomes than similar patients who receive
           a lesser proportion of time in contextualized treatment.

        2. Determine the comparative effectiveness of difference in the delivery of inpatient
           rehabilitation therapies, after statistically adjusting for patient need and ability to
           benefit.

      Investigators hypothesize:

      2.1 The level of effort that patients are able to apply in treatment moderates the
      effectiveness of time in treatment.

      2.2 Family involvement in treatment is associated with better outcomes.

      Data will be drawn from the database established for the TBI Practice-Based Evidence Study
      (TBI-PBE Study). Data on 2130 persons who received inpatient TBI rehabilitation at any of 10
      sites (9 in US, 1 in Canada) were obtained for the study. Detailed longitudinal data were
      collected prospectively on rehabilitation therapies (with point of care data completed for
      every clinical encounter), course of recovery, person and injury characteristics and outcomes
      during and after rehabilitation. Advanced analytic methods (e.g. propensity scores,
      generalized linear mixed models) will be used to compare the effects of different
      rehabilitation interventions on outcomes at discharge and during the 9 months following
      rehabilitation.
