    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a pharmacodynamic effect of CK-2127107
      on measures of skeletal muscle function or fatigability in patients with Spinal Muscular
      Atrophy Types II-IV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study being conducted in these patients and is designed to assess the
      effect of 8 weeks of dosing of CK-2127107 on measures of muscle function in both ambulatory
      and non-ambulatory patients with SMA. The plasma concentration of CK-2127107 will be measured
      at selected time points during the course of dosing and the plasma concentrations obtained in
      this study may be used to conduct exposure-response analysis.
