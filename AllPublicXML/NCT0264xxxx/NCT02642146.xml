      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of routine medical treatments of digital ulcers
      in patients with systemic sclerosis in a prospective cohort study.

      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology with high
      morbidity and mortality. SSc manifests by fibrosis of skin and internal organs. Although the
      underlying mechanisms are still subject to investigation, endothelial dysfunction and
      abnormal immune response are thought to contribute to vascular dysfunction and fibrosis in
      SSc.

      A hallmark feature of SSc is the presence of Raynaud phenomenon (RP) that is caused by
      reversible vasoconstriction of digital arteries triggered by exposure to cold or emotional
      stress. In up to 33-43% of SSc patients, the ischemia can progress to digital ulcers (DUs),
      which are often associated not only with pain but also with severe limitation in the daily
      activity, anxiety and depression among others. In severe cases, RP can be complicated by
      superinfection or gangrene, requiring surgical amputation.

      The mainstay treatment of RP is restoration of the decreased blood flow using calcium channel
      blocker, protstanoids, phosphodiesterse V inhibitor, and endothelin receptor blocker.
      However, the efficacy and safety of those medications in RP-associated ulcers have not been
      definitive, especially in Korean patients with SSc. In addition, it remains unknown whether
      Korean SSc patients respond better to a treatment over others.

      Study aims include

        1. To establish a new prospective cohort of SSc patients with DU in Korea..

        2. To investigate the current situation of SSc patients in Korea.

        3. To investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of current medical treatments of DU
           in SSc patients in Korea
