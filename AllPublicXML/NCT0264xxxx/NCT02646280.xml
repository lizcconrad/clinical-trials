  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of an approach that combines
      massage therapy with elements of neurocognitive rehabilitation such as motor imagery and the
      words of the physiotherapist compared to a traditional massage therapy in reducing pain in
      patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and to evaluate if and how the pain reduction is
      linked to the interoceptive awareness and which is the patient's ability to relax through the
      measurement of the hearth rate variability (HRV).

    <measure>Change of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale for the assessment of pain and it's based on a ten point scale, where 0 means no pain and 10 the greatest pain ever both at rest and during movements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of McGill Pain Questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scales evaluates the degree of functional impairment in activities of daily life caused by pain. It consist of ten sections including pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting standing, sleeping, sex, social life and travelling. Each section includes six sentences relating to different level of limitation in the same activity (0: no limitation, 5: maximal limitation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is divided into 32 items organized into eight subcategories consisting of three to seven items each. The subcategories measure: the awareness of unpleasant, pleasant or neutral body sensations, the tendency not to ignore the feelings of pain or discomfort, not to worry about painful sensations or discomfort, the ability not to draw attention away from body sensations, awareness of the existence of connections between body sensations and emotional status, the ability to control the psychological stress by focusing on body sensations, the ability to listen to your body and the belief that the experiences coming from your body are safe and reliable. It 'a multidimensional assessment questionnaire and self-administered. For each subcategory, the patient may express a score from 0 (never) to 5 (always), the highest score corresponds to a higher level of awareness.</description>

    <measure>Change of SF-12 Health Survey Questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consist in twelve questions that explore eight sub-categories that measure the physical activity, role limitations due to physical health and emotional state, physical pain, the perception of general health, vitality, social activities, mental health and changes in health status and two indices that summarize the overall assessment of the subject with respect to his physical health (ISF) and mental (ISM).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Waddell Disability Index from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It includes nine parameters: pain experienced in a sitting position, travelling, standing,walking and lifting weights and the need to put on or remove footwear, sleep disturbance, life restriction and sex life restriction to measure. The maximum score is 9 points. A score &gt; 5 indicates significant disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of hearth rate variability (HRV) expressed as coherent ratio from baseline to 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Its an index monitored by a plethysmograph that records the heart rate variability (variation in the time interval between a heartbeat and the other) a parameter capable of expressing a person's level of stress through the coherence ratio.</description>
