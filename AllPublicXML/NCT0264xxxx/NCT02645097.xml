  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to compare two different saphenous nerve block locations and will
      help to determine which site best maintains knee strength and pain control.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, observer blinded clinical trial comparing motor strength
      in knee extension between two sets of patients, one receiving a proximal thigh block of the
      saphenous nerve and one receiving a distal thigh block of the saphenous nerve. The secondary
      objectives are to compare the pain relief and quality of life of participants in these two
      groups.
