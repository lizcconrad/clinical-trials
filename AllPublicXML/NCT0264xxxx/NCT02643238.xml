  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of an artificial vision system called
      Brainport system in blind patients To investigate visual, and oculomotor (eye motion)
      mechanisms involved in the use of the Brainport system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of blindness in the US adult population is 0.8% and ranges from about 3/10000
      to 15/10000 in children. Data from world health organization show that about 500,000 children
      become blind each year. The annual cost of blindness to the federal government is $4 billion
      and the cost of a lifetime of support and unpaid taxes for a blind person is about $1
      million.

      There is a need to restore vision for blind patients. Research on vision restoration develops
      fast. There are multiple types of approaches toward producing useful artificial vision. One
      of them directly sends images from a video camera to the visual cortex via an electrode array
      that is intracranially placed on the visual cortex of blind patients. Another one surgically
      places an electrode array beneath the retina for patients whose optic nerves are still
      healthy. Both of them require major surgery and have high risks, and neither is available for
      routine clinical application.

      The one that is non-invasive and easy to use is called the BrainPort® system. The BrainPort®
      system is manufactured by Wicab, Inc. It is commercially available and affordable to any
      consumer. This system is a novel, bionic, non-invasive, vision bypass system that conveys
      environment images from a spectacle-frame-mounted video-camera to the brain via an
      electro-tactile tongue array. The electro-tactile stimulation delivered by the tongue-array
      placed on the tongue allows users to interpret the images of objects in their camera's visual
      field.
