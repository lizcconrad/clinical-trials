  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laboratory change induced by common bile duct (CBD) stone is in general observed as the
      higher elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptideas (É¤-GT), in
      comparison to those of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
      However, some patients with CBD stone show the marked increased level of aminotransferase,
      which sometimes leads to misdiagnose those as liver disease caused by viral hepatitis,
      ischemia, and drug toxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinicopathologic
      features of patients with CBD stones with the high level of aminotransferase in serum.

        &quot;Patients have been diagnosed as CBD stone under endoscopic retrograde
        cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Among patients, patients who displayed above 400 IU/L of
        aminotransferase without cholangitis (gallstone hepatitis group) and patients who showed
        the normal value of aminotransferase (control group) were enrolled in this study. We
        estimated two groups by comparing clinical features, lab finding, radiologic images, and
        findings under ERCP such as CBD diameter, CBD stone diameter, CBD stone number,
        periampullary diverticulum.
