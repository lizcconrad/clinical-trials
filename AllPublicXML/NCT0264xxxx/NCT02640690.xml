  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we are evaluating the effectiveness of a yoga intervention to treat
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), its associated symptoms of chronic pain and insomnia,
      and biological and physiological responses to trauma and PTSD in women Veterans who
      experienced military sexual trauma (MST). If effective, this yoga intervention could reduce
      PTSD symptoms and chronic pain, improve sleep quality, and decrease the body's automatic
      &quot;fight or flight&quot; stress response and the damage this stress response causes in the body,
      including heart disease and diabetes. This intervention could improve these women Veterans'
      quality of life and social functioning, for example, going to work and having satisfying
      relationships with family and friends. This study may support an innovative, complementary
      and alternative PTSD treatment for women Veterans who experienced MST. This new,
      evidence-based PTSD treatment could supplement current PTSD treatments. Clinical guidelines
      for this yoga intervention could be implemented nationally in the VA health care system.

      Objectives: The overall goal of this project is to maximize the health, social functioning,
      and quality of life of women Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who have
      experienced military sexual trauma (MST). The specific aims of this randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) are to evaluate the effectiveness of a trauma-sensitive yoga intervention
      designed specifically for women who experienced sexual trauma as compared to a gold-standard
      PTSD treatment, Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognitive, to 1) treat PTSD and its co-morbid
      symptoms of chronic pain and insomnia, 2) improve social functioning and quality of life, and
      3) reduce the biological and psychophysiologic responses associated with PTSD in women
      Veterans who experienced MST.

      Research Plan: This four year RCT is the next step following the NRI Pilot Study (NRI 12-417)
      in which the investigators demonstrated the feasibility of recruitment, retention,
      randomization, intervention implementation, and data collection, including biological and
      psychophysiological data. Women Veterans seeking treatment for PTSD who report chronic pain
      and insomnia are being recruited from the Atlanta VAMC Trauma Recovery Program Women's Trauma
      Program. Participants (n=210) will be randomly assigned to trauma-sensitive yoga (10 weekly
      sessions) or Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognitive (12 weekly sessions); both intervention
      protocols are data-driven. The target enrollment sample size is 210, with a target final
      sample of 100 or more. The investigators are conservatively allowing for 50%-60% retention,
      based on pilot study results.

      Methods: Data Collection: Data are collected at four points, baseline through 3-months
      post-intervention. Outcome measures include self-report, clinical assessments and biologic
      and psychophysiologic markers. Specific outcomes include PTSD symptom severity, chronic pain,
      insomnia, social functioning, quality of life, cytokines (IL-6, IL-10), C-reactive protein,
      dark-enhanced startle, and heart rate variability. Data Analysis: Comparisons between the
      groups at baseline will be run using t-tests, Mann Whitney non-parametric tests, and
      chi-square tests as appropriate. Multilevel mixed models (MLM) will be used to analyze the
      differences between the groups over time. MLM adjusts for attrition (missing data) over time
      and applies appropriate correlation structure between the time points.

      Clinical Relevance: Women Veterans experience MST and PTSD at alarming rates; consistently
      reported prevalence rates for both among VHA patient samples are 20% or more. MST and PTSD
      put this population at risk for significant physical and mental health symptoms, including
      chronic pain, suicide, and negative health behaviors. This RCT may provide sufficient
      evidence to support an innovative, complementary and alternative PTSD treatment for women
      Veterans who experienced MST. The positive effects of reducing distressing symptoms and
      PTSD-related psychophysiological stress would likely improve social functioning and quality
      of life and minimize the significant medical consequences of PTSD in this population. This
      new, evidence-based PTSD treatment could supplement existing evidence-based PTSD treatment
      modalities. Clinical guidelines for this innovative intervention based on evidence from this
      clinical trial could be disseminated to and implemented in VA Medical Centers nationwide.

    <measure>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels from plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 2-Weeks Post-Treatment; 3-Months Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, (IL-1 , IL-2, IL-6, TNF- ) and C-reactive protein have been shown to correlate with increasing pain intensity in patients with chronic pain, psychological stress, and PTSD. IL-6 has been shown to act as a messenger relaying chemotactic peripheral immune signals to the central nervous system. In addition, IL-6 has been established as part of the biochemical sleep regulatory process.</description>

    <measure>Interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels from plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 2-Weeks Post-Treatment; 3-Months Post-Treatment</time_frame>

    <measure>C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels from plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 2-Weeks Post-Treatment; 3-Months Post-Treatment</time_frame>

    <measure>Dark-Enhanced Startle Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 2-Weeks Post-Treatment; 3-Months Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Dark-enhanced startle is an ecologically valid psychophysiological paradigm for assessing contextual levels of fear and anxiety. Dark-enhanced startle is a laboratory analogue of sustained anxiety and represents a clinically useful tool for assessing anxiety-like behaviors and hyperarousal as they relate to symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 2-Weeks Post-Treatment; 3-Months Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability reflects the central nervous system's ability to respond immediately to fluctuations in blood pressure occurring with each beat. Decreased heart rate variability has been correlated with morbidity and mortality from diverse diseases, including anxiety and depression and cardiovascular disease.</description>
