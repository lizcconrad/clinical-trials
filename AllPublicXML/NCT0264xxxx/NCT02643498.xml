      The purpose of this study is to find out the maximum dose of SBRT that can be safely given
      after chemotherapy for treatment of pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed surgically.

    <description>Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are defined by ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related GI toxicity within 3 months of SBRT. These include: (1) Bowel (includes bowel perforation, obstruction, or hemorrhage) and (2) Stomach (bleeding ulcer, perforation). We will employ a standard 3+3 dose-escalation scheme. Patients will be accrued to the study in cohorts of 3.</description>

    <description>Cohorts 1-3 After completion of induction chemotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) will be administered in 3 fractions, every other day, on an outpatient basis. Dose escalation will start with dose level 1 (9 Gy x 3 fractions) and increase by 1 Gy per fraction at each dose level, dose level 2 will be 10 Gy x 3 fractions and dose level 3 will be 11 Gy x 3 fractions.
Cohorts 4-6 For cohort 4, dose prescription will start at 7 Gy x 6 fractions (42Gy, isoeffective to 11 Gy x 3), followed by 4.8 Gy x 12 (54Gy) and 4.5Gy x 15 (67.5Gy).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytopathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  Locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer as confirmed by the multidisciplinary
             input from a hepatobiliary surgeon and as defined on CT as having tumor abutment of
             &gt;180° (&gt; 50%) of the circumference of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or celiac
             axis, unreconstructable superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or PV involvement.

          -  No evidence of distant metastasis either prior to or after induction chemotherapy.

          -  Completion of at least 3 months, but no more than 6 months of standard induction
             chemotherapy for LAPC, which may include FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel,
             preferably within 2-4 weeks but no longer than 8 weeks.

          -  Pancreatic tumor size ≤ 5 cm.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  ECOG 0-1.

          -  Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/uL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/uL

               -  Platelets &gt;50,000/uL

               -  Total bilirubin Within 2 x upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine-Creatinine clearance Within 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR &gt;60 mL/min
                  for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Ability to understand and follow the breathing instructions involved in the
             respiratory gating procedure or to tolerate compression sufficient to reduce fiducial
             motion to ≤ 5mm

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior abdominal radiotherapy.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients in which iodine contrast is contraindicated

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded. Women of child-bearing potential who
             are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control to avoid
             pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks after the study are
             excluded. This applies to any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not
             undergone successful surgical sterilization or is not postmenopausal (defined as
             amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months, or women on hormone replacement therapy
             with serum FSH levels greater than 35 mIU/mL. A negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             must be obtained within 14 days prior to the start of study therapy in all women of
             child-bearing potential. Male subjects must also agree to use effective contraception
             for the same period as above.
