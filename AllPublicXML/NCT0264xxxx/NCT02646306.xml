  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study focused on the creation of a rehabilitative measuring device
      (SRPT-shoulder proprioceptive rehabilitation tool) and the development of the examination
      methodology for assessing the proprioception of the glenohumeral joint respect to scapula
      abduction, within the movement of antepulsion on the sagittal plane both in healthy subjects
      and in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.

    <measure>Evaluation of the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is an instrument that enables patients to express their pain intensity as a numerical value. Patients were asked to mark the point that corresponded to their perceived pain intensity on a 10-cm line, with 0 indicating the absence of pain and 10 reflecting the most severe pain</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the short form of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (Quick-DASH) at baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The short form (11 item) of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (Quick-DASH) measures physical ability and symptoms of the upper extremity and explores the impact of functional impairment and pain on daily-living tasks, as well as on social and recreational activities, work and sleep. The score ranges from 0 to 100 points, with 0 reflect- ing no disability and 100 corresponding to the most severe disability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the Constant-Murley shoulder outcome score at baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is based on subjective (sleep, work, and recreational activities) and objective (ROM and strength) components, adjusted for age and sex, according to normative values reported by Yian et al. The score ranges from 0 (worst result) to 100 (best result).</description>

    <description>Execution of two tests in succession with the use of the shoulder proprioceptive rehabilitation tool (SRPT), each oriented to indicate a specific discriminative and integrative mode in the movement of the scapulothoracic. Will be required to each subject to perform recognition tasks that include both retraction movements of the hand, starting from a start position, and approaching movements of the hand, starting from an end position. First test: ability to integrate visual and proprioceptive informations. Second test: discriminative proprioceptive capacity of the subject, thus excluding the contribution of the view.</description>

    <description>Using of this tool to measure which is the average error in reaching back in both healthy subjects and subjects with shoulder impingement syndrome starting from the assumption that the shoulder, through the articulation scapulothoracic, helps to determine direction and distance during the &quot;reaching&quot; of an object.</description>
