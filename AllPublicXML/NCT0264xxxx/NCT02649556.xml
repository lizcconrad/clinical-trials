  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the ZRHR-ERS-09-EXT-US study is to further assess the effect of the Tobacco
      Heating System 2.2 (THS 2.2), a candidate Modified Risk Tobacco Product, compared to
      conventional cigarettes (CC) on the components of the &quot;smokers' health profile&quot; for a
      prolonged period of 26 weeks, providing additional information to the results of the original
      study ZRHR-ERS-09-US of 26-week exposure (NCT02396381). In total, the ZRHR-ERS-09-EXT-US
      study will extend the exposure period to 52 weeks.

    <textblock>
      The ZRHR-ERS-09-EXT-US study is a 26-week extension of the original study ZRHR-ERS-09-US.

      This study will be conducted as a separate investigation, as a follow-up of the randomized
      exposure period of the original study, extending the exposure from Week 26 (Visit 10 [V10])
      to Week 52 (Visit 16 [V16]), and will be using the same sites.

      Subjects will continue to use the product they were randomized to in the original study
      ZRHR-ERS-09-US (THS 2.2 arm or CC arm).
