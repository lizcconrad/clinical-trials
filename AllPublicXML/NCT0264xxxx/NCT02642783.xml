  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Samples of 4 commercially available bowel cleansing solutions, namely PEG-electrolyte +
      ascorbic acid (PEG-Asc, Moviprep®, Norgine, UK), PEG-electrolyte (PEG, Fortrans® Ibsen,
      France), sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate (SPS, Picoprep®, Ferring, Switzerland), and
      oral sodium sulfate (OSS, Izinova®, Ibsen, France) were prepared according to the
      manufacturer's instructions. Descriptive analysis was conducted with trained panelists (N=
      14) to create a sensory profile for the solutions and generated attributes were rated on an
      unstructured 15-cm line scale using the Compusense at-hand® (Guelph, Canada) sensory
      evaluation software. Acceptability testing was carried out with untrained participants (N=80)
      and samples were rated on the 9-point hedonic scale. Moreover, a Just-About-Right (JAR) scale
      was included for the four basic tastes to determine their compatibility with optimum
      taste/acceptability levels in the products.
