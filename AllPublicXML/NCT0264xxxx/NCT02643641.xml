    <textblock>
      BM32 is a product for immunotherapy of grass pollen allergies. It consists of 4 different
      recombinant proteins (BM321, BM322, BM325 and BM326) adsorbed on alhydrogel. This
      prospective, double-blind. placebo controlled, mono-centric trial investigates the levels of
      allergen specific IgG antibodies following 3, 4 or 5 subcutaneous injections before the grass
      pollen season.

      The aim of this study is to further optimize the immunization schedule by

        -  moving the last injection into beginning of the grass pollen season for all study arms
           in order to ensure highest possible IgG4 levels when they are needed - i.e. at the peak
           of the grass pollen season,

        -  administration of more than 3 pre-seasonal injections in order to build up sufficiently
           high levels of IgG4 already in the first year of treatment , and

        -  dosing during the beginning of the grass pollen season to establish safety in this
           setting The effect of such optimized immunization schedule on the induction of an IgG4
           immune response as a surrogate parameter for efficacy will be studied. The Total Nasal
           Symptom Score (TNSS) before and after the treatment and Combined Symptom-Medication
           Score (SMS) during the grass pollen season will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.
           This will allow intra-individual comparison of seasonal symptom data and responsiveness
           in the chamber setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subjects are grass pollen allergic but otherwise healthy. Healthy subjects are
             defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or disease as
             determined by their medical history (including family), physical examination,
             laboratory studies, and other tests.

          -  They are aged 18 to 60 years inclusive.

          -  They have a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) to grass pollen.

          -  They have a normal electrocardiogram without clinically significant abnormalities.

          -  They exhibit a moderate to severe response to approximately 1500 grass pollen
             grains/m3 after the first 2h in the Vienna Challenge Chamber, which is defined as a
             nasal symptom score (TNSS) of at least 6. (Nasal symptom score is the sum of nasal
             obstruction, rhinorrhoea, itchy nose and sneezing, each of which have been scored on a
             scale from 0 to 3).

          -  They have a positive skin prick test with a wheal diameter &gt;5mm for grass pollen
             extract at the screening visit.

          -  They have a positive serum IgE test for timothy grass pollen and to rPhl p 1+rPhl p 5
             at the screening visit (ImmunoCAP ≥3.5 kUA/l; i.e ≥ class 2)..

          -  There are no conditions or factors which would make the subject unlikely to be able to
             stay in the chamber for 6 hours.

          -  They are capable of giving informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  They are available to complete all study measurements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Sensitization to Phl p 7

          -  Pregnant, lactating or sexually active women with childbearing potential who are not
             using a medically accepted birth control method (pregnancy to be controlled by a
             pregnancy dipstick test).

          -  On examination the subject is found to have any structural nasal abnormalities or
             nasal polyposis, a history of frequent nosebleeds, recent nasal surgery or ongoing
             upper respiratory tract infection which in the Responsible Physician's opinion renders
             the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.

          -  Any respiratory disease other than mild stable asthma that is controlled with
             occasional use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists and associated with normal lung
             function.

          -  The subject is concurrently participating or has participated in any clinical study in
             the previous month.

          -  Participation in a SIT trial for grass pollen allergy in the three years prior to this
             study.

          -  Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the outcome
             of this study. These diseases include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease,
             malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, haematological disease, neurological
             disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to chronic
             bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis or pulmonary fibrosis).
