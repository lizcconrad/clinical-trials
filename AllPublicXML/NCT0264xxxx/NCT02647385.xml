      The serratus anterior muscle plane (SAM) block associated with pectoral nerve block type I
      (PEC I) may be a safe and effective alternative for the intraoperative of breast surgery,
      since there is evidence of pain reduction. However, correlation between regional anesthesia,
      postoperative pain and inflammatory response in breast surgery has not been demonstrated. The
      aim of this study is to compare the standard intravenous analgesia versus systemic analgesia
      associated with the SAM block and PEC I during breath cancer surgery. The following
      parameters will be evaluated: consumption of opioid intra and post-operative; post-operative
      pain and release of plasma inflammatory cytokines. It is a clinical prospective, randomized
      and controlled study. 50 individuals will be randomly divided into two groups. A group of
      patients receive general anesthesia during surgery and intravenous analgesia after the
      surgery and another group will receive general anesthesia associated with SAM and PEC I block
      during intraoperative and postoperative systemic analgesia. The postoperative pain will be
      assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale pain in the recovery room and 24 hours after
      surgery. Blood sample will be collected for determination of serum cytokines before surgery
      and 24 hours after the surgery.

    <textblock>
      In breast surgery, regional anesthesia associated with general anesthesia during surgery has
      shown great results for the post-operative pain management, prevention of tumor recurrence
      and development of neuropathic pain. It has been shown that regional anesthesia attenuates
      the inflammatory response and systemic changes postoperatively during breast surgeries. Thus,
      it is important to include an additional analgesic intervention in breast surgery in order to
      decrease the local inflammatory response and the postoperative pain. Thus, the serratus
      anterior muscle plane (SAM) block associated with pectoral nerve block type I (PEC I) may be
      a safe and effective alternative for the intraoperative of breast surgery, since there is
      evidence of pain reduction. However, correlation between regional anesthesia, postoperative
      pain and inflammatory response in breast surgery has not been demonstrated. The aim of this
      study is to compare the standard intravenous analgesia versus systemic analgesia associated
      with the SAM block and PEC I during breath cancer surgery. The following parameters will be
      evaluated: consumption of opioid intra and post-operative; post-operative pain and release of
      plasma inflammatory cytokines. It is a clinical prospective, randomized and controlled study.
      50 individuals will be randomly divided into two groups. A group of patients receive general
      anesthesia during surgery and intravenous analgesia after the surgery and another group will
      receive general anesthesia associated with SAM and PEC I block during intraoperative and
      postoperative systemic analgesia. The postoperative pain will be assessed using the Visual
      Analogue Scale pain in the recovery room and 24 hours after surgery. Blood sample will be
      collected for determination of serum cytokines before surgery and 24 hours after the surgery.
