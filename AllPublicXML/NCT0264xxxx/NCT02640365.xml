  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MM-398 (also known as PEP02) is nanoliposomal encapsulated irinotecan: the liposomal
      formulation is designed to extend plasma circulation and to increase accumulation in the
      tumor through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.

      This study introduces a new concept of combining free and nanoliposomal drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-finding and therapeutic exploratory phase Ib multi-center, open label study of
      MM-398 plus irinotecan in two different settings:

        -  Group A : patients with unresectable advanced non-colorectal cancer who should receive
           only MM-398 and irinotecan

        -  Group B : patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who should receive
           MM-398 and irinotecan combined with leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab.

      These groups will be enrolling in parallel. Pharmacokinetic and biomarker sampling will also
      be performed.

      There are three periods to this study :

      Screening period (up to -28d): patients undergo screening assessments to determine the
      eligibility for the study

      MM-398 treatment period (C1D1 until safety evaluation/progression): patients receive
      treatment every 2 weeks and undergo biopsies and other required assessments. The treatment
      period is divided into a maximum of 3 dose levels

      Follow up period: patients will be followed-up 30 days after their last dose of MM-398 for
      final safety assessments, and every 2 months thereafter for overall survival follow-up
