      Background: Embryo quality is known to be a very important determinant to predict the
      implantation and pregnancy rate in IVF patients, however, the role of uterine integrity or
      endometrial receptivity cannot be overlooked.

      Chronic endometritis (CE) is an inflammation of the endometrium diagnosed by the presence of
      plasma cells in the endometrial stroma. There is not only no census on the definition of CE,
      the current literature on the impact of CE on reproductive outcome is controversial and
      consists only of retrospective studies with small sample sizes. Although there is a
      presumption that CE is related to poor IVF outcome, this belief has not been proven.

      Design: Prospective cohort study

      Setting: Infertility clinics of 2 academic medical centers

      Patients: Patients between the ages of ≥ 21 and ≤ 35 years old undergoing their first IVF
      cycle will be invited to participate.

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome will be ongoing pregnancy after 12 weeks estimated
      gestational age (EGA) with previously documented fetal cardiac motion. Secondary outcomes
      will include pregnancy loss rate as defined by chemical pregnancy, blighted ovum or loss of
      fetal cardiac motion before 12 weeks EGA.

      Materials and Methods: The cycle prior to IVF, patients will undergo an in-office endometrial
      biopsy on cycle days 19-24. Samples will be stained for CD138 and the number of plasma cells
      will be quantified. The number of plasma cells in a sample that yields the best sensitivity
      and specificity for pregnancy will be determined by a Receiver-Operator-Curve. This number
      will then be used as a dichotomous variable to assign categories of &quot;positive for CE&quot; and
      &quot;negative for CE.&quot; Pregnancy and miscarriage rates will then be determined in the positive
      and negative CE sample with Chi Square Analysis. A secondary sub analysis will be performed
      to determine pregnancy and miscarriage rates in patients who declined to participate in the
      study.

      Expected Results: The investigators hypothesize that higher rates of CE will be found in
      women failing to conceive with IVF and with subsequent first-trimester miscarriage.
