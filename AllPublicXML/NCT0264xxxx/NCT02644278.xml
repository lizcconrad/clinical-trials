    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-984 (M9831)
      administered alone and in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary evidence of efficacy of VX-984 in
      combination with PLD in subjects with advanced solid tumors

          -  Part B: Current active malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately
             treated cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell

             excluded.
