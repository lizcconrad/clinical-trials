    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Enhanced Recovery After Surgery(ERAS) protocol
      versus conventional treatment on patients who underwent liver resection for hepatocellular
      carcinoma(HCC).

    <textblock>
      212 patients are randomly recruited from inpatients of Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Eastern
      Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, RenJi Hospital, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Subei People's
      Hospital of Jiangsu Province and Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Nantong University from
      February 2016 to July 2016. Randomly assigned about half of the patients to receive Enhanced
      Recovery After Surgery(ERAS) protocol and the other half to receive conventional treatment.
      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ERAS protocol.
