      Background and Aims: Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment modality for
      decompensated cirrhosis and is limited by donor organ availability and financial resources;
      thus many patients die while awaiting liver transplant. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (GCSF) therapy can mobilize bone marrow stem cells for tissue regeneration, and has been
      shown to benefit patients with liver disease. The investigators evaluated the efficacy of
      GCSF therapy in decompensated cirrhosis in an open labelled randomized control trial.

      Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis of mixed etiologies
      were randomized to receive either a 5-day course of GCSF (5 μg/kg/d) plus standard medical
      therapy for 6 months (Group-A); or standard medical therapy alone for 6 months (Group-B). At
      the end of 6 months their survival were compared.
