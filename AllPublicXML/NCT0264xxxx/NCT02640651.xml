    <description>For tDCS stimulation, anodal stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be performed for twenty minutes at 2mA. The current will be applied by a battery-driven tDCS stimulator via a pair of saline-soaked sponge electrodes (25 cm2 surface). The anodal electrode will be placed on the scalp at the F4 position according to the international 10-20 EEG coordinate system. 20 minute tDCS sessions will be conducted ten times over a two week period</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female adults 18-65 years of age.

          -  A diagnosis of childhood onset ADHD, meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [American Psychiatric Association, 2013]
             criteria, including at least 5 moderate inattentive or impulsive-hyperactive symptoms,
             and onset of several symptoms of inattentive or of impulsive/hyperactive traits by the
             age of 12.

          -  English-speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Current or past history of mental retardation, severe sensory impairment such as deafness
        or blindness, hypomania, mania, psychosis, suicidal or homicidal behavior.

        Current moderate to severe symptoms of a mental health condition other than ADHD, assessed
        using a clinical evaluation and the Adult Self Report Scale that, in the judgment of the
        investigator, may jeopardize subject safety or interfere with their ability to participate
        in the study. Specifically, this will include current clinical diagnosis of moderate to
        severe major depression, or a score on the depressive problem subscale of the ASRS that
        falls in the clinically significant range.

          -  Substance use disorder within the past 6 months.

          -  Any significant medical condition, that, in the judgment of the investigator, may
             jeopardize subject safety.

          -  Pregnant females.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to participate in study procedures.

          -  Contraindication to tDCS: history of epilepsy, metallic implants in the head and neck,
             brain stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators, VP shunt, or pacemakers.

          -  Skin conditions that may make the application of, treatment with, and removal of the
             tDCS hardware painful as per the discretion of the clinician.

          -  Current use of a medication considered to be therapeutic for ADHD. If a subject is
             taking a medication that is considered by study investigators to potentially treat
             ADHD (eg. a stimulant, atomoxetine, buproprion, modafanil, serotonin-norepinephrine
             reuptake inhibitor, guanfacine or clonidine) they must stop use of this medication for
             at least 5 half lives of the drug under physician guidance prior to study
             participation. Subjects will not enter the study if it would require stopping a
             medication that is optimally and comfortably managing a clinical concern.
