      The study will include three (3) phases: Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Follow-up
      Phase. Subjects who qualify to participate will apply study drug to their feet three times
      daily and will record their daily pain scores using an interactive voice response system
      (IVRS) during the Treatment Phase for 12 weeks. Approximately 100 adult subjects will be
      randomized to receive Clonidine Gel or Clonidine Gel Comparator.

      Study CLO-291 is a randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter study of 0.1% clonidine topical gel (Clonidine Gel) for the treatment of pain
      associated with painful diabetic neuropathy. The study will include three (3) phases:
      Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Follow-up Phase. Subjects who satisfy all eligibility
      criteria will apply Clonidine Gel Comparator to their feet three times daily and will record
      their daily pain scores using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Approximately 100
      adult subjects will be randomized to receive Clonidine Gel or Clonidine Gel Comparator during
      the 12 week Treatment Phase.

    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a single reading that measures the patients interpretation of their pain on a scale from 0, no pain to 10, worst pain imaginable. The change from baseline can range from -10 to 10. The change from Baseline (averaged over Day -14 to Day -8) to End-of-Treatment (averaged over Days 78 to 84 [±3 days]) in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale score assessing the &quot;average pain in the past 24 hours in the painful areas of the feet&quot; averaged over Days 78 to 84 compared to the 7 days at the Baseline Phase (Days -14 to -8). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change in pain intensity from Baseline to Week 12 was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the Baseline pain intensity score serving as a covariate. The statistical model also included treatment, site, site by treatment interaction, and strata. If the site by treatment interaction term was not significant at the 0.1 level, then it was excluded from the model.</description>

          5. Subject has chronic pain attributable to a symmetrical stocking distribution
             neuropathy in the lower extremities for at least six (6) months. Pain should be
             clearly localized to the area of neuropathy (feet), and subjects should be able to
             distinguish the target pain from other painful areas and conditions.

          6. Subject has an average pain score relevant to the target pain in the feet of ≥4 on an

        <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a single reading that measures the patients interpretation of their pain on a scale from 0, no pain to 10, worst pain imaginable. The change from baseline can range from -10 to 10. The change from Baseline (averaged over Day -14 to Day -8) to End-of-Treatment (averaged over Days 78 to 84 [±3 days]) in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale score assessing the “average pain in the past 24 hours in the painful areas of the feet” averaged over Days 78 to 84 compared to the 7 days at the Baseline Phase (Days -14 to -8). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change in pain intensity from Baseline to Week 12 was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the Baseline pain intensity score serving as a covariate. The statistical model also included treatment, site, site by treatment interaction, and strata. If the site by treatment interaction term was not significant at the 0.1 level, then it was excluded from the model.</description>
