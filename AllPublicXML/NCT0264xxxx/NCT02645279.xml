    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of oral glucose administration
      during MRI for imaging of newborns and compare with midazolam sedation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motion artefacts affect the quality of MRI and in order to overcome this problem procedures
      are performed under sedation or general anaesthesia. The safety profile of these methods for
      newborns is unclear. Alternative non-pharmacological interventions are changeable and might
      be time consuming. Oral glucose/sucrose administration has been the most frequently studied
      non-pharmacologic intervention in term and preterm neonates during painful procedures. In
      this study investigators aimed to compare oral 30% glucose and intravenous midazolam their
      efficiency on sedation during MRI.

    <description>30% glucose solution was administered orally through a teat. 1 mL 30% glucose solution was added following placement of the teat into the mouth of the newborn. After suckling of 0.5-1 mL glucose solution, the motionless and sleepiness of newborn was evaluated. If the target conditions was not achieved, 0.5-1 mL increments of glucose was added until the newborn kept motionless or asleep.</description>
