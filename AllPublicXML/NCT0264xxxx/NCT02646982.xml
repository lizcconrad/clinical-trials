  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the effect of candesartan, a blood pressure medication,
      on cognitive function and thinking skills in those who have early or mild memory
      difficulties, also called mild cognitive impairment or MCI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo-control randomized clinical trial that compares candesartan to
      placebo in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who also have positive
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers. The investigators will assess if blocking the effect of
      Ang II, a crucial mediator of neuro-vascular injury, using angiotensin receptor blockers
      (ARBs) will address shortcomings of current treatment regimens. They will also assess the
      safety and dose-response of target engagement for treatment with escalating doses of
      candesartan in this study.
