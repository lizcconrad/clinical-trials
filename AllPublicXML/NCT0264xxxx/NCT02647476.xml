      Immunomodulating enteral nutrition in the perioperative period may reduce postoperative
      complications in cancer patients. Little is known if this effect translates to the better
      survival.

      The aim of study was to assess the impact of postoperative immunomodulating enteral nutrition
      on postoperative complications and survival of gastric cancer patients.

      The group of 98 gastric cancer patients were randomly assigned for postoperative
      immunomodulating enteral nutrition n=44 (Reconvan ,Fresenius Kabi), or standard enteral
      nutrition n=54 (Peptisorb, Nutricia). Postoperative complications, mortality, 6-month, 1-year
      and 5-year survival were analyzed.

      Treatment of gastric cancer often requires major surgery and carries the risk of
      postoperative complications and fatal outcomes. Mortality rates after gastrectomy due to
      gastric cancer have been reported as 2-5%, while the incidence of postoperative complications
      was 10 to over 40%.

      Immunomodulating enteral nutrition in the perioperative period may reduce postoperative
      complications in cancer patients. Little is known if this effect translates to the better
      survival.

      The aim of study was to assess the impact of postoperative immunomodulating enteral nutrition
      on postoperative complications and survival of gastric cancer patients.

      The group of 98 gastric cancer patients were randomly assigned for postoperative
      immunomodulating enteral nutrition n=44 or standard enteral nutrition n=54. Following the
      initial randomization, the patients received either standard nutrition (oligopeptide,
      low-fat, isocaloric, non-residue diet - Peptisorb, Nutricia) or immunomodulating nutrition
      (protein rich, isocaloric, no-residue diet including arginine, glutamines and omega-3 fatty
      acids - Reconvan, Fresenius Kabi). Postoperative complications, mortality, 6-month, 1-year
      and 5-year survival were analyzed.
