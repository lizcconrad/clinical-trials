  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose To determine the diagnostic potential of various biological markers in blood and
      cyst fluid aspirates from patients with Pancreatic Cystic Lesions (PCLs).

      Research design This is a 10-year prospective cohort and pancreatic cyst fluid repository
      study enrolling all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cyst and undergoing the cyst
      aspiration.

      Procedures to be used Blood Sample Cyst Fluid Sample

      Data Collection:

      Medical Record Number Demographics (age, sex, gender, race) Contact information History of
      alcohol use and IV and other recreational drugs and narcotics use/abuse Medication history
      Past hospitalizations, diagnoses, and treatment Physical examination findings Imaging data of
      abdominal and chest regions, including and not limited to ultrasonography, magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) Future admissions, diagnoses, treatment including
      histopathological findings of resected specimens and blood reports End of study data:
      clinical progression of disease, cyst size, wall thickening, calcification, communication
      with pancreatic duct, string sign, cytology, immunohistochemical findings, assay levels of
      lipase, amylase CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), carbohydrate antigen19-9 (CA 19-9), and other
      biomarkers.

      Risks and potential benefits The risks associated with this study are slight discomfort or
      bruising from the blood sampling and the possible loss of confidentiality if the patient data
      or information is inadvertently disclosed outside of this study. The patient will not receive
      any additional benefit from the study aside from those received as part of routine standard
      of care.

      Importance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result The knowledge gained from
      this study may benefit other patients with Pancreatic Cyst Lesions in the future.
