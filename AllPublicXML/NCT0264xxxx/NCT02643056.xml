  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II, multicenter, open labelled, uncontrolled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      profile of panitumumab in patients affected by Head and Neck cancer after at least one
      cisplatin or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. A translational research study is also planned
      to evaluate EGFR status by FISH, KRAS, B-RAF, HRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA mutation by DNA
      sequencing, PTEN protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and HPV genotyping by reverse
      hybridization.

      Panitumumab is administered iv on days 1 and 15 of a 28 days cycle, until progressive
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy, or patient's refusal

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2, not pregnant.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck
             either metastatic or recurrent, judged incurable by surgery or radiation.

          -  Baseline tumor tissue, sufficient material available for EGFR determination
             (therapeutic target of panitumumab) and biomarker studies. Patients without available
             tissue at baseline or with tissue collected longer than 1 year before, may undergo
             tumor biopsy.

          -  Progression after or not responding to treatment with at least one cis-platin or
             carboplatin containing regimen.

          -  Measurable disease (RECIST 1.1).

          -  Adequate hematological values, renal and hepatic function.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Platinum-na√Øve patients.

          -  Patients previously progressed after a regimen containing EGFR-inhibiting agents (as
             cetuximab, panitumumab, gefitinib, erlotinib), even if there was an initial response.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction,
             unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, serious uncontrolled cardiac
             arrhythmia) 1 year before enrollment/randomization.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease e.g. pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or
             evidence of interstitial lung disease on baseline chest CT scan.

          -  Known or suspected brain metastases.

          -  Psychiatric disorder precluding understanding of information on trial related topics,
             giving informed consent

          -  Known hypersensitivity to panitumumab active ingredient or excipients.

          -  Any concomitant drugs contraindicated for use with the trial drug according to the
             Swissmedic approved product information - HIV positive patients
