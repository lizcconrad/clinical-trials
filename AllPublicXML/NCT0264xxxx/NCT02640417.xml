      This is a double-blind, randomized study in parallel groups of subjects presenting with low
      back pain. Randomized subjects will receive treatment for 60 days with either a combination
      of nucleotides and vitamin B12 or vitamin B1+B6+B12.

      This is a double-blind, randomized study in parallel groups of subjects presenting with low
      back pain. Randomized subjects will receive treatment for 60 days with either a combination
      of nucleotides and vitamin B12 or vitamin B1+B6+B12. The aim of this study is to evaluate and
      compare the therapeutic effect of the combination of nucleotides + vitamin B12 with that of
      the combination of vitamins B1, B6 and B12 in low back pain. Safety and efficacy will be
      monitored throughout the treatment period. Subjects will be randomized in a double-blind
      fashion to either treatment group.
