  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test feasibility, in smokers with lung, head &amp; neck, and bladder cancers,
      that examines the effect of e-cigarette substitution, on measures of smoking-related toxicity
      and medical outcomes. The aim of the study is to determine the appeal of e-cigarettes
      compared to regular combustible cigarettes.

      The aim of the study is to determine the appeal of e-cigarettes compared to combustible
      cigarettes as measured by the degree to which patients succeed in reducing their cigarette
      consumption over the 9 weeks they are supplied with product, along with their consumption of
      e-cigarettes. We will measure past use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes at baseline, 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 weeks. We will also assess the effect of e-cigarette substitution on toxicity by
      measuring expired carbon monoxide and urine NNAL, a carcinogenic metabolite of cigarette
      smoke.
