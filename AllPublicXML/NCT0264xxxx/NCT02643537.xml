  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of this rare injury with special
      emphasis on associated pathologies. Additionally, we aimed to develop an algorithm for the
      diagnosis of associated pathologies following LEH.

        Included for analysis were thirty-one patients (11 females (average age 68.2 years) and 20
        males (average age 48.3 years)) who have been treated for Laxation erecta between 1992 and
        2015.
