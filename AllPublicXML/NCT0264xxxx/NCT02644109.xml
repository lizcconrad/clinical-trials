  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, asociated
      primarily with high plasma levels of LDL lipoprotein, which in turn depend on the endogenous
      hepatic synthesis of cholesterol and its absorption at intestinal level. It has been
      demonstrated that there reducing plasma LDL is beneficial, mainly with the use of statins,
      which are the first treatment option for a moderate hypercholesterolemia.

      Phytosterols reduce the intestinal absorption of cholesterol by reducing its incorporation
      into lipid micelles. Consequently, phytosterols have become a relevant alternative treatment
      against low hypercholesterolemia. The target population are 40 to 65 years old individuals
      with low hypercholesterolemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different protocols have demonstrated that phytosterol intake fluctuates between 1000 to 2000
      mg per day decreasing LDL by around 10%, independently of levels of blood triglycerides and
      HDL (high density lipoproteins) concentrations. In fact, the National Cholesterol Education
      Program and the American Heart Association recommend the addition of 2 g/day of phytosterols
      to daily diet of adults. This is also recommended by the FDA (Food and Drug administration).

      Phytosterols delivery has been proven effective when administrated in lipid matrixes such as
      margarines and dressings and low-fat such as skimmed milk and yogurt, proving to have an
      hypolipidemic effect. The investigational products consist of powder milk and a drinking
      yoghurt with the addition of esterified phytosterols, with a total daily intake of 1.95 g/day
      (1.17 g/day of free equivalent).

      Primary objective: To evaluate the impact in Chilean population of phytosterols incorporated
      into dairy products in reduction of LDL cholesterol.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate potential changes in blood cholesterol concentration according to
           nutritional state and age.

        2. To determine the appearance of symptoms and/or effects during the intervention period.

      The trial has been designed to evaluate the effect of phytosterols incorporated to low fat
      dairy products in Chile, through the consumption of one glass of milk powder and 90 mL of
      drinking yoghurt, which results in a daily consumption of 1.95 g/day of esterified
      phytosterols. This amount falls within demonstrated effective doses reported in literature.
