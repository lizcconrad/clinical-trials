        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-child bearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is 2 years post-menopausal); or Child bearing potential, has
             a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 and agrees to an acceptable method of
             contraception

          -  Subjects with an established clinical history of COPD as defined by the American
             Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)

          -  Current or former smokers with a history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette
             smoking.

               -  At Visit 1, FEV1/FVC ratio must be &lt;0.70

               -  At Visit 1, post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;70% and FEV1 must be 30% to
                  80% before predicted normal value, calculated using NHANES III reference
                  equations.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Significant diseases other than COPD, i.e., disease or condition which, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of participation in the study
             or may influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability to
             participate in the study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the
             course of the study, or women of childbearing potential who are not using an
             acceptable method of contraception.

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, have a current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Subjects who have been hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months
             prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or during the run-in period (Visit 1 to Visit 2).

          -  Subjects who have poorly controlled COPD, defined as acute worsening of COPD that
             requires treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to
             Visit 1 (Screening) or during the run-in period (Visit 1 to Visit 2).

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of angle closure glaucoma will be excluded, regardless of
             whether or not they have been treated.

          -  Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to β2-agonists, glycopyrronium or
             other muscarinic anticholinergics, or any component of the MDI.

        Please refer to the study protocol for the complete inclusion criteria list.
