  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Revival of significance and the emergent market of herbal medicinal products necessitate
      strong commitment by the stakeholders to safeguard the end users. The variability in the
      concentrations of constituents of plant material, coupled with the variety of extraction
      techniques and processing steps used by different manufacturers, results in distinct
      inconsistency in the quality of herbal products. The present study will be directed to a
      polyherbal formulation Entoban which integrates an outstanding blend of herbs that have been
      used for decades to eradicate microorganisms and worms from gastrointestinal tract. It is the
      combination of Holarrhena antidysenterica, Berberis aristata, Symplocos racemosa, Querecus
      infectoria and Helicteres isora. The current study would target the chemical assessment,
      pharmacological and comparative clinical evaluation of Entoban to assure its safety and
      efficacy.

      The study will be adopted to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of Entoban using
      Metronidazole DS as a comparator. The study was carried out in XYZ hospital from Jan 2015 to
      Dec 2015. The participants will be selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusive criteria.

    <description>The primary efficacy criterion will be the frequency and consistency of diarrhea in hours, from the first treatment dose to recovery. It will be evaluated through stool D/R. Stool D/R described the consistency, frequency and other important features of stool. Semisolid stool consistency with 1-2/day will be considered significant.</description>
