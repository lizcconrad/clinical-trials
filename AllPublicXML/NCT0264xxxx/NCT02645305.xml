  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases
      including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease. People with
      COPD have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is
      called airflow obstruction.

      Some preclinical evaluations showed that COPD is closely related to chronic inflammation;
      therefore, this study aimed to use adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in the form of
      non-expanded culture - that usually names as a stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in combination
      with activated platelet rich plasma (PRP) to treat this disease. Both SVF and PRP are
      autologous sources that obtained from adipose tissue and peripheral blood, respectively. This
      mixture is intravenously transfused into the patients.
