  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kienböck's disease is characterized by avascular necrosis of the lunate wrist bone, which is
      usually progressive without treatment.

      Cell therapy is useful in treatment of degenerated bone and mesenchymal stromal/stem cells
      are the best candidates for this kind of treatment.

      This study examined lunate core decompression in combination with implantation of autologous
      bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells for Its treatment potential.

      Bone decompression in combination with implantation of autologous bone marrow derived
      mesenchymal stromal/stem cell will be done in 30 patients with Kienböck disease.

      The patients will be followed at 2weeks, 3months, 6m and 12 months after implantation.

      The Spss(v16) software will be used for data analysis.

    <textblock>
      Kienböck's disease is characterized by avascular necrosis of the lunate wrist There is
      probably no single cause of avascular necrosis of the lunate. Its origin may involve multiple
      factors, such as the blood supply (arteries), the blood drainage (veins), and skeletal
      variations.

      Current treatments are: at the early phase only observation. In the more advanced phases
      surgical techniques such as bone decompression.

      A potential therapeutic strategy would be cell therapy, A source of such cells with a
      regenerative potential could be mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

      The investigators will evaluate safety and efficacy of implantation of autologous BM-MSC
      (bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell) in 30 patients with Kienböck's disease in
      combination with bone decompression surgery. These patients will be followed up and data will
      be analyzed with spss(v16).
