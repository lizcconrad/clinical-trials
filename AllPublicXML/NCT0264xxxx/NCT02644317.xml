  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flatfoot, one of the most common foot problems experienced by preschool-aged children,
      characterized by the collapse of the foot's medial longitudinal arch. Children with motor
      developmental delay often have flatfoot, according to clinical observation, and research
      indicates that preschool age is the main stage of the medial longitudinal arch development
      period. There flatfoot symptoms due to poor arch shock effect, poor walking endurance, likely
      to cause gait problems while growing up. The lack of a stable foot structure to support and
      maintain posture may lead to delayed motor development. Early training intervention and help
      to balance stability is the main rehabilitation goal for motor developmental delayed
      children. With understanding of the foot development of motor development delayed children,
      proper intervention can be provided to improve the movement and stability of the lower limbs.
      The possible deformation of the foot structure and resultant pain in the future can also be
      prevented.

      The investigators designed a prospective cohort study to long-time follow up of preschool
      aged children with delayed motor development and to establish standard data, including the
      foot shape, footprint and balance development. The investigators also discuss the influence
      of the shoe insert with balance and flatfoot correction. Flatfoot leads to poor gross motor
      balance and the balance improvement after flatfoot correction has never been studied. The
      investigators findings should provide direct evidence as a reference for clinical workers.
