  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery (CD) is the most common inpatient surgery in the US, accounting for nearly
      one third of births annually. In the last decade, the CD rate has increased by approximately
      50%, with almost 1.3 million procedures performed in 2012 (Hamilton 2013). CDs have been
      associated with an increase in major maternal morbidity (Silver 2010), with corresponding
      increases in length of inpatient care following delivery and frequency of hospital
      readmission (Lydon-Rochelle 2000). Organizations including Healthy People, the American
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American College of Nurse Midwives
      have targeted reducing the CD rate as an important public health goal for more than a decade;
      however, identifying interventions to achieve this goal has proven challenging.

      Repeat CDs are a significant contributor to the increased cesarean rate, resulting from the
      combination of a rising rate of primary CD and a decreasing rate of vaginal birth after
      cesarean (VBAC), which declined from a high of 28.3% in 1996 (Guide 2010) to 9.2% in 2010
      (Hamilton 2011). Why the VBAC rate has decreased so dramatically remains a subject of debate;
      the extent to which these changes are driven by patient preferences is not known. An NIH
      consensus conference statement noted that &quot;the informed consent process for TOLAC and
      Elective Repeat Cesarean Delivery (ERCD) should be evidence-based, minimize bias, and
      incorporate a strong emphasis on the values and preferences of pregnant women,&quot; and
      recommended &quot;interprofessional collaboration to refine, validate, and implement
      decision-making and risk assessment tools&quot; to accomplish that goal (Cunningham 2010).

      Our group recently created a decision tool, which we refer to as the Prior CD App (PCDA), to
      help English- or Spanish-speaking TOLAC-eligible women delivering at hospitals that offer
      TOLAC consider individualized risk assessments, incorporate their values and preferences, and
      participate in a shared decision making process with their providers to make informed
      decisions about delivery approach. We are now conducting a randomized study of the effect of
      a Prior CD App on TOLAC and VBAC rates, as well as a number of aspects of decision quality.

    <description>The Prior CD Decision App begins with an explanation that its goal is to help the user better understand the two approaches to delivery she is eligible for (trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) and elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD)), and that its goal is to help her engage with her provide in making an informed, shared decision regarding which approach to undergo. It includes four sections: a calculator to estimate the likelihood of having a vaginal delivery if she undergoes TOLAC, a series of information pages that include graphical presentations of the chances of various potential outcomes of the two options, a series of values clarification exercises to help the user think through what's important to her, and a summary print out for her to keep.</description>
