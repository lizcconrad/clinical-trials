  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether nutritional supplementation during pregnancy is
      associated with 1) improved maternal health during pregnancy; 2) improved infant birth and
      neurodevelopmental outcomes, and 3) whether the association between nutritional
      supplementation during pregnancy and infant outcomes is partially mediated by reductions in
      maternal perceived stress and stress reactivity during pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-income pregnant women often experience chronic stress and consequently higher levels of
      stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect
      the developing fetus and the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. This
      program of research is designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant
      health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during
      pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid
      family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting
      receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing
      evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to
      stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response.

      One hundred sixty-two pregnant women will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA
      or placebo beginning at 9-12 weeks of gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived
      stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression, inflammatory markers, DHA levels and
      response to a laboratory stressor will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of
      pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age, birth weight, delivery complications)
      will be collected from medical records, and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress
      reactivity will be assessed at 1, 4 and 9 months of age. Coded data will be analyzed by the
      Investigators at University of Chicago and University of Pittsburgh
