    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of an integrated care protocol on antiviral treatment and sustained
      virologic response (SVR) rates following initiation of direct acting antiviral therapies
      (DAA) treatments in 2011.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and aims: Approval of direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies in 2011 initiated a
      new era of more effective treatments for hepatitis C (HCV). The impact of more effective
      therapies on patient access to treatment is unknown. Integrated Care (IC) involving patient
      case management may overcome barriers to treatment access imposed by psychiatric and
      substance use disorders (SUD).

      Methods: Prospective, randomized trial at a single medical center. Patients with HCV at risk
      for active psychiatric and SUD between Jan 2012 and Jan 2013 were recruited and randomized to
      IC or Usual Care (UC). A mid-level mental health practitioner was placed in the IC clinic and
      provided brief mental health care and case management.

    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome for the study was the proportion of patients that achieve an SVR. Patient adherence to completing the prescribed therapy and SVR were both tracked with medical records. Viral load at 4, 12-and 24-weeks during treatment initiation have been shown to predict final SVR. Final SVR data consists of viral tests conducted at 6 months after the termination of therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Initiation and Completion</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The main secondary outcomes for the study include rates of Interferon-based treatment initiation and completion. Treatment data from the HCV clinics were reviewed for each patient at each site. Participants who a) filled at least one prescription for Interferon and ribavirin, and b) had at least one treatment-related physician visit with a medical record note stating they began taking the medications were deemed to have initiated antiviral treatment. Patients were considered to have completed treatment if they a) were prescribed and received the full course of antiviral treatment recommended by their HCV physician, and b) had at least one medical record note stating they had completed treatment.</description>

    <description>The mental health practitioner (MHP) provided brief interventions and follow up sessions designed to reduce the risk factors that are barriers to successful antiviral treatment (substance use, depression, PTSD. Second, MHP provided ongoing case management services to these patients, with an emphasis on navigating the complex HCV care process, preparation for antiviral treatment, and managing the treatment process (adherence, side effects, etc). Third, the MHP also activated the patient and facilitate the medication management of depression and other psychiatric disorders when possible by collaborating with the prescribing HCV physicians.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome for the study was the proportion of patients that achieve an SVR. Patient adherence to completing the prescribed therapy and SVR were both tracked with medical records. Viral load at 4, 12-and 24-weeks during treatment initiation have been shown to predict final SVR. Final SVR data consists of viral tests conducted at 6 months after the termination of therapy.</description>

Brief mental health interventions and case management: The mental health practitioner (MHP) provided brief interventions and follow up sessions designed to reduce the risk factors that are barriers to successful antiviral treatment (substance use, depression, PTSD. Second, MHP provided ongoing case management services to these patients, with an emphasis on navigating the complex HCV care process, preparation for antiviral treatment, and managing the treatment process (adherence, side effects, etc). Third, the MHP also activated the patient and facilitate the medication management of depression and other psychiatric disorders when possible by collaborating with the prescribing HCV physicians.</description>

        <description>The main secondary outcomes for the study include rates of Interferon-based treatment initiation and completion. Treatment data from the HCV clinics were reviewed for each patient at each site. Participants who a) filled at least one prescription for Interferon and ribavirin, and b) had at least one treatment-related physician visit with a medical record note stating they began taking the medications were deemed to have initiated antiviral treatment. Patients were considered to have completed treatment if they a) were prescribed and received the full course of antiviral treatment recommended by their HCV physician, and b) had at least one medical record note stating they had completed treatment.</description>

Brief mental health interventions and case management: The mental health practitioner (MHP) provided brief interventions and follow up sessions designed to reduce the risk factors that are barriers to successful antiviral treatment (substance use, depression, PTSD. Second, MHP provided ongoing case management services to these patients, with an emphasis on navigating the complex HCV care process, preparation for antiviral treatment, and managing the treatment process (adherence, side effects, etc). Third, the MHP also activated the patient and facilitate the medication management of depression and other psychiatric disorders when possible by collaborating with the prescribing HCV physicians.</description>
