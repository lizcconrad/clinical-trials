      The aim of the present study is to test the efficacy of the combination of two probiotic
      bacteria in reducing the severity of upper respiratory tract infections (common cold) in
      healthy children attending day care or school. The probiotic bacteria used are Lactobacillus
      plantarum strain DSM 15312 and Lactobacillus paracasei DSM 13434 at a total dose of 1 x 10^9
      CFU/tablet and day and will be consumed for a period of 12 weeks.
