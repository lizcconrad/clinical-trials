  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Mindfulness Based Cognitive
      Therapy (MBCT) vs. Treatment as Usual (TAU) for depression and anxiety symptoms in breast
      cancer patients in recovery. Investigators will examine whether MBCT-related improvements in
      sleep quality, illness-related distress, and rumination (escalating cycles of negative
      thinking) predict MBCT-related decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms (Aim 2).
      Exploratory analyses will examine whether demographics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity),
      individual differences (e.g., perceived stress, social support), clinical characteristics
      (e.g., stage/severity of diagnosis), and treatment adherence (e.g., sessions attended, hours
      of weekly practice) help determine for whom MBCT is most effective (Aim 3).

    <description>Subjects randomized to TAU will be advised to seek help from their family doctor or other sources as they normally would if they encountered symptomatic deterioration or other difficulties over the course of the study. All treatments received over the course of the study (for the TAU group) and outside of the study (for the MBCT group) will be assessed at the 3-month follow up (Visit 3).</description>

    <description>Weekly MBCT sessions consist of: a) mindfulness practice including breath-focused sitting meditation, body scanning, and mindful stretching; b) review of previous weeks' homework and an overview of the current week's homework; c) barriers to completing the homework. Homework includes: a) practicing the mindfulness exercise reviewed in class using the CDs provided to each participant (guided practice of the relevant exercise); b) maintaining a calendar of pleasant events; c) mindfully engaging in activities of daily living; and d) logging practice efforts in a daily log.</description>
