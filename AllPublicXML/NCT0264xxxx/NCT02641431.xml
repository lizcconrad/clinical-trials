  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study evaluates the methodology and results of epicardial mapping/ablation
      in a large series of consecutive selected BrS patients and to verify if RFA could normalize
      the consequences of a genetic disease.

      The present Registry is designed as a prospective, monocentric study. All patients referred
      to the Arrhythmology Department of IRCCS Policlinico San Donato Milanese, University-
      Hospital, for the management of BrS and fulfilling the selection criteria will be invited to
      participate in the study and will be asked their written consent to the participation in the
      trial.

      Mapping and RFA procedure will be performed following a standardized procedure in hospital
      settings. Patients will be monitored for at least 3 days after procedure.

      Before hospital discharge, echocardiography and 12-lead ECG will be performed in all
      patients. An ajmaline test will be systematically performed after the procedure and
      thereafter at 3, 6, and 12 months after ablation.

      Patients will be followed up clinically after procedure as per normal clinical practice.
      Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months. 12-lead ECG and ICD interrogation
      will be performed at each follow-up visits. Patients will be instructed to immediately
      contact the center in case of symptoms suggestive of ventricular arrhythmias. Documentation
      for intercurrent events will be requested and collected.

    <description>Epicardial substrate identification consisted in mapping the entire RV epicardial surface under baseline conditions and after ajmaline infusion (1mg/kg in 5 minutes).We obtained 3 groups of RV epicardial maps using CARTO3 system: 1) bipolar/unipolar voltage map, 2) local activation time map (LAT), and 3) potential duration map (PDM), in which abnormal long-duration bipolar electrograms were defined as low-frequency (up to 100 Hz) prolonged duration (&gt; 200 ms) bipolar signals with delayed activity extending beyond the end of the QRS complex. Epicardial ablation was performed during sinus rhythm using a stepwise strategy in a descending order of abnormal potential duration as displayed on the map and beginning from the longest potentials.</description>

    <description>Mapping/ablation procedures will be performed under general anesthesia. After femoral venous access and percutaneous epicardial access, a multipolar catheter will be positioned at the right ventricle apex. High-density endocardial and epicardial electroanatomical maps will be performed using the CARTO3 system to define areas of delayed fragmented prolonged potentials during stable sinus rhythm and during spontaneous or ajmaline-induced type 1 BrS ECG pattern. Ajmaline (1mg/Kg in 5 minutes) will be used for the provocative test. Complete endo and epicardial maps will be obtained to ensure reconstruction of a 3-dimensional geometry of the cardiac chambers and to identify areas of abnormal electrograms as characterized by prolonged fragmented ventricular signals</description>
