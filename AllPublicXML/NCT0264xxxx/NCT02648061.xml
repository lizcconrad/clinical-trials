  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extensive research exists for cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the chance of
      successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is improved. Unfortunately, the overall
      prognosis after ROSC has not improved much and the in-hospital mortality is still reported to
      be 50 to 70 %. The &quot;post-resuscitation disease&quot; is now called the &quot;post-cardiac arrest
      syndrome&quot; (PCAS) and comprises 1) brain injury, 2) myocardial dysfunction and 3) systemic
      ischemia and reperfusion.

      Treatment of patients after cardiac arrest has often followed guidelines that were primarily
      developed for treatment of septic shock. It is still uncertain whether this is the optimal
      way to deliver circulatory support after cardiac arrest.

      There is a lack of studies assessing the relationship between the inflammatory response
      measured by inflammatory biomarkers and circulatory failure in PCAS.

      In this study a detailed description will be given of the clinical trajectory of the
      circulation and the inflammatory response during the first 5 days after cardiac arrest, and
      it will be investigated whether patterns of circulatory and inflammatory response may be
      predictive of deterioration of clinical state.

      This study will obtain longitudinally advanced hemodynamic observations with high resolution
      during the acute phase of post cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), and analyze the details in
      clinical transitions related to circulatory failure. The study will also analyze the
      relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and circulatory failure in PCAS and kinetics of
      hemodynamics associated with standard interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU).
