  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on studies of high intensity interval training (HIIT) in the literature, higher gains
      in VO2max and performance are obtained in short periods of training time. However, different
      designs training configurations, for example, changing the time interval, could influence
      such gains on VO2max and aerobic performance. The aim of the study was to observe the
      possible influences of diferetes types of rest intervals in high intensity interval exercise
      protocol on VO2max, and the aerobic and anaerobic performances in 12 weeks of training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      12-week experiment will be conducted, with a total of 30 high intensity interval training
      (HIIT) sessions in cycle ergometer. Both the first and the last week will serve to stabilize
      the basic values and also repeated after training. So, every other day will be held: 1) risk
      stratification for coronary artery disease, anthropometric measurements, cardiopulmonary test
      maximum effort; 2) stabilization of cardiopulmonary test values, determining the aerobic
      dependent variables: VO2max, peak power - PP, occurrence of power VO2max - PVO2Máx, maximum
      heart rate - HRMax, as well as familiarization with the HIIT protocol; 3) anaerobic
      performance test of 30 seconds determining the anaerobic dependent variables: peak lactate -
      LA, anaerobic power peak - PP, average power - PM. After the dependent variables have
      established, the subjects will be randomly distributed among three groups: two experimental
      and one control, and subjected to 30 sessions of HIIT (all out)with 30 seconds of stimulation
      in cycle ergometer, differentiated only by the recovery time (60 seconds and 120 seconds).
      The control group had only one continuous aerobic exercise (50-55% VO2max) with an average
      time similar to other training.
