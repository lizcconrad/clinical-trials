  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This safety pilot study evaluates the effect of hydroxychloroquine on preventing recurrent
      cardiovascular events among myocardial infarction patients. Half of the participants will
      receive hydroxychloroquine, whereas the other half will receive placebo during six months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-rheumatic medications decrease cardiovascular mortality in rheumatoid arthritis
      patients, based mainly on their anti-inflammatory effect. No studies have addressed their
      effect on preventing recurrent cardiovascular events among non-rheumatic patients.

      In the pilot phase 200 myocardial infarction patients will be recruited during their index
      visit to the study hospitals. Patients will be randomized after initial coronary angiography
      to receive either hydroxychloroquine 300 mg a day or placebo during six months. Patients will
      be followed up until 12 months at four visits. Visit one is at doctor´s office at 3 to 5
      weeks from the day of recruitment. Visit two is at study nurse´s office at 5.5 to 6 months.
      Visit three is a phone interview by the study nurse at 8.5 to 9.5 months. Visit four at 11.5
      to 12.5 months is at doctor´s office.

      This study evaluates the safety of hydroxychloroquine in the setting of myocardial
      infarction, and whether hydroxychloroquine treatment could reduce the incidence of recurrent
      cardiovascular events among myocardial infarction patients. Furthermore, the effect of
      hydroxychloroquine on cardiovascular risk factors and systemic inflammation parameters will
      be studied. In a subgroup of 40 patients, the effect of hydroxychloroquine on aortic
      inflammation will be assessed by PET/CT scan.

      If this safety pilot study with 200 patients proves successful (i.e. no major complications),
      2500 patients will be recruited in additional centers in Finland and the Nordic Countries.

      Orion Pharma provides the active hydroxychloroquine tablet (Oxiklorin) but provides no other
      assistance or funding for the study.
