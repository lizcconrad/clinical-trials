      The purpose of this study is to examines the effectiveness of Core stabilization exercise on
      pain intensity at rest, functional disability, lumbar movement and ability to perform
      repositioning tasks (joint position sense) in patients with subacute non-specific low back
      pain.

      This study is to compare the effectiveness of Core stabilization exercise and physical
      therapy on pain intensity at rest, functional disability, lumbar movement and ability to
      perform repositioning tasks (joint position sense) in patients with subacute non-specific low
      back pain. There are 2 groups receiving 2 different kinds of intervention: treatment group
      receiving core stabilization exercise (CSE) and control group receiving physical therapy
      including therapeutic ultrasound and hydrocollator pack. Each intervention will perform for 7
      weeks. The patients will assess for all outcome measures at baseline, 7 weeks of
      intervention, and 1- month follow-up

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pain on 11- Point Numerical Rating Scale at Week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline an week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The 11 point numerical rating scale (11-NRS) is a method to measure pain intensity. The zero represents no pain while 10 represent the worst imaginable pain.The patient is asked to cross or circle a score that the best represents the pain intensity. Change = (week 7 score - baseline score)</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Disability on Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire at Week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 7</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome was assessed by the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ) Thai version that is designed to assess self-rated physical disability caused by LBP. This questionnaire has 24 items. The participant put a tick on the statement when it applies to him that specific day. The scores range from 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximum disability). change = (baseline score - week 7 score</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Back Range of Motion (Flexion) on Modified-modified Schober's Test at Week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 7</time_frame>
    <description>Modified-modified Schober's test used a tape measure held directly over the spine between points 15 cm above the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) with the participant in the neutral standing position on the foot print. The participant was asked to stand with knees locked and bend forward (lumbar flexion) as far as possible without pain; the increase in distance between the marks gave an estimate of lumbar ROM. change =(baseline score - week 7 score)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Repositioning Error on Repositioning Test at Week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 7</time_frame>
    <description>This test was performed by measuring how accurately the participant during sitting that could reposition the lumbar spine into the former lumbar position, after change position in the sagittal plane. The procedure use a laser pointer adjusted to be level, was positioned to have the mark line directly on 0 cm. After having actively moved around, in maximum flexion-extension and return to neutral position, the laser line on the tape-measure, the deviation from the 0 point was measured in centimeter. change = (baseline score - week 7 score)</description>
