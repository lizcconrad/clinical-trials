      The purpose of this study is to analyze if trunk training has effects on trunk, upper, lower
      extremity motor functions in children with spastic Cerebral Palsy. Second purpose is to
      analyze the relation between trunk control and prematurity, birth weight, upper and lower
      extremity motor functions in children with spastic Cerebral Palsy.

      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a condition caused by a lesion occurred in immature brain during
      prenatal, natal or postnatal period. Children with CP may have motor, cognitive, sensory,
      auditory, behavioral problems during their lifespan. Spastic type CP is most common type of
      CP and many children with spastic CP have both trunk and limb impairment. Physiotherapy is
      very important for improving motor function and protect from secondary impairments in this
      children and should start as early as possible. The aim of this study is to analyze if trunk
      training has effects on trunk, upper and lower extremity motor function in children with
      spastic CP. 38 children with spastic CP between 4-18 years age are included in this study.
      Both genders are included. The Participants randomized according to their gross motor
      function classification system levels and their age. Before intervention all groups assessed
      with assessment tools which assess muscle spasticity, balance, gross motor function, trunk
      control and walking characteristics. After randomization there wasn't any intervention for
      control group; they continued their regular physiotherapy in special education centers two
      times a week. Study group received trunk training two times a week in addition to their
      regular physiotherapy in special education centers during 8 weeks. After 8 weeks all groups
      assessed with the same assessment tools.
