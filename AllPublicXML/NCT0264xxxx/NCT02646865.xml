    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of a self-compassion training in the treatment of social
      anxiety disorder. Half of the participants will receive a self-compassion enhanced group
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, while the other half will receive standard group
      cognitive-behavioral therapy.

    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence showing that shame is associated with social anxiety. Also,
      empirical data shows that individuals with social anxiety have higher levels of shame
      compared with healthy individuals and that shame might play an important role in the
      maintenance of social anxiety symptoms. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy for social
      anxiety seems to reduce the level of shame-proneness, the magnitude of this reduction is a
      small one.

      The purpose of this study is to test whether adding a self-compassion component (which seems
      to be effective in reducing shame feelings) to a cognitive-behavioral protocol would increase
      the efficacy of the treatment in reducing both shame-proneness and social anxiety symptoms
      compared with a standard cognitive-behavioral intervention.
