    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine occurrence of pure red cell aplasia in a group of
      participants with chronic renal insufficiency and with resistance criteria to epoetin alfa
      treatment.The investigational product is producted by Bio-Manguinhos / Fiocruz (BIO-EPO) and
      it is provided by the Unified Health System.

    <description>Patients who meet the appropriate criteria in the selection period will be subject to Pure Red Cell Aplasia diagnostic confirmation by collecting 20 mL of blood in dialysis units.
The samples will be processed, aliquoted and transported to Bio-Manguinhos, where depart periodically (according to the volume of samples) to the reference laboratory Sce Immunologie et d'Hématologie biologiques Hôpital Saint Antoine, where the dosage of antibody will be held anti epoetin alfa</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of alfa epoetin manufactured by Bio-Manguinhos for at least 8 weeks before the
             moment of hyporesponsiveness diagnosis;

          -  Nonuse of alfa epoetin from another manufacturer for at least 24 weeks before
             hyporesponsiveness diagnosis;

          -  Presence of the criteria for pure red cell aplasia disease, which is absence of a
             significant reduction in serum levels of leukocytes and platelets.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The screened patients who have at least one of the following criteria will be excluded from
        the study, and it may be replaced by another participant for the research.

          -  if there is no legal representative, an intellectual disability that restrain the
             compliance and signature of informed consent,

          -  no agreement assigning the informed consent;

          -  It will be excluded from the study if from the moment of hyporesponsiveness diagnosis
             the participant have: lactation pregnancy, hypersensitivity or intolerance previously
             known for alfa epoetin or one of its components, intolerance or allergy to parenteral
             iron, acute hemorrhage, kidney transplantation, hemolysis defined as the presence of
             anemia associated with high levels of indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase ,
