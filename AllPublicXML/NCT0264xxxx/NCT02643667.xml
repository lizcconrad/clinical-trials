  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30-40% of patients who undergo radical prostatetecomy (RP) with curative intent for their
      localized prostate cancer experience relapse of their disease. Thus, improved therapeutic
      approaches are needed in this patient population. Enhancing the patient's anti-tumor immune
      response prior to surgery may improve long-term outcomes following RP.

DLTs will be defined as any of the following that are attributable to ibrutinib.
Any grade 4 toxicity, including hematologic toxicities with the exception of lymphocytosis. Lymphocytosis, in the absence of clinical symptoms, is excluded from DLT, as this may be considered an on-target pharmacodynamics effect of BTK inhibition.
Any grade 3 toxicity.
Any recurrence of the same grade 3 toxicity.
Any delay of RP due to study-drug related toxicity.
Any complications of RP (e.g., bleeding, delayed wound healing) deemed to be related to study drug.</description>

          -  Available evaluable archival tumor tissue for correlative studies including assessment
             of immune infiltration and Btk expression is required. If archival tissue is
             unavailable, patients must be willing to undergo repeat prostate biopsy. Tissue is
             considered sufficient for correlative endpoint analyses if they are obtained from at
             least 2 prostate cores and consist of at least 15 unstained slides from the largest
             tumor volume and/or highest Gleason score. The availability of archival tissue or
             consent for repeat prostate biopsy is required for study eligibility; determination of
             tissue sufficiency is not required for study eligibility.

          -  The effects of ibrutinib on the developing human fetus is unknown. Men treated or
             enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study,
             for the duration of the study participation, and for 3 months after completion of
             treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with neuroendocrine or small cell features are not eligible.

             urologic standard of care.

          -  Any prior use of hormonal therapy, including:

               -  GNRH agonists or GNRH antagonists (e.g., leuprorelin, degarelix)

               -  Any estrogen containing compounds

               -  5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride)

               -  PC-SPES or PC-x products. Other herbal therapies or supplements will be
                  considered by the Principle Investigator on a case by case basis based on their
                  potential for hormonal or anti-cancer therapies.

          -  Prior use of immunotherapy or chemotherapy for prostate cancer

          -  Prior radiation therapy for prostate cancer

          -  Prior investigational therapy for prostate cancer

          -  Patients may not receive any other concurrent investigational agents while on study.

          -  Use of systemic steroid therapy within 28 days of study screening. Patients on inhaled
             or topical steroids are eligible.

          -  Major surgery requiring the use of general anesthetic within 4 weeks of study
             enrollment

          -  HIV, active hepatitis B (HBV) or active hepatitis C (HCV)

               -  Patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV infection, defined as the
                  presence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBc Ab) and absence of hepatitis B surface
                  antigen (HBsAg) are eligible. HBV DNA must be obtained in these patients prior to
                  day 1 of ibrutinib therapy, but detection of HBV DNA in these patients will not
                  exclude study participation.

               -  Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction
                  is negative for HCV RNA.

          -  Inability to swallow capsules or presence of malabsorption syndromes, disease
             significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, history of resection of the stomach

             angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness, or any underlying medical condition, which in the
             Principal Investigator's opinion will make the administration of ibrutinib hazardous
             or obscure the interpretation of adverse events.

          -  Concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers. Patients are
             considered to be free of active malignancy if they have completed curative therapy and
             have a &lt;30% risk of relapse.

          -  Moderate or severe hepatic impairment defined as Child-Pugh Class B or C.

          -  History of congenital bleeding diathesis.

          -  Concomitant use of anticoagulants including warfarin, other Vitamin K antagonists, and
             enoxaparin.
