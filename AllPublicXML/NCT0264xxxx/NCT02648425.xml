  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB study to assess the safety and tolerability of ASLAN001 when given in
      combination with either Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil or Cisplatin and Capecitabine, with a
      view to identifying the recommended Phase II dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose escalation study of ASLAN001 given in combination with
      Regimen A or Regimen B, in patients with metastatic solid tumors, eligible to receive the
      cisplatin/5-fluorouracil or cisplatin/capecitabine regimen.

      If the study medication is considered to be above the MTD, that is, if ≥ 2 DLTs are observed
      in one cohort, next cohort will receive ASLAN001 dose de-escalation in combination with
      chemotherapy.

      Dose of ASLAN001 starts from 400mg BID; then, dose escalation to 500mg BID or dose
      de-escalation to 300mg BID will depend on DLTs observed in cohort.

      Regimen A: Depends on preferred medical practice, Cohort 1A will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID
      in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV infusion and 5 fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day IV
      infusion for 5 days every 3 weeks; or will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID in combination with
      Cisplatin 35 mg/m2 24-hour infusion for day 1 and day 8, 5-fluorouracil 2,000 mg/m2 and
      Leucovorin 300mg/m2 24-hour infusion for day 1, day 8 and day 15 every 4 weeks.

      Regimen B: Cohort 1B will receive ASLAN001 400 mg BID in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m2
      IV infusion and oral capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 BID for 14 days every 3 weeks.
