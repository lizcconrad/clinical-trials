  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to define the repeatability and reproducibility of quantifying
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery (BA) using the AngioDefender (AD)
      methodology.

      Repeatability will be assessed by repeat AD testing of the same subject 1 hour apart, using
      the same AD device and operator.

      Reproducibility will be assessed by comparing FMD scores obtained for the same subject, but
      using different AD devices and operators.

    <description>The AngioDefender device uses a novel, proprietary software algorithm to analyze pulse wave amplitude data collected before and after brachial artery occlusion by a standard upper arm pneumatic blood pressure cuff. The procedure is non-invasive and does not employ ultrasound.</description>
