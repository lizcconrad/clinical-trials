    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Comparisons of major characteristics of patients between apixaban and each of the other AC treatments will be performed using:
An analysis adjusted for confounding factors in order to verify adjustment quality and using:
the Wald test from a logistic regression model for binary and other qualitative variables
the F- test from a covariance analysis for quantitative variables
An analysis after matching for confounding factors in order to verify matching quality and using:
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test for qualitative variables
the F-test from a covariance analysis for quantitative variables</description>
