  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to demonstrate reduction in the levels of biomarkers of
      exposure (BoExp) to selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) and to
      obtain safety information in healthy subjects using the Carbon Heated Tobacco Product 1.2
      (CHTP 1.2) as compared to smokers continuing smoking combustible cigarettes (CC) in a
      confinement setting for 5 days (exclusive use) followed by an ambulatory setting of 85 days.
