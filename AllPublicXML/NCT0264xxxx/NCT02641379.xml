    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48, Week 72, and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a quality of life instrument consisting of a 36-item questionnaire. The SF-36 items were scored and transformed according to the SF-36 Health Survey Manual and Interpretation Guide. Summary scores for SF-36 dimensions (physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, health transition) as well as physical and mental summary measures were compiled after imputation of mean scores for missing items if more than 50% of dimension-related items were available. Scores for health transition ranged from 0 (worst) to 5 (best). Scores for all other dimensions ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The mean SF-36 scores are presented at Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48, Week 72 (for Groups A and B) and at Week 96 (for Group B). Lower score indicate worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48 and Week 72, and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is an instrument consisting of 10 self-administered questions. The FSS items were scored by calculating the average response to all answered items (including the 9 questions and the fatigue symptoms). Each of the 9 questions had answers within a score range of 1-7. A score of 1 for any question indicates less fatigue in everyday life and a score of 7 indicates a higher likelihood of fatigue in everyday life. The mean FSS scores are presented at Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48 and Week 72 (for Groups A and B) and at Week 96 (for Group B).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (Part 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 was conducted from 16 May 2003 to 12 September 2008 at 21 centers in Austria; Part 2 of this study was conducted from 19 October 2009 to 15 November 2013 at 15 centers in Austria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 545 participants were enrolled in Part 1, of which 5 participants were treated but were not included in any analysis population due to a missing post-baseline safety assessment. A total of 176 participants were enrolled in Part 2 of this study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>PEG-IFN Alfa-2a + Ribavirin 48 Weeks (Group A) (Part 1)</title>
          <description>Eligible participants received pegylated interferon alpha-2a (PEG-IFN alfa-2a) at a dose of 180 microgram (mcg) subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for a total of 48 weeks and ribavirin at a dose of 1,000 milligram/day (mg/day) [for participants with a body weight &lt;/= 75 kilogram (kg)] or 1,200 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &gt; 75 kg) orally for a total of 48 weeks. Participants were randomized to Group A based on the presence of an early virological response (EVR) defined as non-detectable serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) [&lt; 600 international units/milliliter (IU/ml)] by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a 2-log10 decrease or greater compared to baseline serum HCV RNA, shortly after Week 12. Participants had a treatment-free follow-up period of 24 weeks.</description>

          <title>PEG-IFN Alfa-2a + Ribavirin 72 Weeks (Group B) (Part 1)</title>
          <description>Eligible participants received PEG-IFN alfa-2a at a dose of 180 mcg SC once weekly for 48 weeks and also received ribavirin at a dose of 1,000 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &lt;/= 75 kg) or 1,200 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &gt; 75 kg) orally for a total of 72 weeks. After Week 48, participants were administered a lower dose of PEG-IFN alfa-2a of 135 mcg/week until Week 72. Participants were randomized to Group B based on the presence of an EVR defined as non-detectable serum HCV RNA (&lt; 600 IU/ml) by quantitative PCR or a 2-log10 decrease or greater compared to baseline in serum HCV RNA by quantitative PCR, shortly after Week 12. Participants had a treatment-free follow-up period of 24 weeks.</description>

          <description>Eligible participants received PEG-IFN alfa-2a at a dose of 180 mcg SC once weekly and also received ribavirin at a dose of 1,000 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &lt;/= 75 kg) or 1,200 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &gt; 75 kg) orally; initially for 24 weeks. Participants without an EVR at Week 12 (&lt; 2-log10 decrease in HCV RNA as compared with baseline) were assigned to Group C and received treatment until Week 24. If HCV RNA became non-detectable at Week 24 then treatment was continued for a total of 72 weeks. Participants were administered a lower dose of PEG-IFN alfa-2a after Week 48 (135 mcg/week, until Week 72). Participants with detectable HCV RNA (≥ 50 IU/ml) at Week 24 were required to discontinue treatment. Participants had a treatment-free follow-up period of 24 weeks.</description>

        <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a quality of life instrument consisting of a 36-item questionnaire. The SF-36 items were scored and transformed according to the SF-36 Health Survey Manual and Interpretation Guide. Summary scores for SF-36 dimensions (physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, health transition) as well as physical and mental summary measures were compiled after imputation of mean scores for missing items if more than 50% of dimension-related items were available. Scores for health transition ranged from 0 (worst) to 5 (best). Scores for all other dimensions ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The mean SF-36 scores are presented at Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48, Week 72 (for Groups A and B) and at Week 96 (for Group B). Lower score indicate worsening.</description>

          <title>Mean Short Form-36 Questionnaire Scores for Groups A and B Over Time (Part 1)</title>
          <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a quality of life instrument consisting of a 36-item questionnaire. The SF-36 items were scored and transformed according to the SF-36 Health Survey Manual and Interpretation Guide. Summary scores for SF-36 dimensions (physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, health transition) as well as physical and mental summary measures were compiled after imputation of mean scores for missing items if more than 50% of dimension-related items were available. Scores for health transition ranged from 0 (worst) to 5 (best). Scores for all other dimensions ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The mean SF-36 scores are presented at Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48, Week 72 (for Groups A and B) and at Week 96 (for Group B). Lower score indicate worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Fatigue Severity Scale Scores for Groups A and B Over Time (Part 1)</title>
        <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is an instrument consisting of 10 self-administered questions. The FSS items were scored by calculating the average response to all answered items (including the 9 questions and the fatigue symptoms). Each of the 9 questions had answers within a score range of 1-7. A score of 1 for any question indicates less fatigue in everyday life and a score of 7 indicates a higher likelihood of fatigue in everyday life. The mean FSS scores are presented at Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48 and Week 72 (for Groups A and B) and at Week 96 (for Group B).</description>

Participants were randomized to Group A based on the presence of an EVR defined as non-detectable serum HCV RNA (&lt; 600 IU/ml) by quantitative PCR or a 2-log10 decrease or greater compared to baseline serum HCV RNA, shortly after Week 12. Participants had a treatment-free follow-up period of 24 weeks.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (Part 1)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a quality of life instrument consisting of a 36-item questionnaire. The SF-36 items were scored and transformed according to the SF-36 Health Survey Manual &amp; Interpretation Guide. Summary scores for SF-36 dimensions (physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, health transition) as well as physical and mental summary measures were compiled after imputation of mean scores for missing items if more than 50% of dimension-related items were available. Scores for health transition ranged from 0 (worst) to 5 (best). Scores for all other dimensions ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The mean SF-36 scores were presented at Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48, Week 72 (for Groups A1, B1 and C) and at Week 96 (for Groups B1 and C). Lower score indicate worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Fatigue Severity Scale Scores for Groups A1, B1 and C Over Time (Part 2)</title>
        <description>The FSS is an instrument consisting of 10 self-administered questions. The FSS items were scored by calculating the average response to all answered items (including the 9 questions and the fatigue symptoms). Each of the 9 questions had answers within a score range of 1-7. A score of 1 for any question indicates less fatigue in everyday life and a score of 7 indicates a higher likelihood of fatigue in everyday life. The mean FSS scores are presented at Baseline (Day 1), Week 24, Week 48 and Week 72 (for Groups A1, B1 and C) and at Week 96 (for Groups B1 and C).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (Part 2)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

          <description>Eligible participants received PEG-IFN alfa-2a at a dose of 180 mcg SC once weekly for a total of 48 weeks and ribavirin at a dose of 1,000 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &lt;/= 75 kg) or 1,200 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &gt; 75 kg) orally for a total of 48 weeks. Participants were randomized to Group A based on the presence of an EVR defined as non-detectable serum HCV RNA (&lt; 600 IU/ml) by quantitative PCR or a 2-log10 decrease or greater compared to baseline serum HCV RNA, shortly after Week 12. Participants had a treatment-free follow-up period of 24 weeks.</description>

          <description>Eligible participants were administered PEG-IFN alfa-2a at a dose of 180 mcg SC once weekly and also received ribavirin at a dose of 1,000 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &lt;/= 75 kg) or 1,200 mg/day (for participants with a body weight &gt; 75 kg) orally; initially for 24 weeks. Participants without an EVR at Week 12 (&lt; 2-log10 decrease in HCV RNA as compared with baseline) were assigned to Group C and received treatment until Week 24. If HCV RNA became non-detectable at Week 24 then treatment was continued for a total of 72 weeks. Participants were administered a lower dose of PEG-IFN alfa-2a after Week 48 (135 mcg/week, until Week 72). Participants with detectable HCV RNA (&gt;= 50 IU/ml) at Week 24 were required to discontinue treatment. Participants had a treatment-free follow-up period of 24 weeks.</description>
