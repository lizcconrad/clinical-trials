  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that up-regulation of the Wnt pathway has been identified as having a significant role
      in carcinogenesis in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the investigator
      believes that inhibition of Porcupine via WNT974 will result in tumor control hence
      improvement in disease free and overall survival in these patients with a tolerable toxicity
      profile. As suggested by pre-clinical models, patients with a tumor harboring a Notch
      receptor (any of the four) loss of function mutation may have a greater response rate to
      treatment with WNT974. The investigator aims to address this question by administration of
      single agent WNT974 and following response radiologically along with close clinical follow up
      to monitor toxicities.
