      The aim of the study to evaluate Five-Dimensional Ultrasound in automated measurement of
      ovarian follicles with controlled ovarian stimulation in contrast to the conventional 2D
      ultrasound

    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective pilot study that will be performed at the Fetal Care Unit at Ain Shams
      University Maternity Hospital.

      72 women will be recruited from the the Fetal Care Unit who will fulfill the inclusion
      criteria. They will be counseled to be included into the study.

      All cases will be subjected to:

      full history taking including patient's age, parity,last menstrual period , past history of
      medical disorders, clinical examinations (General and abdominal).

      Two-Dimensional Ultrasound and Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be done for all cases for
      assessment of ovarian follicles after controlled ovarian stimulation by clomid 50 mg5×2×1 The
      automated software allows for automated three-dimensional follicular measurement.The software
      then analyzes the volume and automatically identifies all of the follicles in the ovary. The
      software also automatically generates several volumetric parameters of each and every
      identified follicle.

          <title>The Volume-based Diameter (dV) of the Follicle by Five-Dimensional Ultrasound</title>
          <description>All women would be receiving ovarian stimulation using clomiphene citrate (clomid 50 mg) once daily for 5 days starting from 2nd day of the cycle then they will be scanned at 10th day by the same physician using Five Dimensional Ultrasound was done.
Five Dimensional Ultrasound automatically identifies hypoechogenic follicles within the captured ovarian volume and generates a set of measurements for each follicle including the volume-based diameter (dV) of the follicle.
The volume calculation is based on the voxel count within the identified follicle. It therefore represents a true measure of follicular volume.</description>
