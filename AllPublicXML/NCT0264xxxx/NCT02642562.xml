      This study will address whether the additional use of Intravenous (IV) iron on top of
      standard care will improve the outlook for patients with heart failure and iron deficiency.
      One group of participants will receive treatment with iron injections and the other group
      will not receive any iron injections.

    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a very common medical problem. Despite improvements in
      treatment, many patients suffer limiting symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue.
      Hospitalisation for CHF is common and life expectancy reduced. Many patients with CHF have a
      deficiency of iron (low iron levels or cannot use iron properly), and this is associated with
      poorer outcomes. Some small research studies have suggested that giving patients intravenous
      iron improves symptoms in the short term. It is unknown, however, whether correcting iron
      deficiency is beneficial to patients with CHF in the long term and whether it improves life
      expectancy and keeps them out of hospital. This study will help us answer these key
      questions.

      This study will address whether the additional use of Intravenous (IV) iron on top of
      standard care will improve the outlook for patients with heart failure and iron deficiency.
      One group of participants will receive treatment with iron injections and the other group
      will not receive any iron injections.

      The study will take place in about 50 secondary care sites (hospitals) across the UK.
      Participants will be recruited over a period of two years and will be followed up for a
      minimum of two and a half years (average duration of three years per participant). After the
      initial visits, participants will be seen every four months.
