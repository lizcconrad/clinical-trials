    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how much of apremilast is found in the blood unchanged
      when administered as an oral suspension compared to when it is administered as a tablet
      formulation. The effect of food on apremilast oral suspension will also be evaluated. In
      addition, information on the safety and tolerability of apremilast will be obtained.

      CC-10004 (also known as apremilast or Otezla®) has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate to
      severe plaque psoriasis in adults. The liquid formulation of apremilast is an investigational
      drug being developed by Celgene Corporation to treat plaque psoriasis in children. An
      investigational drug is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, randomized, three-period, six-sequence crossover study in
      healthy subjects. The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline phase, three study
      periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each study period will be four days in duration (Day 1
      through Day 4) of dosing followed by a five-day washout between doses.

      Within no more than 21 days (Day -21) and no less than two days (Day -2) prior to the start
      of the first study period, subjects will undergo routine screening procedures including a
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, clinical laboratory safety tests, serology
      screen, pregnancy and FSH testing, and drug/alcohol screen.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted into the study center on Day -1 of study Period 1 for
      baseline measurements. During each study period, subjects will receive a single 30 mg oral
      dose of apremilast on Day 1 according to the assigned treatment sequence. Subjects will be
      domiciled at the study center from Day 1 of study Period 1 through Day 4 of study Period 3,
      including the 5 day washout between doses. All subjects will be discharged from the study
      center on Day 4 of study Period 3 following completion of required study procedures.

      A follow-up phone call will occur approximately four days (±2 days) after the discharge from
      the study center.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation
      (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

             criteria for vital signs performed during check-in and/or predose on Day 1 will be at
             the discretion of the Investigator.

          7. Must have a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG). Subjects
             must have a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec.

          8. Contraception Requirements:

               -  Must comply with the following acceptable forms of contraception. All FCBP must
                  use one of the approved contraceptive options as described below while taking
                  apremilast and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose of the
                  apremilast.

               -  At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a FCBP's
                  contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the Investigator
                  will educate the subject regarding contraception options and the correct and
                  consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully
                  prevent pregnancy

             All FCBP must have a negative pregnancy test at Visits 1 and 2. All FCBP subjects who
             engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one of the approved
             contraceptive options described below:

             Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception

             Any surgical or medical condition possibly affecting drug absorption, distribution,
             metabolism and excretion, eg, bariatric procedure, colon resection, irritable bowel
             syndrome, Crohn's disease, etc. Subjects with cholecystectomy and appendectomy may be
             included.

          5. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days prior to the
             first dose administration or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known
             (whichever is longer).

          6. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration to a blood
             bank or blood donation center.

          7. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before dosing, or a positive drug screen
             reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.

          8. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) within 2 years
             before dosing, or a positive alcohol screen.
