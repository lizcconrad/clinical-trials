    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating abemaciclib (LY2835219), an inhibitor of cyclin
      dependent-kinases 4 and 6 (Cdk 4/6) in children and young adults with newly diagnosed diffuse
      intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (Stratum A) and in relapsed/refractory/progressive malignant
      brain (Grade III/IV, including DIPG; MBT) and solid tumor (ST) patients (Stratum B).

      Stratum A- Appropriate dose RT will be administered in 30-33 fractions over approximately 6
      weeks for Stratum A patients. Treatment with abemaciclib (LY2835219) will start on the same
      day as RT and continue twice daily during and after RT for a maximum treatment duration of 2
      years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research participants (dosage
      levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib (LY2835219) starting with dose
      level 1 (80% of adult dose). A cycle is defined as 28 days and the first 6 weeks of therapy
      will constitute the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluation period. Participants must take
      abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.

      Stratum B - Abemaciclib (LY2835219) will be administered orally on a twice daily basis
      continuously for 28 days, which defines one cycle. The maximum treatment duration will be 2
      years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research participants (dosage
      levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib starting with dose level 1 (80%
      of adult dose). Dose escalation will be independent of Stratum A escalation. A cycle is
      defined as 28 days and the first 4 weeks of therapy will constitute the DLT-evaluation
      period. Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.

             least 1 week prior to registration (filgrastim, sargramostim, erythropoietin) and at
             least 2 weeks for long-acting formulations (e.g. neupogen).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled infection

          2. Prior history of QTc prolongation or QTcF &gt; 450 ms on screening ECG.

          3. Any concomitant significant medical illness that cannot be adequately controlled with
             appropriate therapy, or that would impair the evaluation of side effects related to
             this treatment, alter drug metabolism or the tolerance to this treatment

          4. Receiving any other anticancer or investigational drug therapy

          5. Prior therapy with abemaciclib
