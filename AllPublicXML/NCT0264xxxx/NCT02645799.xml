  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy and dose response of
      LABR-312 administered intravenously at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      with a drug eluting stent in reducing restenosis as measured by Optical Coherence Tomography
      (OCT) at 9 months post procedure in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).

      Administration of LABR-312 at the time of PCI will reduce restenosis compared with placebo as
      assessed by the OCT endpoint of % neointimal hyperplasia (%NIH) volume at 9 months in
      patients with DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIb, prospective, multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind,
      two-arm, 1:1 (escalating dose LABR-312 vs. placebo) clinical trial.

      In both study arms, all target lesions will be treated with the Resolute Integrity Drug
      Eluting Stent during the index PCI.

      Lesions that are planned to be treated must be declared and recorded at the time of
      randomization.

      Randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of insulin treatment, HbA1c level
      (&lt;7.5% vs. ≥7.5%), and by pre-procedure monocyte count (≥500/uL or below).

      Subjects (n=~270) will be randomized to receive either the study drug LABR-312 or the
      placebo. Conditionally to ongoing safety monitoring, dose escalation of LABR-312 in the study
      arm will be performed: 0.01 mg (first 45 patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo), up to
      0.03 mg (next consecutive 45 patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo) and up to 0.08 mg
      (final 45 consecutive patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo). If a decision is made not
      to dose escalate, recruitment will continue with the highest dose level deemed safe by the
      ongoing safety monitoring, until approximately 270 subjects are randomized.

      In the LABR-312 group, 3 doses will therefore be tested, resulting in 6 possibilities:

      Group 1: Low dose 0.01 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline) administered IV.

      Group 2: Intermediate dose Up to 0.03 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline)
      administered IV.

      Group 3: High dose Up to 0.08 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline)
      administered IV.

      The duration of subject participation will be 1 year; clinical follow-up will be performed at
      30 days, 9 months, and 1year post randomization.

      OCT follow-up will be performed at 9 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        General Inclusion Criteria: all must be present

          1. Patient has medically treated diabetes mellitus (is on insulin or oral or injectable
             hypoglycemic medications).

          2. Patient is eligible and has an indication for PCI with a drug eluting stent (patient
             may be consented prior to diagnostic angiography with possible PCI).

          3. Patient presents with angina (stable or unstable), silent ischemia (in absence of
             symptoms must have a positive stress test, FFR ≤0.80, or angiographic stenosis of
             ≥70%), NSTEMI, or recent STEMI (&gt;7 days from procedure).

          4. Non-target vessel PCI are allowed prior to randomization depending on the time
             interval and conditions as follows:

               -  During Baseline Procedure:

               -  PCI of non-target vessels performed during the baseline procedure itself
                  immediately prior to randomization, if successful and uncomplicated, defined as:
                  &lt;50% visually estimated residual diameter stenosis, TIMI Grade 3 flow, no
                  dissection ≥ NHLBI type C, no perforation, no persistent ST segment changes, no
                  prolonged chest pain, no TIMI major or BARC type 3 bleeding.

                    -  Less than 24 hours prior to Baseline Procedure:

               -  Not allowed (see exclusion criteria #2).

                    -  24 hours-30 days prior to Baseline Procedure:

               -  PCI of non-target vessels 24 hours to 30 days prior to randomization if
                  successful and uncomplicated as defined above.

               -  In cases where non-target lesion PCI has occurred 24-72 hours prior to the
                  baseline procedure, at least 2 sets of cardiac biomarkers must be drawn at least
                  6 and 12 hours after the non-target vessel PCI.

               -  If cardiac biomarkers are initially elevated above the local laboratory upper
                  limit of normal, serial measurements must demonstrate that the biomarkers are
                  falling.

                    -  Over 30 days prior to Baseline Procedure:

               -  PCI of non-target vessels performed greater than 30 days prior to procedure
                  whether or not successful and uncomplicated.

          5. All non-target lesions (i.e. those not meeting angiographic criteria for the study)
             should be treated prior to randomization. All target lesions must be planned to be
             treated during the index procedure. The investigator will declare which target lesions
             are intended for treatment at the time of randomization. In the event that all target
             lesions cannot be treated (e.g. due to contrast load), staged procedure should be
             delayed preferably at least 2 weeks after the index PCI, and those lesions will be
             considered non-target lesions. Any such planned staged lesions must be declared at the
             end of the index procedure.

          6. Prior target-vessel PCI is allowed if it occurred ≥6 months prior to randomization and
             no restenosis is present, or if re-intervention is planned on the restenotic lesion(s)
             as a non-target lesion.

          7. The patient or legal guardian is willing and able to provide written informed consent
             and comply with follow-up visits and the testing schedule.
