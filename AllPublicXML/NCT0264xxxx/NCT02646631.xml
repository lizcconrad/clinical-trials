  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to improve seizure control among patients with
      epilepsy, which has the potential to improve quality of life for thousands of people living
      with epilepsy and reduce health care utilization, social and economic costs, and
      epilepsy-related mortalities. Participants who are suffering from epilepsy will be randomized
      to receive usual care (UC), a smartphone-based self-management intervention called Management
      of Risks in Epilepsy (MORE), or MORE + telephone-based motivational interviewing (MI).
      Participants will be followed for 3 months.

    <description>MORE is a smartphone application which participants use to record information on a daily basis about seizures (severity, type), medications, and mood and stress levels. It also includes a camera-based application which uses a pill scanner and photo to record the identity and quantity (dose) of medications just prior to them being taken. Also included in the app are medication reminders, educational video clips, and self-management tips.</description>
