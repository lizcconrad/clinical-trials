  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To increase the diagnostic accuracy of subepithelial tumors, larger tissue samples are
      required. It is difficult to obtain adequate tissue samples. There were several biopsy
      methods to obtain tissue samples. Pathological examination would include mitosis counts,
      particularly in hypoechoic subepithelial tumors located in the 4th layer of the gastric wall,
      where differentiation between leiomyoma of benign nature and gastrointestinal stromal tumor
      (GIST) of malignant potential is essential.

      So We hypothesize that unroofing biopsy is an more appropriate method than EUS-FNB(endoscopic
      ultrasonography guided fine needle biopsy). We will compare diagnostic accuracy and
      complications between EUS-FNB &amp; unroofing biopsy.

    <description>Unroofing biopsy menas that the mucosa is resected with endoscopic mucosal resection and biopsies are done repeatedly for the exposed tumor with a conventional forcep. It will be performed for the patients with a suspected upper gastrointestinal subepithelial tumor after EUS-FNB. After unroofing biopsy, the final histopathological result will be used to determine diagnostic accuracy.</description>

    <description>EUS-FNB will be performed for the same patients who have a gastrointestinal subepithelail tumor before unroofing biopsy. EUS-FNB is called when the tissue is obtained by puncutre of a tumor, the tissue whithin the lumen of the fine needle being detached by rotatin, and the needle withdrawn. The pathological result will be also used to compare diagnostic accuracy between EUS-FNB &amp; unroofing biopsy.</description>
