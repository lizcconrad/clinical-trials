  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an increasingly accepted neurostimulation- based
      treatment for major depressive disorder. While there is a growing anecdotal database
      supporting its use in bipolar depression the investigators propose to collect open label
      efficacy and safety data in a small population of patients with clinically verified bipolar
      disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to screen patients with bipolar depression I or II, who are already
      on acceptable mood stabilization. They may or may not be on antidepressants at the time of
      screening but subjects on antidepressants would be taken off them before completing the
      screening phase. Those patients who have a depression of at least moderate severity without
      significant symptoms of activation or mania will be started on a course of open label TMS
      treatment of up to 35 sessions. Safety and efficacy assessments will be done weekly. Patients
      will complete a course of treatment when they meet remission criteria (MADRS score &lt; 10) or
      at the end of 30 treatments, whichever comes first. Patient who are still judged to be
      improving between treatment 25 and treatment 30 will be eligible to complete up to five
      addition treatments as the discretion of each site's principal investigator. Patients who
      meet response criteria (MADRS score decreases by at least 50%) will complete the full course
      of 30 to 35 TMS sessions. Patients will be withdrawn for safety concerns, particularly the
      onset of activation suggestive of mania or a mixed state.

      Patients who meet response or remission criteria will be followed monthly for up to six
      months to evaluate the durability of response. They will be on standard mood stabilizing
      medications and psychotherapy per their clinician's discretion.

    <description>A decrease in MADRS score of at lease 50% will be considered a response to treatment. A MADRS score of less than 10 will be considered remission. We will subdivide patients based on the diagnosis of either bipolar I or bipolar II to compare effectiveness between those groups.</description>

    <description>A YMRS score of 14 or greater will be used for criteria of onset of manic symptoms. The patients will be separated based on their diagnostic category of either Bipolar I Disorder or Bipolar II Disorder.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) to calculate percentage of patients meeting response criteria</measure>

    <description>HAM-D response criteria will be based off a HAM-D score drop of at least 50%. Remission HAM-D score will be 7 or less. For the patients meeting remission criteria, we will calculate the number of treatments required to achieve remission. Patients who only meet response criteria will be treated for 30 to 35 sessions.
Responders and remitters will also be followed for six months after the final treatment to see the durability of response. Percentage of patients' meeting relapse criteria will be calculated.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria- Phase II:

          1. Must be at least 18 years old.

          2. Must meet DSM-5 criteria for bipolar (either I or II) depression by clinical interview
             and M.I.N.I. The duration of the current depressive episode must be at least 4 weeks
             and no longer than 3 years in length.

          3. Should have a MADRS score of at least 20 at screening, an YMRS score of less than 12
             and a CGI score of at least 4.

          4. Must have signed the informed consent document and have a level of understanding
             sufficient to provide informed consent and to communicate with the investigator and
             site personnel.

          5. Must be on a mood stabilizer acceptable to the study physician which is consistent
             with their diagnosis. The mood stabilizer must be at a stable dose for at least four
             days before starting TMS treatment.

          6. If female of childbearing potential, patients must

               1. have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening, and

               2. not be nursing or planning a pregnancy, and

               3. be on a medically acceptable method of birth control acceptable to the principal
                  investigator.

        Choices of contraception that meet the study requirements are

          -  Intrauterine device

          -  Hormonal contraception (estrogen-containing birth control pills, Vaginal ring, patch,
             injections or implants)

          -  Latex condom with spermicide

          -  Diaphragm with spermicide

          -  Cervical cap with spermicide

        Females of childbearing potential who are abstinent can enroll in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria- Phase II:

          1. May not be directly affiliated with Sheppard Pratt Clinical Research Programs or be
             immediate family of Research Programs personnel.

          2. Must not have another primary Axis I diagnosis.

          3. The subject must not have stopped an antidepressant less than two weeks before
             starting TMS treatment or unable to discontinue antidepressant therapy.

          4. Should have no previous history of psychosis or substance dependence or abuse within
             the six months prior to Screening

          5. Presence of an Axis II disorder felt by the investigator to potentially interfere with
             study compliance would exclude a potential participant.

          6. Should not have prior intolerance of TMS or significant lack of response to adequate
             trials of TMS.

          7. Should not have a lifetime history of lack of response to ECT or VNS.

          8. Should not have any medical condition likely to interfere with safe study
             participation.

          9. Women of child-bearing potential who are not using a medically accepted means of
             contraception when engaging in sexual intercourse are excluded, as well as women who
             are pregnant or breast-feeding.

         10. Positive urine screen for any substance of abuse will exclude a patient, with the
             exception of benzodiazepines. A satisfactory explanation in the opinion of the
             investigator along with a negative repeat screen prior to Visit 2 is possibly
             acceptable.

         11. Current suicide risk, as evidenced:

               1. It is the judgment of the investigator that the patient may be at risk for
                  suicide

               2. The patient has rated a &quot;yes&quot; to question 4 or question 5 on the Screening C-SSRS

               3. The patient has attempted suicide within the past 12 months prior to Screening.

         12. History of head injury, epilepsy or seizure disorder, non-removable metallic implants
             or objects in or around the head.

        Inclusion Criteria- Phase III Patients who meet MADRS criteria for response or remission
        will enter Phase III, the six month follow-up phase of the study.
