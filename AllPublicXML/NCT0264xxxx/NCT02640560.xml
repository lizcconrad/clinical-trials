  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Italy, few data about anaphylaxis due to peanuts in pediatric age are available,
      conversely data about walnuts/hazelnuts, shellfish/mollusks anaphylaxis have not yet been
      collected.

      Children with physician-confirmed food allergy to peanuts, walnuts/hazelnuts and
      shellfish/mollusks will be recruited from 9 allergy clinics located in the Italian Territory
      (Bologna, Lecce, Napoli, Palermo, Parma, Pavia, Roma, Torino, Trento).

      Parent of food allergic children will compile a food allergy questionnaire (questions about
      general information on the family, on life and food habits, on indoor environment, on health
      status, on clinical aspects of the allergy, on the access to diagnostic and treatment
      resources).

      Parent of healthy children will compile a control questionnaire (questions about general
      information on the family, on life and food habits and on indoor environment) The 1-year
      survey will determine the frequency of anaphylaxis in allergic outpatient children.
