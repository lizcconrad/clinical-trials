  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if home-based therapy with monitoring via
      telemedicine can overcome many barriers to compliance and improve rehabilitation. Patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty will be followed for 10 weeks during their outpatient
      physical therapy course. Subjects will undergo standard physical therapy or physical therapy
      paired with InterACTION for 10 weeks.
