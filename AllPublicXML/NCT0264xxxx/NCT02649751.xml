    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, dose ranging, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study.

      The aim of this study is to assess the safety of increasing doses of roscovitine administered
      orally for 4 cycles of 4 consecutive days (treatment &quot;on&quot;) separated by a 3 days treatment
      free period (treatment &quot;off&quot;) in adult CF subjects with Cystic Fibrosis carrying 2 Cystic
      Fibrosis causing mutations with at least one F508del-CFTR mutation and chronically infected
      with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

      This study involved 36 Cystic Fibrosis patients: 24 treated and 12 controls.

      ROSCO-CF is a phase II, dose ranging, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled study to
      evaluate safety and effects of (R)-roscovitine in subjects with Cystic Fibrosis carrying 2
      Cystic Fibrosis causing mutations with at least one F508del-CFTR mutation and chronically
      infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

      The aim of this study is to assess the safety of increasing doses of roscovitine administered
      orally for 4 cycles of 4 consecutive days (treatment &quot;on&quot;) separated by a 3 days treatment
      free period (treatment &quot;off&quot;) in 36 adult cystic fibrosis subjects.

      These 36 patients will be allocated to 3 groups of 12 subjects who will be randomized in a
      2:1 ratio (active drug to matching placebo). In each group, 8 patients will receive
      roscovitine (200 mg, 400 mg, 2 X 400 mg in group 1, 2 and 3, respectively) and 4 will receive
      a matching placebo. Treatment will be provided by oral administration of capsules. Each
      patient will receive the same treatment throughout the 28 day study.

      This phase II trial will give some preliminary information about safety and hints of effects
      of a new experimental treatment. If the data suggest that a short term treatment with
      roscovitine provides a safe, effective and convenient approach for CF patients chronically
      infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, patients participating in this proof of concept trial
      will be offered to participate in further longer term studies.
