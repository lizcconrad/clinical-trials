      The study objective is to assess the accuracy of Earlysense contactless monitoring to detect
      changes in blood pressure vs. Gold reference method / devices including ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring device (ABPM) or invasive blood pressure monitoring for patients who have
      arterial line as part of their standard clinical care.

      The study objective is to collect data to assess the accuracy and reliability of Earlysense
      contactless monitoring for blood pressure monitoring vs. gold reference methods such as ABPM
      (Ambulatory blood pressure measurement) for patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine
      department and vs. Arterial Line measurements for patients hospitalized in ICU. In addition
      the collected data will be used to further enhance and improve the existing algorithms.
