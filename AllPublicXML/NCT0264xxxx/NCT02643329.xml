  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the bioavailability of a generic product of gliclazide
      (Product Name: BF-Gliclazide Tablet 80mg, Manufactured by Bright Future Pharmaceuticals
      Factory O/B Bright Future Pharmaceutical Laboratories Limited) with that of reference product
      (Product Name: Diamicron 80mg Tablet, Manufactured by Les Laboratoires Servier Industrie,
      France) when administered to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. The plasma
      pharmacokinetic data of gliclazide obtained from two formulations will be used to access the
      interchangeability of the products.

      The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover with a
      washout period of one to two weeks. During each study session, healthy male subjects will be
      administered a single oral dose of 80 mg gliclazide (one BF-Gliclazide Tablet 80 mg or one
      Diamicron 80 mg Tablet) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours. 20% glucose will
      be given orally to each subject at 2 h after drug administration to minimize the risk of
      hypoglycaemia. Venous blood samples will be collected at pre-dose (0 h) and up to 72 hours
      post-dose. The plasma concentrations of gliclazide will be determined by a validated assay.
      The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze the plasma concentration-time data and
      calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and
      T1/2. ANOVA will be conducted on logarithmically transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf.
      The two one-sided tests will be used to calculate the 90% confidence intervals for the mean
      difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax, and to assess the bioequivalence of the two
      products.
