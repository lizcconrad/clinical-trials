  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of EDs (ED) and post-traumatic sequelae of childhood trauma leads to
      significant impairment, suffering and represents a public health concern because it is
      frequently associated with role impairment, and is frequently under-treated. Considering the
      severity of these conditions, there is a need to develop more effective treatments that are
      tailored to the specific needs of these patients as no conclusion has been made about the
      treatment of choice. To improve treatment it is critically important to study treatment
      effects and the mechanism of these effects.

      The overall aim of the current project is; (1) To build knowledge on how to best treat
      patients with ED with and without childhood trauma, (2) To develop our understanding about
      how change happens for these patients. The investigators will do this by compare two
      treatment models; (1) Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT) and (2) Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
      (CBT), for EDs both treatment types delivered at Modum Bad Psychiatric Center, department of
      ED.

      Patients included in this randomized controlled trial will receive treatment at Modum Bad,
      satisfy DSM-V criteria for ED and half of the patients will in addition have a history of
      childhood trauma. A total of 86 patients who have received either CFT or CBT are followed up
      two year after completion of the treatment. The study utilises a rich data set collected
      outcome measures at altogether 5 time points and process and sub-outcome measures at 13 time
      points. The investigators will take advantage of our established collaborative networks, both
      nationally and internationally and existing procedures, where all patients are assessed with
      the same clinical instruments based on current state-of-the-art methods.

    <description>This version of CBT is based on techniques employed in evidence-based approaches to a transdiagnostic sample. The programme includes; individualized formulation, taking into account different maintaining factors across cases (e.g., nutritional and/or emotional drivers for binging); agenda setting; homework; change in diet (particularly to improve carbohydrate intake); diary-keeping; exposure; behavioral experiments; cognitive restructuring; and surveys. The behavioral change is maintained as a focus, along with changes in mood and cognitions.</description>

    <description>There are four main treatment elements to the program. Two of these are linked to the experience of being a therapy group. This involves patients providing compassionate support to other group members.The third treatment element involves compassionate mind training which mainly focuses on activating the soothing system via imagery and related practical exercises.The final element of the program aims to help patients improve their ability to use their wider social network to access support.</description>
