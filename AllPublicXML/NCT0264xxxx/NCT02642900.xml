  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Candida albicans is the most prevalent species in denture-related stomatitis (DS). There are
      several treatment options for this condition, including the use of antifungal agents such as
      nystatin and miconazole. The side effects and the increasing number of resistant species
      caused by the use of these drugs encourage the development of alternative therapies.
      Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) has been used as a promising treatment of stomatitis. In this
      randomized clinical trial, the effectiveness of PDT was evaluated. Patients in this study
      were allocated to two groups. One group was treated with nystatin, and the other group was
      treated with PDT.

    <textblock>
      Different Candida species, including albicans, tropicalis, and parapsilosis, are present in
      the human oral microbiota, gastrointestinal tract and vagina. These species are typically
      harmless commensals. Candida albicans, the most prevalent species, may be present in up to
      80% of healthy individuals. This species is found with high frequency in dental prostheses
      and is thought to be the main pathogen associated with stomatitis in elderly denture wearers.
      Biofilms of Candida albicans are usually found in intravenous catheters, prostheses, and
      these biofilms promote a high resistance to antifungal drugs. The standard treatment of
      stomatitis is topical antifungal agents, including nystatin and miconazole. The use of
      topical antifungal agents has caused some problems. Poor responses to these agents are the
      result of dilution and fast elimination of the drug because of the action of the saliva,
      which reduced the drug's concentration. The drug's toxicity can cause mild and transient
      gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Alternative treatments
      or adjuvant treatments have been used to treat these diseases, such as the use of probiotic
      bacteria and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using a non-toxic dye (photosensitizer - PS) in
      combination with a source of visible light with a peak wavelength suitable for absorption by
      the PS. The photodynamic process rapidly generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as
      peroxides, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide ions and singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen has been
      implicated as the major causative agent of cellular damage in the photodynamic process, but
      it does not cause cellular damage in host tissues. The amount of ROS formation is the main
      predictor of yeast killing.

      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment
      of denture stomatitis in complete denture wearers.

    <description>Patients were treated with a topical antifungal nystatin oral suspension(1000.000 units) 5mL every six hours/14 days. Patients were instructed to rinse the solution for 5 minutes and then to spit the solution out. Samples were collected on days 7, 14 and 30 after the end of treatment (follow-up).</description>

    <description>Patients used mouthwash with methylene blue 0.005% for 20 minutes (pre-irradiation time). The palatal mucosa was irradiated using a low level laser with the following settings: wavelength of 660 nm, energy density of 120 J/cm ², output power of 40 milliwatt, 2 minutes per point. PDT was performed in two sessions (one session per week). Samples were collected immediately after each clinical procedure and 30 days after the second procedure (follow-up).</description>
