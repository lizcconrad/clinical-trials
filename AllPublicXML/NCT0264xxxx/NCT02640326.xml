  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is common practice to insert a Foley catheter into the bladder to drain urine during and
      after a lung resection. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the potential risks
      associated with this catheterization, particularly with regard to infection. As thoracic
      surgery adopts minimally invasive surgical techniques, the need for urinary catheterization
      during surgery is being questioned since these less invasive surgeries are known to result in
      less post-operative acute pain, shorter length of stay, and other outcomes that tend to
      decrease overall anesthetic needs for this patient population. Thus, there is a need to
      investigate whether patients who have had a minimally invasive lung resection truly need the
      Foley catheter at all. This will be achieved by assigning patients to either an experimental
      no-catheter group or the standard of care routine urinary catheter group to determine if
      patients with no catheter experience different rates of complications. This pilot study will
      primarily determine if there is a difference in post operative urinary complications between
      the groups. It is hoped that this study will definitively determine whether a Foley urine
      catheter is a necessary procedure in the course of a minimally invasive lung resection.

    <textblock>
      Urinary catheterization is standard practice during and shortly after lung resections. The
      standard practice is being questioned in an era where unnecessary interventions are being
      re-considered, particularly since urinary catheterization is not without a risk of adverse
      events. The study is being done to establish an evidence base to support widespread
      discontinuation or continuation of this standard practice. Consenting patients will be
      randomized to either the catheterized or non-catheterized arms. Patient urinary management
      will be managed as per an a priori-defined protocol that follows St. Joseph's Healthcare
      Hamilton (SJHH) institutional standards.
