      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the Family Caregiver Training
      Program for caregivers of people with dementia, using a pretest posttest randomized control
      trial with 3-month follow-up. The Family Caregiver Training Program will consist of 3-hours
      and hence, three modules over the course of one day. Module one will present information on
      communication, eating, and nutrition, module two will focus on transfers and toileting, and
      module three will focus on bathing, grooming, and dressing. The control group will receive
      standard care as relevant to dementia family caregivers including general information on the
      progression of dementia, and helpful resources as suggested by the Alzheimer's Association. A
      convenience sample of 36 family caregivers will be recruited by flyers posted throughout
      local area community boards and Alzheimer's Association media outlets. A repeated measures
      ANOVA will be used to assess the group differences in knowledge and confidence at three time
      points (pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-months post-intervention). Changes in
      caregiver burden, depression, quality of life, and occupational performance and satisfaction
      will be assessed 3-months post-intervention.

      The main research question asks to what extent does participation in a structured 3-hour
      training module (i.e., The Family Caregiver Training Program) focused on assisting family
      caregiver's with the ADLs of people with dementia effect caregiver knowledge and confidence,
      which in turn may effect caregiver burden, depression, quality of life, and occupational
      performance and satisfaction. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between the Family
      Caregiver Training Program intervention and knowledge of and confidence in the occupation of
      caregiving. Aim 2 will explore the relationship between the occupation of caregiving and
      person characteristics including burden, depression, and quality of life. Aim 3 will explore
      the relationship between the changes in the occupation of caregiving and changes in
      occupational performance.

      A feasibility of the Family Caregiver Training Program was established using a single pre-
      post- test design. A significant improvement in caregiver knowledge was found in all three
      areas of training: communication/nutrition (N=53, p&lt;0.001), transfers and toileting (N=46,
      p=0.003), and bathing and dressing (N=45, p=0.10) (DiZazzo-Miller, Samuel, Barnas, &amp; Welker,
      2014). This proposed study is built on the feasibility study, with the addition of
      confidence, burden, depression, quality of life, and occupational performance and
      satisfaction as outcomes using a random assignment to control group design.

      A convenience sample of 36 family caregivers was recruited through flyers, newsletters, and
      Alzheimer's Association media outlets. The intervention group received one two-hour training
      that included three modules. Module one presented information on communication,
      eating/feeding and nutrition; module two focused on transfers and toileting; and module three
      focused on bathing, grooming, and dressing. The control group received standard care based
      upon a packet developed by the Alzheimer's Association for physicians to distribute to
      families and caregivers after receiving a diagnosis of dementia.

      Results from this study will be generalizable to Metro-Detroit area family caregivers.
      Findings may offer information to enhance the caregiver training literature in the field of
      occupational therapy on the impact a community-based activity of daily living training can
      have with dementia family caregivers.
