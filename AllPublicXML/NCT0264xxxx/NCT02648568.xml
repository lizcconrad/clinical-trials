    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the benefit of two cognitive therapies in severe
      sleepwalking/ sleep terrors: relaxation vs. relaxation plus hypnosis. This is a monocentric,
      double-blind controlled study. 75 patients (aged more than 15 yo) with severe sleepwalking
      (defined as at least one epsidoe per week and at least two awakenings in stage N3 on video
      polysomngraphy) will be included. All patients will have a visit 1 for diagnosis including a
      medical interview, a video polysomnography, questionnaires on sleepwalking (PADSS and
      systematized interview), sleep quality (PSQI, MEQ) and sleepiness (Epworth scale) and
      suggestibility scale. 25 patients will be randomized to the relaxation group, 25 patients to
      the hypnosis plus relaxation group, while the 25 non-randomized patients will be non-treated
      controls. Randomized patients will receive the therapy on day 1, and be monitored during the
      subsequent night. They will have a weekly therapy for 4 additional sessions and be monitored
      again on Month 1, as well as they will complete the sleep and sleepwalking questionnaires.
      They will also complete the questionnaire by phone on Month 3. The non-randomized controls
      will complete the questionnaire on month 1, with no therapeutical intervention between Day 1
      and Month 1. The main outcome will be the frequency of sleepwalking episodes, as assessed by
      the PADSS-B. Secondary outcomes include the changes in other subitems of teh PADSS, of the N3
      awakenings in v-PSG between night 1 and Night 2 (short term effect) and Night 1 and Night 28
      (long term effect), as well as changes in sleep quality and sleepiness scales. A comparison
      of spectral EEG, as well as respiration, eye movements, muscle tone and heart rate during
      rest, hypnosis trance, relaxation and sleepwalking episodes is also scheduled.
