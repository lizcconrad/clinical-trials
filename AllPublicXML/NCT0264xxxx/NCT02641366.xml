  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment option for individuals with
      debilitating tremors that do not respond to medical therapy. However, severe tremors,
      particularly those that develop after central nervous system insult or from multiple
      sclerosis, can be comprised of several underlying components that represent dysfunction
      within distinct brain circuits. Some of these dysfunctional brain circuits can be
      successfully treated with DBS while others respond poorly DBS therapy. For severe tremors, it
      can be very difficult to discriminate between the underlying components of a patient movement
      disorder and is exclusively dependent upon clinical expertise. Even with extensive clinical
      experience, it is difficult to reliably predict the results of DBS therapy for patients
      suffering from severe, debilitating tremor. In an attempt to gain more knowledge, an
      electromagnetic tracking system will be used which can precisely measure the position of a
      patient's upper extremity in space during routine neurologic examination. The goal is to use
      this tool to quantitatively identify various components of severe tremor, which can be
      discriminated based on oscillatory frequency and regularity of tremor amplitude. The purpose
      of this research study is to better understand the nature of complex, severe tremors by
      carefully measuring movement of the upper extremities with sensors during simple tasks. The
      goal is to break down complicated tremors into their components and then determine which
      components will respond to deep brain stimulation.

      As a participant in the research study small sensors that are connected to wires will be
      affixed to points on your hand, wrist, elbow and/or shoulder. These sensors are painless and
      otherwise noninvasive. They will be used to measure the precise location of the hand and arm
      in space during the neurologic examination. This exam will test the tremors during short,
      simple tasks using the hand and arm. This information will be stored along with your name and
      medical record number for analysis after your testing is complete.

      The sensors that are used to measure movements are connected to thin, flexible wires that
      will be attached with adhesive tape. The motion sensors use a magnet that produces a weak
      electromagnetic field. This electromagnetic field poses no direct harm, but could potentially
      interfere with medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers or deep brain stimulators if placed
      very close to the electromagnetic emitter.

    <description>This group have already undergone Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) placement and will have measurements of tremor kinetics by using the electromagnetic tracking. The electromagnetic sensors will be placed on the arm and hand while the routine outpatient neurologic examinations are being performed. The testing will be performed with the DBS system in both the on and off settings.</description>
