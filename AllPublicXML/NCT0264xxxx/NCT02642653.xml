  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of a 20 week multi-modal treatment comprised
      of lovastatin or placebo, and the Parent-implemented Language Intervention (PILI) in children
      with FXS. Children will be randomized to drug or placebo in a double-blind design with all
      participating in the PILI. The primary endpoint will be to measure improvements in spoken
      language and behavior among lovastatin-treated than placebo treated participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first multi-modal treatment to combine a targeted treatment for FXS, lovastatin,
      with an innovative parent-implemented intervention (PILI) targeting language and challenging
      behavior delivered through telehealth technology.The hypothesis is that targeted treatments
      will be more effective when applied in combination with PILI. Examination of whether changes
      in the activity of key pathways/proteins influenced by FMRP (the mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (ERK) and MMP-9) are biomarkers of treatment responsiveness. Because lovastatin is
      also an anti-inflammatory, characterization of MEK/ERK signaling in peripheral immune cells
      both pre- and post- treatment will be carried out to determine whether levels of these
      signaling molecules are predictive biomarkers of treatment response. It is hypothesized that
      those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokine profiles will be most responsive to
      lovastatin treatment. Once modeled in FXS, results from these studies can then be applied to
      other neurodevelopmental disorders including Rasopathies.

      The behavioral component of the proposed multi-modal treatment will be a Parent-implemented
      Intervention (PILI) that targets improvements in spoken language and challenging behavior for
      10- to 17-year-olds with FXS by increasing parental verbal responsiveness (PVR) within
      picture-book based story-telling episodes. Parents will be encouraged to use the targeted
      strategies in other everyday interactions with their child. The intervention will be
      delivered to parents in their homes by way of video teleconferencing (VTC). Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive the behavioral intervention alone or in combination with
      Lovastatin.

    <measure>Change from baseline in the participant and mother Expressive Language Sample composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The expressive language sample is collected from shared interactions around a digital wordless picture book involving the participant with fragile X syndrome and his mother. The composite is created from separate measures of the number of different words used by the participant and the mean length of his communication units measured in morphemes. Samples are collected pre- and post-treatment using different digital books on each occasion, with improvement in the composite expected from pre to post.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the FXS- normed Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) social avoidance subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC-C is a 58- item caregiver-rated behavior scale used to examine treatment effects on challenging behaviors for individuals with FXS in the following domains: (1) irritability, agitation, crying; (2) lethargy, social withdrawal; (3) stereotypic behavior (4) hyperactivity, noncompliance; and (5) inappropriate speech. The social avoidance subscale will be analyzed utilizing the Sansone et al. (2011) FXS-normed ABC scoring measures.</description>

    <measure>Improvement of Symptoms in Fragile X using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale</measure>

    <description>A clinician rated scale utilizing history from the parents or caregiver and incorporating it into a clinical rating, first for severity, and then for clinical follow-up. The CGI-S will be used at the pre-treatment assessment to judge symptom severity and the CGI- I will be used at the 10 week and 20 week visits.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>

    <description>The measure will be used to assess parental impressions of progress in two key symptoms: spoken language impairment and social impairment. The distance of the mark from one end is used as the outcome variable for analysis.</description>
