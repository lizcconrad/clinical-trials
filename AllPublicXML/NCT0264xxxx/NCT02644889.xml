    <textblock>
      This study has been designed in order to detect EGFR mutation abundance of tissue and
      concentration of plasma from Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer during treatment with
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) .Through this experiment the investigators aim to evaluate
      the feasibility of plasma EGFR detection and evaluate the correlation of EGFR mutations and
      prognosis.
