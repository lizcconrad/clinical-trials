  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cortisol overproduction ( Cushings syndrome) is a condition where the patient have a special
      fat distribution, with accumulation of fat around the abdomen and in the neck, with thinner
      limbs and weak musculature. The condition can be difficult to separate from adipositas in
      general. Screening for hypercortisolism in adults has been easier the last years, because we
      can measure free cortisol in saliva samples at late night. In children we still dont have
      reference ranges for saliva cortisol in children, so the screening is still troublesome,
      based on Collection of 24-hour urine.The meaning of this study is to establish reference
      ranges for saliva cortisol, and evaluate in a cohort with adipose children if screening with
      saliva cortisol is sensitive and specific enough to be the New screening test for
      hypercortisolism in children too.

      the investigators have collected saliva samples morning and late evening for cortisol
      measurements in a total of 330 children ( 660 samples) in the age from 4 to 16 years ols.
      This samples are going to be used to define a reference range for saliva cortisol in
      children.

      The investigators are then collecting 24 hour urine and saliva samples ( morning and late
      evening) from children at the obesity clinic Haukeland University hospital for verification
      of the reference range , and to estimate if the test is good enough to identify the patients
      that have Cushings syndrome.

      Since the diagnose is very seldom in children, we will get help from a 3. line referral
      center in London to include patients with true Cushings syndrome.
