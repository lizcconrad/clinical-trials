    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-sequence DDI study designed to examine the effects of dupilumab
      on the pharmacokinetics of selected cytochrome P450 substrates in adult patients with
      moderate to severe AD.

      The study consists of a screening period (day -35 to -2), study period 1 (day -1 to 7), study
      period 2 (day 8 to 50), and a follow-up period (day 51 to 135 [end of study]).

      Following completion of study period 2 (Day 50), patients will be given the option to enroll
      into the Open-Label Extension (OLE) study R668-AD-1225. Patients who decline will be followed
      for the next 12 weeks (Day 135).

          6. History of excessive consumption of beverages containing caffeine (more than 4 cups or
             glasses per day). Patients who are not willing to abstain from the consumption of
             caffeine during certain periods of the study will also be excluded

         12. Known or suspected immunodeficiency, including history of invasive opportunistic
             infections (eg, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, listeriosis, coccidioidomycosis,
             pneumocystosis, aspergillosis) despite infection resolution, or otherwise recurrent
             infections of abnormal frequency or prolonged duration suggesting an immune
             compromised status, as judged by the investigator

         13. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive HIV serology at

         14. Positive with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb),
             or hepatitis C antibody (Hep C Ab) at the screening visit. NOTE: Patients who are
             HBsAg negative and HBsAb positive are considered immune after a natural infection has
             cleared or they have been vaccinated against hepatitis B. Therefore, they are
             acceptable for the study.

         15. History of malignancy within 5 years before the baseline visit, except completely
             treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, and completely treated and resolved
             non-metastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin

         16. History of clinical endoparasitosis (ie, helminth infection) within 12 months before
             the baseline visit, or high risk of helminth infection, such as residence within or
             recent travel (within 12 months before the baseline visit) to areas endemic for
             endoparasitoses, where the circumstances are consistent with parasite exposure (eg,
             extended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running water, consumption of uncooked,
             undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close contact with carriers
             and vectors, etc), unless subsequent medical assessments (eg, stool exam, blood tests,
             etc) have ruled out the possibility of parasite infection/infestation

         17. Female patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant or
             breastfeed during the study

         18. Women who are using any form of hormonal contraceptives (eg, oral, injectables,
             implants, patches, rings, hormone-impregnated intrauterine devices [IUDs]) for birth
             control

         19. Women unwilling to use adequate birth control, if of reproductive potential and
             sexually active.
