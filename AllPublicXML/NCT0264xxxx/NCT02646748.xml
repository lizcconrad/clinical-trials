      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b platform study in subjects with advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors (Part 1a) and subjects with selected solid tumors (Part 1b and Part
      2). Two treatment groups (Group A and Group B) will be evaluated

      Part 1a utilizes a 3+3 design to evaluate pembrolizumab and INCB combinations in advanced
      solid tumors. Group A will evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity itacitinib
      (INCB039110) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Group B will evaluate a
      PI3K-delta inhibitor (INCB050465) in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or PAD and recommend a dose for the Part 1b safety expansion with each
      combination.

      Once the recommended dose has been identified in Part 1a, subjects with select solid tumor
      types will be enrolled into safety expansion cohorts based upon prior treatment history with
      a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b) for each combination.

      Part 2 utilizes a Simon 2-Stage design to evaluate INCB050465 in combination with
      pembrolizumab in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and a 1 stage design to evaluate
      the combination in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial cancer
      (UC).

      This is an open-label, Phase 1b, 3 Part (Part 1a, Part 1b, and Part 2), multi-center study.

      Part 1a utilizes a 3+3 design to evaluate pembrolizumab and INCB combinations in advanced
      solid tumors. Group A will evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity itacitinib
      (INCB039110) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Group B will evaluate a
      PI3K-delta inhibitor (INCB050465) in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or PAD and recommend a dose for the Part 1b safety expansion with each
      combination.

      Once the recommended dose has been identified in Part 1a, subjects with endometrial cancer,
      gastric cancer, melanoma, microsatellite unstable (MSI) colorectal cancer or other
      MMR-deficient tumors, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or
      transitional cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract will be enrolled into safety expansion
      cohorts based upon prior treatment history with a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b) for
      each combination.

      Part 2 utilizes a Simon 2-Stage design to evaluate INCB050465 in combination with
      pembrolizumab in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and a 1 stage design to evaluate
      the combination in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial cancer
      (UC).

             that have had disease progression after available therapies for advanced or metastatic
             disease that are known to confer clinical benefit, been intolerant to treatment, or
             refused standard treatment.

          -  For Part 1b: Must have documented confirmed disease progression on a prior PD-1
             pathway targeted agent or must be PD-1 pathway-targeted treatment naïve.

        not have had previous treatment with antibodies that modulate T-cell function or checkpoint
        pathways. Must have disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy or must be
        intolerant to or refuse standard treatment. Must not have received more than 2 lines of
        prior therapy.

          -  Received an immune-suppressive based treatment for any reason within 14 days prior to
             the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Has not recovered from toxic effect of prior therapy to &lt; Grade 1.

          -  Active or inactive autoimmune process.
