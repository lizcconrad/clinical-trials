  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral rehydration therapy is the only treatment recommended by the World Health Organization
      in acute diarrhea in children. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety
      of a therapy with gelatin tannate plus oral rehydration versus oral rehydration alone in
      children with acute gastroenteritis.

      This is a single-blind, prospective, randomized and parallel study performed in two Pediatric
      Services of tertiary referral hospitals. Patients, ages 3 to 36 months with acute
      gastroenteritis randomized to receive an oral rehydration solution (OR), or an oral
      rehydration solution plus gelatin tannate (OR+G). The primary outcomes evaluated were: the
      number of bowel movements after 48 and 72 hours after initiating treatments. Secondary
      outcomes were: duration of diarrhea (days), stool characteristics and adverse events. Other
      clinical variables, as weight, fever, vomiting, appetite and the acceptability of the two
      treatments were also recorded.
