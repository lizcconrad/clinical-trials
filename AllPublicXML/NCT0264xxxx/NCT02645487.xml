    <textblock>
      SRS dose escalation for brain metastases in radiation-naïve patients will establish true
      tolerable doses, which may exceed the current standard doses. This may lead to an improvement
      in local control, patient survival, and/or quality-of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, several large randomized studies have shown that in patients with limited brain
      metastases, whole brain radiation can be safely deferred when treated with SRS and close
      surveillance. In light of this, most of such patients are now treated with SRS alone without
      WBRT. However, the SRS doses set by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 90-05 continue to
      be applied to patients without previous cranial irradiation.

      The potential insufficiency of current SRS dose for long-term tumor control is of pressing
      concern. The advances chemotherapy has led to an improvement in overall survival in many
      patients with metastatic cancer, including malignancies often associated with brain
      metastases, such as lung (40-50%) and breast (15%). As these patients survive longer, more
      patients may develop brain metastases and the current dose of SRS may not be adequate to
      control the brain metastases for the duration of their survival. In fact, there is evidence
      that the control rate declines with time after SRS, and after 3 years, the local control rate
      may be only about 60%. In the case of brain metastases from relatively radio-resistant
      melanoma, the reported 12-months local control rates for SRS range from 52% to 75%. More
      potent SRS doses could lead to improved long-term control of brain metastases.
