  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole body vibration (WBV) can help to improve muscle flexibility by stimulating the
      neuromuscular functions. But there is a dearth in the literature to prove its effectiveness
      in improving the flexibility of the upper limb muscles. Therefore the purpose of the study is
      to determine the effects of vibration on improving upper limb flexibility. This experimental
      research will be conducted by recruiting participants at the age of 19 to 27 with no
      histories of injuries on the upper limb. They will be randomly assigned into two groups;
      experimental (with vibration) and control (no vibration) group. The WBV machine will be used
      to provide vibration to the upper extremities by placing both palms on the vibration
      platform. The outcome measure of active chest flexibility and shoulder reach flexibility will
      be performed pre and post vibration.

    <description>Flexibility test of Active Chest Flexibility and Shoulder Reach Flexibility tests will be performed before and after the experiment to determine their improvement in the flexibility of the pectoral muscles. After measuring the flexibility, two stretching exercises of one-arm doorway stretch and office chest stretch will be performed. it will be done twice, 30 second each with 10 second rest in between. After exercise, this group had to undergo vibration exercise by using whole body vibration machine.</description>

    <description>vibration will be given using whole body vibration machine. The subject will place both palms on top of the vibration platform with their knee supported on the ground. They need to apply as much pressure on the vibration platform by using their body weight. The whole body vibration machine will be set at the frequency of 30 Hz and the amplitude of 5 mm. They need to hold that position for 1 minute for 3 sets with 1 minute rest in between. The researcher will immediately stop this if the subjects feel dizziness and discomfort</description>
