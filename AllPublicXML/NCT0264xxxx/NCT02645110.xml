      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of whole-natural hand-wash
      formulations in bacterial removal and to estimate the relative mildness of the formulations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand washing with soap and water is one of the main ways to prevent the spread of diseases in
      general and specifically, the spread of hospital-acquired diseases. Mother's Choice Company
      develops natural products and technologies which include hand-wash soap. The purpose of this
      project is developing a whole-natural hand wash soap including no harmful ingredients which
      will succeed to remove at least 99.9% (3 log reduction) of the hand transient microbiota. In
      addition, the soap will be mild enough to allow the use of dozens times a day. The procedure
      for evaluating soap effectiveness in bacterial removal will include in general: bacterial
      application on hands, hand washing with the tested soap, sampling of hands before and after
      hand washing. The procedure for soap mildness estimation will include exposure of specific
      area of the arm or the back skin to the soap and following up and grading the reaction of the
      skin.

    <description>For log reduction determination the bacterial counts will be converted to log10. Next, the final quantity of bacteria recovered from hands after washing hands with the tested soap will be reduced from the start quantity of bacteria that was recovered from hands after bacterial application (before washing hands). For each soap the log reduction of each subject and the average log reduction will be presented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For effectiveness test:

          -  Subjects must remove all jewelry from their hands and forearms before participating.

          -  Subjects must not expose their hands to any antimicrobial products for 24 hours before
             the test (including antimicrobial containing dish soaps, shampoos, and body washes).

          -  Subjects must don safety glasses and lab coat prior to participating.

          -  Subjects will not be exposed to more than one challenge microorganisms per week and
             more than five challenge microorganisms in total.

        For mildness test:

          -  Subject aged 18-60

          -  Subjects should be healthy adults from both sexes (preferably more women than men)

          -  Subjects would be able to participate in one study per four weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria
