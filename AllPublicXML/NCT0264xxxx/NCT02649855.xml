      Background:

      Metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the prostate
      area. It can be controlled by lowering the amount of testosterone in the body. This is called
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The vaccine PROSTVAC might help the immune system kill
      cancer cells. Researchers want to add PROSTVAC and docetaxel chemotherapy to ADT. They think
      this may work better against prostate cancer than ADT alone.

      Objective:

      To test if adding PROSTVAC and docetaxel to ADT works better against prostate cancer than ADT
      alone.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 18 years and over with metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Blood tests

      Possible CT, MRI, or bone scan: Participants lie in a machine. The machine takes pictures of
      the body.

      Electrocardiogram: Soft electrodes are stuck to the skin to record heart signals.

      Participants will have 2 optional tumor biopsies during the study.

      Participants will join 1 of 2 groups. Both groups will get:

      ADT

      Docetaxel by vein

      Steroids by mouth or vein before each docetaxel infusion

      PROSTVAC injection

      Both groups first have ADT. One to 4 months after, they have:

      Group A:

      Docetaxel every 3 weeks for 6 cycles

      PROSTVAC 3 weeks after the last infusion

      Booster injections 2 weeks later and then every 3 weeks, for 6 boosters total

      Group B:

      PROSTVAC

      Booster 2 weeks later

      Docetaxel hours later

      Docetaxel and the booster every 3 weeks for 6 cycles

      Participants will have a visit 4-5 weeks after the last treatment. They will then have visits
      every 12 weeks.

      Participants will be followed for up to 15 years. This includes physical exams every year for
      5 years.

      Background:

        -  A phase III trial demonstrated that combining docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy
           (ADT) significantly improved survival (57.6 vs 44.0 months (HR=0.56, (0.44-0.70), p
           &lt;0.0001) for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).

        -  PROSTVAC (developed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and licensed to Bavarian
           Nordic Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for
           prostate cancer.

        -  Preclinical and clinical studies support the potential synergy in the combination of
           docetaxel and PROSTVAC. The potential to combine docetaxel with vaccine in mCSPC could
           improve upon the survival advantage that has been previously seen.

      Objectives:

      Primary

      -To determine if PROSTVAC combined with docetaxel is able to induce greater antigen spreading
      (i.e. a broader immune response) with greater associated response score compared to docetaxel
      alone after 19 weeks.

      Key Eligibility Criteria:

        -  Must have castrate sensitive prostate cancer (rising PSA and testosterone over 100) or
           is within 134 days of starting ADT (Arm A or B) or within 28 days of start ADT (Arm C)

        -  Histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer

        -  Patients must have metastatic disease

        -  Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria

        -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function

      Design

        -  This is a randomized trial of ADT followed by simultaneous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3 weeks
           x 6 cycles + PROSTVAC q3 weeks x 6 cycles versus ADT followed by sequential docetaxel 75
           mg/m(2) q3 weeks x 6 cycles followed by PROSTVAC q3 weeks x 6 cycles in men with newly
           diagnosed mCSPC.

        -  Patients who have not started ADT or who have been on ADT 28 days or fewer will be
           assigned to treatment with PROSTVAC for 4 - 6 injections followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2
           q3 weeks x 6 cycles.
