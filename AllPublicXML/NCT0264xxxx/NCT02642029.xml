  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the
      impact of modulating cerebellar activity on time perception, executive function, and mood and
      psychotic symptoms in psychosis patients (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and
      bipolar disorder with psychotic features) and healthy control participants. The investigators
      hypothesize that abnormally reduced activity in the cerebellum contributes to the
      abnormalities in patients, that cerebellum-mediated disruptions in time perception may
      partially underlie executive dysfunction and symptoms, and that cerebellar stimulation will
      normalize disease-relevant outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cerebellum plays a major role in integrative processing of higher order cognitive and
      affective functions, but it has not been considered a major treatment target for psychotic
      disorders. The goal of this study is to administer three different conditions of transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS)-- excitatory, inhibitory, and sham TMS-- in a cross-over design in
      psychosis patients (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with
      psychotic features) and healthy control participants to investigate with causal explanatory
      power the role of the cerebellum as a treatment target for psychotic disorders. More
      specifically, the investigators will measure the effects of cerebellar excitation and
      inhibition on time perception, executive function, and symptomatology. TMS will be
      administered using a theta-burst stimulation (TBS) protocol applied to the posterior
      cerebellar vermis. Participants will undergo three study sessions, one for each of the three
      TMS conditions. During each session, the investigators will administer validated cognitive
      paradigms and clinical measures immediately before and after TMS.

      The specific aims are to:

      1: Investigate the role of the cerebellum in abnormalities of time perception, executive
      function, and mood and psychotic symptoms by evaluating these functions before and
      immediately after excitatory, inhibitory, or sham TMS applied to the cerebellar vermis in
      patients with psychosis and in healthy control participants.

      (1a) Time perception hypothesis: Compared with controls, patients with psychotic disorders
      will have impaired timing perception, i.e., higher number of errors and/or greater
      inter-trial variability in an interval discrimination task (Protocol A) +/- a repetitive
      tapping task (optional Protocol B) both at baseline and after sham TMS. The investigators
      predict that the abnormalities in patients will improve after excitatory but not inhibitory
      TMS.

      (1b) Executive function hypothesis: Patients will show a higher number of errors and longer
      reaction times on the N-back working memory task (Protocol A) +/- the multi-source
      interference task (optional Protocol B), both at baseline and after sham TMS. The
      investigators predict that these deficits in patients will improve after excitatory but not
      inhibitory TMS.

      (1c) Symptom hypothesis: Symptom ratings using visual analog scales will improve in the
      period immediately after excitatory but not inhibitory TMS, and show no significant change
      after sham TMS.

      2: Investigate the relationship between time perception and (a) executive function and (b)
      symptomatology in patients with psychotic disorders. Hypothesis: The investigators predict
      that performance on the time perception task will correlate with performance on a working
      memory task as well as with mood and psychotic symptoms.

      This study may improve understanding about the role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology
      of psychotic disorders. Such knowledge can potentially guide the development of cerebellar
      TMS as a therapeutic intervention for psychosis.

    <measure>Change (Δ) in accuracy of time interval discrimination (Protocol A) pre- and post-TMS</measure>
    <time_frame>In each of the 3 study visits, participants will undergo (a) pre-TMS assessments (15-20min), (b) TMS (15min), and (c) post-TMS assessments (15-20min). Thus, approximately 30-45 min will separate the pre- and post-TMS task performances.</time_frame>
    <description>In each trial, participants are presented with two tones separated by 1200 ms (the standard interval), a 1s delay, then a comparison pair of tones. The time interval of the second tone pair will be either equal to (E-condition), longer than (L-condition), or shorter than (S-condition) that of the first pair. Participants are asked to indicate using a keyboard whether the second time interval is equal, longer, or shorter than the first.</description>

    <description>Participants are asked to tap a response button at the same rate as auditory tones presented every 500ms (tone-paced tapping). After 12 taps, the tone is discontinued and participants are required to continue tapping at the same rate as the previously presented signal (self-paced tapping).</description>

    <time_frame>In each of the 3 study visits, participants will undergo (a) pre-TMS assessments (15-20min), (b) TMS (15min), and (c) post-TMS assessments (15-20min). Thus, approximately 30-45 min will separate the pre- and post-TMS task performances.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with three numbers (1, 2, or 3) and/or letters (&quot;x&quot;) on a computer screen every 1.75s, with one number always different from the other two matching numbers or letters (distractor stimuli). In control trials (in which both numbers and &quot;x's&quot; are presented), the target number matches its position on the button-press (e.g., &quot;1xx&quot; where 1 is the target number). In interference trials (in which only numbers are presented), the target does not match its position on the button-press (e.g., &quot;221&quot; where 1 is the target number). Participants are asked to report, via button-press, the identity of the number that is different from the other two.</description>

    <description>Participants will take a brief computerized survey pre- and post-TMS, in which they will be presented with visual analogue scales (VAS) and asked to indicate current levels of depression, anxiety, euphoria, auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, paranoia, referential thinking, and delusions of control. The VAS format will allow participants to self-report ratings quickly and easily with simple mouse clicks.</description>
