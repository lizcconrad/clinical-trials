  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients requiring the heart valve replacement surgery, heart function is injured in
      different degree.Thus, minimizing the impact of the anesthesia drug on the cardiovascular
      system has important clinical meanings. Etomidate has slight effect on the cardiovascular
      system, often used in the induction of anesthesia, however target controlled infusion
      etomidate in maintenance of anesthesia is less used. So, the trial is designed to observe the
      application value of TCI etomidate in thoracoscopic mitral valve replacement surgery.
