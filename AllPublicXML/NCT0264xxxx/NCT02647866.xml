      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of administration of
      multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 and to select the highest dose tolerated by subjects with
      moderately active Ulcerative Colitis (UC) followed by a Long-term Extension Therapy (LTE)
      phase for eligible subjects with a clinical response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, double-blind clinical study of multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 (or placebo)
      with an Long-term Extension Therapy (LTE) phase will be conducted in approximately 60
      randomized adult subjects with moderately active UC who have a documented unsuccessful
      previous treatment.

      The Treatment Period includes double-blind Induction Therapy (12 weeks) and Open-label
      Therapy (OLE) phase phase (40 weeks) for eligible subjects at Week 12. Subjects already
      enrolled in the double-blind, long-term extension (LTE) under preceding versions of the
      protocol who worsen may be eligible to transition to the OLE up to Week 28.

      The Follow Up Period after the last administration will be for up to 16 weeks.
