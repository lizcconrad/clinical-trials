  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to find out how well a patient of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will
      respond to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a chronic inflammatory
      arthritis, which leads to joint damage &amp; disability if not treated properly. A DMARD is used
      to treat RA that slows down or prevents joint damage, as opposed to just relieve pain or
      inflammation by painkillers. The study will be conducted at the Department of Clinical
      Immunology, JIPMER (Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education &amp; Research).
      Patients will receive either a single DMARD (Methotrexate) or combination DMARDs therapy
      (Methotrexate + Leflunomide + Hydroxychloroquine). During treatment course, routine blood
      investigations will be carried out to monitor treatment response and side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged ≥18 years, fulfilling the 2010 ACR EULAR criteria for RA (symptom duration less
      than one year) &amp; having moderate to severe disease activity (DAS28≥3.2) will be invited to
      participate. After providing written informed consent, eligible patients will be stratified
      into two groups. Block randomization will be done to generate random allocation sequence.

      Treatment Group I will be treated with Methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy and Treatment Group II
      will be treated with Methotrexate + Leflunomide (LEF) + Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination
      therapy. Concurrent treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in adequate dose and
      oral low dose Glucocorticoids (GC) (max: 15 mg/d) will be allowed during the study.

      DMARD dosages used are: MTX 25 mg/week orally (dosage after 6 weeks), LEF 20 mg/day (dosage
      after 2 weeks) and HCQ 400 mg/day. GCs will be given in an oral tapering scheme. All patients
      will be prescribed folic acid (10 mg/week) during MTX prescription.

    <measure>A good response according to European league against rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria and Functional ability with Indian health assessment questionnaire (iHAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A good response is defined as a decrease after randomization of disease activity score- 28 joints (DAS28) score by &gt;1.2, and a resulting DAS28 score ≤ 3.2.
Indian version of HAQ (iHAQ) has been validated in patients with RA, which comprises 12 questions (nine basic and three advanced activity of daily living) relevant to the Indian population. For each question there is a four-level difficulty scale ranging from 0 to 3 that represent no difficulty ('0'), some difficulty ('1'), much difficulty ('2'), and inability to do ('3'). The final score is the mean of the highest scores across the eight categories and ranges from 0 to 3, with higher levels indicating more disability.</description>
