  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two weeks of daily oral
      administration of one of three dose levels of Paxerol or placebo in subjects with nocturia.
      Eligible study subjects will be identified according to inclusion/exclusion criteria (see
      below), and baseline assessments will be recorded.

      Due to small sample size of 25 patients per group in this proof-of-principle dosing-finding
      trial, stratification according to gender and BMI will be difficult. However, similar
      distribution of patient types to the four treatment groups will be attempted by evenly
      assigning patients to the four treatment groups according to genders and body mass index
      (BMI) of &lt;25, 25-30 and 30-40.

      Paxerol or placebo will be taken 30 minutes before bedtime daily for two weeks. Nocturia
      frequency, Nocturia Quality of Life (NQOL), Duration of First Undisturbed Sleep (DFUS), total
      hours of nightly sleep, safety and tolerability will be monitored before and after a two-week
      treatment period. Results from subjects treated with different doses of Paxerol and placebo
      will be assessed and compared. Baseline urinary Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production will also
      be assayed to assess potential correlation between baseline urinary PGE2 production and
      responsiveness to Paxerol treatment.

      The co-primary objectives are:

      A. To assess the effect of different doses of Paxerol on the reduction in the number of
      nocturia episodes.

      B. To assess the clinical benefit of different doses of Paxerol in reducing nocturia via
      assessment of nocturia quality of life (NQOL).

      The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of different doses of Paxerol on:

      A. Duration of First Undisturbed Sleep (DFUS) B. Total hours of nightly sleep C. Safety and
      tolerability

      An exploratory assessment is to evaluate baseline urinary PGE2 production on the
      responsiveness of subjects to Paxerol.

      This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two weeks of daily oral
      administration of one of three dose levels of Paxerol or placebo in subjects with nocturia.
      Eligible study subjects will be identified according to inclusion/exclusion criteria (see
      below), and baseline assessments will be recorded.

      Due to small sample size of 25 patients per group in this proof-of-principle dosing-finding
      trial, stratification according to gender and BMI will be difficult. However, similar
      distribution of patient types to the four treatment groups will be attempted by evenly
      assigning patients to the four treatment groups according to genders and body mass index
      (BMI) of &lt;25, 25-30 and 30-40.

      Paxerol or placebo will be taken 30 minutes before bedtime daily for two weeks. Nocturia
      frequency, Nocturia Quality of Life (NQOL), Duration of First Undisturbed Sleep (DFUS), total
      hours of nightly sleep, safety and tolerability will be monitored before and after a two-week
      treatment period. Results from subjects treated with different doses of Paxerol and placebo
      will be assessed and compared. Baseline urinary Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production will also
      be assayed to assess potential correlation between baseline urinary PGE2 production and
      responsiveness to Paxerol treatment.

      Study duration for each subject is approximately 4 weeks, which includes screening, baseline
      assessment, two weeks of treatment with study drugs, and follow-up.

        Inclusion:

          -  Subjects diagnosed with nocturia, as defined by International Continence Society
             (i.e., the interruption of sleep one or more times at night to void), confirmed by
             evaluation in participating investigator's urology practice for the following
             characteristics: nocturia is related to overactive bladder (OAB); nightly ≥2.5 times

             episodes), biofeedback, etc.

          -  Males or females, ≥18 years of age with Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;40.

             required in this study.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;150/100 mm Hg).

          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the
             past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or New York Heart Association Class

             entry into the study or any anticipated use during the study. In the event of the need
             for any unanticipated use of such drugs during the trial, the timing and doses of such
             use should be carefully recorded and reported at the next visit to the clinic.

             NSAIDs, or any other pain medication.

          -  Daily use of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil,
             vardenafil, avanafil, and udenafil) within 30 days prior to study or any anticipated
             daily use during the study. (Note: PDE inhibitors are known to have positive effect on
             voiding dysfunction and thus can interfere with the assessment of Paxerol [Ückert et
             al 2010].)

          -  History of polyuria or evidence of polyuria (estimation of daily production &gt;2.5

             nocturnal arising to urinate.

          -  Evidence of hyponatremia at baseline.

          -  Any significant disease or abnormality of the neurological, visual, gastrointestinal,
             hepatobiliary, pulmonary, cardiovascular, genitourinary or musculoskeletal system
             other than those specified above that, in the opinion of the involved investigator,
             might compromise the ability of the prospective subject to participate in the study or
             that could confound interpretation of study results.

          -  Any abnormality on screening medical history, physical examination or clinical
             laboratory examination other than those specified above that, in the opinion of the
             involved investigator, might confound interpretation of study results.

          -  Subjects with known hepatitis, HIV-AIDS, or tuberculosis.

          -  Subjects with known dysrhythmia of any form.
