  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Qatar, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have become the leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality over the past two decades. Between 1991 and 2010, a total of 16,736 patients were
      admitted with ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) in Qatar. Despite the use of percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and pharmacological agents
      to acutely reduce vascular risk, ACS patients are at high risk of having further
      cardiovascular events. Consequently, secondary cardiovascular risk reduction therapy is
      needed for all CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) patients. Clinical practice guidelines recommend
      that following ACS, patients should receive indefinite treatment with aspirin, a beta
      blocker, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or alternatively angiotensin II
      receptor blocker (ARB) and a statin. Less than 80% of ACS patients in Qatar use this
      quadruple combination after discharge. This creates a significant opportunity for pharmacists
      to improve CVD management and outcomes in Qatar. Nothing is known about the impact of Qatar
      clinical pharmacists as direct patient-care team members at discharge and post-discharge on
      the short-term and long-term outcomes of ACS patients. The proposed study is aimed to
      determine this impact. The investigators hypothesize that a clinical pharmacist-delivered
      intervention consisting of medication reconciliation and counseling at discharge and tailored
      follow-up post-discharge will decrease hospital readmissions, emergency department (ED)
      visits and all-cause mortality at 3 month, 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge
      when compared with control arm and pharmacist delivered intervention at discharge only among
      ACS patients. The investigators also hypothesize that the effect of the intervention will
      increase patients' adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention medications for CAD
      (Coronary Artery Disease), and patient satisfaction with pharmacy services. Besides, this
      intervention will reduce the treatment burden on patients.

      Nothing is known about the impact of Qatar clinical pharmacists as direct patient-care team
      members at discharge and post-discharge on the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients
      with ACS at Heart Hospital in Qatar. This research project aims to determine this.

      The investigators hypothesize that a clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention consisting of
      medication reconciliation and counseling at discharge and tailored follow-up post-discharge
      will decrease hospital readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause mortality
      at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge when compared with control arm
      and pharmacist delivered intervention at discharge only among ACS patients. The investigators
      also hypothesize that the effect of the intervention will increase patients' adherence to
      evidence-based secondary prevention medications for CAD, and patient satisfaction with
      pharmacy services. besides, this intervention will reduce the treatment burden on patients.

      Study objectives:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention at discharge
           and tailored follow-up post-discharge on decreasing hospital readmissions, ED visits and
           mortality in ACS patients.

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on improving patient adherence to
           evidence-based secondary prevention CAD medications.

        3. To study the effect of the intervention on reducing the burden of treatment on patients.

        4. To assess the effect of the intervention on increasing patient satisfaction with
           pharmacy services at Heart Hospital in Qatar.

    <intervention_name>Structured intervention at discharge and tailored follow up post discharge</intervention_name>
    <description>At discharge, pharmacist-delivered personalized intervention would include the following (30-60 minutes session): The pharmacist will perform medication reconciliation and will check the appropriateness and accuracy of discharge medications. - Other potential interventions that could be done by the pharmacist include in addition to medication initiation: dose and/or frequency optimization, changing ACEI with ARB if necessary, changing to another statin if needed, identification of inappropriate or duplicated therapy, etc.
The pharmacist will ensure that a follow-up plan for medication monitoring after discharge is communicated to the patient. The pharmacist will also provide a tailored and thorough counseling to the patient. In addition to the pharmacist delivered intervention at discharge (as described above), the study pharmacist will schedule 2 follow-up sessions (30-60 minutes each session) with the patients at 4 weeks of discharge and at 8 weeks of discharge.</description>
