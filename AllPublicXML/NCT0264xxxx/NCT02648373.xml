  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients with low back pain who are scheduled to
      begin physical therapy but have not yet had their first appointment to better understand
      their beliefs and attitudes and to evaluate the effects of an educational session about low
      back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of a patient
      education session provided prior to beginning physical therapy on outcomes of usual physical
      therapy for acute/sub-acute low back pain patients. The study compares two groups, one group
      will be treated with usual physical therapy with no pre-treatment education and the other
      group will also receive the pre-treatment. Patients will be followed after 6 weeks and 3
      months. Physical therapy care is left to the discretion of the physical therapist in
      conjunction with the patient. Outcomes will include pain and disability, and patients
      attitude and believes (pain catastrophizing, fear avoidance behavior). The overall hypothesis
      is that the additional educational treatment may address and improve pain, disability and
      fear.

    <description>Patients receive an educational video about low back pain based on the Consumer Reports Choosing Wisely recommendation for patients with back pain to avoid early imaging and remain as active as possible. After the video the evaluator and patient discussed key themes from the video and the patient was able to ask any questions. Previously scheduled physical therapy then began with treatment at the therapist's discretion.</description>

    <description>An educational video was watched based on Consumer Reports Choosing Wisely patient education supporting the recommendation that imaging is not helpful early for low back pain and the best strategy is to remain as active as possible. Key themes were discussed with a physical therapist and the patient's questions were answered.</description>
