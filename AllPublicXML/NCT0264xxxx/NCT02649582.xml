    <textblock>
      In this phase I/II trial, the primary objective is to determine overall and progression-free
      survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma when autologous Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1)
      messenger (m)RNA-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccination is added to adjuvant temozolomide
      maintenance treatment following (sub)total resection and temozolomide-based chemoradiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a microscopically infiltrative disease, is the most common
      malignant brain tumor worldwide. Despite optimized standard of care treatment median survival
      and prognosis remain poor with a median survival of only 15% and five year survival after
      diagnosis of 5%.

      In this single arm single centre phase I/II trial the investigators will determine the
      overall and progression free survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM when autologous
      WT1 mRNA loaded dendritic cell vaccination is added to standard of care treatment. During two
      years of recruitment the investigators will include 20 patients with newly diagnosed,
      histologically verified glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) who have received a total or subtotal
      resection of the tumor. Patients who underwent prior radiation or chemotherapy or with a
      history of other malignancy will be excluded. In addition to standard of care consisting of
      adjuvant chemoradiation with temozolomide and temozolomide maintenance patients will receive
      an intradermal vaccination with autologous WT1 mRNA-loaded dendritic cells commencing 1 week
      after radiotherapy. The dendritic cell therapy product will be generated and administered in
      the Antwerp University Hospital, more specifically the Center for Cell Therapy and
      Regenerative Medicine (CCRG) and the Division of Hematology, both headed by Prof. Zwi
      Berneman.

      Recruitment began in December 2015 and is intended to continue until the end of 2020 or when
      20 patients are enrolled. After 2 years of follow up (expected until 2022) overall and
      progression free survival analysis will be performed and this will be compared with the
      published data of standard of care treatment without vaccination. In addition the
      investigators will look for feasibility, incidence of adverse events and immunogenicity.
