  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, strength training and power is the main objective of providing only muscle
      conditioning, without possible gains on the VO2Max, however, not for aerobic performance.

      A total of 10 visits will be performed. The subjects will be divided into two exercise
      groups: 1) control group (CG) who performed only aerobic activity of running or walking at
      moderate intensity (65% VO2max); and 2) strength and power exercise group (GFP), which held
      the protocol circuit. On the first visit the subjects answer an initial questionnaire of risk
      stratification for coronary artery disease, and performed a maximal aerobic exercise test.

      The subjects performed the interval protocol with strength and power exercises at high
      intensity in circuit. 20 seconds stimuli will be provided with 10 seconds passive recovery,
      totaling 4 minutes. In the last session the subjects will be performed the same initial
      procedures adopted in the first visit to determine the values of VO2max after training. The
      control group will be performed just one training session total run time conducted in eight
      sessions by GFP group (approx. 30 min).
