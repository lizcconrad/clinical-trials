    <textblock>
      This study will examine if the attending nurse model will enhance critical patient-centered
      elements of care that will in turn improve patient education and shared decision-making,
      medication adherence, stroke-related health literacy, and reduce early readmissions to
      ultimately yield improved patient quality of life. Our primary objective is to determine
      whether the attending nurse model of care improves stroke patients' health at 7 days, 30
      days, and 90 days after hospital discharge as assessed through questionnaires.

    <description>The attending nurse model of in-hospital care delivery aims to improve patient understanding, shared decision making, medication adherence, and reduce early readmissions after discharge to improve quality of life. On the inpatient stroke unit, the attending nurse will take ownership of essential aspects of an individual stroke patient's care, education, and transition out of the hospital. To further contribute to the patient's plan of care, the attending nurse will be present on daily teaching rounds.</description>
