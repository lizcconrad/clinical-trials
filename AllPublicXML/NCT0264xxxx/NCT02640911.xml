      Visits occurs at 0,4,8,13,26,52,78,104,130 and 156 weeks. The main indexes include physical
      examination, vital signs, abdominal circumference , laboratory tests (blood cell analysis/
      blood biochemical tests / prolactin (PRL) / thyroxine, etc.), adverse events, 12-lead
      electrocardiogram( ECG), extrapyramidal syndrome(EPS )assessment, sexual function evaluation,
      medication and other subjective feelings. The second indexes include scales of Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale(PANSS)，Clinical Global Impression-severity of Illness Scale(CGI-S),
      Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia(CDSS),Personal and Social Performance Scale(PSP),
      the MOS 36一item Short Form Health Survey(SF-36), relapse rate, drug consolidation,
