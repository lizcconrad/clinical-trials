  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine whether there are age-, diet- and genetically-related
      differences in the perception of sweeteners, both nutritive and non-nutritive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational 3-day study of children between the ages of 7 and 14 and their
      mothers. A variety of psychophysical methods determined liking for each of the sweeteners and
      saliva samples were obtained for genotyping of taste receptor genes. Anthropometric and
      dietary intake measures were also collected.
