    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double blind randomized controlled trial. In this study we will
      investigate the influence of hyaluronic acid injection to knee after knee arthroscopy, when
      known or discovered cartilage damage greater than International Cartilage Research Society
      score (ICRS) grade 2 is found. The indication for arthroscopy is not necessarily the
      cartilage damage. A set of 3 consecutive injections will be administered and follow up of
      physical examination and questionaries will be done.

      Our null hypothesis is that the administration of hyaluronic acid will show decrease pain and
      quicker rehabilitation and return to normal activity in patients with grade 2 and higher
      cartilage damage that had gone through knee arthroscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of hyaluronic acid is well known as one of the treatment modalities for knee
      osteoarthritis (OA) .Arthroscopy is a controversial treatment option for knee OA but in some
      cases, during knee arthroscopy done for other indication, cartilage damage is noted. This
      cartilage damage may slower the healing and rehabilitation process after knee arthroscopy.
      Therefore we will evaluate the influence of hyaluronic acid injection on the healing and
      rehabilitation process following knee arthroscopy.

      All patients will be recruited prior to the arthroscopy. All patients will sign a concent
      form.Patients will be randomly divided to 2 groups which are the 2 arms of this study -
      treatment group and control group. All patient will be examined by a senior orthopedic
      surgeon and will fill the pre operative questionnaires. MRI scan of the operated knee prior
      for the surgery will be collected and evaluated.Knee arthroscopy will be performed by 2
      senior orthopedic surgeons. Data and arthroscopic findings will be collected and documented
      during surgery. 2 weeks after surgery patients will be evaluated in the hospitals'
      outpatients clinic. The treatment group will be given a series of 3 injections of Sodium
      Hyaluronate 1%(ARTHREASE, TM) - one injection per week. The control group will be given a
      series of 3 injections of placebo (BPS - Buffer Phosphate Solution - the buffer solution of
      the hyaluronic acid regular injections). The syringes will be blinded to the patients and the
      physician.

      questionnaires will be given at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3months and 6 months post operatively
