  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute viral respiratory infections are among the most common causes of hospitalization in the
      pediatric population. The usual presentation of viral respiratory tract infections (VRTI)
      includes fever, malaise, wheezing and or coughing, rhinorrhea and loss of appetite. Up to 50%
      of children will have at least one viral-induced wheezing illness by school age. Currently
      treatment of VRTI is essentially supportive and no specific and efficient treatments are
      known. Given the lack of effective medications, current treatment for severe viral lower
      respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants relies on supportive measures only. These
      measures include supplementation of oxygen, monitoring of apnea, nasal/gastric tube feeding
      or intravenous fluids, and, if required, respiratory support with nasal bi-level
      positive-airway pressure. VTRI therefore represent an important unmet need for improved
      treatment strategies. Acupuncture's effect on has also been studied. Acupuncture has been
      shown to be a safe and effective in various respiratory tract inflammations. A review
      published in 2011 have found that acupuncture is safe for pediatric patients. Acupuncture's
      effect on acute viral induced wheezing and cough in hospitalized children has yet to be
      studied. Since the current standard of care is supportive care only, using acupuncture as an
      additional treatment may provide benefit in reducing wheezing, respiratory distress, and
      shorten hospitalization.
