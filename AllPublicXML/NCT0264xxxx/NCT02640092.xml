  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, longitudinal observational study evaluating the imaging
      characteristics of the tau positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligand [18F] Genentech Tau
      Probe 1 (GTP1) in the brain of participants with prodromal, mild, and moderate Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) compared to healthy participants. The overall goal of this protocol is to
      evaluate the longitudinal change in tau burden using [18F]GTP1, a tau targeted
      radiopharmaceutical.

    <description>Participants will complete [18F]GTP1 PET imaging at four time points: Baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months. For each [18F]GTP1 imaging session, the following procedure will be performed: a catheter will be placed for intravenous (IV) administration of [18F]GTP1. Participants will receive an IV bolus injection of up to 370 megabecquerel (MBq) (10 millicurie [mCi]) of [18F]GTP1.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For All Participants:

        - Availability of a study partner who, in the investigator's judgment, has frequent and
        sufficient contact with the participant and is able to provide accurate information
        regarding the participant's cognitive and functional abilities, agrees to accompany the
        participant and provide information at visits

        For Healthy Participants:

          -  Healthy with no clinically relevant finding on physical examination at screening and
             upon reporting for the Baseline [18F]GTP1 imaging visit

          -  Have no cognitive complaint

          -  Have a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) global score = 0

          -  Have a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 28-30

        For Participants With a Diagnosis of AD:

          -  Participants with mild or moderate AD must meet National Institute on Aging -
             Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) core clinical criteria for probable AD dementia, with
             an amnestic presentation

          -  Participants with prodromal AD must meet NIA-AA core clinical criteria for mild
             cognitive impairment (MCI)

          -  Have screening [18F]florbetapir PET imaging demonstrating amyloid binding based on
             qualitative visual read

          -  A brain MRI consistent with a diagnosis of AD, with no evidence of non-AD disease to
             account for dementia or MRI exclusion criteria

          -  Medications taken for symptomatic treatment of AD must remain stable for at least 30
             days prior to screening visit

          -  Satisfy one of the following subgroups: Approximately 20 prodromal AD (MMSE 24-30, CDR
             = 0.5); Approximately 20 mild AD (MMSE 22-30, CDR = 0.5 or 1); Approximately 20
             moderate AD (MMSE 16-21, CDR = 0.5 or 1 or 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or prior history of any drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Participants with any significant psychiatric, neurological, or unstable medical
             disorder expected to interfere with the study

          -  Participants unable to undergo MRI and PET scan

          -  For participants contributing CSF samples, any contraindication to lumbar puncture

          -  Prior participation in other research protocols or clinical care in the last year such
             a radiation exposure combined with that from the present study exceeds an effective
             dose of 50 millisievert (mSV), the allowable annual limit for research participants as
             stipulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
