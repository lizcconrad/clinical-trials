    <textblock>
      Sixty advanced breast cancer patients are planed to enrolled in this clinical trial. Forty
      patients are enrolled into thalidomide plus chemotherapy group. Twenty patients are enrolled
      into chemotherapy alone group. There is no restriction on chemotherapy regimen and lines.

      The study compares the combination of thalidomide and chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone
      for the treatment of stage IV breast cancer. Efficacy and safety of the
      chemotherapy-thalidomide combination will be evaluated. Assessing the isolated effects of
      thalidomide in a setting where pre and post treatment serum specimens can be obtained will
      provide essential information about the mechanisms by which vascular endothelial growth
      factor(VEGF) inhibition affects tumor growth, and represents an ideal opportunity to evaluate
      the molecular effects of thalidomide on breast tumor.
