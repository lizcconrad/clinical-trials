  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial examining 12-week, 24-week and
      one year outcomes from a combined therapeutic and physical exercise program that aims to
      bridge head-and-neck cancer survivors from acute care rehabilitation services to
      community-based exercise programming.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be stratified by early (within 18 months of surgery) and late (&gt; 18 months
      of surgery) and randomized on a one-on-one basis to (1) a supervised therapeutic exercise
      program for the neck and shoulder (serving as standard care) or (2) a combined therapeutic
      and lower body resistance exercise program. The randomization sequence will be generated by
      staff in the Rehabilitation Research Centre at Corbett Hall and placed in sealed opaque
      envelopes.

      The exercise program will be offered in a group setting. Participants will exercise 2 times
      per week for a 10-week session and will have the option to continue for an additional 10-week
      maintenance session. The primary outcome for the study will be quality of life as measured by
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue Scale at 12-weeks.

      At each measurement point following the baseline assessment, including the 12-week and
      24-week and one year follow-ups, an Independent Assessor will perform the objective fitness
      measurements. The Independent Assessor will also administer the Neck Dissection Impairment
      Questionnaire and the FACT-Fatigue quality of life questionnaires. The Physical Activity
      Adherence Diary will be collected by a Research Coordinator at each follow-up visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Squamous cell carcinoma/ thyroid cancer/ melanoma or lymphoma involving: oral cavity,
             oropharynx, larynx or hypopharynx, or lymph nodes in the neck region

          -  Surgical treatment includes radical neck dissection, modified radical neck dissection

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status greater than or equal to 60%

          -  No evidence of residual cancer in the neck and no distant (M0) metastasis. Potential
             participants with symptoms suggestive of distant metastasis (M1) must have appropriate
             investigations (e.g. bone scan) to rule these out.

          -  Participants must have completed their head and neck/ thyroid/ melanoma/ lymphoma
             cancer treatment (minimum 4 weeks post treatment)

          -  Pre-participation Screening: Prior to participation in the exercise program, potential
             participants will complete general and cancer-specific Physical Activity Readiness
             Questionnaires (PAR-Q+) to determine appropriateness for the exercise program.
             Physician consent and approval for supervised exercise will be required prior to
             enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A participant will be ineligible if they present with medical illness or psychiatric
             illness, which, in the opinion of the investigators, would impact his/her ability to
             participate in exercise or interfere with follow-up.
