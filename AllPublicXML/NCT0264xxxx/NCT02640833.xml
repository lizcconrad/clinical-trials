    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, and
      determine the recommended Phase 2 doses of co administered Duvelisib and Venetoclax in
      participants with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small
      lymphocytic lymphoma, or indolent or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who have not previously
      received a Bcl-2 or Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. The Phase 2 portion of the
      study will preliminarily evaluate efficacy, and expand the toxicity evaluation.
