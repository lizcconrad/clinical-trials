    <textblock>
      Purpose of Study: Apnea of Prematurity (AOP) is common, affecting the majority of infants
      born &lt;34 weeks gestational age (GA). Apnea is accompanied by intermittent hypoxia (IH), which
      contributes to multiple pathologies, including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), sympathetic
      ganglia injury, impaired pancreatic islet cell and bone development, and neurodevelopmental
      disabilities. Standard of care for AOP/IH includes prone positioning, positive pressure
      ventilation, and caffeine therapy, none of which is optimal. The objective is to support
      breathing in premature infants by using a simple, non-invasive vibratory device placed over
      limb proprioceptor fibers, an intervention using the principle that limb movements facilitate
      breathing.

      Methods Used: Premature infants (23-34 wks GA) with clinical evidence of AOP/IH were enrolled
      1 week after birth. Caffeine therapy was not a reason for exclusion. Small vibration devices
      were placed on one hand and one foot and activated in a 6 hour ON/OFF sequence for a total of
      24 hours. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and breathing pauses were
      continuously collected.

      Aim: To study the effect of limb proprioceptive stimulation using a vibratory device on
      apneic events, intermittent hypoxic episodes and bradycardias in a premature infant with
      apnea of prematurity.

      The objective is to provide support and to assist impaired ventilation and oxygenation in
      apnea of prematurity (AOP). Recurrent apnea and accompanying resultant intermittent hypoxic
      (IH) episodes are significant concerns commonly encountered in premature infants, and optimal
      management is a challenge to neonatologists. AOP is defined as &quot;a pause of breathing for more
      than 15-20 seconds or accompanied by oxygen desaturation (SpO2&lt;80% for&gt;4s) and bradycardia
      (heart rate&lt;2/3 of baseline for&gt;4s), in infants born less than 37 weeks of gestation
      [Moriette G et al., 2010]. When these pauses are longer (&gt; 15s), they are frequently
      prolonged by obstructed inspiratory efforts, most likely secondary to loss of upper airway
      tonic activity [Martin RJ et al., 2012]. In extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, the
      incidence of IH progressively increases over the first 4 weeks of postnatal life, followed by
      a plateau and subsequent decline between 6-8 weeks.

      The incidence of AOP correlates inversely with gestational age and birth weight. Nearly all
      infants born &lt;29 weeks gestation or &lt;1,000 g [Robertson CM et al., 2009], 54% at 30 to 31
      weeks, 15% at 32 to 33 weeks, and 7% at 34 to 35 weeks gestation exhibit AOP [Martin RJ et
      al]. Both animal and human evidence show that immature or impaired respiratory control and
      the resultant IH exposure contribute to a variety of pathophysiologic issues via
      pro-inflammatory and/or pro-oxidant cascade as well as cellular mechanisms, e.g., apoptosis,
      leading to acute and chronic morbidities (e.g. retinopathy of prematurity, altered growth and
      cardiovascular regulation, disrupting zinc homeostasis which hampers insulin production and
      there by predisposing to diabetes in later life, cerebellar injuries and neurodevelopmental
      disabilities) [Martin RJ et al., 2004, Pae EK et al., 2011, 2014, ].

      Current standard of care for AOP includes prone positioning, continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to prevent
      pharyngeal collapse and alveolar atelectasis, and methylxanthine therapy (caffeine,
      theophylline), which is the mainstay of treatment of central apnea [Reher et al., 2008;
      Pantalitschka T et al., 2009; Moretti C et al., 2012; Henderson-Smart DJ et al., 2010]. Apart
      from prone positioning, none of these interventions are optimal for early development. CPAP
      masks will distort the bony facial structure in early development, and methylxanthine
      interventions pose serious questions of neural development interactions.

      Hypothesis: Applying slight vibration to the limbs will reduce the number of breathing
      pauses, intermittent hypoxic episodes and bradycardias in apnea of prematurity.

          <description>In the same subject cardiorespiratory parameters - heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were compared during the procedure (vibration) and without procedure (no vibration). The same subject had both control and treatment periods.
Vibration: A device providing vibrations is placed on the subject and vibration is turned on and off in a 6 hour on/off sequence. Heart rate, respiratory pauses and oxygen saturation are compared during vibration (intervention) and without vibration (no intervention) in the same subject.</description>
