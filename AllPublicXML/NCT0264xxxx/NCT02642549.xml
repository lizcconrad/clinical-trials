  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Girls for Health (G4H) will promote the economic empowerment, agency, and voice of rural
      adolescent girls by supporting their transition from secondary school to tertiary training in
      midwifery, medicine, nursing and other health careers, and in so doing, will address the
      acute shortage of female health workers in rural Northern Nigeria. G4H will integrate proven
      girls' education strategies with innovative vocational interventions to build 1350 girls'
      career aspirations and academic achievement and will significantly increase the number of
      rural girls entering health training institutions (HTI) in four northern states. The program
      will include: 1) a bridge program offering accelerated academic instruction in science, math
      and English; 2) vocational counseling and practicums at local health facilities; 3) safe
      spaces to enhance critical life skills; 4) four month science immersion courses for girls
      accepted for admission to a health training institution; and 5) HTI capacity building to
      cultivate a rural female-friendly learning environment. G4H will work towards sustainability
      from the start by using existing secondary school and HTI infrastructure, and feeding into
      government rural health worker employment schemes.

      G4H will be evaluated using a rigorous cluster randomized controlled trial design,
      randomizing at the school level to assess its impact on key outcomes of interest that include
      rural girls' secondary school graduation and subsequent HTI enrollment, retention and
      completion, as well as delayed marriage and improved agency and voice. Process monitoring and
      costing analysis will be conducted to support quality implementation and dissemination
      efforts. The design will ensure that high quality evidence is available to guide the field
      regarding the effectiveness and costing of in-school bridge programming in broadening rural
      girls' participation in education and career opportunities in the context of low resource
      settings characterized by low rates of female participation in education and income
      generation.
