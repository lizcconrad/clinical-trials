  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be looking at whether combining cyclophosphamide, pembrolizumab (an antibody
      that blocks negative signals to T cells), GVAX (pancreatic cancer vaccine), and SBRT (focused
      radiation) is effective (anti-tumor activity) and safe in patients with locally advanced
      pancreatic cancer.
