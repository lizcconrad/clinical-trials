  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, Cobimetinib has in
      patients with histiocytosis. Cobimetinib is an investigational oral medication that blocks
      MEK1.

    <description>by PET Response Criterial (PRC), with a dichotomous BOR of CR or PR versus neither of those. Assuming we use this binary endpoint of response, defined as best overall response of CR or PR versus not using the PET Response Criteria (PRC), a sample size of 18 patients provides 90% power to test the hypothesis that the response rate is promising (defined as 35% or higher) against a non-promising rate of 10% or lower.</description>

    <description>This is an open-label, single-center, phase II study exploring the efficacy and safety of single-agent Cobimetinib in patients with histiocytic disorders whose tumors are 1) BRAFV600 wildtype or 2) BRAFV600E mutant and are intolerant to, or unable to access, BRAF inhibitors.</description>

    <description>Patients in this study will receive single-agent Cobimetinib 60mg oral daily for days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle. The rationale for single agent therapy, is the evidence for robust and sustained response to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy in histiocytic disorders harboring the BRAFV600E mutation. Patients will have the option to discontinue treatment after 12 cycles and will be monitored for disease relapse for an additional 12 months. In the event that disease relapse occurs within the 12 month monitoring period, patients will restart treatment and continue on study. Upon restarting, the assessment schedule will restart at cycle 1 and all assessments will occur at the same frequency and intervals.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed histiocytic disorder or histologic findings compatible with a
             histiocytic disorder in the context of confirmatory radiologic findings

          -  One of the following:

               -  Documentation of BRAF V600E mutation and inability to access of BRAF inhibitor or
                  prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor discontinued due intolerable side effects
                  or toxicity prior to progression, -OR-

               -  Documentation of wild-type BRAF V600 mutational status

          -  Measurable disease according to PET Response Criteria, with the exception of patients
             with cutaneous disease that can be measured and followed by RECIST criteria

          -  Histiocytic disorder must be (a) multi-system disease or (b) disease that is recurrent
             or refractory to standard therapies, or (c) single-system disease with that is
             unlikely to benefit from conventional and less toxic therapies, based on the best
             available evidence (for example, CNS or cardiac infiltration, retroperitoneal
             fibrosis, prior chemotherapy, or other medical history or co-morbidities, etc)

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

          -  Age ≥ 16 years

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 3 (May be converted from Karnofsky Performance Status)

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as indicated by the following:

               -  ANC &gt; 1000/uL

               -  Platelets ≥ 50,000/uL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL.

          -  Patients with cytopenias below these thresholds deemed to be the result of disease
             will be considered eligible.

          -  Adequate renal function, as indicated by:

               -  creatinine ≤ 1.5 the upper limit of normal (ULN) -OR-

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance of &gt; 50 ml/min

          -  As for #7, patients with renal dysfunction deemed to be the result of disease will be
             considered eligible.

          -  Adequate liver function, as defined by bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN

          -  AND AST/ALT &lt; 3 ULN

          -  Ability to swallow pills

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing in
             premenopausal women. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without serum
             pregnancy test if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥
             1 year.

          -  Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment
             and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their
             physician. Effective methods of contraception are defined as those which result in a
             low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly
             (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine
             devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception
             may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures
             compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)

          -  Patients must be willing to consent for protocol #12-245 for IMPACT testing.

          -  To date, no patients with BRAF-mutated ECD/LCH have had disease progression on BRAF
             inhibitor therapy. Such patient would be eligible but would require tissue biopsy for
             genotyping before participating.
