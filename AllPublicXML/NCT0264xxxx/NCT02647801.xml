  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to test a novel network approach (Bringmann et al., 2013), which
      enables to investigate the complex, interdependent network of self-control and its influences
      in everyday life. By adding an intervention to the network, such as mindfulness training, it
      is also possible to explore the way mindfulness changes connection strengths between network
      variables.

      For six weeks, an ambulatory assessment and additional seven weekly laboratory sessions are
      conducted with 120 students from the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz who are randomized
      to a control (n=60) or intervention condition (n=60). Pre and post measurement sessions take
      place to assess self-reported trait self-control and mindfulness and a behavioral measure of
      mindfulness (Levinson, Stoll, Kindy, Merry &amp; Davidson 2014). Participants of both the
      experimental and control condition come to five weekly lab meetings in which they fill out
      questionnaires to assess changes in self-reported self-control and mindfulness. But only
      participants of the experimental condition take part in weekly computer based mindfulness
      trainings. During the ambulatory assessment, participants complete questionnaires six times a
      day via mobile phones that are randomly prompted and answer questions about state
      self-control, motivation, affect, and current situation.

    <intervention_name>Mindfulness intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Mindfulness is practiced with a weekly computer based guided breathing meditation in which one's own breath has to be counted repetitively from 1 to 9. Participants have to press a specific button for breaths 1 to 8 and then press another button for breath 9 on a keyboard. During this practice they put on headphones and listen to a voice that guides them through breathing meditation. A &quot;click&quot; sound will occur if breath is miscounted (Levinson et al., 2014). After each computer based breathing meditation the experimenter and participants exchange meditation experiences and views. After the first mindfulness training participants in the experimental group are also able to practice mindfulness at home by listening to audio files on the mobile phone (bodyscan or breathing meditation).</description>
