  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the use of tolvaptan (commercial name Samsca) when given
      in addition to intravenous (IV) diuretics early during an episode of acute heart failure. It
      will be compared to a high dose of IV diuretics alone or the use of metolazone in addition to
      IV diuretics. The investigators are looking to see if there is improvement in the symptoms
      and outcomes of persons with acute heart failure.

      This is a single-center, randomized trial to assess the effects of 30 mg daily of tolvaptan
      when given concomitantly with home dose of diuretic (Lasix equivalent) intravenously (IV)
      versus 5mg daily of metolazone given concomitantly with home dose of diuretic (Lasix
      equivalent) IV, versus 2.5 times home dose of diuretic (Lasix equivalent) IV in participants
      hospitalized for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF).
