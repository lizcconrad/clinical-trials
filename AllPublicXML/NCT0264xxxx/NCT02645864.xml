  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the common malignant tumors. The annual incidence of esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma is 260,000 with the mortality of 210,000 in China. Different from
      that in western countries, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still the dominant
      pathological type in China and account for more than 95% cases in clinic. The prognosis of
      ESCC is very poor. About 50% of patients have advanced disease at diagnosis with a 5-year
      survival rate of only 5-7%. Though esophagectomy is standard treatment, disease will relapse
      in many patients.

      For patients with unresectable or recurrent disease, chemotherapy is an important treatment
      alone or with radiotherapy. Taxane, platinum, and fluoropyrimidine have been reported
      effective in ESCC and is popularly used in first-line treatment of ESCC. However, there is
      still no standard 2nd-line treatment for patients who fail in first-line treatment. Both
      irinotecan and taxane had been studied as 2nd-line treatment for esophageal cancer patients.
      But there are only a few of ESCC patients involved in those studies.

      Except for chemotherapy, targeting treatment is another promising treatment for esophageal
      cancer. In recent years, antiangiogenic treatment has been proved to be effective and
      tolerable in many cancers such lung, colorectal, and gastric cancer. Apatinib is an also
      known as YN968D1, is an orally antiangiogenic agents. Preclinical and clinical data has shown
      that it is effective in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors including esophageal
      cancer. And it was approved and launched in China in 2014 as a 3rd-line treatment for
      patients with advanced gastric cancer.

      Therefore, investigators initialize this dose escalation phase I study to explore the safety
      of irinotecan and apatinib combination treatment in ESCC patients with relapse disease after
      esophagectomy and failure in 1st-line chemotherapy. Investigators will analyze the maximum
      tolerated dose (MDT) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in this study.

    <description>This study will include a sequential evaluation of 3 subjects per cohort. Cohort 1: apatinib 250 mg per day and irinotecan 150mg q2w. Cohort 2: apatinib 500 mg per day and irinotecan 150mg q2w. Cohort 3: apatinib 750 mg per day and irinotecan 150mg q2w.
A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) event is defined as any of the following events:
CTCAE Grade 4 event
Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity including fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that continues despite optimal medical management) If a DLT is experienced in any cohort, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If two (2) DLTs are experienced in any cohort, the study will stop and the dose of combination treatment in this cohort will be documented.</description>
