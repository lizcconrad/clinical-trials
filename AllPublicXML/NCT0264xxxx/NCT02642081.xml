  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) were associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with heart failure. In
      addition, the investigators would like to assess the risk of admission for acute
      decompensated heart failure following exposure to NSAIDs within 30 days.

    <measure>Change from baseline in serum creatinine at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>We collect not only patient's baseline serum creatinine level (defined as the median value of the previous-six-months serum creatinine), but also serum creatinine level on the detecting day (defined as the most recent day from index date we detecting the serum creatinine). Acute kidney injury is defined as the absolute increase in the serum creatinine concentration of ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline; or a percentage increase in the serum creatinine concentration of ≥50 percent.</description>
