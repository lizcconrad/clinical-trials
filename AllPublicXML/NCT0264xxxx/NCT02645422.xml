      The aim of the present study is to identify new obesity-related genetic defects and determine
      their association with clinical manifestations in families with childhood-onset severe
      obesity. The investigators hypothesize that by exploring children with severe early-onset
      obesity they can find new obesity-related genetic defects and by exploring obesity-associated
      clinical manifestations the investigators can elucidate the outcomes of severe childhood
      obesity.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a complex disorder with many contributing genetic and environmental factors. The
      genetic causes and mechanisms for severe childhood obesity are still incompletely understood.
      It is acknowledged that obesity in some individuals could be a consequence of rare genetic
      variants with strong effect - these rare variants might be population specific.

      The aims of this study are to determine

        -  inheritance patterns of early-onset obesity

        -  new obesity-related genetic variants and disease-causing gene mutations

        -  the association between obesity-related genetic defects and clinical manifestations

        -  the association between obesity-related genetic defects and psychiatric symptoms

      in patients with early-onset obesity and their first-degree relatives

      Significant advancements in genetic methodology provide new tools to explore genetic defects
      underlying obesity. Family-based approach provides several advantages compared to cohort
      studies to investigate genetic determinants of complex diseases.The unique genetic
      composition of the Finnish population enables identification of novel genetic entities.

      Discovery of genetic defects associated with severe childhood-onset obesity will increase the
      investigators understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity and allows early detection, by
      genetic testing, of those at increased risk and optimal targeting of preventive measures.

        The study subjects include children and adolescent with severe, early-onset childhood
        obesity. Early-onset obesity is defined as height-adjusted weight &gt;60 % (corresponding to
        severe obesity) before the age of 7 years.
