        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 14 - 75 years of age at time of screening.

          2. A clinical diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes for a minimum of 9 months duration as
             determined via medical record or source documentation by an individual qualified to
             make a medical diagnosis

          3. Adequate venous access as assessed by investigator or appropriate staff

          4. Subjects participating in the high and low glucose challenges must have an established
             insulin carbohydrate ratio(s) and insulin sensitivity ratio. (The term &quot;established&quot;
             refers to a ratio that has been previously defined and tested prior to screening
             visit). Subjects without established ratios may participate under observation only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject will not tolerate tape adhesive in the area of Enlite 3 Sensor placement as
             assessed by qualified individual.

          2. Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of Enlite 3 Sensors or
             device placement (e.g., psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection)

          3. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device) wherein
             they have received treatment from an investigational study (drug or device) in the
             last 2 weeks

          4. Subject is female and has a positive pregnancy screening test

          5. Females of child bearing age and who are sexually active should be excluded if they
             are not using a form of contraception deemed reliable by investigator.

          6. Subject is female and plans to become pregnant during the course of the study

          7. Subject has had a hypoglycemic seizure within the past 6 months.

          8. Subject has had hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness within the past 6
             months prior to screening visit.

          9. Subject has had an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) within the past 6 months
             prior to screening visit.

         10. Subject has a history of a seizure disorder.

         11. Subject has central nervous system or cardiac disorder resulting in syncope.

         12. Subject has a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery
             bypass surgery, coronary artery stenting, transient ischemic attack (TIA),
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA), angina, congestive heart failure, ventricular rhythm
             disturbances or thromboembolic disease.

         13. Subject has a hematocrit(Hct) lower than the normal reference range.

         14. Subject has a history of adrenal insufficiency
