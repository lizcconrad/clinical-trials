  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective analysis of a cohort of all emergency care patients in Beijing from
      January 2005 to December 2014. This aim of this study was to analyze the trends in
      pre-hospital emergency care need and the emergency response times, with the intention of
      aiding the government to optimize medical resources and improve pre-hospital emergency care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-hospital emergency care is a very important part of Emergency Medical Service (EMS)
      System, crucial to patients' life support, disability and mortality rate reduction. The level
      of pre-hospital emergency care reflects the comprehensive ability of the organizational,
      management and public welfare of a country. Beijing Emergency Center and Beijing Red Cross
      Emergency Center are in the charge of all the pre-hospital emergency care in Beijing, which
      respectively subordinate to Beijing government and Chinese Red Cross Society. This study
      collected the data of 3,909,746 cases from these two pre-hospital care centers from January,
      2005 to December, 2014 and retrospective analyzed the pre-hospital emergency call demand and
      first aid related time. The results of this study can help the government optimize medical
      resources; strengthen the prevention of related emergency diseases. The changes and trends of
      pre-hospital care disease spectrum also present the same problems and situation of developing
      megacities like Beijing. Based on the meticulous work in these 2 centers, this study has
      collected the most complete pre-hospital emergency care data in China.

    <description>All pre-hospital service data were collected from January 2005 to December 2014 from the Beijing Emergency Center and Beijing Red Cross Emergency Center, which oversee all pre-hospital care in Beijing. The major illnesses were classified into 34 disease spectrum categories according to the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) which total includes 34 diseases. Data on pre-hospital emergency demand and first aid-related time intervals were analyzed to determine trends over the period.</description>
