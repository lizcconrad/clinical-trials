  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, single-center, longitudinal and analytical study on
      the effect of bariatric surgery in obese patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is expected to enroll 22 obese subjects with chronic kidney disease (decrease in
      glomerular filtration and/or albuminuria/proteinuria). After the inclusion in the study
      patients will remain for six months with a reduced calorie diet until the day of bariatric
      surgery. Time monitoring of the patient after surgery is 24 months.
