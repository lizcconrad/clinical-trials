      A Phase I, Randomized, Single-centered, Double-blinded Clinical Trial of Allogenic Adipose
      Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells Therapy for Knee Osteoarthritis.

      This is a randomized,single-blind, double-blinded,phase I clinical trial. Subjects who are
      with a clinical diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis cartilage defects and will be randomly
      distributed 1:1:1 to different dosage group after signing the ICF and screening tests.The
      treatment will accept Allogenic ReJoinTM at the first and fourth week.The duration of the
      therapy is 48 weeks.
