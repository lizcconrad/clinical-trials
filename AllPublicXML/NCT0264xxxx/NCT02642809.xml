  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to treat patients with metastatic esophageal cancers and dysphagia
      with two fractions of brachytherapy followed by pembrolizumab. The brachytherapy is
      hypofractionated and will provide a radiation dose of sufficient intensity to induce the
      release of tumor-derived antigens and trigger an antitumor immune response. The simplicity of
      the design should maximize the chance to examine the hypothesis that radiotherapy can induce
      an immune response, which can then be augmented by pembrolizumab treatment. Success in this
      study would provide the impetus to conduct further trials aimed at developing this unique
      strategy as a more broadly applicable therapeutic option in the treatment of patients
      suffering from these deadly cancers, and will provide important mechanistic insights into the
      relationship between radiation treatment and immune therapy augmentation.

      Taken together, these data indicate that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in esophageal cancers
      in combination with radiation therapy may be a rational treatment strategy for these cancers.
