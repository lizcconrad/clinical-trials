      Comparison of quality of preparation of colonoscopy in patients taking same day 4L
      preparation vs. 4 L split dose preparation in patients scheduled for an afternoon colonoscopy
      procedure.

      The aim of colorectal cancer screening is to reduce mortality. This can be effectively
      achieved by colonoscopy with direct visualization of the entire colon to detect preneoplastic
      lesions such as adenomatous polyps. Bowel preparation quality is critical for the accuracy of
      colonoscopy, time required to complete the procedure and its success. On the other hand, poor
      quality of bowel preparation was shown to be associated with a lower adenoma detection rate.
      Prior studies have shown that time of colonoscopy is one of the major factors influencing
      bowel preparation quality with the afternoon colonoscopies being notable for a high failure
      rate. This failure rate is related to poor bowel preparation quality. Given that, the number
      of afternoon colonoscopies performed is still high due to the increased need for
      colonoscopies. Therefore, it is suggested that improving the bowel preparation quality can
      reduce failure rate of afternoon colonoscopies. Several studies on split-dose bowel
      preparation have shown that it is superior to the conventional day-before regimen, in terms
      of preparation quality and patient's tolerability. Another study on split-dose bowel
      preparation also showed that it is associated with a better adenoma detection rate, better
      polyp detection rate and colonoscopy completion rate. There also have been few studies
      comparing same day dose vs. day-before for afternoon colonoscopies and showed that same day
      was superior to day before.There is no data comparing quality of preparation of colonoscopy
      in patients taking same day 4L preparation vs. 4 L split-dose preparation for an afternoon
      colonoscopy.

      Using a 4L PEG-ELS solution, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and patient's
      tolerability for the same day versus split-dose regimen.
