      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of three seasonal
      trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs)manufactured by Glaxosmith Kline (GSK), Beijing Sinovac
      Biotech (Sinovac) and Shenzhen Sanofi Pasteur (Pasteur) in Chinese healthy servicemen. Using
      imported GSK's TIV as control, to compare it with other two domestic TIVs in Chinese healthy
      servicemen.

      This study is a 1:1:1 randomized, double-blinded, controlled phase Ⅳ clinical trial in a
      military command in Beijing. Healthy individuals aged between 18～34 years who had not
      received any influenza vaccine during recent three years will be enrolled and administrated
      one dose TIV. Safety data will be collected for whole study (Day 0 to Day 30).Blood samples
      will be collected for immunogenicity assessments before injection and 21 days after
      vaccination.
