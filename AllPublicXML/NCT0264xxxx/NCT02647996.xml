    <textblock>
      To compare functional connectivity after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) between a group
      of post-comatose TBI with restored consciousness and a group of post-comatose TBI with
      persistant disorder of consciousness at admission in rehabilitation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recovery of consciousness can be impaired in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Prognostic
      factors are sparse and mostly clinical (mainly the initial Glasgow coma scale GCS) (1).
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) could allow a better understanding of functional
      recovery. Graph method has been applied to fMRI signal analysis in disorder of consciousness
      (DOC) due to post-anoxic encephalopathy. Comatose state was characterized by dramatic change
      in local connectivity (hub location) without significant change in global connectivity (2).
      The present study aims at describing functional connectivity in DOC following severe TBI. We
      will record resting state fMRI in TBI patients in two clinical conditions: conscious state
      versus DOC state.
