    <textblock>
      Double-blind, crossover, randomized, 3x3 Latin square, placebo-controlled study of single
      intravenous dose administration of VVZ-149. To demonstrate assay sensitivity, lidocaine will
      be administered as a positive control. The study will take place during a single inpatient
      visit involving three separate treatment periods, each with a washout of (&gt;16-hours. Study
      drugs (VVZ-149 vs. lidocaine vs. normal saline, NS) will be administered intravenously.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a history of persistent pain secondary to unilateral
             monoradiculopathy present for a minimum of 3 months prior to the study, with an
             average pain intensity score of at least moderate over at least 50% of the day for the
             7 days prior to the screening visit and over the 7 days prior to starting study
             medication.

          2. Males or females between 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive. Females who are pregnant
             or breastfeeding will be excluded from the trial.

          3. Subjects must be in generally good health, either using no medication or using a
             stabilized medication regimen for chronic and well-controlled conditions such as
             hypertension, allergies, stable endocrinopathies (e.g. hypothyroidism), etc. Subjects
             with other active diseases will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the principal
             investigator.

          4. No concomitant therapy with any medication that is a known significant inhibitor or
             inducer of CYP450 2D6 and CYP3A4, at the discretion of the PI.

          5. Normal or clinically insignificant screening laboratory tests:

               -  Serum BUN, creatinine, bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, potassium, sodium, lactate
                  dehydrogenase, inorganic phosphate, total protein, glucose, albumin, and uric
                  acid. WBC, absolute neutrophil count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. SGOT
                  (AST), SGPT (ALT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, TSH/T4, urinalysis, and

               -  Electrocardiogram (12-lead). Any significant laboratory abnormalities will be
                  reviewed by the principal investigator prior to inclusion of the subject in the
                  study.

          6. Willingness to restrict analgesic therapy during inpatient admission days to the
             allowed rescue analgesic agent permitted by the study (acetaminophen).

          7. Subjects must have normal cognitive function and communicative ability in the English
             language.

          8. Subjects must be able to provide meaningful written informed consent.

             other investigational drug or device studies during the entire course of this study
             (beginning with the screening visit).

          5. Subjects with the following abnormal clinical evaluations:

               -  Impaired renal function defined as BUN &gt; 45 or creatinine &gt;2.0 and/or impaired
                  liver function defined as liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin
                  greater than 1.5 x upper limit of normal laboratory values.

               -  Prolonged PR (&gt;200 ms) interval on electrocardiogram (12-lead). Subjects
                  presenting with the above laboratory abnormalities may be allowed on a
                  case-by-case basis at the discretion of the principal investigator.

          6. Subjects who intend to donate blood or blood products while participating in this
