    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess and compare the efficacy of a standard 8-weeks protocol
      based on the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction MBSR program versus a 4-week shortened
      version of the protocol in the improvement of wellbeing variables in a non-clinical
      population in Spain. The investigators initial hypothesis was that both protocols are
      efficacious but the standard 8-week performs better that the short one.

    <description>A 8 weekly sessions of 120 min based on the standard protocol of Kabat Zinn was performed. The adapted program did not include a one-day retreat in silence, but one session in silence plus extra kindly awareness (compassion-based) and value-based exercises. Home practice was not systematically assessed, but recommended to be of 45min per day, most of the days. It was administered by a trained (3-y experience) and certified MBSR teacher (MMPD).</description>

    <intervention_name>4-week shortened MBSR</intervention_name>
    <description>This protocol was made up of 4 sessions of 120 mn administered by the same trained MBSR programme therapist to avoid variables associated to the therapist. The rationale behind the shortened version of MBSR was to keep the core content and practices of the program, in fewer sessions: raisin exercise (experiential concept of mindfulness); and main anchors of attention (breathing, body sensations, body movements).</description>
