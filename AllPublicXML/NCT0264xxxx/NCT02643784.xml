        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 45 to 75 years old patients;

          2. Stroke involving the vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) as judged
             by clinical and MRI evidences;

          3. Time from symptom onset to take the study assigned medication is within 24 hours;

          4. Statin naïve or discontinued at least 3 month before stroke onset;

          5. First ever stroke or mild sequelae (with modified Rankin Score 0-1) before the index
             event;

          6. Moderate neurological deficit with baseline NIHSS scoring from 4-20;

          7. MRI scans （T1W1、T2W2、T2Flair、DWI、SWI）accomplished from 12 to 48 hours after the onset;

          8. Consent form signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study:

          1. Stroke involving the vascular territory of the vertebrobasilar artery as judged by
             clinical and MRI evidences;

          2. Hemorrhagic transformation or intracranial hemorrhage on baseline MRI. MRI performed
             between 12-48 hours after the onset, if MRI provides evidences which met with the
             exclusion criteria, the patients will be excluded from the study;

          3. Any circumstances under which MRI scans can't be performed;

          4. Evidences suggesting cardiogenic stroke such as atrial fibrillation, acute coronary
             syndrome, patent foramen ovale , etc;

          5. Comatose with NIHSS 1a&gt;1;

          6. Medical or psychiatric conditions such as severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, heart
             failure, malignancy, major depression, dementia, alcohol or drug abuse;

          7. Suitable for rt-Plasminogen Activator thrombolysis treatment;

          8. Receiving medication with possible neuroprotective functions after stroke onset;

          9. Currently take steroids therapy;

         10. Diagnosed with malignancy within 5 years;

         11. Patients with myopathy or serum creatine kinase &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal
             not caused by myocardial injury;

         12. Severe renal function damage (eGFR&lt;30);

         13. Concurrent use ciclosporin;

         14. A history of hypersensitivity of statins and other severe complication;

         15. Child-bearing women ;

         16. Patients who are or may be pregnant;

         17. Other conditions under which patients not pertinent to attend the study as judged by
             the investigators.
