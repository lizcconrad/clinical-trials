  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the moment in France, one delivery on four is induced for a medical indication. In this
      context, the practitioners are exposed to an additional difficulty when the clinical
      examination of the patient reveals a unfavorable cervix because the main drug used for the
      releases cannot be used and the cervix must be previously mature.

      There is a pharmacological method used and estimated in these indications of cervical
      maturation: the dinoprostone (Propess®).

      Other methods using a mechanical process, are under development and of evaluation as it is
      the case of the probe of dilation with double balloon (Cook®).

      The population of the obese women is a population in constant increase in France and
      presenting deliveries to higher risks of maternal and foetal complications. At these
      patients, the medicinal releases seem also more difficult and at greater risks of failures.

      The investigators wish compared the efficiency of the cervical ripening balloon to the
      dinoprostone within the framework of a medical indication in a release with a unfavorable
      cervix in obese pregnant women.
