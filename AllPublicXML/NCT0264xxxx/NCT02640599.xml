  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will use a stationary bike protocol to investigate whether patients with post
      concussion syndrome benefit from adding exertion training to a vestibular rehabilitation
      program.

      Investigators examine the effect of aerobic exercise testing and training on individuals with
      concussion who are currently experiencing symptoms and examine the effect of aerobic exercise
      in combination with traditional vestibular rehabilitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled single blind pilot study testing the hypothesis that the
      combination of aerobic exercise plus vestibular rehabilitation will result in greater
      reduction of symptoms of dizziness and imbalance compared to vestibular rehabilitation alone.
