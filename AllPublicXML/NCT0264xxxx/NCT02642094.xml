      To examine whether rapamycin can reduce malignant markers and aberrant mammary
      stem/progenitor cells (MaSCs) number in surgical specimens

    <description>Subjects will be given a low dose of rapamycin at 2 mg/day for 5-7 days of treatment. A surgical specimen will be taken 3-7 days after the last dose of rapamycin. The specimens will be evaluated for lesion size, nuclear grade, presence of necrosis in each patient's core biopsy and surgical specimens, as well as IHC (ImmunoHistoChemistry) for biomarkers including p16, COX2 (cyclooxygenase-2), and Ki-67. Specimens will also be tested for rapamycin treatment on the properties of mammary stem/progenitor cells as another biomarker for gauging the efficacy of rapamycin treatment.</description>
