  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Living donor organ transplantation has increased in recent years due to an increased need for
      organs. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a TAP block on
      postoperative analgesia and opioid consumption in liver transplantation donors in whom a
      right lateral extending upper mid-line abdominal incision was used.

      This prospective randomized controlled double-blinded study was conducted with 50 liver
      transplantation donors between 18-65 years who were scheduled to undergo right hepatectomy
      surgery. Cases to whom TAP block with ultrasound was applied after standard general
      anesthesia were determined as Group 1 and cases to whom only standard general anesthesia was
      applied, were determined as Group 2.

    <description>Patients who received a tranversus abdominis plane block with ultrasound after standard general anesthesia represented Group 1.
The tranversus abdominis plane block was performed bilaterally by obtaining an image with real time ultrasound guidance with a 6-13 MHz linear probe.
The block was placed with a 22 G 80 mm needle while obtaining real-time images via an in-plane technique.
Two 20 mL syringes were prepared after preparing a local anesthetic concentration of 1.5 mg/kg of 0.5% bupivacaine to 40 mL with saline. These were administered to the left and right abdominal walls.
Postoperative analgesia was administered through a morphine the patient-controlled analgesia device.</description>
