  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in Taiwan, where chronic
      viral hepatitis is common. Patients with HCC typically have impaired liver function because
      of virus- or alcohol- induced cirrhosis and viral hepatitis, and only approximately 20% of
      them are appropriate candidates for surgery. The 5-year overall survival for patients treated
      by surgery is approximately 30%-70%. For those not treated with surgery, liver function
      affected by an underlying liver disease has a strong influence on clinical outcomes, and
      complicates treatment strategies further than for other tumors. Maximal preservation of
      normal liver volume and function is an important consideration in the choice of treatment.

      Proton beam has been applied to HCC treatment in Japan for longer than a decade, and several
      retrospective results showed excellent 3-5 years local control rate ranging from 85-95% and
      nearly no major complications. The investigators also retrospectively reviewed 75 index
      tumors sized 3.1-7.0cm in 70 patients receiving multiple-electrode radiofrequency ablation
      with switching controller (ME-SWC RFA) treatments in the period between 1 January 2009 and 31
      December 2011 (Oral report in Taiwan Digestive Disease Week, October, 2012). Estimated 1-,
      2-, and 3-year cumulative overall survival rates and local control rates were 94%, 85%, 81%
      and 89%, 83%, 67%, respectively.

      Since ME-SWC RFA is the present one of standard modalities for non-surgery, moderate to
      larger (3-7 cm) HCC, and based on retrospective studies the local control rate of proton
      therapy was better than radiofrequency ablation, this prospective trial is aimed to compare
      the effects of these two modalities in 3-7 cm HCC patients who are not candidates for surgery
      or refuse surgery. This prospective study has high possibility to confirm the role of proton
      beam in HCC.

      Along with the clinical trial, the investigators will also use next generation sequencing
      (NGS) to exam gene expression profile of tumor samples and find out candidate genes related
      to local control, intrahepatic control (treatment out-field control in liver), regional lymph
      node relapse, distant metastasis, and treatment response in HCC.

    <description>Multiple-electrode radiofrequency with switch-controller system (ME-SWC RFA) can create a large coagulation necrosis volume and successful treat HCC sized more than 3 cm, extending to 8.5 cm. ME-SWC RFA system uses up to 3 electrodes parallel insertion to inside of the tumors with an equilateral triangular confirmation before initiation of ablation. The distances between electrodes are about 1.5-2 cm, estimated by ultrasound measuring. The switching machine is set on the auto-mode, and all electrodes work alternately and switching each other automatically after impendence surge.</description>
