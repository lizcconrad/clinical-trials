  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The doctor-patient relationship was becoming worse. More and more work-related violence has
      happened to physicians and nurses. A portion of medical students felt depressed and thought
      that the career future was gloomy. The study was designed to measure the empathy, an vital
      element of professionalism, well-being of mental and study emotion. Furthermore, the
      investigators explored an intervention of group study to promote medical students'
      professionalism, mental health and study emotion.

      humanities when the other group is not given any intervention but the same room and time.The
      outcomes including empathy, depression, quality of life, burnout and self-efficiency are
