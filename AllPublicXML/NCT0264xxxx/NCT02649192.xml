  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children are particularly vulnerable to respiratory virus infections, especially influenza.
      Vitamin A &amp; D deficiencies are associated with vulnerability to infectious diseases of the
      respiratory tract. The central hypothesis of this protocol is that vitamin supplements will
      enhance antibody responses toward the flu vaccine in children. Children, 2-8 years old, will
      be randomized to receive influenza virus vaccine with a vitamin A+D supplement or influenza
      virus vaccine with placebo. Children will be tested for vitamin levels and immune responses
      before and after influenza virus vaccinations to determine if vitamin supplementation
      improves the influenza virus vaccine-induced immune response.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To assess the vaccine-induced and total antibody (including IgG and IgA) response after
           influenza virus vaccine administration and IgA/IgG plus IgA/IgM ratios at 28 and 56 days
           in sera

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To assess the neutralizing response toward influenza virus vaccine in the sera.

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will be randomized to receive either an influenza virus vaccine plus Vitamins A
      &amp; D or an influenza virus vaccine plus placebo. They will be stratified based on retinol
      binding protein (RBP) levels at screening, using a cut-off indicative of Vitamin A
      insufficiency (≤22,000 ng/ml). Co-enrolled sibling participants will be first stratified by
      RBP levels, then siblings within the same stratum will be equally assigned to different arms
      to provide greater assurance of balanced treatment assignment. Children will be tested for
      vitamin levels and immune responses before and after influenza virus vaccinations to
      determine if vitamin supplementation improves the influenza virus vaccine-induced antibody
      immune response.

      All participants will receive two doses of an influenza virus vaccination administered at
      least 28 days apart. Vitamin levels and antibody responses toward the vaccine will be
      measured on day 0 (baseline levels obtained where day 0 equals the first influenza virus
      vaccination administration), day 28, and day 56. Placebo or Vitamins A + D (at the levels of
      20,000 IU and 2,000 IU, respectively) will be administered orally on the days of vaccination.

      Blood serum samples will be collected from participants on Day 0, prior to receiving
      influenza virus vaccine on Day 28, and during their Day 56 follow-up visit.

      Parents will be asked to fill out diary cards to indicate food intake for children during the
      study period along with an optional food frequency questionnaire given on day 56. Specific
      measurements on days 28, and 56 will include analyses of vaccine-specific and total IgA, IgG,
      and IgA/IgG plus IgA/IgM ratios in sera. Functional activities of antibodies toward influenza
      vaccine will also be measured.

    <time_frame>Day 56 after first vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of 2X increases or conversion from undetectable to detectable response in virus-specific antibody after 2 immunizations in intervention and control groups will be reported.
The point estimate and 95% confidence interval will be estimated for both groups, overall and by stratum. The proportion difference with 95% confidence interval will be reported, overall and by stratum. Due to possible variation in virus strains and influenza virus vaccine formula in different flu seasons, analyses by season will also be described. Continuous titer values in both groups, overall or by stratum, will be described and compared with point estimate along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <description>Secondary analyses will examine sero-conversion based on antibody functions (HAI or neutralization) defined as antibody titers of &lt;1:40 converting to ≥1:40, or a four-fold increase in titer for participants with a starting titer of ≥1:40. Sero-conversion rate will be estimated with proportion and 95% confidence interval for both groups, overall and by stratum. The rate difference will be described with point estimate and 95% confidence interval, overall and by stratum. Due to possible variation in virus strains and influenza virus vaccine formula in different flu seasons, analyses by season will also be described.
