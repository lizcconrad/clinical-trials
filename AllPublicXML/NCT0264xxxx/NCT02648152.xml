  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter observational study to validate that the POLARSTEM™ is a state-of-the-art implant
      in terms of radiographic, clinical performance and long-term survivorship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this multicenter clinical observation is to validate short-, mid-, and long-term
      outcome (efficacy and safety) of the POLARSTEM™.

      Efficacy evaluations:

        -  Evaluation of function, range of motion (ROM) and pain as assessed by Harris Hip Score,
           Hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) [7, 8], an extension of the
           Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).

        -  Radiographic changes as defined by radiolucent lines, osteolysis, hypo- and hypertrophy,
           implant loosening or migration

      Safety evaluations:

        -  Intra- and perioperative device-related adverse events (AE) and complications up to
           discharge

        -  Postoperative AE up to 10 years
