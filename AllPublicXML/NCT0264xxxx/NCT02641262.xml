  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains among the most acute and critical
      diseases, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) and thrombolysis as mainstay
      reperfusion treatments. Real-world implementation of current guidelines for STEMI management
      has been assessed in developed countries and large Chinese cities. However, until now, there
      has been no registry on patients with STEMI in Henan, the most populated (about 100 million)
      and predominantly rural (66%) province in central China.

      This registry is aimed to assess management practices, time delays, outcomes and reasons for
      not receiving reperfusion therapy in consecutive STEMI patients in reperfusion-capable
      hospitals, i.e., tertiary and secondary, in Henan province.

      1. Henan institute of cardiovascular epidemiology is responsible for design, data quality
           control and statistical analysis.

        2. Data are collected using a uniformed questionnaire by trained staff at each hospital.

        3. Sample size estimation: Based on Henan retrospective observational cohort of STEMI
           patients, in-hospital mortality in secondary and tertiary hospitals were 5.6% and 6.0%,
           respectively. To achieve a precision of 20% with an α of 0.05 in each of the hospital,
           investigators need a sample of 5000, 2500 in each class hospital.

        4. Statistical analysis plan: Investigators will report summary statistics for patient
           characteristics, delay time (symptom onset-to-first medical contact(FMC),
           FMC-to-reperfusion), patient referral (time and means of transportation), treatments
           received and primary outcomes. Investigators will also undertake the following
           prespecified subgroup analyses: hospital class, age, sex, killip class, time to first
           medical contact, infarct location, history of hypertension, diabetes or smoking and
           thrombolysis in myocardial infarction risk score.

        5. Quality assurance plan

      1)Diagnosis of STEMI is according to the third universal definition of myocardial infarction.

      2)Before registry, a training program on study objectives, data collection, and STEMI
      management is given to the primary investigator and related staff at each participating
      center.

      3)Henan institute of cardiovascular epidemiology will regularly monitored at least 10% of
      questionnaires for accuracy against medical records. If the questionnaires are not completed
      with 98% accuracy, all questionnaires are considered unqualified and this staff will be
      retrained.

      4)Before entering into the computer, data are queried for invalid and illogical values by
      research staff in Henan institute of cardiovascular epidemiology. Participating centres who
      has the high error rate of data, and no change in 6 months shall be deemed abandoned
      automatically; participating centres who has the high quality of data will be issued a
      certificate to reward.

      5)Investigator meeting will be annually held to conclude the progress, solve existing
      problems and strengthen program training.
