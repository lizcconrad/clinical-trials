      Purpose: To report the feasibility and to obtain preliminary data on the effects of using an
      enhanced Otago Exercise Programme to reduce fall risk in individuals with osteoarthritis
      (OA).

      Participants: Ten participants from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project who have OA,
      are at risk for falls, and are 65+ years old.

      Procedures (methods): All participants will receive the 6-month enhanced Otago program. The
      investigators will assemble data: quantifying participant adherence to and safety of the
      intervention, ascertaining retention of participants for 6 months, determining acceptability
      of the program, and other validated measures (e.g., number of falls and fall severity,
      balance measures).

    <measure>Berg balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>This is 14 item scale that measures balance among older adults. The participant attempts to complete 14 different balance tests (e.g., stand unsupported with eyes closed, pick up object from floor from standing position), closely supervised by a physical therapist to prevent fall or injury. The test takes no more than 15 minutes to complete and a total score is calculated of 0-56 (high fall risk to low fall risk).</description>

Time for each test is recorded in seconds, and maximum length of time of each test is 30 seconds.</description>

    <description>The Otago Exercise Programme is a falls prevention program that is successful at reducing falls in adults 65+ years of age. Briefly, this program includes flexibility, progressive lower extremity strengthening with ankle weights, and balance exercises. The investigators are replacing the Otago walking program with the evidence-based Arthritis Foundation's Walk With Ease program.</description>
