    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of exhaled air analysis as tool to monitor the disease activity
      in Crohn's Disease (CD). This study is a validation of the previous findings. In this study
      the participant will be asked to donate exhaled air, blood samples and fecal samples. The
      breath samples will be used to measure various volatile metabolites in breath. The breath air
      will be next used to validate the previous findings. The blood samples will be used to define
      the origin of volatile metabolites in breath. Finally, the potential of exhaled breath
      analysis as non-invasive marker of diseases activity will be compared to established fecal
      calprotectin.

      In the recent study(doi: 10.1097/Mib.0000000000000436) it was shown the potential of analysis
      of exhaled air to differentiate active and inactive state of Crohn's Disease (CD). Although,
      the molecules found in this cohort have shown potential to differentiate between CD patients
      in remission or with active disease, the validation of the outcomes has to be performed in
      new population. One crucial pathophysiologic factor in CD is excessive lipid peroxidation
      during oxidative stress, i.e. during overproduction of oxidants compared to the protective
      antioxidants. Oxidative stress is a potential aetiological factor and/or a triggering factor
      in CD. Many volatile compounds including hydrocarbons and aldehydes are produced during
      oxidative stress and they can be non-invasively measured in exhaled air 5, 6. However,
      exhaled breath contains volatile metabolites originating from previous or current uptake of
      environmental contaminants, and more interestingly from metabolism of foreign organisms
      (bacteria, viruses, fungi or yeasts). Therefore, it is important to study not only exhaled
      air but also blood in which blood borne volatile molecules can be measured. Since the current
      study also aims for validating the use of volatile molecules in exhaled air as non-invasive
      markers for disease activity in CD patients, the investigators will compare the outcome of
      exhaled air analysis with currently established non-invasive measure of disease activity,
      i.e. fecal calprotectin.

        Our target population will consist of individuals with established diagnosis of Crohn's
        Disease (CD). The target population will include male and female between the ages of 18 and
        65 years and standard BMI (between 19 and 30). Potential study participants will be
        excluded if having any disease compromising immune system (such as HIV positive status or
        patients after organ transplantations), diagnosis of any liver disease, active and
        untreated tuberculosis and chemotherapy agents. All potential participants must have
        scheduled appointment for colonoscopy.
