  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study to determine outcomes of surgical release of tongue-tie
      and lip-tie in babies who are experiencing difficulty with breastfeeding.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding rates in the United States initiate at around 80%, but many mothers are unable
      to effectively breastfeeding because of problems with latch and suction generation. Previous
      studies have demonstrated how nipple pain is directly linked to ankyloglossia, but most of
      these studies are done with poor methodology.

      Clinically, tongue-tie and lip-tie have correlate with numerous other symptoms besides nipple
      pain. These babies tend to be inefficient nursers, which can affect weight gain. Abnormal
      intake of air because of the poor latch/seal can lead to reflux symptoms. Finally, there is a
      significant psychological toll on mothers who want to breastfeed but cannot do so.

      This study aims to prospectively analyze these outcomes by using validated tools.

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Lingual Frenotomy and/or maxillary labial frenectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>The procedure is performed with a 1064nm InGaAsP semiconductor diode laser which is a soft tissue laser with variable pulsed wave and wattage settings. The procedure was performed at 0.7-0.8 pulsed watts, 200 microseconds on and 100 microseconds off (actual wattage: 0.47 to 0.53 W) using a 300 micron laser fiber. The tongue is elevated using a grooved director while the laser tip is applied to the frenulum. If present, the anterior frenulum is divided until the submucosal portion of the tie is identified (this is the posterior tongue-tie). A small window in the central mucosa is made and the lateral mucosal walls of the posterior tongue-tie are released, taking care to not disturb the fascia of the underlying genioglossus muscle.</description>
