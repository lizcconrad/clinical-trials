  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to investigate the pain outcomes and satisfaction of pain relief for
      pediatric patients receiving needleless jet-injected (J-Tip) lidocaine prior to regional
      anesthesia with femoral and/or sciatic nerve block and general anesthesia for arthroscopic
      knee surgery compared to femoral nerve block and/or sciatic nerve block with needle injected
      lidocaine prior to regional and general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The J-tip device has not been reported for use prior to regional block anesthesia prior to
      femoral or sciatic nerve blocks. The use of the J-tip device for lidocaine introduction prior
      to femoral or sciatic blocks at Arnold Palmer Medical Center has been up to the discretion of
      the anesthesiologist. It has been anecdotally reported at our institution to have equal or
      better pain relief for the regional nerve blocks as needle introduction of lidocaine.

      This study seeks to evaluate the difference in pain from local anesthetic infiltration with
      J-tip needleless injection device compared to needle injection by use of Visual Analog
      Scales.

        -  To evaluate efficacy of femoral nerve block after J-tip device lidocaine injection post
           operatively by use of Visual Analog Scales.

        -  To assess patient and parent satisfaction with J-tip device use by satisfaction
           questionnaire.

        -  To assess changes in post operative pain medication amounts with J-tip device use.

    <description>After sterile preparation, the J-tip injector will be placed on the skin at the selected site of the regional block needle introduction. Firm pressure will be placed with the J-tip injector on the site for the chosen block, the safety ring slid down, the trigger pressed and the tip held firmly on the skin for three seconds. One quarter of a milliliter of one percent lidocaine will be injected with the characteristic &quot;pop&quot; and &quot;hissing&quot; sounds inherent to the J-tip injector.</description>
