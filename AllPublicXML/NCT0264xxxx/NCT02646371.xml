  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proof of concept challenge study, the bioconjugate candidate vaccine Flexyn2a will be
      tested for its ability to induce an immune response that protects healthy adult volunteers
      from infection with a wild-type Shigella flexneri 2a strain compared to subjects receiving
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flexyn2a is a bioconjugate candidate vaccine that is able to induce an humoral immune
      response specific for the 2a-antigen of Shigella flexneri 2a bacteria. Healthy adult
      volunteers naïve for Shigella flexneri 2a infections at screening will receive two
      administrations of 10 micrograms Flexyn2a or placebo 4 weeks apart. Four weeks after the
      second vaccination, each subject will be challenged with 1500 cfu of the virulent Shigella
      flexneri 2a strain 2457T. In order to assess the ability of Flexyn2a to protect against
      infection with this strain, the attack rate of shigellosis in the group vaccinated with
      Flexyn2a will be compared to the group of the subjects who received placebo injections.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female age 18-50 years (inclusive)

          -  Good health, without clinically significant medical history or physical examination
             findings.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and negative urine before each vaccination
             and before challenge for female subjects of childbearing potential.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to avoid pregnancy by use of effective
             contraception. Abstinence is not acceptable as effective contraception. Female
             subjects unable to bear children must have this documented (e.g. tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy).

          -  Willingness to participate in the study after all aspects of the protocol have been
             explained and written informed consent obtained.

          -  Completion of a training session and demonstrated comprehension of the protocol
             procedures, knowledge of Shigella‐associated illness, and a passing score of 70% or
             better on a written examination.

          -  Availability for the study duration, including all planned follow‐up visits.

          -  Willingness to refrain from participating in other studies of investigational products
             until completion of the last study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women currently nursing.

          -  Presence of a significant medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the
             investigator precludes participation in the study.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in screening hematology or serum chemistry as
             determined by PI or PI in consultation with the research monitor and sponsor.

          -  Presence in the serum of HIV antibody, HBs‐Ag, or HCV antibody (if confirmed positive
             by HepC confirmatory test, i.e. RIBA, PCR)

          -  Evidence of IgA deficiency (serum IgA &lt; 7 mg/dl or limit of detection of assay).

          -  Evidence of current excessive alcohol consumption or drug dependence.

          -  Evidence of impaired immune function.

          -  Regular use of laxatives, antacids, or other agents to lower stomach acidity.

          -  Use of any medication known to affect the immune function (e.g., systemic steroids)

             period.

          -  Known allergy to any of the following antibiotics: ciprofloxacin,
             trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or penicillin.

          -  Symptoms consistent with Traveler's Diarrhea concurrent with travel to countries where
             Shigella infection is endemic (most of the developing world) within two years prior to
             dosing, OR planned travel to endemic countries during the length of the study.

          -  Vaccination for or ingestion of Shigella within 3 years prior to vaccination.

          -  Use of antibiotics during the 7 days before vaccination and challenge
