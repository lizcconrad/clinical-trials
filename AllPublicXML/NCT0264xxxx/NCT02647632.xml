  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate, in HCV genotype 1 or 4-infected patients
      who failed a prior DAA bitherapy with Sofosbuvir, the efficacy of a treatment with
      Grazoprevir/Elbasvir, Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin in the two treatment groups and compare the
      rate of sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after 16 or 24 weeks of this treatment.
      SVR12 is defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ (either TD[u] or TND).
