  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CVXL-0107 a glutamate release inhibitor, has shown evidence of antiparkinsonian and
      antidyskinetic activity in a macaque model and has shown a significant effect on the
      UPDRS-III (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) while &quot;ON&quot;,
      as well as an increase of &quot;ON-time&quot; without dyskinesia or without troublesome dyskinesia in a
      previous phase 2a proof of concept study. This study will confirm the efficacy of CVXL-0107
      in combination with optimal dose of levodopa on motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) .

      Phase IIa study, 1:1 randomized, double blind placebo- controlled, with cross-over. Each
      volunteer patient will be randomly assigned to receive CVXL-0107 or placebo as add-on PD
      therapy and crossed-over to the other arm in the second sequence of the study. They will be
      assessed during an acute levodopa challenge test with one intake of the study drug or placebo
      with a supra-optimal dose of levodopa after 2 weeks of daily treatment with the same study
      drug or placebo. Patients will be cross-overed to the other treatment and reassessed during a
      second acute levodopa challenge test after 2 weeks of daily treatment with the study drug or
      the placebo. The study will evaluate the anti-PD and the anti-dyskinesia efficacy of
      CVXL-0107 as measured by MDS-UPDRS part III (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's
      Disease Rating Scale) and on levodopa-induced dyskinesia as measured by the AIMS (Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale).
