    <textblock>
      The model by which physicians measure the lack of blood flow in the vessels that supply blood
      to the heart muscle is called Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is the measurement of the
      pressure across the vessels that supply blood to the heart. These are known as the coronary
      arteries. This study involves comparing two FFR wires, the St. Jude Medical Pressure Wire
      (PW) and the ACIST Navvus Microcatheter (MC) to check the accuracy of the devices. FFR allows
      real-time estimation of the effects of a narrowed vessel, whereas standard angiography can
      underestimate or overestimate narrowing, because it only visualizes contrast (the different
      areas of color) inside a vessel.

    <textblock>
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement by pressure wire (PW) under hyperemic conditions
      has become the invasive gold standard for determining the physiologic extent of cardiac
      ischemia, and which has been validated in several clinical outcomes studies as a way of
      optimizing case selection for PCI. More recently a microcatheter (MC)-based sensor
      measurement of fractional flow reserve has been introduced. Small scale in-vivo comparisons
      have been performed suggesting the utility of this approach to measure FFR,but these data are
      limited and have not been independently validated. This non-randomized, prospective study is
      designed to evaluate the accuracy of MC-based FFR measurement to the PW standard in lesions
      subjected to FFR assessment in routine clinical practice.
