  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the natural clinical course, diagnostic possibilities and
      treatment modalities in moderately severe (MSAP) and severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The
      management of severe acute pancreatitis varies with the severity and depends on the type of
      complication that requires treatment. Although no universally accepted treatment algorithm
      exists, the step-up approach using close monitoring, percutaneous or endoscopic drainage,
      followed by minimally invasive video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement has demonstrated to
      produce superior outcomes to traditional open necrosectomy and may be considered as the
      reference standard intervention for this disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite overall reduced mortality in the last decade, MSAP and SAP are devastating diseases
      associated with mortality ranging from less than 10% to as high as 85%, according to various
      studies. The management of SAP is complicated because of the limited understanding of the
      pathogenesis and multi-causality of the disease, uncertainties in outcome prediction and few
      effective treatment modalities. Generally, sterile necrosis can be managed conservatively in
      the majority of cases with a low mortality rate (12%). However, infection of pancreatic
      necrosis can be observed in 25%-70% of patients with necrotizing disease; it is generally
      accepted that the infected non-vital tissue should be removed to control the sepsis.
      Laparotomy and immediate debridement of the infected necrotic tissue have been the gold
      standard treatment for decades. However, several reports have shown that early surgical
      intervention for pancreatic necrosis could result in a worse prognosis compared to cases
      where surgery is delayed or avoided. Therefore, several groups worldwide have developed new,
      minimally invasive approaches for managing infected necrotizing pancreatitis. The
      applicability of these techniques depends on the availability of specialized expertise and a
      multidisciplinary team dedicated to the management of SAP and its complications.

    <description>Depending on the operator experience, tandem trocar technique or Seldinger technique can be used. If the Seldinger technique is used, then the catheter tract should be sequentially dilated over a guidewire. Access routes that avoid crossing the bowel and other intervening organs, or major mesenteric, peripancreatic, or retroperitoneal blood vessels are selected to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination and hemorrhage. Successful percutaneous treatment of necrotic collections of the pancreas depends on several important factors. Catheters often need to remain in place for several weeks and sometimes months; hence, close follow-up is required.</description>
