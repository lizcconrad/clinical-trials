      This is a Phase IV, multicenter, open label, non-randomized comparative group study to assess
      the safety and performance of the OrbiSymm system in subjects referred to contra lateral
      breast symmetrization involving a breast reduction following breast reconstruction
      post-mastectomy.

      The device has the CE Mark and will be used in the indication for which it is approved.

      Up to 60 patients will be assigned to the study (up to 30 patients for Orbix procedure, and
      up to 30 patients without Orbix procedure (only routine reduction/symmetrisation). Patients
      will return to the clinic for follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 12 &amp; 24 months (last visit will be
      optional).
