      For this study the investigators will conduct five-day trial periods for spinal cord
      stimulator (SCS) effectivenessâ€”once a patient is deemed to be a possible SCS candidate, the
      trial leads are implanted and they are asked to return to clinic in five days to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the trial. The primary outcome for this study will be a comparison of daily
      energy expenditure (EE), in units of kcal/day, prior to and after the trial implantation of
      the SCS leads and external pulse generator. Patients will wear the accelerometer device
      twenty-four hours a day for five days prior to the trial lead implantation to obtain baseline
      values, have the trial leads implanted in the procedure clinic, then continue to wear the
      accelerometer for another five days. Baseline and post-SCS energy expenditure values will be
      compared. The secondary outcomes for this study will be steps taken, hours of sleep, and
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, as described in appendix 1) during the pre and post trial
      implantation periods. SCS itself is not a research procedure in this study, rather it is part
      of routine medical care for patients who would benefit from the procedure.

        Patients presenting to the UCD chronic pain clinic with post-laminectomy syndrome and
        demonstrate signs of neuropathic axial back pain will be considered. These patients should
        also be qualified for SCS placement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting to the UCD chronic pain clinic with post-laminectomy syndrome and
             demonstrate signs of neuropathic axial back pain will be considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults, pregnant women, patients
             unable to stop anticoagulation, and prisoners will be excluded.

          -  Pregnant patients will be excluded due to the risks of radiation exposure during SCS
             procedures and prisoners will be excluded as our clinic does not receive referrals
             from prison populations at this time.
