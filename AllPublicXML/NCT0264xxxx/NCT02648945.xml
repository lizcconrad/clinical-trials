  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety levels among the younger generation especially students have been increasing
      drastically in recent years. This severely affects a student's academics as previous studies
      have shown a strong correlation between high anxiety levels and poor working memory. Working
      memory, also known as short term memory is an important component in studying as it aids in
      holding important information needed to understand following information for a short period
      of time. This concerning phenomenon has drawn the attention of researchers to find solutions
      to this issue where recent studies have found physical exercise to contribute in the
      improvement of cognition which also includes working memory. Hence, the aim of this study is
      to compare the effects of low and high intensity exercises on working memory among students
      with high anxiety levels. Thirty female undergraduate students from UTAR with relatively high
      levels of anxiety will be conveniently sampled using Beck Anxiety Inventory. Participants
      will then be randomly allocated into 2 groups to undergo low and high intensity exercise on a
      treadmill according to Balke's Protocol. 2 memory assessments involving Verbal Memory Task
      will be conducted for each participant before and after the intervention.

    <description>high intensity exercise on a treadmill according to Balke's Protocol.
high intensity of exercises for each group of 15 participants were set at 80-85% VO2 max (Schneider, S., et al., 2009). To determine the targeted HR for low and high intensity aerobic exercise for each participant, the needed VO2 max percentages were subbed into the Swain equation as follows: %VO2 max = (%HRmax - 37)/0.64 Exercise HR/HRmax = %HRmax
After rearrangement, it will be:
%HRmax = %VO2 max x 0.64 + 37 Exercise HR = %HRmax x HRmax During the experimental session, each participant performed physical exercise training on the treadmill according to Balke's Protocol. The reliability of this protocol was tested by Leddy, et. al. (2011).</description>

    <description>first, Verbal Memory task was completed by each participant. Participant then started walking on the treadmill at either a speed of 3.0 mph (4.8 km/h) for sedentary individuals or 3.5 mph (5.6 km/h) for active individuals with grade 0% (Hanson, 1984). This was followed by an increase in grade of 2% for every 2 mins with the speed remaining constant until targeted HR was reached. A heart rate (HR) monitor (POLARÂ®) was used to measure HR throughout the test and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was done at the end of every 2 min stage. Exercise was stopped as soon as participant reaches targeted HR or requests to stop because of fatigue or any discomfort. Participant was then given time to cool down until HR reached or fell below 120 bpm and was allowed to take a break for approximately 1 min before proceeding with the second set of Verbal Memory Task. Upon completing the memory test, the participant was allowed to leave</description>
