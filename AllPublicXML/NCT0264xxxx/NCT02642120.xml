      To assess if the use of the dental support device( DSD) Laboraide™ shortens the second stage
      of labor and decreased the rate of obstetrical interventions, and if it's use alleviate pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated that a dental support device (DSD) may increase the
      isometric strength of different muscle groups (1-7). A preliminary pilot study of 32 women in
      2009 showed that DSD may shorten the second stage of labor among nulliparous women (8) by
      increasing the expulsive efforts of the parturient. The study hypothesis was that DSD may
      decrease the length of the second stage of labor and decrease the need for obstetrical
      interventions such as cesarean delivery or operative vaginal delivery.

      The Laboraide™ is a DSD developed specifically for use during labor. It is an inert device
      located between the jaws and does not interfere with speaking, breathing or any other oral
      activity during labor. It is a single use device, and is not transferred between women. The
      investigators hypothesize that using this device can shorten the second stage of labor and
      decrease obstetrical intervention rate. The researchers will also investigate it's efficiency
      in pain management.
