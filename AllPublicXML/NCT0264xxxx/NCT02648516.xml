  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively suppresses viral replication, leading to
      a significant immune recovery and a dramatic reduction in the incidence of AIDS-defining
      events. However, approximately 20% of individuals who exhibit stable viral suppression by
      ART, but fail to achieve sufficient immune reconstitution and are considered immune
      nonresponders (INRs). These INRs often experience an increased risk of opportunistic
      infections and shorter life expectancy compared with matched immune responders.Therefore,
      efficiently treating these immune nonresponders has become one of the most difficult
      challenges in the clinic.

      There is not a consensus definition of immunologic nonresponder individuals. In this study,
      we described patients whose CD4+ T-cell count remained below 200 cells/ul after 2 years of
      effective antiviral as immunologic nonresponders, in which viroimmunologic dissociation
      implies a greater risk of AIDS related and non-AIDS-related illnesses. Immune-based therapy
      such as IL-2 and IL-7 have been shown to increase CD4 T-cell counts but yielded no clinical
      benefit in a large randomized study. We have reported that umbilical cord-MSC treatment is
      safe and can significantly decrease systemic immune overactivation and improve immune
      reconstitution in INR patients. Meanwhile, we did not find that there was a significantly
      transitory increase in peripheral CD4 T-cell counts within 1-2 weeks since the onset of each
      MSC infusion. More important, umbilical cord-MSCs were found to be with a potential to
      produce IL-7 and TGF-Î² in vitro and in vivo and preferentially expand CD4 T-cell response in
      the recipients. Therefore, development of novel interventions to reduce immune
      overactivation/inflammation and enhance immune reconstitution in INRs is a high priority.

      Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized donor peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (MNCs) are a heterogeneous population of immune cells that have a potential role in
      immunomodulation and hemopoiesis. Here, we hypothesized that HLA-mismatched MNCs transfusion
      can be used to comprehensively restore or boost the host holistic immune system for INR
      patients, to the degree similar as immune responders.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and initial efficacy of allogeneic
      adoptive immune therapy (AAIT) for INR patients. 20 INR patients received i.v. transfusion
      one round (3 times) of 2.0-3.0*10E8 cells/kg of MNSs as the treated group. All of them
      received the conventional treatment for AIDS. The CD4 T cell numbers, HIV reservoir, side
      effects, symptom improvement, control of opportunistic infections and will be evaluated
      during the 48-week follow up.
