      This study will assess the ability for continuous electronic feedback to reduce the length of
      second stage labor and improve maternal and fetal outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The length of the second stage (pushing stage) of labor is highly correlated with the
      incidence of adverse outcomes for mother and neonate. More than 80% of laboring women in the
      US have epidurals for labor pain management. The length of second stage labor is increased in
      women receiving regional anesthesia for pain management during labor and delivery compared to
      women without anesthesia. This increased length of labor is largely due to lack of maternal
      sensation resulting in decreased physiologic feedback on the efficacy of maternal expulsive
      (pushing) efforts. Continuous maternal feedback regarding fetal decent during labor may
      result in more effective maternal expulsive efforts reducing the length of second stage and
      improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study will assess the ability for continuous
      electronic feedback to reduce the length of second stage labor and improve maternal and fetal
      outcomes.

      The study device consists of a modification of the standard fetal scalp electrode and a
      separate apparatus designed to detect movement of the fetal head by detecting movement of the
      FSE. As the patient pushes, the amount of fetal movement will be measured and recorded. The
      movement will be recorded by a laptop computer which will provide optical and auditory
      feedback to the patient about descent of the fetal head with maternal expulsive efforts.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to measure the ability of immediate, quantitatively precise, visual, and auditory and haptic maternal feedback on fetal descent to reduce the overall length of second stage labor compared to women receiving standard verbal and manual feedback during second stage labor and reduce the incidence of pushing for longer than 60 minutes.</description>

    <description>The PushCoach device consists of a modification of the standard fetal scalp electrode and a separate apparatus designed to detect movement of the fetal head by detecting movement of an FSE. The PushCoach will be attached to the patient by an adhesive pad over the sacrum and extend between the patient's legs approximately 2-3 inches from the vaginal introitus. It assesses the movement of the FSE attached to the fetal scalp during pushing. The amount of fetal movement will be measured and recorded. The PushCoach device is connected to a laptop computer which will provide optical and auditory feedback to the patient about descent of the fetal head with maternal expulsive efforts.</description>
