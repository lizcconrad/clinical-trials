    <description>Results are based on HbA1c data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The 'on-treatment' observation period was the period where the subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period was a subset of the 'on-treatment' observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes the observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the 'on-treatment' observation period or initiation of rescue medication. The post-baseline responses are analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment and country as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit.</description>

        <title>Change in HbA1c</title>
        <description>Results are based on HbA1c data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The ‘on-treatment’ observation period was the period where the subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period was a subset of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes the observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period or initiation of rescue medication. The post-baseline responses are analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment and country as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit.</description>

        <description>Results are based on fasting plasma glucose data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The ‘on-treatment’ observation period was the period where the subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period was a subset of the ‘on -treatment’ observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes the observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period or initiation of rescue medication.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 7-point Self-measured Plasma Glucose (SMPG) Mean Profile</title>
        <description>SMPG values were recorded at 7 time-points: before and 90 minutes after start of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and at bedtime. Reported results are mean profile from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The ‘on-treatment’ observation period was period where the subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period was a subset of the ‘on -treatment’ observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period or initiation of rescue medication. The post-baseline responses are analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment and country as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit.</description>

        <description>Results are based on the data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The ‘on-treatment’ observation period was the period where the subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period was a subset of the ‘on -treatment’ observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes the observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period or initiation of rescue medication. The post-baseline responses are analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment and country as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit. Change from baseline is presented in terms of ratio to baseline value.</description>

Subjects received semaglutide 0.25 mg for 4 weeks (weeks 1 to 4) followed by 0.5 mg for another 4 weeks (weeks 5 to 8) and then semaglutide 1.0 mg for remaining 32 weeks (weeks 9-40). Subjects were followed for 5 weeks after completion of treatment period.</description>

          <title>Change in Short Form Health Survey (SF-36v2™)</title>
          <description>The questionnaire contains 36 items across 8 domains and 2 summary scores. Score range: 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score). Results are based on the data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The ‘on-treatment’ observation period was period where subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period was a subset of the ‘on -treatment’ observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes the observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period or initiation of rescue medication. The post-baseline responses are analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment and country as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit.</description>

        <description>Percentage of subjects who achieved (yes/no) HbA1c reduction of ≥1% after 40 weeks of treatment. Results are based on the data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The ‘on-treatment’ observation period was the period where the subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period was a subset of the ‘on -treatment’ observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes the observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period or initiation of rescue medication. Missing data imputed from a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment and country as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit.</description>

        <description>Results are based on the data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The ‘on-treatment’ observation period was the period where the subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period was a subset of the ‘on -treatment’ observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes the observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period or initiation of rescue medication. The post-baseline responses are analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment and country as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit. Change from baseline is presented in terms of ratio to baseline value.</description>

        <description>Results are based on the data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The ‘on-treatment’ observation period was the period where the subject was considered to be exposed to trial product. The ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period was a subset of the ‘on -treatment’ observation period, where subjects did not receive any non-investigational antidiabetic medication (rescue medication). This period includes the observations recorded at, or after the date of first dose of trial product and not after the first occurrence of the following: the end-date of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period or initiation of rescue medication. The post-baseline responses are analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment and country as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit.</description>
