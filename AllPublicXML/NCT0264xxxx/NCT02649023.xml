  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the incidence of pre- and early postoperative deep venous thrombosis in
      patients undergoing hepatobiliopancreatic surgery, as well as potential corresponding risk
      factors with special attention to circulating tumor cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thromboembolic events are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in oncological patients.
      Up to 20% of cancer patients suffer from venous thromboembolism (VTE) induced by the
      underlying malignancy itself. Oncologic gastrointestinal surgery is a well-known risk factor
      for VTE. About 4-6% of patients undergoing elective hepatobiliopanreatic surgery develop a
      deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism. However, there are no data referring to
      the incidence of DVT shortly ahead of the surgical event, implementing that a certain
      percentage of postoperative DVT might have already been acquired before the operation.
      Furthermore, most studies only evaluate the rate of symptomatic VTE. In this study, all
      patients undergoing hepatobiliopancreatic surgery will be screened for deep venous thrombosis
      the day before surgery, on the third postoperative day (primary endpoint) and 90 days after
      the operation with a 2-point compression sonography of the lower extremities. The development
      of a symptomatic VTE (DVT or pulmonary embolism) will be recorded as secondary endpoint. Risk
      factors, perioperative morbidity / mortality and presence of circulating tumor cells will be
      analyzed with regard to VTE incidence.

    <measure>Deep venous thrombosis on day 3 after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be screened for deep venous thrombosis using a compression ultrasonography at the popliteal and common femoral vein. In case of a pathological finding, a complete compression duplex sonography of the lower extremities will be used for specification.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptomatic deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during hospital stay</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who develop clinical signs of a DVT like swelling of the leg, pain or tenderness in the leg, increased warmth, red or discolored skin of the leg, will be diagnosed by complete compression duplex sonography for confirmation of a deep venous thrombosis. Patients who develop clinical signs of pulmonary embolism like unexplained shortness of breath, pain with deep breathing, coughing of blood, chest pain with electrocardiographic signs of right ventricular stress will be diagnosed by CT pulmonary angiography for confirmation of central or peripheral pulmonary embolism.</description>
