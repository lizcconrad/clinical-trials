  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding motivational interviewing (MI) to a
      behavioural weight loss program (BWLP) results in improved weight loss for adults who are
      overweight or obese.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although behavioural weight loss programs (BWLP) are typically the first line of treatment
      for obesity, they are often plagued by high attrition rates and poor adherence. Studies
      evaluating the benefit of adding motivational interviewing (MI) to BWLPs have yielded mixed
      findings. The main purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the efficacy of
      adding MI to a BWLP on weight loss and adherence outcomes among 135 overweight and obese
      individuals enrolled in a 12-week (24 session) BWLP.

      This study used a randomized, controlled, longitudinal, between-subjects design to
      investigate the effects of a two-session MI intervention on weight loss in participants
      enrolled in a BWLP. Patients received either two 45-60 minute MI interventions or two 45-60
      minute attention control interviews. The control group interview consisted of questions
      ascertaining weight history, diet history, dietary awareness and physical activity. Questions
      for the control group focused primarily on assessment of past behaviour whereas questions for
      the MI group focused on enhancing motivation by exploring and resolving ambivalence. Weight
      was measured at baseline, end of the BWLP, and 6 months following BWLP completion. Program
      adherence (measured as number of BWLP sessions attended out of 24) was assessed as a
      secondary dependent measure. Importance, readiness, and confidence for weight change were
      assessed at baseline and then immediately following each interview (either MI or control). In
      addition, several other secondary outcome measures were assessed at baseline, end of the
      BWLP, 1 month follow-up, and 6 month follow-up.

      Research personnel informed all BWLP participants about the study at the initial BWLP group
      intake assessments, which occurred just prior to the commencement of the formal BWLP.
      Individuals who expressed interest in participating were contacted by phone by a research
      assistant and screened for eligibility. If eligible, an appointment was made for the first
      MI/control session which was scheduled within the first two weeks of the BWLP. Randomization
      occurred immediately prior to this interview. Participants were then contacted during the
      10th week of the BWLP to schedule a second MI/control session, which occurred approximately
      during the 12th week of the program. Participants were all contacted several weeks following
      program completion to schedule the one-month follow-up assessment. Finally, all participants
      were contacted approximately five months following program completion in order to schedule
      the six-month follow-up assessment.

      Sessions were tape recorded for all participants for quality assurance purposes. A subset of
      tapes were used to assess for treatment integrity.

    <time_frame>Mean physical activity as measured by the PPAQ, at the end of the behavioural weight loss program (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity was measured by the Paffenbarger questionnaire (PPAQ; Paffenbarger, Wing, &amp; Hyde, 1978). This self-report questionnaire assesses amount of activity performed during a typical week, and consists of three components: (1) stair climbing, (2) walking, and (3) sports and recreation. Participants were asked to report the frequency and duration of physical activity in the past week. Participants report the frequency and duration of physical activity in the past week. Scoring yields energy expenditure from physical activity per week (kcal/kg/week). Higher scores translate into greater energy expenditure per week (i.e.,better outcome). Range is 0 - no theoretical maximum. Highest observed score in our study was 10902 kcal/kg/week.</description>

    <description>The semi-structured MI protocol was a 45-60 minute intervention based on general MI principles and guidelines, MI strategies specific to health care practice, and MI principles for obesity treatment. The MI protocol included the following components: (1) eliciting concerns about weight; (2) exploring ambivalence; (3) assessing importance and confidence for change; (4) writing a decisional balance; (5) bolstering self-efficacy; (6) looking towards the future; and (8) eliciting ideas for possible changes participant could make to work towards weight loss. Although there was slight variation, the protocol for both MI sessions consisted of similar components.</description>

    <description>The attention control interview was a semi-structured interview ascertaining information relevant to health history, weight history, diet history, dietary and physical activity habits. The majority of questions for the control interviews were drawn from the Behavioural Weight Loss Program intake application. It was designed to be structurally equivalent to the MI session in terms of length of session, timing of sessions, and treatment modality. The goal of the attention-control interview was to provide a pseudo-intervention that controlled for factors common to attending treatment (e.g., attending treatment sessions, having personal contact with a therapist, discussing weight-related issues).</description>

          <description>Two 45-60 minute motivational interviewing sessions focusing on ambivalence towards change.
Motivational Interviewing: The semi-structured MI protocol was a 45-minute intervention based on general MI principles and guidelines, MI strategies specific to health care practice, and MI principles for obesity treatment. The MI protocol included the following components: (1) eliciting concerns about weight; (2) exploring ambivalence; (3) assessing importance and confidence for change; (4) writing a decisional balance; (5) bolstering self-efficacy; (6) looking towards the future; and (8) eliciting ideas for possible changes participant could make to work towards weight loss. Although there was slight variation, the protocol for both MI sessions consisted of similar components.</description>

Attention Control: The attention control interview was a semi-structured interview ascertaining information relevant to health history, weight history, diet history, dietary and physical activity habits. The majority of questions for the control interviews were drawn from the Behavioural Weight Loss Program intake application. It was designed to be structurally equivalent to the MI session in terms of length of session, timing of sessions, and treatment modality. The goal of the attention-control interview was to provide a pseudo-intervention that controlled for factors common to attending treatment (e.g., attending treatment sessions, having personal contact with a therapist, discussing weight-related issues).</description>

          <title>Physical Activity (PPAQ)</title>
          <description>The Paffenbarger questionnaire (PPAQ) assesses amount of planned and lifestyle associated physical activity performed during a typical week. The PPAQ consists of three components: (1) stair climbing, (2) walking, and (3) sports and recreation. Participants report the frequency and duration of physical activity in the past week. Scoring yields energy expenditure from physical activity per week (kcal/kg/week). Higher scores translate into greater energy expenditure per week (i.e.,better outcome). Range is 0 - no theoretical maximum. Highest observed score in our study was 10902 kcal/kg/week.</description>

          <title>Dietary Behaviour (DHQ) - overall score</title>
          <description>The Fat-related Dietary Habits Questionnaire (DHQ) is a 22-item questionnaire that was used to collect information on dietary behaviours and high-fat eating patterns. The DHQ consists of an overall summary score and five subscale scores assessing different dimensions of fat-related dietary habits. The overall summary score is the mean of all non-missing subscales scores. Responses are scored on a 4-point scale (usually, often, sometimes, rarely/never). Range of overall summary score is 1 - 4. Higher scores correspond to higher fat intakes (i.e., higher scores = worse outcome).</description>

          <title>Eating Disorder Symptomology (EDEQ) - global score</title>
          <description>Measured by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ). The EDEQ is a 36-item self-report rating scale, which assesses the presence and degree of specific psychopathology associated with eating disorders over the previous 28 days. Consists of a global score as well as four subscales: Eating Concern, Restraint, Shape Concern, and Weight Concern. The global score is obtained by summing the subscale scores and then dividing this sum by the number of subscales (i.e. four). Range is 0 - 6. Higher scores are indicative of greater eating disorder symptomatology (i.e., worse outcome).</description>

          <description>The Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESE), is a six-item measure that assessed self-efficacy for engaging in physical activity. Participants rated their confidence that they could exercise on a 5-point Likert scale for six barriers to exercise (e.g., bad weather, stress, availability of equipment). Scores range from 1 - 5. Higher scores are indicative of greater self-efficacy (i.e., higher scores = better outcome).</description>

          <description>The Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire (WEL) is a 20-item measure that yields 5 subscale scores which rate self-efficacy for controlling eating in different dimensions: negative emotions, availability, social pressure, physical discomfort, and positive activities. A global/total score (which ranges from 0 - 180) is obtained by summing the scores of each of the five subscales. Higher scores are indicative of greater self-efficacy (i.e., higher scores = better outcome).</description>

Attention Control: The attention control interview was a semi-structured interview ascertaining information relevant to health history, weight history, diet history, dietary and physical activity habits. The majority of questions for the control interviews were drawn from the Behavioural Weight Loss Program intake application. It was designed to be structurally equivalent to the MI session in terms of length of session, timing of sessions, and treatment modality. The goal of the attention-control interview was to provide a pseudo-intervention that controlled for factors common to attending treatment (e.g., attending treatment sessions, having personal contact with a therapist, discussing weight-related issues).</description>

Participants were asked to report the frequency and duration of physical activity in the past week. Participants report the frequency and duration of physical activity in the past week. Scoring yields energy expenditure from physical activity per week (kcal/kg/week). Higher scores translate into greater energy expenditure per week (i.e.,better outcome).

          <title>Physical Activity at 6 Month Follow up</title>
          <description>Physical activity was measured by the Paffenbarger questionnaire (PPAQ; Paffenbarger, Wing, &amp; Hyde, 1978). This self-report questionnaire assesses amount of activity performed during a typical week, and consists of three components: (1) stair climbing, (2) walking, and (3) sports and recreation. Participants were asked to report the frequency and duration of physical activity in the past week. Participants report the frequency and duration of physical activity in the past week. Scoring yields energy expenditure from physical activity per week (kcal/kg/week). Higher scores translate into greater energy expenditure per week (i.e.,better outcome). Range is 0 - no theoretical maximum. Highest observed score in our study was 10902 kcal/kg/week.</description>

          <description>Self-efficacy related to eating patterns was measured by the Weight Efficacy Life-Style Questionnaire (WEL; Clark, Abrams, Niaura, Eaton, &amp; Rossi, 1991). This self-report questionnaire yields five subscale scores, which rate self-efficacy for controlling eating in different situations/dimensions: negative emotions, availability, social pressure, physical discomfort, and positive activities. A global/total score (which ranges from 0 - 180) is obtained by summing the scores of each of the five subscales. Higher scores are indicative of greater self-efficacy (i.e., higher scores = better outcome).</description>

        <title>Self-efficacy for Engaging in Physical Activity After the Second Motivational Interviewing or Attention Control Interview, Week 12</title>
        <description>Self-efficacy for engaging in physical activity was measured by the Exercise Self-Efficacy questionnaire (ESE; Nigg &amp; Riebe, 2002). Participants rate their confidence that they could exercise on a 5-point Likert scale for six barriers to exercise (e.g., bad weather, stress, availability of equipment). Consists of a global score as well as four subscales: Eating Concern, Restraint, Shape Concern, and Weight Concern. The global score is obtained by summing the subscale scores and then dividing this sum by the number of subscales (i.e. four). Range is 0 - 6. Higher scores are indicative of greater eating disorder symptomatology (i.e., worse outcome).</description>
