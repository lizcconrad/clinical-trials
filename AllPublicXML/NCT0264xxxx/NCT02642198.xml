      This study is being conducted to validate the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP)
      measurement technology from Mortara Instrument, Inc. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) and Zoe
      Medical, Inc. (Topsfield, Massachusetts, USA) in a neonatal, infants and children up to 3
      years old patient population. The study is defined according to the International Standard
      &quot;ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2013, Non-invasive sphygmomanometers — Part 2: Clinical investigation
      of automated measurement type&quot;.

      The device under test is Mortara Instrument's Surveyor S12/S19 patient monitors (&quot;Surveyor&quot;)
      incorporating neonatal NIBP technology. Specifically, NIBP measurements will be taken using a
      cuff on the patient's limb (exact location will be determined by clinician) using a variety
      of cuffs sized for neonates and pediatrics. The device utilizes oscillometric technology to
      obtain quickly and conveniently non-invasive blood pressure measurements. Results will be
      compared to invasive blood pressure measurements from patients already monitored with such
      sensors. The Device under Test will be calibrated and verified by a Mortara representative on
      site.

        Patient inclusion criteria

        Before proceeding with the blood pressure non-invasive measurements detection, patients
        shall be examined and met the following stated criteria:

          -  Patients shall have already an invasive blood pressure monitoring (with catheter),
             this criteria applies only for Method 1.

          -  It shall be possible to perform multiple measurements of Non Invasive Blood pressure
             on one or more limbs with inflatable cuff.

          -  Patient with weight and age range according to the protocol requirements previously
             defined.

          -  Once the patient is identify a pre-screening activities is performed in order to
             assess any differences in the blood pressure. If the differences are minimal,
             according to the criteria described in the next section &quot;Exclusion criteria&quot;, the
             patient can be included in the study group.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients with unstable clinical or cardiovascular conditions;

          -  Patients with circulatory problems which can results in different blood pressure
             values in the limbs;

          -  patients with heart disease which can results in blood pressure wave morphology
             abnormalities;

          -  patients where the difference of systolic blood pressure between two limbs is greater
             than 15 mm Hg or the difference of lateral diastolic blood pressure is greater than
             10mmHg;

          -  Patients with arrhythmias.
