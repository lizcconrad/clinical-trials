  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the immunotherapeutic
      agent nivolumab given in combination with gamma knife therapy and valproate in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma, a common and lethal type of brain cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential to treat a wide range of diverse cancers. Of
      particular interest to researchers is the PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction, a major pathway
      that many cancers hijack in order to suppress immune control. Anti-PD-1 antibodies such as
      nivolumab show a strong potential to treat many types of cancers including glioblastoma, the
      most common and most lethal brain cancer.

      This study will examine a means of further focusing immune response on glioblastoma by
      combining stereotactic &quot;gamma knife&quot; radiosurgery with nivolumab. The rationale behind this
      intervention is that the radiation therapy will enhance immune response rate by providing
      additional tumor antigens from dying cells. Additionally, a study from investigators at Johns
      Hopkins indicates that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may boost the anti-cancer
      efficacy of PD-1 antibodies like nivolumab. Valproate, a class I HDAC inhibitor, will be used
      concurrently with nivolumab with the goal of enhancing the effects of both the nivolumab and
      the radiotherapy.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The pharmaceutical company (BMS) would no longer provide nivolumab for the study, so the study
    was terminated early.
