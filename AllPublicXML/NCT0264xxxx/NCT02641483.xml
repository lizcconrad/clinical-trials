  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the effect of electrical stimulation of the rectum on colonic
      motility. Most individuals with spinal cord injury develop neurogenic bowel dysfunction,
      which includes slowed colonic motility, which means that stools take longer than normal to
      pass through the colon. This slowed movement may result in chronic constipation and
      difficulty emptying the bowels. Individuals typically (without or without caregiver
      assistance) insert a gloved finger into the rectum and gently stretch it to improve colonic
      motility for a brief period to empty the bowels. The investigators hypothesize that
      electrically stimulating the rectum, instead of mechanically stretching it, will produce the
      same beneficial effect of improving colonic motility. Therefore, this study will compare the
      two methods. If electrical stimulation effectively improves colonic motility, then the
      investigator shall develop the approach as a therapeutic intervention in future studies.

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Two interventions will be tested, including the clinical standard of digital rectal stimulation and a novel approach using electrical stimulation of rectal sensory afferents, to determine the effect on colonic pressure. Increased colonic pressure will indicate successful modulation of neural pathways to increase bowel activity and thereby facilitate defecation in individuals with neurogenic bowel dysfunction.</description>
