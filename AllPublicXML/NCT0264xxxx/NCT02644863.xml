      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of D-CIK immune cells combined with chemotherapy
      after resection of esophageal cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 patients of esophageal cancer with TNM stage of tumor stage II-III,who had received
      surgery and kept their tumor tissue, will be randomly divided into group A (receive cancer
      tissue antigen sensitized D-CIK immune cells in combination with chemotherapy treatment) or
      group B (just receive chemotherapy), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A
      will receive 3 cycles of autologous antigen-sensitized DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks)
      and chemotherapy. Patients in group B will receive only 3 cycles chemotherapy.
