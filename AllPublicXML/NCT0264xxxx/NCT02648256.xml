  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is a serious and frequent infection in immunocompromised
      patients, whose evolution is potentially fatal if untreated. It is the most common
      opportunistic infections classifying patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus
      (human immunodeficiency virus +) at the stage acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Data from
      the french Institute for Health Watch showed in 2011 that 31% of 1400 cases of acquired
      immune deficiency syndrome were revealed by Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.

      Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia also increasingly concerns immunocompromised human
      immunodeficiency virus negative patients, due to the increasing use of immunosuppressive
      therapies (including corticosteroids), of anticancer cytostatics and biotherapies, in the
      context of grafts, transplants, but also from autoimmune or inflammatory chronic diseases.

      Recent data show that the number of cases occurring in patients Pneumocystis jirovecii
      pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus - in France is now higher than the cases occurring in
      Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia +. The severity of the Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is
      increased in patients with human immunodeficiency virus -, in whom the evolution is faster,
      with mechanical ventilation often required and higher mortality, requiring a fast and early
      diagnosis. Routine diagnosis relies on the detection of the fungus in the bronchoalveolar
      lavage, using stains (May Grunwald Giemsa or immunofluorescence) and Polymerase Chain
      Reaction. Polymerase Chain Reaction provides a diagnostic gain in immunocompromised patients
      not infected with human immunodeficiency virus that may present a pejorative table quickly
      despite low fungal burden. However, the deoxyribonucleic acid of the fungus can sometimes be
      detected in the absence of scalable Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and then shows a
      pulmonary colonization by Pneumocystis jirovecii. It is therefore important to improve the
      positive predictive value of Pneumocystis Polymerase Chain Reaction, to guide the management
      of optimal patient.

      In this work, the investigators propose to evaluate the Polymerase Chain Reaction on
      oropharyngeal rinse, non-invasive sampling and therefore probably less often positive and
      specific active infection. The investigators will develop a quantitative Polymerase Chain
      Reaction to identify a fungal load threshold number of copies / mL for diagnosing
      Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia with better positive predictive value.
