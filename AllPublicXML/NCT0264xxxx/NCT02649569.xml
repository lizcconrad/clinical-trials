      This pilot research trial studies continuous activity monitoring during fractionated
      radiotherapy in patients with head and neck, lung, or gastrointestinal cancer. This study
      explores the use of fitness trackers to study the activity levels of patients before, during,
      and after radiation therapy and the use of weekly assessments to measure the patients'
      quality of life during radiation therapy. This may allow doctors to see if there is any
      relationship between activity levels, quality of life, treatment interruptions,
      hospitalizations, and clinical outcomes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of continuous, accelerometer-based evaluation of patient
      activity levels before, during, and after treatment with fractionated external beam
      radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of performing weekly quality of life assessments during
      fractionated external beam radiotherapy.

      II. To explore how accelerometer-based metrics change throughout patients' treatment courses
      and if these changes are associated with quality of life assessments, treatment
      interruptions, hospitalizations, and clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients wear an activity monitor throughout and up 4 weeks after completion of radiation
      therapy. Patients who are willing may continue to wear the monitor through routine follow up
      appointments. Patients also complete questionnaires at evaluations, which take place prior to
      radiotherapy initiation, weekly during radiotherapy, and then 2 and 4 weeks after the
      completion of radiotherapy.
