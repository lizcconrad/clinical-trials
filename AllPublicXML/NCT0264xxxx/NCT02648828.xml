  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the ability of physicians and a statistical index (the
      Rothman score) to predict clinical deterioration over the next 24 hours. Clinical
      deterioration is defined as concern in change in vital signs or patient status requiring a
      call to the rapid response team, cardiopulmonary arrest, or transfer to the ICU.

      The proposed study will ask interns, residents, and attending physicians from general
      internal medicine teaching teams in a large teaching hospital to make predictions about the
      probability of their patient having a clinical deterioration in the next 24 hours. The
      investigators will compare these judgments to the Rothman index.

    <description>Physicians will make judgments about the probability of clinical deterioration for each of their patients on a 0 (definitely won't) to 100 (certainly will) scale. Clinical deterioration is defined as rapid response, cardiopulmonary arrest, or ICU transfer in the next 24 hours. The Rothman Index is an index that predicts clinical deterioration. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) will be calculated for physicians and the Rothman Index. The AUROC measures the association between the physician's judgment or Rothman Index and actual clinical deterioration. The AUROC of these two measures will then be statistically compared.</description>
