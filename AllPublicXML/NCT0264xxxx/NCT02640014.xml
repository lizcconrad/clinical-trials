    <textblock>
      The outcomes of oral immunotherapy (OIT) in food allergy study will provide more knowledge of
      oral immunotherapy. So far the OIT has showed in clinical experiments to be a interesting way
      to increase the unresponsiveness in severe food allergies. However little is known about it´s
      long-term outcomes, immunological mechanisms and there are no previous studies about
      cost-utility of OIT.

      The purpose of the present study is to examine the outcomes of the food oral immunotherapy on
      patients with severe food allergy in the three different subprojects:

      Study 1: Long-term follow up after milk oral immunotherapy. The measured outcomes are
      long-term effectiveness (e.g. health-related quality of life), safety of desensitization and
      immunological changes.

      Study 2: Measure health-related quality of life with disease-specific and generic
      questionnaire. The aim of this study is to define the suitability of the FAQLQ and the 15-D
      questionnaires for the Finnish food allergic patients. Another purpose of this study is to
      examine the relationship between FAQLQ and 15-D questionnaires.

      Study 3: QALYs. This is called the cost-utility analyses and QALYs and its purpose is to
      calculate the cost of OIT and to define the cost-effectiveness of OIT by measuring QALYs. To
      our knowledge this will be the first pilot study to define the QALYs in food oral
      immunotherapy. The aim is to have 50-100 patients. The literature in other areas of medicine
      50-100 patients in QALY-publishing is quite plain.
