    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pain relief after infusion of
      ropivacaine at port sites at end of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)compared with placebo
      (0.9% normal saline).

    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to two groups, On Day 1,each subject was to undergo
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. Anesthesia will be induced with
      fentanly (2-4ug/kg), propofol TCI (4ug/ml), rocuronium (0.6mg/kg), and maintaine with
      remifentanly(0.1-0.3ug/kg.h) , and propofol TCI (3-5ug/ml). At the end of the operation
      before wound closure, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ropivacaine or placebo. In
      study group all wounds were infiltrated with 0.75% ropivacaine 14ml at port sites before
      wound closure(6ml for epigastric port ,6ml for umbilical port ,and 4ml for working port) .
      The study drugs will be applied to the skin, subcutis, fascia, and parietal peritoneum
      through the port sites at the end of surgery. All anesthetics will be stopped when wound
      infiltration completed. Patients will be send to PACU for monitor a while then back to ward.
      Record of pain intensity evaluation and rescue analgesic medication consumption were to
      continue through 48hours after administration of study drug. Pain intensity will be assessed
      by using a 0-10 point VAS scale. VAS-rest and VAS-coughing were recorded at the baseline
      ,2,4,6,8,12,18,24,48 hours. Postoperative Rescue analgesia consisit of Parecoxib Sodium 40mg
      be given by a nurse on requst of the subject to a maximum of 80mg per day.
