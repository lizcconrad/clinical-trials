  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the nutritional therapy with SBI (a medical food)
      as compared to placebo in the clinical dietary management of mild to moderate Crohn's
      disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, pilot study evaluating
      SBI 10 g BID compared to matching placebo for 12 weeks followed by a 12 week open-label
      extension SBI 10 g BID (EnteraGam) in the dietary management of mild to moderate Crohn's
      disease.

      The effect of SBI will be evaluated on Crohn's disease related symptoms and inflammation
      symptom control as measured by Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores and plasma and
      stool markers of inflammation. The patient's quality of life will also be assessed as an
      indicator of disease state.

    <description>Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate (SBI) is a specially formulated light-colored protein powder composed of immunoglobulin (IgG) and other serum proteins similar to those found in colostrum and milk. SBI does not contain any milk products such as lactose, casein, or whey. SBI is gluten-free, dye-free, and soy-free. SBI is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and FDA guidelines for medical food ingredients. Two packets (each packet contains 5 g of SBI) BID.</description>
