    <textblock>
      This study assesses the impact of diastolic heart failure on exercise capacity in women who
      have a previous coronary condition. All the participants will go through the same evaluation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that systolic heart failure impacts exercise capacity and quality of
      life, diastolic heart failure however, is not well documented as a condition that reduces
      physical performance.

      To confirm that patients have a diastolic disfunction an echocardiography will be performed,
      this will also yield the left ventricle ejection fraction to confirm the preserved ejection
      fraction heart failure diagnostics.

      Exercise capacity will be assessed using the distance walked on the six-minute walking test,
      performed on a 30m corridor.

      Pulmonary function will be assessed with spirometry and values of forced vital capacity and
      forced expired volume in one second will be recorded and compared to the age-predicted
      values.

      Respiratory strength will be determined by maximal pressure achieved on a respiratory
      manometer.

      Peripheral muscular strength will be assessed with a handheld dynamometer. Knee extension
      strength of the dominant leg will be recorded.

      An echocardiography will be performed to assess systolic and diastolic function and ejection
      fraction.

      Heart autonomic function will be evaluated using a heart rate monitor and a computer software
      to identify the sympathovagal balance.
