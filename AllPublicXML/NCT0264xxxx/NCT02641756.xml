  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to identify and characterise the anatomical component of the
      replication competent HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1) reservoir.

      The investigators hypothesize that the clinically relevant HIV-1 reservoir is hiding in
      various but specific anatomic compartments and is able to rebound when therapy is stopped.

      This reservoir is probably smaller than the HIV-1 reservoir hiding in the blood but could be
      more transcriptional active because of its specific environment, possibly influenced by lower
      concentrations of the antiretroviral therapy.

      The current proposal will, for the first time, identify the source of the viral reservoir by
      phylogenetically backtracking the viral genome of the rebounding virus to the sequences of
      viral DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) in different anatomical compartments. The subsequent
      characterization of the viral reservoir markers (size, integration sites, methylation
      profile, stimulation and inhibition assays) will enable us to understand how this viral
      rebound occurred.

    <description>The participants will undergo in depth sampling under CART to characterise the HIV reservoir in different anatomical compartments.
