    <textblock>
      This research is a Phase II clinical trial, which means it will test the safety and
      effectiveness of Nivolumab. Nivolumab is an antibody (type of human protein) that works to
      stop tumor cells from growing and multiplying by immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is trying to
      have the body's own immune system work against tumor cells.

      Nivolumab has been used in other research studies and information from those other research
      studies suggests that this intervention may help to stop Meningioma cells from growing.
      Nivolumab is FDA approved to treat other types of cancers, but the FDA (the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration) has not yet approved this intervention for this type of cancer.

             required.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to comply with scheduled visits, treatment
             schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study, including disease
             assessment by MRI (or CT), as confirmed by signing a written informed consent
             document.

          -  The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason:

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCPB; defined in Section 3.4) must have a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG)
             within 72 hours of starting study therapy;

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding;

          -  WOCPB must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception from the time
             of enrollment for the duration of treatment with study therapy plus 5 months after the
             last dose of Nivolumab.

          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s)
             of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug plus 7 months after the
             last dose of Nivolumab.

          -  Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP
             on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected
             pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active
             with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective
             methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year when used consistently
             and correctly.

          -  At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of two methods of contraception, with one
             method being highly effective and the other method being either highly effective or
             less effective as listed below:

               -  HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

                    -  Male condoms with spermicide

                    -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive
                       pills, vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs)
                       such as Mirena by WOCBP subjects or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female
                       partners of male subjects participating in the study may use hormone based
                       contraceptives as one of the acceptable methods of contraception since they
                       will not be receiving study drug

                    -  Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
                       ovulation

                    -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

                    -  Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard

                    -  Tubal ligation

                    -  Vasectomy

                    -  Complete Abstinence - Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance
                       of heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for
                       all study drugs. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not required to
                       use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must continue to
                       have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective
                       contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to
                       forego complete abstinence.

               -  LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

                    -  Diaphragm with spermicide

                    -  Cervical cap with spermicide

                    -  Vaginal sponge

                    -  Male Condom without spermicide

                    -  Progestin only pills by WOCBP subjects or male subject's WOCBP partner

                    -  Female Condom - A male and female condom must not be used together

               -  UNACCEPTABLE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

                    -  Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods)

                    -  Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)

                    -  Spermicide only

                    -  Lactation amenorrhea method (LAM)

          -  NOTE: Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are
             exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP participants must still undergo
             pregnancy testing as described.

             potentially curative therapy;

          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis;

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results examples include but are not
             limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

          -  Medical History:

          -  History of intracranial abscess within 6 months prior to start of study therapy;

          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS);

          -  NOTE: HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Nivolumab. Appropriate

          -  Prisoners or participants who are involuntarily incarcerated;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Nivolumab is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with Nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             Nivolumab.
