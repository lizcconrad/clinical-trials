    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential-group study to assess the
      safety and tolerability as well as how the drug (AZD7594) affects the body (pharmacodynamics
      [PD]) and how the body affects the drug (pharmacokinetics [PK]) when AZD7594 is given as
      single and multiple ascending doses once daily by inhalation to healthy male Japanese
      subjects, compared with placebo (non-active drug)

          4. Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent for optional genetic research
             Note: If a subject declines to participate in the genetic component of the study,
             there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the subject. The subject will not be
             excluded from other aspects of the study described in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion
             of drugs.

          3. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of investigational drug administration.

          4. Any contraindication against the use of vagolytic or sympaticomimetic drugs, as judged
             by the investigator.

             urinalysis, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) or lung
             function results at baseline, as judged by the investigator.

         12. Any clinically significant abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the
             resting ECG and any clinically significant abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG, as
             considered by the investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc
             interval changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the
             protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy.

         13. Prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate (HR) using Fridericia's formula (QTcF)

             example, ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation.

         17. Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the investigator.

             20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to
             the first administration of investigational drug or longer if the medication has a
             long half-life.

         25. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing in the US) within 30 days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever
             is longer) of the first administration of investigational drug in this study. The
             period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or 1 month after the last
             visit whichever is the longest.

             Note: Subjects consented and screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous
             phase I study, are not excluded.

         26. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.

         27. Subjects who have previously received AZD7594.

         28. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca or study site employee or their close relatives.

         29. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.

         30. Subjects who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions.

         31. Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator. It is acceptable to

             the Japanese language.

             In addition, any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the
