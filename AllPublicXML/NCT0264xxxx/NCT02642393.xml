  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to determine
      whether oral inosine dosed to moderately elevate serum urate (from â‰¤5.7 mg/dL to 7.1-8.0
      mg/dL) over 2 years slows clinical decline in early PD.

      Clinical decline will be assessed as change in the primary outcome variable of the Movement
      Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), a composite scale
      comprising patient- and clinician-reported outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capsules containing 500 mg of inosine (active drug) or ~500 mg of lactose (placebo) will be
      taken orally up to two capsules three times per day (i.e., up to 3 g/day) for 24 months. In
      the inosine-treated group the number of capsules taken per day will be titrated to serum
      urate levels - measured at trough at study visits no more than three months apart - in order
      to achieve concentrations of 7.1-8.0 mg/dL. Initial dosing will be tailored to individualized
      factors including gender and pretreatment serum urate, and then advanced gradually toward the
      projected target dose. Adjustments in dosing of placebo capsules in the control arm will be
      algorithm-based to match dosing of inosine capsules in the active drug arm.

      Following study drug discontinuation all subjects will be followed during a 3-month wash-out
      period by telephone calls and a final study visit. All study visits after screening will
      include measurement of the primary outcome variable (MDS-UPDRS) and most will include
      secondary outcome variables: adverse events, dose adjustments, disability warranting
      initiation of dopaminergic therapy, Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL),
      39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Schwab &amp; England Activities of Daily
      Living (S&amp;E ADL) scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and orthostatic vital signs.

Analysis of measures that are equally evaluable at the end of both periods (such as proportion of subjects having developed disability warranting dopaminergic therapy), will be conducted as a three-part test: a) of significantly slower worsening during period 1, b) of non-inferior rates of worsening during period 2, and c) of a significant net benefit at the end of period 2. It could provide evidence of disease modification if all three evaluations were favorable.</description>
