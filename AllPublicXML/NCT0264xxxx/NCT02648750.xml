    <textblock>
      This feasibility study evaluates whether it is possible to run a larger scale study to
      investigate the use of a self-management programme with adults who have recently had a
      stroke. Half of the participants will receive support with self-management from stroke
      therapists, while the other half will receive it from rehabilitation assistants.

    <textblock>
      Supporting self-management post-stroke is a key priority in healthcare policy, but not yet
      embedded into the provision of stroke rehabilitation. Barriers to implementation include time
      and resource. The feasibility of using the Bridges Stroke Self-Management Programme within an
      Early Supported Discharge Service and delivery by Rehabilitation Assistants is unknown.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate key trial parameters to inform the protocol of a future
      definitive trial into the effectiveness of Bridges delivered by rehabilitation assistants
      within an Early Supported Discharge Service.

    <description>The Bridges self-management programme is based on self-efficacy principles. It includes a Bridges stroke workbook consisting of stroke survivors' experiences and strategies, with space to record and reflect on personal goals and achievements, which the practitioner will work through with the participant. The practitioner will also used strategies based on key principles of self-management during interactions with patients.</description>
