    <textblock>
      PREVEIL is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm clinical trial to assess the safety and
      functionality of the SurModics drug coated balloon (DCB) in the treatment of subjects with
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) due to de novo stenoses of the femoral and
      popliteal arteries. The trial will enroll up to 15 subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PREVEIL will enroll patients presenting with angiographic evidence of significant stenosis in
      the femoral or popliteal arteries. All enrolled subjects will be treated with the SurVeil
      DCB.
