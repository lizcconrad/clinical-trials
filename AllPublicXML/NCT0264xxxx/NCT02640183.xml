  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of 5% lidocaine 25 mg-prilocaine 25 mg/g
      cream (EMLA®) applied to the uterine cervix for reducing pain during diagnostic hysteroscopy,
      using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, and whether it can replace general anesthesia
      that may be required for some cases of office hysteroscopy.

    <description>All women will be asked to score the pain they experienced during the procedure using a VAS that consists of a 10-cm line scaled from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain and 10 = severe pain). Women will be asked to verbally specify the number that represented their level of perceived pain intensity during the hysteroscopy immediately after the procedure.
After completing the hysteroscopy, women will be asked if they would recommend the procedure to other women, if they had wished to abandon the hysteroscopy, and whether they would repeat the procedure if needed.</description>
