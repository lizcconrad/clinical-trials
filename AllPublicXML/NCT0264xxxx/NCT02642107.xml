  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, most protocols of nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC) of various research bodies such as
      the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group require routine elective irradiation to the
      retropharyngeal area and to levels II-V, and also to the supraclavicular lymph nodal areas
      regardless of the status of nodal metastasis. Previous studies had confirmed that the pattern
      of cervical lymph node metastasis in NPC followed an orderly manner. Retropharyngeal lymph
      nodes (RLNs) and Level II LNs were the most commonly involved, followed by Level III and
      Level V LNs, Level IV LNs, and SCF LNs, and the incidence of LN skip metastasis is rare,
      ranging from 0.5% to 7.9%. It was rare for NPC patients without neck lymph node metastases to
      experience neck failure after elective irradiation to levels II, III and VA. It also
      confirmed that with unilateral LN metastases of higher-level LNs usually spread down
      ipsilateral LNs.Thus, the investigators conduct the non-inferior randomized trial to
      determine the value of elective neck irradiation in NPC with N0-N1.
