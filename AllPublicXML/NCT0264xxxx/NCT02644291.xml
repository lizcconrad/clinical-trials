      This is a safety (Phase 1) trial using mebendazole for recurrent pediatric brain cancers that
      include medulloblastoma and high grade glioma, that are no longing responding to standard
      therapies. The drug mebendazole is an oral drug in a chewable 500 mg orange flavored tablet.
      It is already approved to treat parasitic infections. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the safety and side effects for increasing doses of mebendazole, followed by the
      treatment of an additional 12 patients at the best tolerated dose.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      oral mebendazole in patients with recurrent/progressive pediatric brain tumors and to confirm
      the tolerance of the MTD of oral mebendazole by assessing tolerance in a dose expansion
      cohort. Secondary Objectives of the study include to determine the safety, tolerability and
      toxicity of mebendazole in this patient population, determine the plasma levels of
      mebendazole in this patient population and Determine progression-free and overall survival of
      mebendazole in an extended cohort of patients with treatment refractory pediatric brain
      cancer.

      Mebendazole (MBZ) is a drug developed to treat human helminthic disease and is FDA-approved
      for the treatment of roundworm, common hookworm, American hookworm, pinworm and whipworm. MBZ
      use is well documented and frequently used in tropical countries at higher doses for the
      rarer parasitic infections of the brain.

      We have shown efficacy in preclinical laboratory models of high grade glioma and
      medulloblastoma. Mebendazole therapy demonstrated safety in a phase I clinical trial for
      adults with high grade gliomas such as glioblastoma. This trial completed the maximum
      approved enrollment of 24 patients treated with mebendazole, with high doses consistent with
      dosing published for severe parasitic infections.

      Laboratory studies indicate that mebendazole enters the brain and brain tumors at
      concentrations that may be effective for a combination of anti-cancer mechanisms. In animal
      models of brain cancer evidence suggest that mebendazole can prevent cell proliferation by
      interfering with tubulin formation, and it may prevent the formation of new abnormal blood
      vessels that feed tumor growth.

      The patients for this experimental trial are those between the age of 1 to 21 with the
      diagnosis of medulloblastoma, or high grade glioma, where the tumor has resumed growth or
      continued to grow despite standard medical therapy. High grade glioma are those with a World
      Health Organization (WHO) grade of III or IV. It includes diagnosis of pediatric
      glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Patients who have
      failed other forms of experimental therapy may also be eligible for this trial.

      Mebendazole is provided at no cost in the form of a chewable 500 mg tablets, recommended to
      be taken three times daily with meals or food. The pill can be chewed after meals, or ground
      up to be mixed with food or drink. It has a mild orange flavor that is similar in consistency
      to an antacid tablet.

      Although side effects are rare and the vast majority are reversible, they include stomach
      upset, decreased blood count, and elevated liver enzymes due to inflammation.

      The main additional procedure beyond taking this drug, is that patients are requested to
      consent to up to three additional blood draws to check the blood (serum) levels of the drug
      to ensure it is being absorbed at sufficient doses.

      Patients can continue to receive the drug as long as in the attending physicians opinion the
      therapy is not causing any severe side effects, and there is no clear indication that the
      patient will not respond to mebendazole therapy. Patients can withdraw from this trial at any
      time for any reason, and may be eligible for other experimental therapies afterwards.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a confirmed recurrent/progressive brain malignancy that have failed
             at least one prior treatment regimen.

          2. Age for inclusion in this trial at time of patient enrollment is ≥ 1 year, and up to
             21 years (prior to the 22nd birthday) with any of the recurrent medulloblastoma or
             recurrent high grade glioma may be consented and treated under this protocol. Patients
             who turn 22 during the course of the trial will continue to be treated.

          3. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) &gt; 50% for patients ≥10 years of age. Lansky score of
             ≥ 50 for children &lt; 10 years of age.

          4. Life expectancy greater than 10 weeks.

          5. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000 cells per microliter

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 750 cells per microliter

               -  Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells per microliter

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper
                  limit of normal

               -  Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR

               -  Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 for patients with creatinine &gt; 1.5 x
                  upper limit of normal

          6. The effects of mebendazole on the developing human fetus are unknown. In rats there is
             evidence of a teratogenic effect, although there is no evidence of adverse effect from
             women accidently taking mebendazole (at lower doses) during pregnancy. For this
             reason, women of child-bearing potential should agree to use birth control while
             taking mebendazole if there is a reasonable risk of pregnancy. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          7. Ability for patient (and if applicable parent or legal guardian) understand and the
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document, or for a parent or legal
             guardian to give assent for those cases where a very young patient is unable to
             understand or sign the consent.

          8. For the patient or parent/legal guardian to be able to comply with treatment plan,
             study procedures and follow-up examinations.

          9. Failed any previous front line standard of care therapy that is currently used for the
             patient's initial diagnosis.

         10. Ability to swallow pills, or liquid formulation and for patient or parent/legal
             guardian to keep an accurate medication record.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients who have known allergy to mebendazole.

        2 Patients who have previously had a severe side effect, such as agranulocytosis and
        neutropenia, in conjunction with previous mebendazole or benzimidazole class drug for a
        parasitic infection.

        3 Patients who are taking metronidazole and cannot be safely moved to a different
        antibiotic greater than 7 days prior to starting mebendazole therapy. Metronidazole and
        mebendazole in combination have been associated with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic
        Epidermal Necrolysis in a case report.

        4 Patients who have previously taken mebendazole as part of any experimental anti-cancer
        protocol, and have failed this therapy.

        5 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
        pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, chronic hepatitis, acute hepatitis, or psychiatric
        illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements.

        6 Pregnant women are excluded because mebendazole is a Class C agent with the potential for
        teratogenic effects. Because it is not known if mebendazole is excreted in breast milk,
        breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with mebendazole.

        7 Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen or
        hepatitis C positive; or with a history of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis.

        8 Patients with a history of any medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
        that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risks associated with the study
        participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the
        interpretation of the results.

        9 Patients who are not available for follow-up assessments or unable to comply with study
        requirements.
