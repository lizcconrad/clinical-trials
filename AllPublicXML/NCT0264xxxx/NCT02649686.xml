    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of durvalumab that can be tolerated
      without causing very severe side effects when receiving standard treatment and to see what
      effects the study drug has on this type of cancer.

      The researchers doing this study are also interested in looking for markers that will help
      predict which patients are most likely to be helped by durvalumab when receiving standard
      treatment and what effects durvalumab has on this type of cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this type of disease at this point is to receive a drug
      called trastuzumab that targets the HER-2 receptor. Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many
      types of cancer. This drug is an antibody and laboratory tests show that it works by allowing
      the immune system to detect your cancer and reactivating the immune response. This may help
      to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has been shown
      to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it
      is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone.

      The use of durvalumab when receiving standard treatment is being studied because it is
      thought that one way of over-coming resistance to the standard therapy is to add a drug that
      activates the immune system, as durvalumab has been shown to do, thus &quot;re-sensitizing&quot; immune
      function to kill cancer cells.

             the study. Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have
             the document signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be
             provided with a full explanation of the study before consent is requested.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)
             placed on patients being considered for this trial.

             of prednisone 10mg).

             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc., within the past 2 years prior to the start of
             treatment. The following are exceptions to this criterion: patients with vitiligo or
             alopecia, Graves' disease, hypothyroidism (e.g. following Hashimoto syndrome) stable
             on hormone replacement, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past
             2 years).

          -  History of primary immunodeficiency, history of organ transplant that requires
             therapeutic immunosuppression and the use of immunosuppressive agents within 28 days

             from other immune therapy (NOTE: Intranasal/inhaled corticosteroids or systemic
             steroids that do not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose of an
             alternative corticosteroid are permissible.)

             and/or have symptomatic cardiac dysfunction (uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year or
             cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication, history of 2nd or 3rd degree

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy
             test (urine or serum) proven negative within 14 days prior to registration. If test is
             positive, pregnancy testing may then include an ultrasound to rule-out pregnancy if a
             false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is
             high and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour production of hCG,
             as seen with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if an ultrasound is
             negative for pregnancy.
