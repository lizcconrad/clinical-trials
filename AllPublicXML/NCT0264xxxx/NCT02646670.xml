      The purpose of this study in to compare the efficacy of treatment of diabetic macular edema
      (DME) using Ranibizumab (Lucenti®), Aflibercept (Eylea®) and Aflibercept (Eylea®) plus
      Ranibizumab (Lucentis®).

      It is a randomized clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of the combination of two
      substances currently used in the treatment of DME. Will be allocated in different four groups
      randomly pacients who receive treatment with intravitreal injections of ranibizumab,
      aflibercept or a combination of aflibercept and ranibizumab.

      Interventions will be carried out with intravitreal injections in patients with formal
      indications of diabetic macular edema treatment previously assessed with complete eye
      examination in Goiania Eye Institute(Instituto de Olhos de Goiânia)

      Patients will be divided into four groups:

        -  In the first group will be held three applications of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 ml,
           with one application every month and follow up with Optical Coherence Tomography on days
           1, 3, 5, 10 and 30 following the application.

        -  In the second group will be held three applications of Intravitreal Aflibercept 0.1 ml,
           with one application each month followed by monitoring with Optical Coherence Tomography
           on days 1, 3, 5, 10 and 30 subsequent

        -  The third group will be held two applications of Ranibizumab 0.1 ml interspersed with
           one application of Aflibercept 0.1 ml in the second month and subsequent evaluation with
           Optical Coherence Tomography on days 1, 3, 5, 10 and 30.

        -  In the fourth group will be held two applications of 0.1 ml Aflibercept interspersed
           with one application of Ranibizumab 0.1 ml in the second month and subsequent evaluation
           with Optical Coherence Tomography on days 1, 3, 5, 10 and 30.

    <description>Were evaluated the therapy with two different drugs used in diabetic retinopathy, and for this were separated twenty patients in four groups:
First group will be held three applications of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 ml, and follow up with OCT.
Second group will be held three applications of Intravitreal Aflibercept 0.1 ml, and followed by monitoring with OCT.
Third group will be held two applications of 0.1 ml Aflibercept interspersed with one application of Ranibizumab 0.1 ml in the second month and subsequent evaluation with OCT.
Fourth group will be held two applications of Ranibizumab 0.1 ml interspersed with one application of Aflibercept 0.1 ml in the second month and subsequent evaluation with OCT.
In all this groups will be observe the time of reduction of macular edema in the days 1, 3, 5, 10 and 30.</description>
