  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has been recommended as the standard preoperative treatment for
      locally advanced rectal cancer. However, preoperative radiotherapy increases the risk of
      bowel dysfunction after sphincter-preserving surgery, for which patients suffer from
      incontinence, urgency, and unpredictability defecation problems. Furthermore, preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy is a potential risk factor of anastomotic leakage and stenosis after rectal
      cancer surgery.

      Unhealthy anastomosis, with both ends of injured bowel segments after pelvic radiation, is a
      major concern. When conventional surgical procedures would retain part of sigmoid colon that
      has been included in the radiation target, sphincter-preserving surgery with proximally
      extended resection margin could provide an intact proximal colon limb for the anastomosis.

      It is not known yet whether proximally extended resection improves postoperative bowel
      function or anastomotic integrity for patients with rectal cancer after neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy. The proposed study will compare sphincter-preserving surgery with and
      without proximally extended resection margin, to observe the postoperative bowel function and
      incidence of anastomotic complication. This study will examine a new surgical strategy, which
      potentially benefits the patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
