      This is an open-label, multicenter, prospective pilot study assessing the efficacy and safety
      of Bellafill for correction of distensible atrophic acne scars in the full facial area. All
      enrolled subjects will receive initial treatment with Bellafill, as well as touch-up
      treatments (if necessary to achieve optimal correction). Subjects will be evaluated at
      Screening (Month -1), Day 0 (Baseline) Month 1, Month 4, and Month 7.

    <description>Correctable acne scars will be individually identified and only scars that the Investigator determines to be correctable will receive study treatment. All eligible scars within the treatment area will be treated. Bellafill will be injected using a standard tunneling technique whereby the filler is injected in a retrograde manner utilizing several passes until the scar reaches a desired level of correction. A touch-up treatment is allowed if additional treatment is required to achieve optimal correction.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient, male or female subjects of any race, 21 years of age or older. Female
             subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at
             Baseline and practice a reliable method of contraception throughout the study.

          -  Negative response to the Bellafill Skin Test.

          -  Presence of ≥4 distensible atrophic acne scars (treatment scars) in in the facial
             area.

          -  Subject desires correction of his/her atrophic acne scarring.

          -  All Fitzpatrick skin types are eligible.

          -  Willing to withhold additional aesthetic therapies to the proposed treatment area
             (e.g., other soft tissue fillers such as hyaluronic acid, and/or any resurfacing
             procedures (as described in Protocol Section 5.4) for the duration of the study.

          -  Able to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits, as
             assessed by the Investigator.

          -  Sign an IRB-approved Informed Consent Form, Photographic Release Form, and the
             Authorization for Use and release of Health and Research Study Information (HIPAA)
             Form prior to any study-related procedures being performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects that are pregnant (positive urine pregnancy test), breast-feeding, or
             who are of childbearing potential and not practicing a reliable method of birth
             control.

          -  Undergone facial treatments with any prohibited treatment/procedures and/or use of any
             other prohibited treatment/procedure within certain time periods as listed in Protocol
             Section 5.4.

          -  Excisional facial surgery (such as Blepharoplasty, Face Lift, Rhinoplasty) of the face
             less than 6 months prior to study enrollment or plans for facial surgery during the
             study.

          -  History of bleeding disorders.

          -  Presence of any skin pathology or condition that could interfere with the evaluation
             of the treatment areas, worsen due to the proposed treatment or require interfering
             topical, systemic or surgical therapy.

          -  Recent or current history of inflammatory skin disease, infection,
             cancerous/pre-cancerous lesion, unhealed wound or clinically significant acne in the
             proposed treatment areas. Clinically significant acne is defined as a patient whom has
             ≥3 active inflammatory acne lesions in the treatment areas.

          -  History of systemic granulomatous diseases active or inactive (e.g., Sarcoid,
             Wegeners, TB) or connective tissue diseases (e.g., lupus, dermatomyositis).

          -  Hypertrophic acne scars, any evidence of keloid scarring in the treatment area.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to any of the components of the
             study device (including lidocaine or any amide-based anesthetic), or has a history of
             allergies to any bovine collagen products, including but not limited to injectable
             collagen, collagen implants, hemostatic sponges, and collagen-based sutures.

          -  Undergone or be planning to undergo desensitization injections to meat products.

          -  Unable to communicate or cooperate with the Investigator due to a language barrier
             (non-English speaking), poor mental development, or impaired cerebral function.

          -  Evidence of alcohol or drug abuse (Investigator opinion), or history of poor
             cooperation, non-compliance with medical treatment, or unreliability.

          -  Use of an investigational device, biologic or drug in the past 30 days, or be
             currently participating in an experimental drug, biologic or device trial.

          -  Exhibits additional physical attributes which prevent the assessment or treatment of
             the atrophic scars, as judged by the Investigator, such as excessive hair, traumatic
             or surgical scars, excessive hyperpigmentation in the treatment area, etc.

          -  Has a condition or be in a situation that, in the Investigator's opinion, may put the
             subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with the subject's participation in the study.

          -  An employee (or a relative of an employee) of the Investigator, Sponsor or
