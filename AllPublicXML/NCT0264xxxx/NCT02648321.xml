      The current study aims to investigate the beneficial effect of motivational intervention in
      promoting exercise habit in patients with psychosis. Outpatients will be recruited and will
      be randomized to a 12-week motivational intervention program. They will be assessed for their
      clinical symptoms, cognitive function, physical fitness, and quality of life. All patients
      will have cognitive function assessments at baseline, 12 weeks after the completion of the
      program and 6 months. The primary hypothesis of the current study is that motivational
      intervention can help patient to develop exercise habit in patients with early psychosis.

    <description>Motivational Interviewing is a patient-centered, tailored counselling intervention for exercise, through which patients' motives to change are identified. Personal ideas and ambivalence are explored. The discrepancies between the present behavior and the patient's own future goals are amplified. The patient's intrinsic motivation for change is increased through the process.</description>
