      The purpose of the study is to determine if patients wearing a CAM walker boot have a change
      in weight compared to patients who wear a CAM boot and are provided nutritional and upper
      body exercise information.

      The study objectives are: (1) Determine if patients wearing a CAM (Controlled Ankle Movement)
      walker boot have a change in weight compared to patients who wear a CAM boot and are provided
      nutritional and upper body exercises (gender appropriate) information at the time the CAM
      boot is dispensed; and (2) Determine, if weight is gained or lost, the average amount
      gained/lost over the treatment period.

    <description>Patients are prescribed CAM boot and provided nutritional and upper body exercise counseling at the time the CAM boot is dispensed. Patients will be given a diary to complete their daily meal intake (optional), seated upper body physical exercise guidelines and asked to perform them three days per week and each exercise three times per session if able. They will be asked to record number of hours CAM boot is worn daily in the Patient Diary, if one is utilized. Albumin lab test will be drawn and their height and weight measured.</description>
