    <textblock>
      There is a possible implication of sleep apnea syndrome via night-time intermittent hypoxemia
      in perturbation of quality of life and tumour progression to patients with a bronchial
      cancer.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate this possibility with the help of a night record of sleep
      and quality of life questionnaires.
