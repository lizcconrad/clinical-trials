    <textblock>
      Non-parous women with a live singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation past 34 gestational
      weeks will be randomized to lateral episiotomy or no episiotomy when operative vaginal
      delivery by vacuum extraction is indicated. Primary outcome is clinically diagnosed obstetric
      anal sphincter injury (OASIS) of any degree.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has started at Danderyd Hospital. Danderyd Hospital is a large teaching hospital
      affiliated to the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. Danderyd Hospital attends
      approximately 7 000 deliveries annually, of which 330 are vacuum extractions in non-parous
      women. Other hospitals in Stockholm County and other parts of Sweden are invited to
      participate in the study.

      Informed consent is collected from non-parous women with a singelton, live fetus in cephalic
      presentation, with a planned vaginal delivery and without previous gynecological surgery due
      to incontinence or prolapse. Women can be approached at any time from gestational week 25
      until delivery, unless they are in severe pain or discomfort, there is not enough time to
      consider the information, or there is a language barrier. The informed consent form is kept
      at the receiving research department and a note of consent/no consent is made in the
      obstetrical medical file, which pops up every time the file is opened.

      At indication for vacuum extraction, the patient's consent is confirmed verbally and
      allocation is made by opaque envelopes on the vacuum extraction equipment mobile cart.
      Randomization is performed 1:1 in blocks of 4 by an external organization (Karolinska Trial
      Alliance).

      Lateral episiotomy is performed according to the intervention description. Total sample size
      has been calculated to 1400 women, if a reduction in OASIS prevalence from today's 12.2% to
      7.7% in operative vaginal deliveries is to be detected (estimated drop-out rate 3% for the
      primary outcome). The women will be recruited over a maximum of 3 years. An interim analysis
      will be performed after 350 randomized women to each arm, since a 50% reduction to less than
      6.1% sphincter tears could be detected with less than 5% risk of a type-1 error at this
      sample size. If such a reduction is seen, the study will be closed.

      Data is collected prospectively through Case Record Forms and the obstetrical medical file
      Obstetrix (Cerner Sverige AB), which covers approximately 98% of deliveries with complete
      data, and the Swedish Pregnancy Register covering the whole of Sweden from 2015 as well as
      the (optional) Swedish Obstetrical Tear Register, which Danderyd Hospital is a part of since
      2014. From the Obstetrical Tear Register, questionnaires are sent out in paper form or
      electronically to patients with a diagnosed anal sphincter tear at delivery, 8 weeks and 12
      months after delivery. The same questionnaires is sent out electronically in the follow-up of
      the study participants regardless of randomization or result (sphincter tear or not). In
      addition, the participants will be sent questionnaires regarding birth satisfaction (BSS-R
      and CEQ 2.0) at 8 weeks after delivery and questionnaires regarding sexual function (FSFI and
      FSDS) and quality of life (Euro-QoL-5D) at delivery and after 12 months.

      A follow-up from registers regarding mode of delivery and prevalence of episiotomy and OASIS
      in subsequent births will be performed at 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years after the index
      birth.
