      Background:

      Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common and potentially fatal cause of acute
      respiratory distress that requires immediate treatment in emergency department. The mortality
      rates are as high as 20% after discharge. Currently, furosemide is the most commonly used
      medicine in emergency department for ADHF. Although nitrate was proved to generate similar
      effect when compared to furosemide, less than 30% of patients received nitrates. This
      practice happens not only in Hong Kong, but also all around the world. Moreover, there is
      limited evidence to support a difference in ADHF patients receiving intravenous nitrate
      vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions.

      The aims of the study are:

        1. To monitor the changes in concentration of cardiac biomarkers, VAS dyspnoea score and
           cardiac output before and after treatment of furosemide, isosorbide dinitrate or both.

        2. To investigate whether the changes in concentration of cardiac biomarkers, VAS dyspnoea
           score and cardiac output before and after treatment is associated with the change in
           length of hospital stay.

        3. To investigate whether combination treatment with intravenous furosemide and isosorbide
           dinitrate in patients with HF reduces VAS dyspnoea score, in-hospital mortality, length
           of hospital stay and number of readmission to a higher extend than do either medication
           alone.

        4. To evaluate the prognostic values of novel cardiac biomarkers on 7-day, 14-day, 30-day
           and 6-month mortality and readmission.

      Design:

      This single-blinded randomized controlled study will be conducted in the Prince of Wales
      Hospital in Hong Kong.

      Setting and Subjects:

      Patients with dyspnoea will be screened and recruited from adult patients attending the
      emergency department at the Prince of Wales Hospital.

      Interventions:

      Patients with acute decompensated heart failure will be randomly treated with intravenous
      furosemide, isosorbide dinitrate or both. Level of dyspnoea, multi-biomarker and haemodynamic
      parameters will be measured before and after treatment.

      Outcomes:

      The primary outcome is the change in VAS dyspnoea score after treatment of furosemide,
      isosorbide dinitrate or both. The secondary outcomes are the changes in concentration of
      biomarkers and cardiac output, the number of in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay,
      7-day and 30-day and 6-month mortality and readmission.

      Definitions:

      Heart failure can be defined as an abnormality of cardiac structure or function leading to
      failure of the heart to deliver oxygen at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the
      metabolizing tissues, despite normal filling pressures (or only at the expense of increased
      filling pressures).

      Acute decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF), is defined according to Framingham criteria as a
      change in symptoms and signs in the context of heart failure. For this study we define this
      as an acute change in symptoms and signs within the previous 24 hours.

      In the New York Heart Association classification (NYHA), Class I: no limitation is
      experienced in any activities; there are no symptoms from ordinary activities.; Class II:
      slight, mild limitation of activity; the patient is comfortable at rest or with mild
      exertion.; Class III: marked limitation of any activity; the patient is comfortable only at
      rest.; Class IV: any physical activity brings on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest.

    <description>Patients will be asked to indicate their status of dyspnoea using a visual analogue scale (VAS). They will be asked to make a mark on a 100 mm uncalibrated horizontal line in sitting (patients head at â‰¥ 600 relative to horizontal) and supine positions. The mark will be converted to a score (0-100 points) by measuring the distance from the left end. A VAS dyspnoea score of 0 corresponds to the patient's subjective feeling of &quot;I can breathe normally&quot; and a score of 100 represent to &quot;I cannot breathe at all&quot;.</description>

    <description>Furosemide is the most commonly used medication for treatment of heart failure. It causes a direct vasodilator effect shortly after administration, followed by diuresis induction. However, furosemide also activates both the sympathetic and the renin angiotensin systems, causing a rise in peripheral resistance.</description>

    <description>Isosorbide dinitrate is a vasodilator which is also well-known for treating acute decompensated heart failure. It induces acute venodilatation at low dose and arteries dilation when gradually increasing the dose. The effect peaks 5 min after administration.</description>
