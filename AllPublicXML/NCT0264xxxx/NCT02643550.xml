    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate in a 3 +3 design, the safety of escalating doses
      of IPH2201 given IV in combination with cetuximab in patients who have received prior
      systemic regimen(s) for recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck (SCCHN). A cohort expansion will evaluate antitumor activity of the combination.
