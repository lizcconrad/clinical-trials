    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the increased prevalence of myopia among patients
      in different periods in an ophthalmologic hospital in Goiania. There has been an increase of
      myopia prevalence around the world especially in some Asian countries. The investigators
      intend to analyze if this growing tendency is also present in our hospital, and if it exist
      how much is this growth.

      There were compared data collected in two scientific studies carried out in the same
      ophthalmologic hospital in different periods of time, they evaluated among other factors, the
      refractive errors of the participants, from this data there were compared the percentage of
      patients with myopia between the two studies. And analysed how much was the grown of myopia

    <description>Comparison of the prevalence of myopia from data collected in two scientific studies carried out in the same ophthalmologic hospital in different periods of time, that evaluated among other factors the refractive errors of the participants.
In the first study were examined 16.806 students from municipal schools of Goiania during the period October 1995 to December 2000. In the second study there were selected 165 children from 2 to 14 years old who were referred to the Institute of Goiânia eyes, by the &quot;Projeto Boa Visão&quot; within the school environment. The &quot;Projeto Boa Visão&quot; aims to identify vision problems related to refraction.</description>
