  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster (clinic level) randomized pragmatic trial to compare the
      effectiveness of MA Health Coaching (MAC) delivered by non-clinician primary care staff
      (i.e., MAs) versus usual care (UC) in improving diabetes clinical control among individuals
      with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in the primary care environments of two distinct, yet
      representative healthcare systems in San Diego County: Neighborhood Healthcare (a San Diego
      County FQHC system and designated Patient-Centered Medical Home, serving predominantly ethnic
      minority, low income patients) and Scripps (a large, non-profit, private insurance-based
      health system, serving predominantly Caucasian, middle-to-higher income patients). Six
      hundred patients at intervention (n=2; patient N=300) and control (n=2; patient N=300)
      clinics, aged 18 and older, with T2DM, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 8.0%, and/or
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 100 mg/dL, and/or systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      ≥ 140 within the last 60 days, will be identified and enrolled using electronic health
      records (EHRs). Primary clinical outcomes of HbA1c, LDL-C, and SBP assessed as part of
      quarterly (or annual, for LDL-C), standard-of-care medical visits will be extracted from EHRs
      over 12 months. Changes in patient-reported behavioral (diabetes self-care) and psychosocial
      (quality of life, patient activation) outcomes will be evaluated via telephone assessment in
      a subset of intervention and control (N=300 total) participants at baseline, month 6, and
      month 12. A thorough process evaluation will be conducted to establish reach,
      acceptability/feasibility, adoption/maintenance, and fidelity of the intervention and will
      integrate patient, MA, and primary care provider perspectives. Cost-effectiveness will also
      be examined from the health system perspective. Principles of community engaged research were
      incorporated in intervention and study planning and will be sustained throughout the research
      period.
