  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the introduction of early ultrasonography
      screening will change the diagnostic spectrum of soft tissue shoulder injuries in patients
      aged forty years or more. We also want to study whether certain physical tests will be able
      to predict or rule out full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff (shoulder tendons) in the
      acute phase. Another purpose is to explore the course of soft tissue shoulder injuries over a
      year, as well as to compare the results to studies on the prevalence of rotator cuff
      full-thickness tears.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tear</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 21 days of acute shoulder injury</time_frame>
    <description>To explore the number of acute traumatic full-thickness tears in soft tissue injuries in the â‰¥ 40 population, and whether structured clinical examination is an adequate screening tool</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one year of shoulder injury</time_frame>
    <description>The OSS is a patient reported outcome score consisting of 12 items. It was developed for use in assessing the outcome of shoulder surgery, but is also used to assess non-surgical interventions. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, and the overall scores ranges from 0 to 48. The request for a licence to use the score was approved by Isis Outcomes on July 2nd 2015.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one year of shoulder injury</time_frame>
    <description>QuickDASH is a patient reported outcome score consisting 11 of the original 30 items of the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) questionnaire. Each item has five options, and the total score ranges from 0 - 100. The Norwegian translation used in the study is available at http://dash.iwh.on.ca/system/files/translations/QuickDASH_Norwegian.pdf</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo structured clinical examination and ultrasonography of both shoulders on the day of inclusion. They also fill out an injury registration form, Oxford Shoulder Score and QuickDASH. Follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months will be identical, but without ultrasonography and injury registration form.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria, all of the following:

          -  patient at Section for Orthopaedic Emergency, Oslo University Hospital

          -  living in the municipality of Oslo

          -  acute injury

          -  sudden onset of symptoms

          -  International Classification of Diseases (ICD) -10 S4-diagnosis (except injuries of
             middle and distal third of humerus and related soft tissue)

             dislocation without fracture

          -  turns up for follow-up appointment within 21 days of injury

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients that are incapable of giving and or receiving adequate information, or that
             cannot undergo a normal clinical investigation, due to for example language problems,
             level of consciousness, drugs, mental or emotional status or other

             months before the injury

          -  other serious disease such as cancer, rheumatic disorders, haematological,
             neurological, endocrinological or gastrointestinal disease that according to the
             doctor`s best clinical judgement makes participation or follow-up difficult

          -  does not want to participate
