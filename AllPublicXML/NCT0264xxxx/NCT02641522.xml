  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of siltuximab on immune cell functions
      in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D).

  <detailed_description>

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single center,
      non-randomized (patients are not assigned by chance to treatment groups), Mechanistic Study
      (a study that focuses on the biologic activity of the drug, rather than on disease
      treatment). Up to 10 patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) will be enrolled in the study.
      Participants will receive a single dose of siltuximab and blood samples will be obtained a
      total of 6 times until 12 weeks after dosing. Cells will be isolated from the blood samples
      and used to measure specific activities of cells in the immune system. Safety evaluations for
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination will be
      performed throughout the study. The end of study is the date of the last assessment for the
      last patient.

             within 10 days of the onset of exogenous insulin therapy; IA-2; ZnT8

          2. Peak stimulated C-peptide level ≥ 0.1 pmol/mL following a mixed meal tolerance test
             (MMTT) conducted within 60 days of enrollment

          3. Females of child-bearing potential must be willing to use effective birth control and
             refrain from donating eggs for the purposes of assisted reproduction for duration of
             study.

          4. A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (β-human chorionic
             gonadotropin [β-hCG]) or urine pregnancy test at screening and prior to dosing.

          5. During the study, and for 3 months after receiving the study agent, a woman must agree
             to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction.

          6. Willing and able to give informed consent for participation.
