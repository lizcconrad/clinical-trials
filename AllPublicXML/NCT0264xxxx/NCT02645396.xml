      This study will be conducted at several Maternal and Child Health Hospitals (MCHHs) in China
      and the research activities will be integrated with routine medical services during pregnancy
      at the study sites.The investigators will build a perspective cohort study enrolling ~8000
      pregnant women elder than 18 and following up their newborns at specific MCHHs.As a first
      step, The investigators will work with these hospitals to recruit the subjects. After being
      informed, the participants' remaining blood and urine samples (after their medical
      examinations) at their early, medium and late stages of pregnancy will be collected , and
      their newborns' urine and saliva samples will be collected after delivery. The aim of this
      study is to enroll 5000 series mother-newborns.

        This study will enroll ~8000 pregnant women aged 18 years and above at MCHHs. Pregnant
        women who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. All inclusion and
        exclusion criteria will be reviewed by investigators or qualified designees to ensure that
        each subject is qualified for the study. In general, those whose newborns (including early
        birth, any congenital anomaly) are successfully followed up remain in the study population.
        However, those with adverse pregnancy outcomes captured in the MCHHs, such as abortion and
        still birth, etc., will also be the investigators' subjects even though we cannot have
        newborns' urine/saliva samples.
