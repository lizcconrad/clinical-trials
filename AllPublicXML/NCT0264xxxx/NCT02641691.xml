    <description>Radiotherapy will consist of five fractions, delivered once daily, to a total dose of 25Gy at 5 Gy per fraction.
An optional concomitant boost may be delivered to the primary tumor of 1-2 Gy per day (30-35 Gy to tumor total). If a boost is given then the maximum allowed dose to small bowel is 25 Gy.
Chemotherapy should begin two weeks (9-12 working days) after completion of radiotherapy.
Oxaliplatin will be given intravenous (IV) over 2 hours on Day 1 every 14 days for a maximum of 6 cycles.
Leucovorin will be given IV over 2 hours on Day 1 every 14 days for a maximum of 6 cycles.
5-FU bolus will given IV push on Day 1 every 14 days for a maximum of 6 cycles.
5-FU infusion will be given continuous IV on Day 1 over 46 hours every 14 days for a maximum of 6 cycles.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of biopsy proven stage I-IIIB (cT1-3, N0-1, M0) adenocarcinoma of the
             rectum; staging must also be based on multidisciplinary evaluation including MRI
             and/or endorectal ultrasound

          -  Tumor ≤ 12 cm from anal verge as determined by MRI or endoscopy

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Adequate bone marrow function defined as:

               -  ANC &gt; 1,500 cells/mm3

               -  Hgb &gt; 8 g/dl

               -  platelets &gt;100,000 cells/mm3

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB-approved written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No visible tumor present

          -  Prior chemotherapy or extirpative surgery for rectal cancer.

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 3 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or prostate cancer treated without radiotherapy.

          -  Currently receiving any investigational agents.

          -  A history of allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to 5FU, oxaliplatin, or leucovorin.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity and on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study drugs. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
