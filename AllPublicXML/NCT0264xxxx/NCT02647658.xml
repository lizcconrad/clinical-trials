  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem among US adults. Initial episodes tend to be
      self-limited (&quot;acute&quot;), but some people can progress to a state of persistent pain. Often
      termed &quot;chronic&quot; LBP (cLBP), this condition can cause prolonged difficulty with most daily
      activities, including job performance. Most patients see chiropractors or primary care
      physicians (PCPs) for initial episodes of LBP. This study will compare two approaches for
      preventing patients with acute LBP (aLBP) from developing cLBP. Both treatments can be
      delivered in an outpatient PCP setting. The first approach is to provide PCPs with
      information regarding a patient's risk of transitioning from aLBP to cLBP and to encourage
      PCPs to treat patients according to accepted clinical guidelines. The second approach is to
      provide the same risk information and have PCPs team up with physical therapists to deliver
      psychologically-informed physical therapy (PIPT) for those patients determined to be at high
      risk for transitioning to cLBP. PIPT is designed to help patients identify and overcome
      physical and psychological barriers to recovery. The 3,000 patients expected to be recruited
      from five regional sites (Pittsburgh, PA; Boston, MA; Baltimore, MD; Charleston, SC; and Salt
      Lake City, UT) will start the study when their LBP is in an acute phase. The study's primary
      aims are to compare the proportions of cLBP and measures of functional ability between the
      two groups at 6 months. Secondary aims are to compare these outcomes between the two groups
      at 12 months and measure the number of low back-related x-rays, MRIs, surgeries, and other
      medical procedures during the follow-up period. The same outcomes will be assessed for an
      observational cohort of 9,000 patients with aLBP at low to medium risk for transitioning to
      cLBP across the 5 sites. This study was designed with input from a variety of national and
      local stakeholders, including patients with LBP, providers, payers, professional
      organizations, purchasers, and policy representatives.
