      Presepsin (formerly CD14), is a glycoprotein receptor occurring at the surface of
      monocytes/macrophages. CD14 binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) complexes and LPS binding
      protein (LPB), which triggers the activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), resulting in the
      production of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines. Following Presepsin activation by
      bacterial products, the CD14 complex is released in the circulation as its soluble form
      (sCD14), which in turn is cleaved by a plasma protease to generate a sCD14 fragment called
      sCD14-subtype (sCD14- ST). Plasma levels of sCD14 can be measured using an automated
      chemo-luminescent assay (PATHFAST).

      Severe sepsis and septic shock represent major challenges of modern intensive care medicine,
      and still recently published international guidelines demand ongoing research about the
      pathophysiology, diagnostics and treatment. Currently, the diagnosis of sepsis is based on
      the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the presence of a
      known infection. However, non-infectious SIRS associated with acute tissue injury and innate
      immune activation can induce clinical syndromes analogous to sepsis, including multiple
      trauma, pancreatitis, burns, and autoimmune diseases.

      Within the field of infectious diseases, a biomarker may be used for identifying a high risk
      group or predisposing condition, as an aid to identification of the disease, or to direct
      therapy and stratify patients according to their specific risk factors, and/or as an aid to
      therapeutic management in order to avoid relapse of infection. Within the recent years,
      dozens of potential biomarkers of infection have been described. The diagnostic performance
      of biomarkers is usually measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and by likelihood
      ratios and area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves.

      Recently, several researches devolved their interest in discovering pathways involved in the
      innate immunity. Mediators involved in the recognition and elimination of bacterial
      endotoxins have been identified as new candidate biomarkers of sepsis, namely
      lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and soluble fractions of the membrane cluster of
      differentiation 14 (mCD14). Membrane CD14 is a multifunctional
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein (cell surface glycoprotein),
      constitutively expressed by various cells, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils,
      etc. CD14 is a pattern recognition receptor for bacterial molecules, namely
      lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria and peptidoglycans together with
      lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria. CD14 is crucial in activating the toll-like
      receptor 4 (TLR4)-specific proinflammatory signaling cascade and ultimately, initiating the
      inflammatory reaction against invading microorganisms. In the course of inflammatory
      reaction, plasma protease activity generates soluble CD14 fragments (sCD14), presepsin.

    <measure>Prognostic value of presepsin</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary reports suggest that levels of presepsin are significantly higher in septic patients than in healthy individuals. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of presepsin compared to other inflammatory markers in children with SIRS and suspected sepsis or septic shock. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will performed for presepsin and compared to ROC curve analysis of current available infection biomarkers.</description>

    <measure>Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sepsis mortality in children remains high despite advances in diagnosis and treatment. Early identification and risk stratification is a key point in the triage of patients with sepsis. The aim of the study is identifying and testing of presepsin with improved sensitivity and specifity for the presence of sepsis, and prediction of morbidity and mortality.</description>
