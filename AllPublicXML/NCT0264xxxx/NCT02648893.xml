  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a multiple food crops basket (containing four either biofortified or
      commercially-available food crops) will be fed to young children in Mumbai, Maharashtra,
      India over a period of nine months to measure growth, cognitive changes, and immune function
      in comparison to children receiving non-biofortified crops.

      Potentially, lactating women (their mothers) will also be included in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron, zinc, and vitamin A deficiency remain a major worldwide public health problem
      especially in developing countries such as India. In this randomized study, 200 children aged
      6-24 months (and potentially their lactating mothers) from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India will be
      fed a multiple food crops basket (containing either four biofortified or
      commercially-available food crops) three times per day, six days per week, for nine months.
      The goal of this study is to examine the effects of the biofortified multiple food crops
      basket on immune function, growth, and cognitive function in this age group. The key outcome
      measures are biomarkers of vitamin A, iron and zinc status, growth (anthropometric z-scores),
      and immune and cognitive function. Nutrient biomarkers will be assessed at enrollment
      (baseline), at an intermediate time point (midline; random serial sampling) and after 9
      months of follow-up (endline). Additionally, we will measure concentrations of C-reactive
      protein (CRP) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as iron and zinc biomarkers can be
      influenced by inflammation. To assess cognitive function, multiple specific aspects of
      memory, attention, and processing speed will be assessed. Higher-level, integrative cognitive
      abilities that require the coordination of multiple specific functions, such as
      problem-solving and exploratory behavior and global aspects of attention during free play
      with toys, will also be assessed. In addition, a Bayley III test will be conducted at the
      baseline, intermediate, and endline assessments to obtain a broad measure of attainment of
      developmental milestones that can be used to compare the characteristics of this cohort with
      those reported in the literature.
