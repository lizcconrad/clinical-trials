  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute colorectal obstruction has been reported to occur in 7 - 29% of all colorectal
      malignancies, but emergent surgical decompression is associated with high morbidity and
      mortality rates. Recently, self-expandable metal stents(SEMS) have been suggested as an
      alternative to surgery and effectively decompress the colonic obstruction and allow for bowel
      preparation and elective surgery. Theoretically, SEMSs are classified into uncovered stents
      and covered stents. Covered stents have the advantage of less frequent stent occlusion by
      tumor in-growth and the disadvantage of a high risk of stent migration, whereas uncovered
      stents are associated with less stent migration, although they appear to be more prone to
      tumor ingrowth. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional stents, a double-layered
      combination covered stent was developed. In the present study, the investigators evaluated
      the efficacy and safety of the newly designed covered stent by comparing it with the
      uncovered stent in patients with malignant colorectal obstruction.

    <description>Stent insertion was performed by experienced endoscopists under fluoroscopy and by using through-the-scope methods. After the obstructing tumor was identified by endoscopy, a guidewire was introduced through the stricture under endoscopic and fluoroscopic controls. Then, the self-expandable colorectal stent delivery catheter was advanced through the working channel of the endoscope over the guidewire until the stent was positioned across the stricture. Upon releasing the stent delivery catheter, stent deployment was initiated proximally and progressed distally. Simple abdominal radiography was performed during and after the procedures to confirm proper stent placement and expansion.</description>
