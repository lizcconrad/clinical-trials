      This retrospective cohort study assessed sealant clinical success applied to pit and fissure
      by dental undergraduate students at Piracicaba Dental School - Brazil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A population presenting 1st/2nd permanent molars with sealed occlusal surfaces were
      considered. Dental records were reviewed for: patient's caries risk (High/Low); operator
      experience (scores 1 to 4, beginners to seniors); number of follow-up visits; isolation
      procedure; sealant/tooth type; and age at placement. Posteriorly, the patients were called to
      dental evaluation and the sealed teeth were classified regarding the sealant presence,
      partial presence or absence, with or without caries, or sealant replacement to a restorative
      material in Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory, considering the caries presence/absence.
      Successful outcome was considered in the caries absence.
