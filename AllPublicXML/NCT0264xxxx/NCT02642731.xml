    <textblock>
      Sensitive renal markers have been studied abundantly in connection with open heart, liver and
      transplantation surgery; however in major orthopaedic surgery their use is anecdotal. The aim
      of the present study is to evaluate use of sensitive renal markers, NGAL (Neutrophil
      gelatinase associated lipocalin ), KIM-1 (Kidney injury molecule- 1), LFABP (liver-type fatty
      acid-binding protein), and IL-18 (interleukin -18), in patients coming for elective TKA
      (total knee arthroplasty) as a pilot study before large study concerning acute kidney injury
      in orthopaedic surgery.

      Acute renal deterioration is a serious adverse event in elective surgery. Serum creatinine
      based diagnostics of acute kidney injury may delay diagnosis and produce false negative
      results since serum creatinine is affected by diet, muscle mass, used hydration therapy. In
      recent times new markers have been developed and tested in order to find sensitive, fast and
      reliable marker of renal deterioration.
