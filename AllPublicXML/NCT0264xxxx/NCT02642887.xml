      Objectives: To clinically evaluate the healing of Miller Class I and II isolated gingival
      recessions treated with the modified tunnel approach (mTA) versus the conventional tunnel
      technique (cTT) in conjunction with subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG).

      Material and Methods: In this split-mouth study, thirty healthy patients exhibiting two
      isolating anterior Miller Class I and II gingival recessions were treated with mTA + SCTG and
      cTT + SCTG. Treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3-months and 6-months
      postoperatively. The primary outcome was root coverage esthetic scores (RES).

    <textblock>
      Various techniques have been suggested for the treatment of isolated mandibular recessions
      e.g., envelope, coronally advanced flaps double pedicle flap or tunneling procedures combined
      with laterally positioned pedicle flaps in conjunction with SCTG. Despite the fact that the
      mentioned techniques appear to improve root coverage, the success in terms of complete root
      coverage has high variability and thus it is still unknown which approach may lead to the
      most predictable outcomes. The limited evidence from the literature points clearly to the
      clinical importance of developing new concepts for predictable of isolated mandibular
      recessions.

      The MTA is a dual flap approach; that starts with full thickness flap (avoiding papilla
      incision) till the level of the mucogingival junction. On reaching the level of the
      vestibular mucosa, a partial thickness flap is applied to undermine the base of the flap.
      Using this dual approach carries two main advantages: avoidance of severing the gingival
      blood supply through the full thickness flap, in addition to minimizing the tension on the
      flap tissue through using the partial thickness flap at the above-mentioned site.

      In this trial, the mTA has been proposed for the surgical treatment of isolated mandibular
      recessions due to the following advantages: 1) it avoids vertical releasing incisions. 2) it
      doesn't incise the papilla, which may improve the vascularization of the area plus
      stabilizing the soft tissue flap. 3) it is suitable to patients with thin gingival biotype.
