  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of morphine to a local anesthetic when performing an epidural analgesia during
      labor analgesia has improved the efficiency and the action duration of analgesia. One
      limitation of this technique is the time of installation of the analgesic effect (about 30
      minutes) when using the only epidural. Therefore, the technique of sequential combined spinal
      epidural was introduced. This is to shorten the installation time by direct injection into
      the cerebrospinal fluid. This allows a good efficiency in less than 10 minutes. It has been
      shown that low doses of sufentanil (strong opioid) in spinal anesthesia could potentiate the
      effect of the local anesthetic.
