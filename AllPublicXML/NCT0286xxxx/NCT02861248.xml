      A prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMRT for treating non-hypertrophic
      post-burn scars in an Asian population.

      Background: Laser therapy is an emerging, minimally invasive treatment for scars. Among the
      various techniques, fractional microplasma radiofrequency technology (FMRT) has proved to be
      effective for various types of scars and skin conditions such as rhytids, striae distensae,
      and hyperpigmentation.

      Method: A prospective clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      FMRT for treating non-hypertrophic post-burn scars in an Asian population. All patients
      underwent three to five treatment sessions at intervals of 8−16 weeks. The patient and
      observer scar assessment scales (POSAS) were use to evaluate changes in the burn scars before
      and after treatment. Intermediate and long-term adverse events were recorded for outcome
      analysis.

    <description>The patient component of the POSAS contains six parameters that the patient scores: pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness, relief. The physician (observer) component contains five parameters: vascularization, pigmentation, pliability, thickness, relief. Each parameter is scored from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating that the scar similar to normal skin and 10 indicating the worst situation imaginable.</description>

    <description>After the patient's scars were subjected to a mild cleanser and 70% alcohol, a topical cream of 5% lidocaine hydrochloric acid (Beijing Ziguang Medication Manufacture Corporation Ltd, Beijing, China) was applied to the entire scar surface under occlusion for 60−90 min before treatment to achieve local anesthesia. Fractional micro-plasma radiofrequency treatment (Pixel RF, Accent XL; Alma Lasers, Caesarea, Israel) was applied using a roller tip at 50−80 watts. Three or four passes were made in different directions over each affected area. A high rolling speed of roughly 5 cm/s was manually controlled. This treatment was accompanied by an air cooler (Cryo 5; Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) for pain control. All patients attended three to five treatment sessions at intervals of 8−16 weeks.</description>
