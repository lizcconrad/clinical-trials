      This project is an exploratory study, based on the hypothesis of involvement of chemokines in
      hormonal escape of prostate cancers.

      The two main objectives are:

        -  To describe the variations in expression of chemokines in serum and urine level in
           patients with prostate cancer

        -  And to study the disease stage and intra-prostatic concentrations of chemokines based on
           serum and urine concentrations of chemokines before treatment initiation.

      These estimates can be used in future trials set up for the management of prostate cancer
