      The aim of this study is to test for an early post-stress cardiac output (CO) change by
      impedance cardiography and its relation to the severity and extent of myocardial ischemia and
      angiographic coronary disease in subjects undergoing exercise stress testing using a novel
      cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT camera.

      Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a
      well-established noninvasive procedure for the evaluation and risk stratification of patients
      with coronary artery disease (CAD) (1). However, it has been recognized that in certain
      patients SPECT MPI is unable to detect the presence of or underestimates the extent of CAD.
      The fact that moderate to severe perfusion defects are noted in less than half of the
      patients with significant left main disease (2) has stimulated studies to improve the
      diagnostic accuracy of SPECT MPI. Such studies have analyzed post-stress parameters such as
      left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (3, 4), wall motion abnormalities (5) and
      transient LV dilation (6) with images acquired on conventional Anger cameras as long as 60
      minutes after the stress tracer injection. Such delayed assessment may miss early ischemic
      stunning as a result of its transient nature. However, detection of an early post-stress
      decrease in cardiac output (CO) may serve as a potential marker for the presence of
      significant or extensive ischemia. The aim of this study is to test for an early post-stress
      CO change by impedance cardiography and its relation to the severity and extent of myocardial
      ischemia and angiographic coronary disease in subjects undergoing exercise stress testing
      using a novel cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT camera.
