  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To support the discovery of new means for revealing the presence of Obsessive Compulsive
      Disorder (OCD), facilitating detection through new technology-based metrics, and attempt to
      automate existing diagnostic procedures allowing for more efficient diagnostic methods that
      would broaden clinical scope and outreach.

      Aim 1: To observe and compare childhood behaviors regarding handwashing in OCD and control
      populations

      Hypothesis 1: Control participants will spend less time washing their hands, will wash them
      less frequently, and will be less preoccupied with the sink when doing other activities.

      Aim 2: To observe and compare childhood behaviors regarding organizing a cluttered area.

      Hypothesis 2: OCD participants will be more disturbed by the presence of clutter and more
      compelled to organize the items than control participants

      Aim 3: To observe and compare childhood behaviors regarding turning on/off light switches

      Hypothesis 3: OCD children will be more likely to exhibit compulsive repetitive behaviors
      regarding the light switch than control participants

        The investigators will recruit 20 children and adolescents with OCD aged 5-17 who present
        to the University of Minnesota Child and Adolescent Anxiety and Mood Disorders Clinic or
        who are referred from outside clinicians. Twenty healthy controls will be recruited from
        the community.
