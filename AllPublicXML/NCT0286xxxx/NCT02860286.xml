  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, 2-part, single-arm, 2-stage study of tazemetostat
      800 mg two times a day (BID) administered orally. Screening of subjects to determine
      eligibility for the study will be performed within 21 days of the first planned dose of
      tazemetostat.

      In Part 1, 12 subjects with relapsed or refractory malignant mesothelioma regardless of BAP1
      status will be treated and undergo pharmacokinetics (PK) blood sample collection after a
      single tazemetostat 800 mg.

      Part 2 will include subjects with BAP1-deficient relapsed or refractory malignant
      mesothelioma.

      Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study. Response assessment will be evaluated
      after 6 weeks of treatment and then every 12 weeks thereafter while on study.
