  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study was conducted to investigate the novice
      practitioners' learning curve of visual estimation of LV ejection fraction (%) through a
      echocardiographic video files at the academic emergency department (ED) in tertiary urban
      hospital.

      Eight EM residents who have no experience of echocardiography prior to the study were
      recruited as analysis of the echocardiographic image file. They received echocardiography
      interpretation skill training which included one hour of lecture. Twenty echocardiography
      videos files were provided during training session, they were instructed how to estimate EF
      by looking at the LV contractility without taking any measurement.

      This procedure took less than 2 minutes in each case. An evaluation form was completed by
      each EP. EF is estimated qualitatively (Normal / Global hypokinesia), RWMA and quantitatively
      (%) by EP with echocardiographic certification(cardiologist). An each echocardiography has
      been performed with M7RÂ® model ultrasound machine was reported by experienced
      echocardiographers as using MSM. The echocardiography results were reported blinded to our
      study.

      A participant estimated the EF based on a complete assessment of LV wall motion including
      parasternal long-axis, short-axis, and apical four chamber view except for MSM.

      And, participants wrote down EF(%) and a region of WMA as visual assessment and checked
      Normal wall motion or Global hypokinesia in EF reporting paper.
