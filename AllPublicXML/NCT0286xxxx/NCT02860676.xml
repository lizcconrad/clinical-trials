  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety of the investigational drug called
      cirmtuzumab when given for a duration of 6 to 12 months. Cirmtuzumab is a type of drug called
      a monoclonal antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called ROR1 that is on
      the surface of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. This blocks growth and survival of
      the CLL cells. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells so this drug should target the
      cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental because its use is not approved by
      United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      Although there is evidence from tests on laboratory animals that cirmtuzumab can decrease the
      number of CLL cells, the investigators do not know if this will work in humans. Therefore,
      the goal of this study is to see if cirmtuzumab is safe and tolerable in study participants
      when given for a duration of 6 to 12 months.

      This is an open-label extension study to determine the safety and efficacy. Patients enrolled
      in the initial phase 1 trial in CLL are eligible for enrollment in this extension trial.

      UC-961 is administered by intravenous infusion every 14 days for 4 doses, then every 28 days
      for 4 doses, after which responses will be assessed. Patients with an objective response
      (meeting working group criteria for partial response or complete response) will continue at
      the same dose and schema. Patients with stable disease or progressive disease are eligible to
      increase the dose of UC-961 for another 6-month course.

      Duration of UC-961 administration is until disease progression, treatment intolerance, or
      lack of clinical benefit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical and phenotypic verification of B cell CLL and measurable disease.
             Immunophenotyping of the leukemic cells (blood or marrow) must demonstrate a
             monoclonal (or light chain positive) B cell population with immunophenotype consistent
             with CLL (e.g., co-expressing CD19 and CD5).

          -  Recovered from toxic effects attributed to UC-961 to grade 1 levels, or baseline.

          -  Must have measurable disease, including one of the following:

               -  absolute lymphocyte count greater than 5000/uL
