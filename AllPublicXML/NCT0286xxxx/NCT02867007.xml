      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose, in the absence of
      exceeding the MTD, of KHK2455 administered orally in combination with mogamulizumab to
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      The study is designed as a 2-part, multicenter, open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation,
      cohort-expansion study of KHK2455 as a monotherapy run-in (Cycle 0) followed by combination
      therapy with the anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab (Cycle 1 and beyond).

      Part 1 will identify the MTD or the highest protocol-defined dose, in the absence of
      exceeding the MTD, for the KHK2455 monotherapy run-in and for the combination regimen
      (KHK2455 monotherapy [Cycle 0] followed by KHK2455 + mogamulizumab combination [Cycle 1]).
      The dose escalation phase (Part 1) will enroll up to approximately 36 subjects.

      Part 2, the cohort-expansion phase, will further explore the safety, tolerability, PK, PD,
      pharmacogenomics (PGx), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of KHK2455 administered as
      monotherapy and in combination with mogamulizumab in subjects with one cohort-specific tumor
      type. In Part 2, approximately 15 subjects with a selected tumor type will be enrolled and
      treated with the recommended KHK2455 dose established in Part 1 in combination with
      mogamulizumab.
