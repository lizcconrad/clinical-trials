  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronic fatigue is observed in approximately 40 % of the patients with a chronic quiet
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and impacts the quality of life of the patients. The
      beneficial role of a regular physical activity on the quality of life of patients having an
      IBD was demonstrated in 5 studies including only 1 controlled one [Bilski, on 2013]. The
      mechanism by which the physical activity could improve the quality of life of the patients
      remains unknown (stress decreased, reduction of the inflammatory process) [Bilski, on 2014].
      Several studies concerning other chronic pathologies such as fibromyalgia, have demonstrated
      the beneficial effect of a regular physical exercise to reduce the fatigue of patients. It
      was recently demonstrated that the chronic fatigue observed in patients with IBD came along
      with a physical reduction in the performances during the exercise test and a reduction in the
      physical activity of the patients [Vogelaar, 2015].

      Our hypothesis is that a regular moderate physical activity could improve physical
      performance during an effort et could reduce the chronic fatigue and improve their quality of
      life.
