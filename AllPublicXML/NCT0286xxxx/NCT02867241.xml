  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention for
      parents to reduce tobacco smoke exposure of young children
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this intervention is to reduce exposure of children to tobacco smoke,
      through an intervention program designed to help parents better perceive exposure and its
      harms, and to provide tools for assisting them in protecting children. Secondary aims are to
      understand the relationships between parentally-reported and objectively measured child
      tobacco smoke exposure, to assess the relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and health
      and health care utilization, and to better understand parental perceptions of tobacco smoke
      exposure (PPE) and parental perceptions of risk (PPR) from tobacco smoke exposure. The
      effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated using a randomized controlled trial.

      This RCT is a continuation of previous work. Originally the entire research project, which
      included a Pilot Study and a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was registered as NCT01335178.
      Upon completion of the Pilot Study, we closed NCT01335178 and opened a new one for the RCT
      with the current registration number.
