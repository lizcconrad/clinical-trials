      Patients with advanced or recurrent adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the
      cervix will receive Pemetrexed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every three week.

      On initiation of pemetrexed, on day one of first chemotherapy cycle, patients will begin
      taking folic acid at a dose of 350 to 600 mcg daily as well as receive an intramuscular
      injection of 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, with subsequent vitamin B12 injections given every 9
      weeks while on study.
