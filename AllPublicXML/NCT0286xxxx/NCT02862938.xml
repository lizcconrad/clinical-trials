  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, sham controlled, masked clinical trial of 60 study participants with
      glaucoma. Participants with a qualifying study eye will be randomized after screening and
      baseline evaluations to receive the NT-501 encapsulated cell therapy (ECT) implant or a sham
      surgery (control arm), and no explant will be required.

      An examination for safety will occur one day and one week following implant and periodically
      thereafter for 24 months post-implant. Based on the primary analysis of data at 6 months,
      patients in the control arm may be offered the NT-501 ECT implant at the 12 month time point.

    <description>On eligible participants that are randomized to this group, the NT-501 Investigational product will be implanted in the study eye, and participants will be followed for 24 months.
The investigational treatment, NT-501 ECT, provides intravitreal sustained release of soluble ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor after intraocular implantation.</description>

    <description>To maintain masking, participants randomized to this group receive sham surgery and will be followed for 12 months. Following analysis of the 6 month data, if the open label extension (OLE) is not triggered, patients in the control group will continue on the original study schedule timeline trough month 24. If OLE is triggered participants will be offered the NT-501 ECT investigational product and will followed for additional 12 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following criteria to join the study (all eligibility
        criteria must be met at the screening and baseline visits unless otherwise noted):

          1. Participant must be medically able to undergo the testing required in the schedule of
             events (SOE).

          2. Participant's clinical diagnosis must be consistent with glaucoma 1. characterized by
             the following features:

             a) Clinical evidence of progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and
             degeneration using both visual field and at least one structural modality as
             established by: i. Glaucomatous visual field abnormality. ii. Mean deviation (MD) of
             -3 to -15 dB. iii. Minimum average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness of 60 μm
             and maximum average RNFL of 90 μm.

             b) Residual visual field preservation including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
             better than 20/200 in both eyes.

             c) Two visual field tests of adequate quality with a maximum visual field index (VFI)
             variability of ± 10%.

          3. Participant's glaucoma must be clinically stable, with intraocular pressure (IOP) &lt;
             21.

          4. If a participant has two eyes meeting study criteria, only the worse eye as determined
             by visual field index (VFI) will be deemed includable. If both eyes qualify and have
             the same VFI, a randomization procedure will assign one eye to the study.

          5. Participant must understand and sign the informed consent. If the participant's vision
             is impaired to the point where he/she cannot read the informed consent document, the
             document will be read to the participant in its entirety.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective form of birth
             control.

          7. Participant must be determined by the presurgical anesthesia or medical team to be fit
             for ophthalmic surgery for the NT-501 ECT implant insertion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant is unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits.

          2. Participant has other optic nerve or retinal degenerative disease causing vision loss,
             irrespective of whether it is currently treated or untreated.

          3. Participant has visual loss to less than 20/200 in non-study eye.

          4. Participant is likely to be offered glaucoma surgery within 6 months of screening.

             duration. To be eligible for this study, the participant must discontinue use of these
             products prior to enrollment and must not continue with the products until after they

             that would increase the risk of participation in the study or may interfere with the
             study procedures, evaluations and outcome assessments.

         19. Participant has choroidal neovascularization secondary to age related macular
             degeneration or any other type of retinal degeneration that may interfere with the
             study procedures, evaluations and outcome assessments.

         20. Any intraocular surgery of the study eye within 12 weeks prior to the screening visit

         21. History of use of drugs with known retinal toxicity, at retinotoxic doses.
