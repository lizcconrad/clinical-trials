  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two main aims in this study. The first objective is to evaluate whether a
      particular telehealth solution, in addition to standard treatment and care, lead to a
      significant decrease in the mortality and an increase in health related quality of life for
      patients suffering from Heart Failure that may benefit from telehealth compared with only
      standard treatment and care. The second objective is to examine the additional costs of the
      telehealth solution and assess whether this solution is a cost-effective way to care for
      patients with Heart Failure across patients and municipality districts.

      It is hypothesized that telehealth care will increase patients quality adjusted life years
      compared to usual practice, since no difference in mortality and a higher health related
      quality of life is expected. Furthermore, it is hoped that there will be a 30% reduction in
      the number of admissions and readmissions to hospitals and a 30% reduction in the number of
      outpatient visits resulting in fewer costs for hospitals. However, it is uncertain as to
      whether these savings are offset by other costs such as more visits to general practitioners,
      community care or the implementation costs.

    <description>A tablet (a Samsung GALAXY TAB 2 (10.1)) that holds information on handling heart failure in general. The device can also collect and transmit relevant disease-specific data, which are indicative of their current state of health, via a Digital Blood Pressure Monitor (Model UA-767, plus BT-C) and a scale. The device can measure four vital signs, which are transferred wirelessly: blood pressure, pulse, and weight. The tablet can be activated and give a sound, when it is time for taking measurements again.</description>

    <description>In Denmark, usual practice for treating, monitoring and caring for patients with heart failure are the responsibility of the patient's general practitioner (treatment and monitoring) and the municipalities (practical help and nursing care). Heart failure patients can make appointments with their general practitioner or practice nurse free of charge in order to get help in managing heart failure. Community based care and practical help varies. As a rule community care comes at regular intervals based on a clinically based estimate of the patients' needs, but the personnel are not necessarily certified nurses and often not fully educated in heart failure and definitely not on call</description>
