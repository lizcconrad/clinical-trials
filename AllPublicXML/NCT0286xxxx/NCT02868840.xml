  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tai Chi, an ancient Chinese martial art, is a low intense aerobic exercise characterized by
      continuous movements that embrace the mind, body, and spirit. Tai Chi addresses the
      integration and balance of mind and body using the fundamental principles of slow, smooth,
      and continuous movement control, and the transfer of body weight while maintaining an upright
      and relaxed posture. The present randomized clinical trial project aims to apply the
      suggested principles as the typical features of Tai Chi applied stroke rehabilitation, and to
      evaluate the effects on physical (balance), psychological, and cognitive function.

      Cerebrovascular disease is a major global concern. The individuals with stroke would suffer
      from disease associated symptoms which influence their functioning in everyday life. These
      symptom clusters were usually known to be sharing similar underlying mechanisms. It is clear
      that the development of effective stroke rehabilitation involves interdisciplinary team
      approach to manage physical, social, cognitive, and psychological functioning in this
      population.

      Tai Chi, an ancient Chinese martial art, is a low intense aerobic exercise characterized by
      continuous movements that embrace the mind, body, and spirit. Tai Chi addresses the
      integration and balance of mind and body using the fundamental principles of slow, smooth,
      and continuous movement control, and the transfer of body weight while maintaining an upright
      and relaxed posture. The newly developed style of Tai Chi for health programs is the seated
      Tai Chi, which shares the common Tai Chi principles while being modified to adjust the
      movements for patients with limited mobility.

      The present randomized clinical trial project aims to apply the suggested principles as the
      typical features of Tai Chi applied stroke rehabilitation, and to evaluate the effects on
      physical (balance), psychological, and cognitive function. Only a few studies ever addressed
      the feasibility of Tai Chi for stroke rehabilitation, and the relationship between cognition
      and balance in this population is still very early stage of investigation. The main purpose
      of our collaborating project is to explore the direct relationship between cognition and
      balance in stroke patients during their rehabilitation process.
