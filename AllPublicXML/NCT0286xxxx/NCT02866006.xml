      BVAC-C is immunotherapeutic vaccine using B-Cell and Monocytes as antigen presenting cell.
      This study is Open-label, dose-escalation, multiple dosing study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, immune response and pre efficacy of BVAC-C in patients with multiple metastatic
      progressive or recurrent HPV type 16 or 18 positive cervical cancer after failure to standard
      care. 9~18 patients will be enrolled
