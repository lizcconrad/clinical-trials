      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine in continuous infusion in
      the control of pain intensity, the impact on the consumption of opioids and observe the side
      effect profile in patients suffering from great extent of burns.

      Despite advances in pharmacology and in analgesic techniques, pain in burned patients is
      unwieldy yet, this occurs in such cases due to the complexity and intensity and the need for
      multidisciplinary medical team. The burn pain is classified as nociceptive, but can also
      present a neuropathic component. Overall this is a pain at rest and during movement, being
      aggravated by procedures like changing dressings. In the weeks after the burn there is
      intense pain due to injury and the management of the framework, which often involves dressing
      changes and other procedures such as surgery in donor area skin.

      The use of opioids in high doses can lead to unwanted side effects.To reduce the adverse
      effects resulting from the use of opioids in high doses, we purpose the use of intravenous
      continuous infusion of ketamine. In controlling the pain of major burned patient there is
      evidence only of the use of ketamine in the form of intermittent boluses, especially during
      dressing changes or in the perioperative period. The use of ketamine in continuous infusion
      lacks evidence in this group of patients The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of ketamine in continuous infusion in the control of pain intensity, the impact on
      the consumption of opioids and observe the side effect profile in patients suffering from
      great extent of burns.
