      Description:

      Multicentre observational study, not randomized. Ambispective character (retro and
      prospective). Opened to any member of the Asociación Española de Urología (AEU), public and
      private medicine.

      Justification:

      Active surveillance is a strategy proposed to control the overtreatment derived from the
      opportunist screening in prostate cancer (PCa).

      Its development in our country is erratic and different in every Center. This database tries
      to include most of patients included in active surveillance in Spain with a few minimal
      inclusion criteria.

      Multicentre registry and follow up of the active surveillance in Spain.

      Hypothesis:

      Mortality cancer specific for PCa includible in active surveillance to 15 years is lower than
      5 %.

    <measure>Characterization of pathologically agressive tumors by Gleason score</measure>
    <time_frame>From the study start and stop until 15 years</time_frame>
    <description>Characterization of pathologically agressive tumours will be done by analyzing the pathological reports of radical prostatectomy specimens derived from patients included in the protocol that went on to radical prostatectomy. This has no time frame, although time of radical prostatectomy will be a variable to take in account for comparisions among different timings of performace of radical prostatectomies.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. PSA ≤ 10 ng / mL; if prostate volume&gt; 60 cc in transrectal, ultrasound includable with
             PSA&gt;10 ng / ml if PSAD &lt;0.20
