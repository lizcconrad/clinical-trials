      Aim: This study was planned for comparing physical activity levels, nutrition quality and
      quality of life of the individuals that are diagnosed with and without metabolic syndrome
      (MetS) and that live in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).

      Method: 1200 individuals in total, in which (n: 660) individuals diagnosed with MetS and
      (n:660) individuals not diagnosed with MetS, participated in this study. Socio-demographic
      characteristics of the individuals that participated the study were registered with a survey
      form. The long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used for
      determining physical activity levels of the individuals; whereas total numbers of daily steps
      were carried out with pedometer. The 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)
      was used for the assessment of dietary habits, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was used for
      the assessment of health-related qualities of life of individuals and Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI) was used for the assessment of depression. In addition, biochemical analysis
      and anthropometric measurements of individuals were also taken.

    <description>Dry needling was performed on active and/or latent TPs at Gluteus Medius, Quadratus Lumborum, Multifidus, Erector Spinae muscles of the subjects in the study groups without applying any local anesthetic substance. The needles were applied with a 90º angle for Multifidus, Quadratus Lumborum and Gluteus Medius muscles; while they were applied with a 45º angle for Erector Spinae muscles. Thin stainless steel needles of 0.25x0.40 mm and 0.30x0.60 mm were applied in infiltration form on the TP through many points in conformity with the injection technique. The needles were kept on the body for 20 minutes and at the 10th minute, the needle was rolled and re-stimulation was enabled. The treatment was applied twice a week, which is equal to 6 sessions in total.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Classic Physiotherapy Program</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Hot-pack was applied for 20 minutes. Burst TENS was applied on the lumbar regions of the cases of the control group paravertebrally with 4-electrode reusable silicone rubber. The dimensions of electrode is 5x5cm. Pulse width was set for 100 µsn, pulse frequency was set for 2 Hz, cycle time is set for 0.5 seconds and the amplitude was increased until visible muscle contraction was reached. If the muscle contraction is lost during the session, the amplitude was increased again. The period of treatment was 6 sessions in total with 25 minutes of each.
Ultrasound was paravertebrally applied to the lower back regions of the subjects. The treatment was applied with 1 MHz frequency, 1.5 W/cm2 power, for 6 minutes a day, for 10 sessions in total with direct contact with the patient's skin.</description>
