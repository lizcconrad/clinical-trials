  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Core temperature monitoring is mandatory during major surgery. The accurate techniques
      currently used are invasive, such as artery catheter and oesophagal probe. A new non-invasive
      cutaneous device, 3M SpotOn, using Zero Heath-Flux method, continuously measure core
      temperature. This prospective study compare the accuracy of Zero-Heath-Flux to oesophagal
      temperature (30 patients) and to artery catheter (20 patients) in adult patients during
      surgery.

    <textblock>
      Every patients undergoing heavy surgery had their central temperature monitoring, through an
      arterial catheter if the surgery required it (30 patients in this arm), otherwise the
      investigators used an oesophagus tube (20 patients). We also monitored every 50 patients with
      a non-invasive method 3M spot on (Zero-heath-flux technic) in order to measure its fiability
      and validity during the surgery.
