  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluated a public health program in Haiti that introduced an oral
      cholera vaccine as part of comprehensive control efforts for a major cholera epidemic.
      Although the vaccine (Shanchol(R)) had been demonstrated to be very safe, and effective at
      preventing cholera in many settings, it had not extensively been used to control an outbreak,
      and it had not been extensively studied in populations that were previously naive to cholera
      (i.e. countries that had never had cholera before). This cholera epidemic was the first ever
      report of cholera in Haiti.

      After the cholera vaccination campaign was complete, the investigators aimed to evaluate the
      field efficacy of the vaccination campaign by evaluating the number of cases of cholera, and
      determining if cholera patients had been vaccinated. The investigators compared the rate of
      vaccination in cholera cases to controls from the community that had not had cholera in a
      case-control study.

      The investigators also performed a second study - a bias-indicator study - that enrolled
      patients with non-cholera diarrhea, and community controls. The role of the bias-indicator
      study was to evaluate for potential sources of bias, since the investigators could expect
      that cholera vaccination should have no effect on non-cholera diarrhea.

        This study will be conducted in the catchment area of the vaccine campaign, in the rural
        regions of Bocozel and Grande Saline, located in the Artibonite Department of Haiti.
        Bocozel has a catchment population of approximately 56,000 people and Grande Saline has a
        catchment population of approximately 21,000 people. These two neighboring sections are one
        of two Haitian locations in which the two-dose Shanchol oral cholera vaccine will be
        implemented as part of the vaccination campaign in 2012. Key stakeholder meetings conducted
        by PIH staff among diverse groups of community members in Bocozel suggest broad acceptance
        of the vaccine. Based on these meetings and reported oral cholera vaccine uptake in other
        countries, we estimate that vaccine uptake will be 80% or higher in Bocozel.
