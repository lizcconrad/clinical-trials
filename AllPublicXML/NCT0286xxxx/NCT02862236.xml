  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experiment is aimed to examine the effect of common psychiatric drugs on several
      cognitive functions, in a healthy and subclinical adult population. The investigators
      hypothesize that baseline stress level regulates drugs effects on cognitive performance.
      Additionally, different levels of stress may moderate the drugs-cognition relations. In order
      to examine our hypotheses, the investigators focus on two anxiolytic drugs: herbal based
      (Hypericum) and benzodiazepine (Alprazolam). about 160 healthy (and/or subclinically anxious)
      subjects (aged 18-40) will be administered with single dose of the drugs (between subjects)
      on two different experiment dates - so subject that will be administered with a drug will
      receive placebo on the second date, or vice versa. The design will be double blind and second
      experiment day will occur at least 14 days after the first. Prior to administration, the
      investigators will measure depression and trait anxiety and state stress and anxiety, using
      inventories and cortisol in saliva test. Subjects will undergo a battery of computerized
      cognitive tests measuring working memory, attention, executive control, and visual
      perception. State anxiety and stress will be also measured before and after the battery. A
      gentle stress manipulation will be conducted during some of the tests.

      currently, the research is focusing on a Hypericum and placebo only, regarding 60
      participants.
