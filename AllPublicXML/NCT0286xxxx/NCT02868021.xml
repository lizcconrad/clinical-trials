  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will investigate the effects of blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise for up
      to 4-6 weeks prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery in older patients to measure
      clinical outcomes such as strength, lower extremity function, and pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a low-resistance
      exercise protocol with blood flow restriction (BFR) using a tourniquet in the preoperative
      period of patients awaiting TKA. BFR exercise is a new exercise method that has not been
      studied in the perioperative period. The investigators will compare our intervention to a
      no-exercise group up to 4 - 6 weeks prior to surgery to determine if this type of exercise is
      feasible in the preoperative period and if BFR exercise will improve functional,
      physiological, and molecular outcomes when compared to patients without exercise.
