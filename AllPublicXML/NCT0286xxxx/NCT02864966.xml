    <textblock>
      This is a 24 hour patch test to determine the acute tolerance of 3 variants of condom on a
      panel of healthy adult subjects. The patches will be affixed to the back and remain under
      occlusion for 24 hours. They will then be assessed at 30 minutes and 24 hours post patch
      removal.

      Three test products (plus positive and negative control) will be applied to the back using
      occlusive tape and will remain on the skin for 24 hours. The patches will be removed after 24
      hours and assessed as 30 minutes post patch removal and again at 24 hours post patch removal.
      Each test site will be scored for erythema and oedema by a dermatologist.

      The primary endpoint for this Clinical Investigation is the irritation of the test products
      according to the Cutaneous Irritancy Index value. The test products success criteria is to be
      graded as 'non-irritant' and this should be confirmed by the study dermatologist.
