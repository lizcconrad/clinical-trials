  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate sensitization to animal allergens and allergic symptom during
      contacting animal allergens in Korean veterinary researchers who attend their annual
      conference.

      The investigators will compare sensitization to animal allergen and other clinical and
      occupational factors between subjects who suffer from allergic symptom during contacting
      animal and those who do not.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will visit annual conference of Korean veterinary researchers.

      After informed consent, Korean veterinary researchers who attend their conference and agree
      to enrollment into this study will be asked to respond to questionnaires regarding their
      gender, age, underlying allergic diseases, family history of allergic diseases, occupation
      and it's duration, contact animal and contact duration. Subjects will also be requested to
      report allergic symptom, causal animal and situation of contact including veterinary service,
      animal experiment, pet ownership, and ingestion if subjects suffer from allergic symptom when
      subjects contact animal.

      Then, subjects will also be asked to undergo skin prick test for animal allergens including
      chicken feather and ten mammal epithelia as well as cow's milk, and hen's egg, four fish
      flesh and seven animal meats.

      subjects will be divided into two group, subjects who suffer from allergic symptom during
      contacting animal and those who do not. Between two groups, sensitization to animal allergens
      as well as other demographic and occupational factors including gender, age, underlying
      allergic diseases, family history of allergic diseases, occupation and it's duration, contact
      animal and contact duration will be compared.
