  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) affects over 60 million people. The exact
      pathogenesis of POAG is poorly understood. A significant risk factor for glaucoma is
      advancing age. The rate of ageing is not the same in all age matched individuals. The concept
      of accelerated ageing suggests that the presence of a number of specific genetic,
      environmental or systemic risk factors may cumulate to accelerate the ageing process in some
      individuals and lead to the development of age-related disease. Understanding the factors
      that influence accelerated ageing is vital.

      Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a complex group of compounds that are naturally
      formed. They accumulate gradually with age in cells, tissues and blood vessels throughout the
      body where they adversely affect structure and function. Circulating AGE levels can be
      influenced by oxidative stress levels and dietary intake. Recent research has found that
      sustained exposure to high levels of circulating AGEs could be a major factor in the
      development of a number of chronic age-related degenerative disorders, including POAG.

      To date there have been few clinical studies that have been able to non-invasively explore
      the association between AGE levels and the development and progression of glaucomatous optic
      neuropathy (GON), or to explore the possible contribution that oxidative stress and dietary
      intake make to total tissue AGE levels in such patients. Furthermore little is understood
      about the relationship between AGE levels and retinal vascular function, a parameter known to
      be altered in GON that also could be influenced by AGE levels.

      The proposed study will aim to evaluate whether tissue-bound AGE levels are associated with
      parameters of retinal vascular function, oxidative stress, dietary intake and the presence of
      GON. Establishing this association could increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of
      GON and allow a new biomarker for accelerated ocular ageing to be realised
