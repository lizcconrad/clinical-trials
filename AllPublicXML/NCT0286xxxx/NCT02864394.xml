  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus
      docetaxel in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with programmed cell death
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive tumors who have experienced disease progression after
      platinum-containing systemic therapy. The primary hypothesis of this study is that
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) prolongs overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)
      compared to docetaxel in participants with PD-L1 positive tumors
