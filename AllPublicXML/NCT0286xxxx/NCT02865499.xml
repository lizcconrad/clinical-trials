    <textblock>
      This study addresses a &quot;lifespan approach to healthy development and aging&quot; with direct
      relevance to humans by testing the anti-aging effects of acarbose in humans. It is a pilot
      study to: i) better estimate power for a larger trial, ii) establish the safety and potential
      beneficial effects of acarbose in non-diabetic elderly humans, and iii) determine whether the
      effects of acarbose on the microbiome likely play a role in its enhancement of longevity
      and/or healthy aging. These are essential initial steps for translating acarbose into an
      anti-aging human therapy.

    <textblock>
      Treatment with acarbose, an α-glucosidase inhibitor, extends median lifespan by 22% in male
      mice. Acarbose is FDA-approved for use in humans and has been extensively employed for the
      management of diabetics; there have been few associated side effects reported. Acarbose is
      considered a very safe treatment. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that acarbose treatment
      could be used in elderly humans to elicit improvement in systems known to be negatively
      affected by aging. Since the outcomes of acarbose treatment may be differentially affected by
      age, it is imperative to test the drug directly in older subjects for its safety and
      efficacy. Towards this end, the investigators propose to perform a small pilot study
      assessing the effects of acarbose in ten elderly subjects, aged 75-95 years old. Briefly, a
      cohort of non-diabetics will be recruited; subjects will be in generally good health with all
      chronic diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, etc.) clinically stable. Trial
      participants will be studied before drug initiation (pre-treatment), during 3 months of
      acarbose (blood draws at 1 month and 3 months of treatment), and following termination of the
      drug (1 and 3 months post treatment) such that each subject will serve as his own control.
      The following will be assessed: 1) acarbose safety, including physical examination, clinical
      blood work, self-reporting of discomfort or other symptoms, and SF36 questionnaires; 2)
      Endothelial function which should improve with acarbose; 3) Physical function (grip strength
      and walking speed); 4) Cognitive function; 5) Immune parameters known to change with aging;
      these will include cytokine profiles, regulatory t-cell numbers, the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio,
      and naïve/memory T cell ratios; and 6) Gut microbiome composition which the investigators
      predict will change with oral acarbose treatment, potentially contributing to its positive
      effects on lifespan.
