      Background Surgical injury provokes a stress response. These pathways mediated by stress
      hormones and cytokines cause a catabolic state. The loss of body cell mass may result in
      prolonged convalescence and increased morbidity. Protein catabolism after colorectal surgery
      is even more increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Epidural blockade, by
      reducing the intensity of the catabolic response, improves substrate utilization after
      surgery in non-diabetic patients. This effect is even more pronounced in diabetic patients
      receiving amino acids.

      The aim of the study is to explore the effect of two different protocols to manage blood
      glucose control on glucose and protein metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      undergoing colon surgery and receiving epidural analgesia and perioperative feeding with
      amino acids. The following hypotheses are tested:

        1. Tight perioperative blood glucose control with intensified insulin therapy compared to
           standard blood glucose control in presence of general anesthesia with epidural analgesia
           and amino acid infusion would reduce endogenous glucose production and leucine
           oxidation.

        2. Tight blood glucose control and perioperative infusion of amino acids induce a more
           positive protein balance compared to standard blood glucose control by better oxidative
           glucose utilization and redirecting amino acids from oxidative to synthetic pathways.

      Material and Methods A total of 20 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 undergoing elective
      colorectal surgery will be admitted to the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive standard blood glucose control (blood glucose target &lt;10 mmol*l-1; control group;
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) group, n=8) or to receive tight blood glucose control with
      intensified insulin therapy (blood glucose target&lt;6 mmol*l-1; intensified insulin group; II
      group, n=8). All patients will receive general anesthesia and an epidural catheter for
      perioperative analgesia. During surgery (intraoperative state) and immediately after surgery
      (postoperative state) when receiving an amino acid infusion protein and glucose kinetics will
      be assessed using a stable isotope technique with L-[1-13C]leucine and [6,6-2H2]glucose and
      circulating concentrations of glucose, glucagon, insulin and cortisol will be measured. The
      primary endpoints of the study will be protein balance. Sample size is set to ensure at least
      80% power at a significance level of 0.05.
