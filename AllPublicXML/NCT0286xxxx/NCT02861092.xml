  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It exists recommendations to get an optimal antibiotic treatment for bone and joint infection
      and prescription of antibiotics in the bone and joint infections on material meets certain
      obligations: the micro-organism must be known, the antibiotic therapy must be started in
      association, obtaining high plasma levels, use of molecules having good bone circulation. It
      is recommended to initially administer treatment with intravenous route and to propose an
      oral relay, under conditions. It is recommended to administer the antibiotic treatment for at
      least 6 weeks.

      The dosages of antibiotics are adapted to the weight of patients in order to respond to those
      recommendations. But little is known about the optimal dose of treatment to give to obese
      patients (BMI&gt;=30) and the frequency of serious adverse events in these patients in which the
      dosage is then higher can be more important compared to non-obese patients. The aim of the
      study is then to evaluate the risk of occurrence of serious adverse events in obese patients
      and to identify risks factors.

      This study consists in a retrospective cohort of obese patients treated for a bone or joint
      infection and having had a serious adverse event. Several data are collected concerning:
      demographics data, treatment responsible of the serious adverse event (molecules, dosage,
      route), description of the serious adverse event, residual rate for vancomycin.

    <description>The data concerning the serious adverse events are collected in this Cohort. It is molecule, dosage, description of the adverse event. A severity grade is allocated to every adverse event, based on the &quot; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events &quot;. This is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term (from 1 to 5). Serious adverse events have a grade &gt;=3. This description will highlight particular the antibiotics the most implicated in serious adverse events</description>

    <time_frame>The patients included have presented a serious adverse event between 2008 and 2015.</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the serious adverse events is made between the group of obese patients, a group of non-obese patients treated for bone and joint infection and a group of obese patients treated for bone and joint infection but who had never had an adverse event. The role of the vancomycin in the serious adverse event will be compared in the 3 populations where the lean body mass (total mass of the skin, bones, muscles, organs and fluids of the human body), the fat body mass and the total mass will be used.</description>
