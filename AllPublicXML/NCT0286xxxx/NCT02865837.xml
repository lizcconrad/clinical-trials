  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare, for each patient, dosimetry of organs at risk
      (bladder, rectum, sigmoid, small bowel) in two bladder distension procedures (emptied by a
      urinary catheter or filled with 120cc) during PDR 3D image-guided brachytherapy of cervical
      cancer.

    <description>The brachytherapy applicator and a urinary catheter are set up in the operating room under general anesthesia.
Then, an MRI (or a scanner if contra-indication) is performed after a bladder filling with 120cc of normal saline solution and urinary catheter clamping.
Right after, a scanner is performed with urinary catheter declamping and emptied bladder.
Delineation of CTVs and organs at risk (bladder, rectum, sigmoid, small bowel), and dosimetric optimisation are made on study with filled bladder.
Then, organs at risk are delineated on the study with emptied bladder. The prior dosimetry is reset on this study and organs at risk doses are compared.</description>
