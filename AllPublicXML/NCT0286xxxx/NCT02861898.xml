    <textblock>
      Primary brain cancer kills up to 10,000 Americans a year. These brain tumors are typically
      treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either individually or in
      combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate
      for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months. Glioma is the
      most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately 7,000 patients in the
      United States each year. These highly malignant cancers remain a significant unmet clinical
      need in oncology. GBM often has a high expression EFGR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)
      which is blocked by Cetuximab (CTX). The investigators have recently completed a separate
      Phase I clinical trial using superselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion (SIACI) of CTX
      after blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD) for recurrent GBM (Chakraborty et al, in
      revision, Journal of Neurooncology). The investigators found that intra-arterial infusion of
      CTX is well tolerated with few adverse effects. The investigators hypothesize that in
      patients with newly diagnosed GBM, repeated SIACI of this drug after BBBD will be safe and
      efficacious for our patients when combined with standard chemoradiation (STUPP protocol).

      This trial will be a non-randomized open label Phase I/II clinical trial. In addition to
      standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy (STUPP protocol) the patient will be given CTX
      intra-arterially after BBBD for a total of three doses at approximately post surgery days 30,
      120 and 210.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients of ≥18 years of age.

          -  Patients with a documented histologic diagnosis of newly diagnosed glioblastoma
             multiforme (GBM)

          -  Patients with pathology confirmed histologic EGFR overexpression

          -  Patients must have at least one confirmed and evaluable tumor site.∗

             *A confirmed tumor site is one in which is biopsy-proven. NOTE: Radiographic
             procedures (e.g., Gd-enhanced MRI or CT scans) documenting existing lesions must have
             been performed within two weeks of treatment on this research study.
