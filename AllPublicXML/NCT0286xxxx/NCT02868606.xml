  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many hospitals have begun giving insulin to nearly all patients with diabetes while they are
      in the hospital even if a patient does not use insulin at home. Controlling blood sugar with
      insulin when a patient is hospitalized is believed to reduce the risk of complications and
      death, but research has not demonstrated these benefits except in patients who are critically
      ill. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to evaluate whether such insulin therapy
      actually does reduce in-hospital complications, deaths, need for intensive care, or length of
      stay in the hospital.

      The primary aim of the proposed study is to determine if physiologic insulin therapy
      administered to general hospital inpatients with hyperglycemia favorably affects in-hospital
      complications and mortality, need for intensive care, or length of stay. The secondary aim is
      to determine if the magnitude of benefit derived from this therapy differs (a) in patients
      with known vs. newly diagnosed diabetes, or (b) in medical vs. surgical patients. The study
      will analyze data from a natural experiment that occurred when the applicant institution
      introduced universal physiologic insulin therapy as the standard of care for hyperglycemia. A
      quasi-experimental before-and-after study will compare in-hospital complications, mortality,
      and resource use in patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes before vs. after implementation of
      this standard (n≈6400). Outcomes measured at 7 nearby acute-care teaching hospitals during
      the same two time intervals will provide parallel control data (n≈35,000). Data from the
      control hospitals will make it possible to evaluate whether temporal changes in patient
      characteristics or other variables affecting hospitals in the region could explain effects
      that might otherwise be erroneously attributed to the intervention. Given the high prevalence
      of comorbid diabetes in the hospital and the possibility that universal physiologic insulin
      for managing hyperglycemia may not deliver the intended benefit or could even do more harm
      than good, answering this question is an important goal.
