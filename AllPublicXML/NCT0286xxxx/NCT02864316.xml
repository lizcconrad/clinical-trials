             irradiated site and be considered a radiation-induced tumor.

             must be willing to undergo a pre-treatment tumor biopsy.

          -  Measurable disease.

          -  Progressive disease on study entry.

          -  Received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and developed recurrent or metastatic
             disease within 6 months of completing therapy.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.
