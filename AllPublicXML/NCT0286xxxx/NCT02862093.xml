  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may
      affect neuro-adaptations associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD), potentially influencing
      craving and alcohol intake.

      Investigators investigated alcohol intake and dopamine transporter (DAT) availability by
      Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in the striatum of AUD patients before and
      after deep rTMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included AUD patients. Patients were enrolled by the alcohol addiction unit of the
      Internal Medicine, Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department of the Catholic University in
      Rome, Italy, according to the inclusion criteria. Screening collection of medical history,
      physical, neurological and psychiatric examinations as well as laboratory tests were
      performed. Moreover, patients were underwent to baseline SPECT assessment of striatal DAT
      availability using 123I-N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane
      (123I-FP-CIT) as the radiotracer. Subsequently, patients were randomized in two groups
      (matched for gender and age) by a computer program for the REAL deep rTMS or SHAM. After
      weekly sessions of deep rTMS for four weeks, patients were underwent to the same clinical
      assessment as in the screening phase and second SPECT .

      Moreover, the alcohol intake during both the four weeks prior to the enrollment and the 4
      weeks of rTMS sessions were assessed through the Timeline Followback (TLFB) interview, an
      instrument providing a retrospective estimation of the number of drinks per drinking days,
      the number of drinking days, the number of abstinence days, the number of heavy drinking days
      and the total number of drinks. Patients were also evaluated with Alcohol Dependence Scale
      (ADS), Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAI
      Y1 and STAI Y2),Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale.

    <description>The intervention consisted of deep rTMS of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex through the Brainsway Deep TMS System using an H-shaped coil . The motor threshold was measured by delivering a single pulse to the motor cortex. The site of stimulation was located 5.5 cm anterior to the point at which maximum stimulation of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle was reached. Each patient received a total of 12 rTMS sessions (three sessions per week): 20 trains per session at an intensity of 100% of the motor threshold, 50 pulses per train at a frequency of 10 Hertz, an inter-train interval of 15 seconds.</description>
