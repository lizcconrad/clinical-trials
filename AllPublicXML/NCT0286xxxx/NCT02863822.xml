    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the low fermentable
      oligo-di-monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet in functional dyspepsia (FD). The
      investigators will compare education in the low FODMAP diet to a standard healthy diet for
      improving symptoms in FD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional Dyspepsia (FD) is defined by the Rome III criteria as bothersome postprandial
      fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning in the absence of
      structural or systemic disease that can explain the symptoms. These symptoms have been
      present for at least 3 months with symptom onset 6 months prior to the diagnosis.

      The low fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet has been studied in
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and has been shown to have modest benefit in a
      limited number of small studies. The diet is generally started by complete elimination of
      fructose, lactose, fructans, galactans, and polyols. Following symptom improvement, these
      groups are reintroduced one at a time while the patient monitors for symptoms.

      Although the low FODMAP diet has never been formally studied in patients with functional
      dyspepsia, we have noted the FD patients report improvement in their symptoms on the diet.
      This improvement could be explained by reduction in duodenal and gastric distention with the
      low FODMAP diet or a change in the duodenal flora.

      To date, there have been no randomized trials evaluating dietary modification in FD. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in functional
      dyspepsia. The investigator's hypothesis is that the addition of the FODMAP diet to standard
      medical treatment will result in improved symptom control in patients with functional
      dyspepsia.
