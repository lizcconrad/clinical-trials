             only remaining eye) amenable to a conservative treatment (at least on one eye in
             bilateral disease) but needing initial chemotherapy because of the location, the size
             of the lesion (more than 4 mm of diameter), a vision threat or risks of intravitreal
             relapse making those patients not amenable to chemothermotherapy first line.

             psychological reasons.
