    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of atezolizumab in treating patients with
      cancer following adoptive cell transfer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administration in patients who have
      received adoptive cell transfer (ACT) within 6 months of enrollment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the expansion of engrafted T cells following atezolizumab administration in
      the peripheral blood and within the tumor microenvironment.

      II. To evaluate the phenotype and function of engrafted T cells following atezolizumab
      administration.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. IV. To evaluate the response rate using
      immune related Response Criteria (irRC) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1, or other tumor-specific criteria.

      V. To evaluate survival outcomes and progression free survival using irRC and RECIST v1.1, or
      other tumor-specific criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30- 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days for a total of 17 doses over up to 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and then
      every 3 months thereafter.

               -  Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately
                  October to March); patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine

          -  Patients who have previously tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             are NOT excluded from this study (please note: testing of all patients wishing to

               -  No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention
                  of opportunistic infections

               -  A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard
                  PCR-based tests
