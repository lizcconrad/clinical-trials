  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of falling affects more than one third of people over 65 years old and over 50% of
      persons over 80 years. These falls have important consequences for the autonomy of the
      elderly patient and also increase the risk of sequelae and death.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate a personalized rehabilitation program for elderly
      patients that fall for the first time and to measure the impact on the fear of falling of
      these patients. This intervention is a home-based program combining exercises, home
      modifications and education on fall risk factors.

    <measure>Falls Efficacy Scale (FES-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FES is a 10-item validated questionnaire that can be self-administered or completed during an interview. The person is asked to indicate on a 10-level rating scale his/her level of confidence in his/her capacity to accomplish a variety of activities of daily life (e.g., going up and down the stairs, taking a bath or shower) without falling. A FES score is calculated by adding up the score of each item.</description>
