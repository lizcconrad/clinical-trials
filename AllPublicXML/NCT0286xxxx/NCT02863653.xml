      Objective: To evaluate what factors contribute to social participation restrictions in
      subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), considering the model International Classification
      of Functioning (ICF).

      Methods: Cross-sectional study with 81 individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis, using
      instruments to measure two constructs of component social participation.

      In this study the definition of social participation considered several areas, such as
      marriage and family, work, leisure, religion, economy, and politics which are based in the
      social scales of the questionnaires SF-36 and AIMS2.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Short Form Instruments (social aspect) and Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (social interaction) were used as outcome measures to assess the social participation according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2009 to August 2010</time_frame>
    <description>We evaluated 81 individuals in a single meeting with the SF-36 and AIMS2, each participant was assessed for 2 hours. The revised AIMS2 comprises five main dimensions. The score of each AIMS scale varies from zero to 10 (a score of 10 indicates the worst state of health). The SF-36 is a generic instrument that assesses quality of life and comprises eight dimensions. The SF-36 final score varies from zero to 100 in each of the eight dimensions (a score of 100 represents the best state of health).</description>
