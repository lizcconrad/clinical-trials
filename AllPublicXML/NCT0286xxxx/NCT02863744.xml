      NEED FOR THE STUDY:

      Coronally advanced flap with Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft (CAF+SCTG) technique has
      proven to be one of the most successful modalities for root coverage.1 The success of any
      surgical procedure is dependent on wound healing.

      Wound healing after surgical procedure is complex and highly orchestrated event that includes
      hemostatic phase, inflammatory phase, phase of new tissue formation and the final remodelling
      phase leaving behind collagen rich extracellular matrix (ECM) and a dense and stable tissue.2
      During wound healing clot provides a foundation for the future ECM. ECM plays a vital role to
      prompt cellular migration, adhesion, wound contraction and epithelialization. This crucial
      role of ECM is maintained by a group of enzymes collectively known as Matrix
      Metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs plays a central role in wound healing.3,4 Failure of
      regulation of these MMPs has been correlated with faulty wound healing.3,4 MMPs (i.e.
      collagenases, gelatinases, matrilysins, stromelysins, and membrane type MMPs) are family of
      zinc dependent endopeptidases capable of cleaving extracellular matrix (ECM) in healing
      wounds.3 MMP-8 are primarly produced by neutrophils and are also produced by other cells such
      as oral epithelial cells, plasma cells and fibroblasts.7 MMP-8 is expressed during the
      myelocytic stage of development of PMN (Polymorphonuclear cell) precursors in the bone
      marrow29 and is stored as latent enzyme (pro-mmp-8) within the specific granules of PMN.30
      Pro-MMP-8 is rapidly released from activated PMN undergoing degranulation31 and then is
      activated via cysteine switch mechanism to yield the active form of enzyme.29 MMP-8
      (polymorphonuclear collagenase5) cleaves the triple helix of fibrillar collagen and has
      affinity for type I collagen and type III collagen5 that is abundantly found in connective
      tissue of gingiva. MMP-8 degrades gelatin type VII, VIII and X collagen.5 MMP-8 has been
      implicated to be important for acute wound healing.6 Assessment of wound healing progression
      after surgery is important. Currently blunt surrogate markers such as probing is used.
      Limitation of these markers is that it represents the history of healing and not the ongoing
      activity. As hallmark of healing is collagen remodeling, it is of interest to study the
      cytokine profile that relates to wound healing. Such knowledge may potentially lead to new
      diagnostic strategies to study wound healing in a better way reflecting the healing
      phenotype.

      The function of collagenase during normal wound healing after periodontal surgery has been
      relatively ill-defined due to lack of studies in this area.10 Most of the research has
      concentrated on the characterisation of MMP-8 during pathogenesis of periodontal disease8 and
      the changes in MMP-8 level after periodontal treatment.

      Nwomeh et al studied MMP-8 from dermal wound healing by collecting wound exudate from
      occlusive bandage. He noted that MMP-8 peaked at day 4 and persisted for about a week. MMP-8
      over expression leads to faulty healing.5 Chronic wounds have 30 times greater MMPs than
      acute wounds. Inhibiting excessive protease expression in these wounds may allow a
      prospective wound healing treatment.5 Very less is known about the cellular aspects of soft
      tissue healing in the oral mucosa. The assumption that oral healing is similar to dermal
      wounds might provoke confusion, as there are certain subtle difference like reduced scar
      formation in the dermal wounds2, role of IL-1 in oral wounds and absence of IL-1 in dermal
      wounds11, faster healing in oral wounds, presence of saliva that aids in healing etc. Overall
      it is still a matter of speculation and ambiguity about the differences in the unique healing
      pattern of oral wounds.

      Understanding wound healing at molecular level provides an in depth basis to develop
      treatment strategies that can prevent delayed healing.2 As recommended by Consensus Report of
      10th European workshop on periodontology that, there is a need for more studies at cellular
      level to identify cytokine, chemokine, and intracellular signaling networks for better
      regenerative approaches10, the present clinical trial was designed.

      On account of a considerable lacunae in this area of periodontal research, this study is
      planned to assess the MMP-8 levels during the post-op healing following CAF+SCTG surgery for
      recession coverage and to better identify the mechanism involved in wound healing. This
      information can be used to prevent the normal surgical wound from altered healing experience.

      6.2 REVIEW OF LITERATURE: Sanctis et al. (2011) conducted a study to determine the use of
      connective tissue graft (CTG) in root coverage. The results proved CAF in association with
      SCTG is a valid approach in the treatment of recession defects Nwomeh et al. (1999) assessed
      the sources of collagenases (MMP-8, MMP-1) and their activity in normal healing wounds and
      chronic non healing ulcers. The results showed MMP-8 is predominant collagenase present in
      normal healing wounds and chronic non healing ulcers had increased level of MMP-1,8 and
      decreased levels of TIMP-1 Armstrong et al (2002) reviewed the key role of MMP-8 in wound
      healing as predominant collagenase. He elaborated the expressions of peak levels of MMP-8 at
      day 4 and 7 during normal wound healing.

      Hammerle et al (2014) in a consensus report that reviewed the biological processes of soft
      tissue wound healing in oral cavity, found that oral soft tissue healing at teeth, implants
      and edentulous ridge follows the same phase as skin wound healing and human histological data
      are limited.

      Sorsa et al (2010) compared four methods for gingival crevicular fluid matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP-8) detection i.e., Immunofluorometeric assay, Dip stick test,
      dentoAnalyser immunoblot assay and ELISA kit in their study and concluded that all the assays
      are comparable and dentoAnalyser is among first quantitative MMP-8 chair side testing devices
      in periodontal and peri implant diagnostics and research.

      Fernandez et al ( 2007 ) conducted a study to investigate the role of MMP_8 in cutaneous
      wound healing healing. They observed significant delay in wound closure in MMP-8 -/- mice and
      an altered inflammatory response in their wounds. They indicated that MMP-8 participates in
      wound repair by resolution of inflammation and open the possibility to develop new strategies
      for treating wound healing defects.

      Mohd H et al (1999)19 assessed the levels of MMP-8 and MMP-3 during early healing phase
      following a guided tissue regeneration procedure by assessing GCF (Gingival Crevicular Fluid)
      samples for quantification of MMP-8 and MMP-3. They found that presence of the membrane
      appeared to increase the levels of MMP-3 and -8 and relate to the resorption of the
      bioresorbable membrane by host systems.

      Dickinson et al (2013) studied the early events in periodontal regeneration in the canine
      supraalveolar periodontal defect model by using histologic and immunological techniques and
      concluded that activation of cellular regenerative events in periodontal wound regeneration
      is rapid, the general frame work of tissue formation ( bone, periodontal ligament, and
      Connective tissue) is broadly outlined within 14 days.

      Shaw et al (2009) reviewed wound repair at a glance and described the complex process of
      wound repair. He emphasized that the remodeling of extracellular matrix is accomplished by a
      delicate balance of MMPs.

      Teles et al (2010) measured the levels of GCF biomarkers and subgingival bacterial species in
      periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects. He concluded that clinically healthy sites
      from periodontitis subjects present higher levels of GCF biomarkers and periodontal pathogens
      than sites from healthy subjects.

      6.3 Objective of the study: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect and
      impact of CAF+SCTG for root coverage in Millers class I and II gingival recession sites on
      the MMP-8 levels in GCF and serum.

      The secondary objective is to test the utility of base line MMP-8 level in predicting
      categorically assessed treatment outcomes and correlate it with early wound healing pattern
      following CAF+SCTG for root coverage.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS:

      7.1 Source of data:

      Patients visiting the outpatient Department of Periodontology, Krishnadevaraya College of
      Dental Sciences and Hospital and satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      screened and selected for the study.

      The experimental design will be consisting of a total 15-20 sites who will be recruited for
      the study as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients will be informed about
      the surgical procedure and materials used for the study and an informed consent will be
      obtained from the patients.

      7.2 Method of collection of data:

      Sample size:

      This prospective study will be a single blind comparative clinical control trial with 15-20
      patients having Miller's class I and II recession defects in the maxillary anterior arch.

      Sampling technique

        -  After screening examinations in the initial phase, each subject will receive a session
           of oral hygiene instructions, scaling and root planning with ultrasonic scalers and
           manual curettes.

        -  Surgical treatment of recession defect will not be scheduled until the patient can
           demonstrate an adequate standard of supragingival plaque control (plaque score &lt;20% O
           Leary 1972). The below mentioned clinical parameters will be recorded to the nearest
           millimeter using a UNC-15-probe (University of North Carolina -15 periodontal probe -Hu
           Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) and measuring occlusal stents for positioning measuring probes
           will be fabricated with cold-cured acrylic resin on a cast model obtained from an
           alginate impression. It will be constructed so that it covers the occlusal surfaces of
           the tooth being treated and the occlusal surfaces of at least one tooth in mesial and
           distal directions. It will also be extended apically on the buccal and lingual surfaces
           to cover the coronal third of the teeth. Three grooves will be marked on the stent at
           mesio-buccal, mid-buccal and disto-buccal sites as the reference points15 so that post
           surgical measurement will be made at the same position and angulation as those made
           before surgery ie baseline measurements then after 6 months.

        -  The GCF sample will be collected from gingival sulcus of the tooth indicated for root
           coverage procedure (negative control) and from another tooth wth clinically healthy
           gingiva (positive control). The samples will be collected at baseline and at subsequent
           post surgical followup (fourth day, seventh day and 6 months).

      Clinical measurements:

      The following clinical measurement will be recorded at baseline and after 6 months.

        1. Gingival Recession depth (GRD), measured as the distance between the CEJ and gingival
           margin.17

        2. Gingival Recession Width (GRW), measured as the distance between the mesial gingival
           margin and distal gingival margin.17

        3. Probing Depth (PD), measured as the distance from gingival margin to the base of
           gingival sulcus.17

        4. Clinical Attachment Level (CAL), measurement from the CEJ ( Cementoenamel junction) to
           the base of the gingival sulcus.17

        5. Apico coronal width of keratinised tissue (KTW) measured as the distance from
           mucogingival junction to the gingival margin.17

        6. Wound Healing indices (WHI) will be assessed on 4th and 7th day ( Lien-Hui Huang, 2005)

        7. Plaque Index (Sillness and Loe, 1964)

        8. Gingival Index (Loe and Sillness, 1963)

        9. Gingival Bleeding Index (Ainamo and Bay, 1975)

      SURGICAL PROCEDURE:

        -  Before starting the surgery, root surfaces near to buccal attachment loss will be
           instrumented with mini-five Gracey Currettes and the mechanical treatment will be
           terminated when smooth and hard root surfaces will be obtained.16

        -  Under local anesthesia 2% lignocaine hydrochloride (Ligox 2%, Indoco Remedies Ltd, Goa,
           India) using a No. 15 BP (Bard Parker) blade, a submarginal incision will be made at the
           buccal aspect of the treated tooth and extended 3 mm horizontally in the mesial and
           distal interdental gingiva. An intrasulcular incision will be made at the buccal aspect
           of the involved tooth. Two oblique, divergent releasing incisions will be followed,
           extending beyond the mucogingival junction.

        -  A full thickness flap will be elevated till the MGJ (mucogingival junction) using a
           small periosteal elevator. Subsequently, a partial-thickness flap will be raised beyond
           the mucogingival junction to allow a passive coronal displacement of the flap completely
           covering the CEJ without tension.16

        -  Root planning will be done using a sharp curette.The papillae adjacent to the treated
           tooth will be de-epithelialized to create a bleeding surface for a recipient bed, where
           SCTG will be placed.

        -  The donor site consisting of 2 mm thick palatal connective tissue graft will be
           harvested from the premolar to the first molar area using the 'trap door' technique.14
           The connective tissue graft will be secured in position with 4-0 absorbable sutures in
           recipient sites.

        -  The flaps will be stabilized with sling suture in a coronal position, followed by
           interrupted suture on releasing incisions in an apico-coronal direction using 4-0
           absorbable sutures.14

        -  The surgical sites will be protected with a non eugenol periodontal dressing. Post
           operative instructions will consist of 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse 3 times daily for
           3 weeks and Ibuprofen 600 mg for pain control for three days. 33

        -  Sutures will be removed 7 days after surgery and after this patients will be
           reinstructed in mechanical cleaning of treated teeth with use of soft toothbrush.33

        -  Recall and reinforcement of oral hygiene instructions will be done every 2 months.

      Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling and ELISA:

        -  The subjects will be seated comfortably in an upright position on the dental chair, and
           the selected site will be well illuminated.

        -  GCF samples will be collected after plaque index but before any other clinical
           recordings which would cause tissue irritation and blood contamination of sample.19
           During the 4th and 7th day post surgical follow up ,the periodontal dressing will be
           gently removed and GCF samples will be collected from the gingival sulcus.

        -  After gently drying the area with a blast of air, supragingival plaque will be removed
           without touching the marginal gingiva. The area will be isolated with cotton rolls to
           prevent saliva contamination and GCF will be collected by inserting standard paper
           strips (perio paper; oraflow Inc., Smithtown, NY, USA) into the crevice until mild
           resistance is felt for 30 seconds.19

        -  The GCF sample volume will be measured in a calibrated appliance (Periotron 8000 Proflow
           Inc., Amityville, NY, USA)TM, after which the readings will be converted to an actual
           volume (µl) by reference to the standard curve. The strips from the selected site will
           be transferred in micro centrifuged tubes containing 200(µl) of phosphate buffer
           saline.19

      Serum sampling:

        -  Eight milliliters (8 ml) of blood will be collected from the antecubital fossa after 12
           hour fast in the morning using 20-guage needle with 2 ml syringes and will be
           immediately transferred to the laboratory.

        -  The blood sample will be allowed to clot at room temperature for one hour, serum will be
           extracted from blood by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes. Serum sample will be
           immediately transferred to plastic vial and stored at -800C till the time of assay34
           performed using Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) kit.

      Outcome:

      The primary outcome measured will be :

        -  MMP-8 levels in GCF and serum at baseline and subsequent post surgical follow up after
           CAF+SCTG procedure (4th ,7th and 6 month).

        -  Quantitative analysis of GCF samples at baseline and 4th ,7th and 6 month post surgical
           follow up.

        -  Correlation of GCF and serum MMP-8 values at baseline and 4th ,7th and 6 month post
           surgical follow up.

      The secondary outcome measured will be :

        1. Wound Healing indices (WHI) will be assessed on 4th and 7th day

        2. Gingival Recession depth (GRD)

        3. Gingival Recession Width (GRW)

        4. Probing Depth (PD)

        5. Clinical Attachment Level (CAL)

        6. Apico coronal width of keratinised tissue (KTW)

        7. Plaque Index, Gingival Index and Gingival Bleeding Index

      All the above parameters will be correlated with the MMP-8 levels.

      Statistical analysis

      The values obtained will be compared between the GCF and serum using ANOVA test. Mean
      differences at different time intervals from the baseline value will be tested using
      Mann-Whitney U test separately. A 'p' value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant.
