      N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of depressive symptoms in youth at high-risk for bipolar
      disorder: a functional connectivity study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct an 8-week, open label study of N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of depressive
      symptoms in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder, with resting state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations at baseline and endpoint. This proposal is innovative
      because it investigates the efficacy and tolerability of a novel pharmacological treatment in
      youth offspring of bipolar disorder, and examines the neurophysiology of predictors of mood
      disorders in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder. This study will obtain pilot data to
      propose a larger, neuroimaging-based, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
      N-acetylcysteine in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder. The expected outcome, that
      N-acetylcysteine will be efficacious in ameliorating depressive symptoms in youth at high
      risk for bipolar disorder, and that it will demonstrate improvement in functional
      connectivity within the left frontostriatal circuit associated with treatment response.

    <description>N-acetylcysteine will be initiated at 600 mg PO daily for Week 1, then increased to 600 mg PO twice a day for Week 2, then increased to 600 mg PO morning and 1200 mg PO evening for Week 3, and then increased to 1200 mg PO twice a day for Week 4-8. Doses might be decreased anytime if clinically indicated. Following the study, all patients will be referred to treatment as usual. Adherence will be assessed in weekly visits in the first month and then bi-weekly in the second month. Adherence will be assessed by subject interview, pill counts during each study visit, and by legal guardian interview (if minor).</description>
