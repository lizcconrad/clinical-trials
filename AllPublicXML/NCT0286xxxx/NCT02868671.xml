  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to examine if acupuncture intervention can reduce the onset
      of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and affective and cognitive complaints among mild
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study also hypothesized that compared to those in the sham
      acupuncture and waiting list control groups, patients in the real acupuncture group will have
      fewer symptoms of depressive symptoms, sleep problems and post-concussion symptoms.

      Project Background: Acupuncture has been shown in other settings to alleviate symptoms of TBI
      that are reported to be precursors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including
      affective (depression, anxiety) and somatic (headache, sleep difficulties) complaints.
      Evidence suggests that the increased intensity of these symptoms, particularly greater
      affective distress and injury-associated pain, increases vulnerability to PTSD. By treating
      post-TBI symptoms with acupuncture, these predisposing conditions will improve, and, as a
      result, the incidence of PTSD in this patient population will be reduced.

      Research plan: The overarching focus of this study is the use of acupuncture treatment,
      targeted to symptoms of mild TBI, to reduce the onset of PTSD. The investigators propose a
      randomized, sham procedure and usual care-controlled clinical trial of acupuncture beginning
      at acute phase following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants meeting eligibility
      requirements will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: true acupuncture, sham acupuncture or usual
      care. Acupuncture treatments will continue for one month, at which point all participants
      will be assessed for presence of mild TBI symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and PTSD diagnosis.
      Participants will be evaluated again after one-month acupuncture treatment and follow-up
      post-hospital discharge. The investigators hypothesize that true acupuncture will be more
      effective than sham acupuncture and usual care in reducing these outcomes at after treatment
      and follow-up stage. A subgroup of patients were also randomized selected in each group and
      scanned by 3T MRI scanner at baseline, one-month (after acupuncture treatment) and follow-up.

    <description>Participants will receive treatment four times a week for two weeks and three times a week for two weeks. Participants will be treated with major points: Yintang, Du20 (Bai Hui), LI4 (He Gu), LR3 (Tai Chong), RN4 (Guan Yuan), ST36 (Zusanli) (front treatment) or Du20, GB20 (Feng Chi), SP6 (Sanyinjiao), BL15 (Xin Shu), BL18 (Gan Shu), BL23 (Shen Shu) (back treatment). The position of the treatment will alternate between sessions such that the first session will be on the back, with the next session on the front. In addition to the 6 required points, acupuncturist will be allowed to choose 4 more points. The 4 supplemental points may be chosen from the following: LR2 (Xin Jian), HT7 (Shenmen), PC6 (Neiguan), GB34 (Yang Ling Quan), GB39 (Xuan Zhong), SI3 (Hou Xi), RN6 (Qi Hai), RN24 (Cheng Jiang),KI 3 (Taixi), KI 6 (Zhao Hai), ST40 (Feng Long), SP10 (Xue Hai), BL14 (Jue Yin Shu), BL17 (Ge Shu), BL19 (Dan Shu), BL20 (Pi Shu), BL60 (Kun Lun). Auricular acupuncture will be employed.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to sham acupuncture will receive a 'placebo' acupuncture session. In the sham procedure, a needle guiding tube will be tapped on the surface of the skin near, but not on, each of the 10 acupuncture points that would have been selected for true acupuncture. The needle guiding tube will be used to create sensations that mimic needle manipulation.</description>
