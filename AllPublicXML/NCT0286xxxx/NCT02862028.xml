        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18~65 years old, male or female;

          2. Life expectancy≥6 months;

          3. ECOG score: 0-3;

          4. Advanced solid tumor (lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer) were diagnosed by
             pathological or clinical physicians;

          5. Enough venous channel, no other contraindications to the separation and collection of
             white blood cells;

          6. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR technology will be used to determine the positive EGFR
             family (including EGFR, HER2, HER4) and IGFR1 protein. At least one protein expressed
             in immunohistochemical tumor tissue should be no less than grade 2 or 2+ scores. The
             levels of protein are defined as follows: (according to cell staining) : grade 0:
             without staining; grade 1: 1-25%; grade 2: 26-50% and grade 3: 51-100%; (According to
             the intensity): negative; 1+; 2+ and 3+;

          7. Laboratory examination: white blood cell≥3 x 10*9/L, blood platelet count≥60 x 10*/L,
             hemoglobin≥85g/L; lymphocyte count≥15%, total bilirubin≤100 mol/L; ALT and AST less
             than five times of the normal level; serum creatinine less than 1.5 times of the
             normal level；

          8. Signed informed consent；

          9. Women of child-bearing age must have evidence of negative pregnancy test and be
             willing to practice birth control after 2 weeks following the cells transfusion.

          2. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, unstable coronary disease (uncontrolled
             arrhythmias, unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure (&gt; Class II,
             NYHA), or myocardial infarction within 6 months.

          3. Abnormal lung function: FEV (forced expiratory volume) &lt; 30% prediction, DLCO
             (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) &lt; 30% prediction, blood oxygen
             saturation &lt; 90%;
