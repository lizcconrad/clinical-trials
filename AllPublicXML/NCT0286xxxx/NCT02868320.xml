  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted at the teaching hospital of Misr University for Science &amp;
      Technology. It aimed to examine the use of SMS technology in educating and monitoring
      diabetic patients in Egypt, and assess the impact of educational text messages on their
      glycemic control and self-management behaviors. Participants were randomized into an
      intervention and a control group. Intervention patients received an instruction booklet as
      well as daily educational and weekly reminder messages to better control their diabetes.
      Control patients received the same instruction booklet but no SMS messages. Both group
      patients took an HbA1c test at the beginning and end of the study period and were asked to
      measure their blood glucose once a week and record their readings into a monitoring table
      over 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c levels, which was expected to be
      greater among intervention patients at the end of the study. Secondary outcomes included
      blood glucose levels, treatment and medication adherence, diabetes self-efficacy, rate of
      hospital/ER visits, frequency of blood glucose measurement, among others.
