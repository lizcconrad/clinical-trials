      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pregabalin on patient reported
      outcomes compared with conventional analgesic care in chronic cervical pain patients with
      accompanying upper limb radiating pain (neuropathic component) treated in primary care
      settings under routine clinical practice.

      Rational and background:

      Cervical pain with upper limb radiating pain(neuropathic component), such as cervical
      spondylosis radiculopathy or cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is one of the typical and
      common neuropathic pain. However, in Japan, large number of those patients are treated with
      NSAIDs without adequately assessing the cause of pain, despite that α2δ ligand, SNRI
      (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors ), and TCA (Tricyclic Antidepressants) are
      recommended in the clinical guidelines for neuropathic pain. Therefore, treatment
      satisfaction of these patients is low. This is currently a major issue in treatment for
      cervical pain with neuropathic component in Japan. In fact, our previous study which assessed
      the effect of pregabalin in low back pain patients with radiculopathy suggested that the
      selection of appropriate analgesics according to the cause of pain improved pain related
      sleep interference, pain and function. However, there are a few reports with regard to effect
      of pregabalin in cervical pain patients with neuropathic component. Therefore, we propose to
      conduct an observational study in order to assess the effects of pregabalin in cervical
      radiculopathy, when added to routine clinical care. The present study can encourage an
      understanding of the necessary of assessing cause of the pain, and treating with appropriate
      analgesics.

      Research objectives :

      To evaluate the effect of pregabalin comparing with the conventional analgesic care in
      chronic cervical pain patients with accompanying upper limb radiating pain(neuropathic
      component) treated in primary care settings under routine clinical practice.

      Study design:

      This is an 8-week, multicenter prospective non-interventional observational study. Subjects
      who have chronic cervical radiating pain patients with accompanying upper limb radiating pain
      (with a neuropathic component) and meet all other entry criteria are enrolled at baseline in
      the duration of study. Study arms are pregabalin with or without usual care vs. usual care
      (mono/combo therapy). The usual care are assumed NSAIDs, Antidepressants, weak opioids,
      acetaminophen etc.

      The analgesic treatment is determined by the clinical judgment of the physician in charge of
      patient management. This therapeutic choice is not related to the decision to take part in
      the study. All enrolled subjects will be received with analgesic treatment. The study
      requires 3 visits at least, baseline/enrollment visit, Week 4 visit and Week 8 visit (or
      discontinuation).

    <measure>Change From Baseline at 8 weeks in Pain Related Sleep Interference Scale (PRSIS - Past Week Recall)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Visit 2 (week 4), Final visit (week 8 or discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Related Sleep Interference Scale (past week recall) consists of an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (pain did not interfere with sleep) to 10 (pain completely interfered with sleep). Subjects are to describe how their pain has interfered with their sleep during the past week by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Visit 2 (week 4), Final visit (week 8 or discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is an index of how well patients with cervical pain are able to function with regard to daily activities. The score for the index ranges from 0 to 50 with a lower score indicating better function. In the event that a patient has used rescue medication within 12 hours of the clinic visit, the patient should respond to the questions based on their functional ability in the 24 hour period just preceding the use of rescue medication.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pain Numeric Rating Scale (Pain NRS - past week recall)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Visit 2 (week 4), Final visit (week 8 or discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain NRS (past week recall) consists of an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Subjects are asked to describe their average pain during the past week by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Euro Qol- 5 Dimensions -5 Level (EQ-5D-5L)-QOL-Score-</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Visit 2 (week 4), Final visit (week 8 or discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a copyrighted, subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value or utility score. There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L: A Health State Profile and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Recent guidance suggests that the Health State Profile and VAS should be administered together.
The Health State Profile is designed to record the subject's level of current health for five domains comprising a health profile: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Responses from the five domains are used to calculate a single utility index value.</description>

The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is designed to rate the subject's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100 where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state.</description>

    <time_frame>Final visit (week 8 or discontinuation)</time_frame>

    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: (WPAI: GH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Final visit (week 8 or discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI: GH is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities. Unlike general health or disease-specific measures, the WPAI:GH assesses function-related endpoints to allow a measure of the economic impact of relative differences in either the safety or efficacy of therapeutic endpoints. In this study, the WPAI: GH will measure the effect of the patient's chronic cervical pain with accompanying upper limb pain (neuropathic component) on work productivity and regular activities.</description>
