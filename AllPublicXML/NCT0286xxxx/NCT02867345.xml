    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in treating
      castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Blood samples will also be collected for
      research purposes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study of ex-vivo knocked-out, expanded, and selected PD-1
      knockout-T cells from autologous origin. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups to
      determine the maximal tolerant dose. After the lower number of cycles are considered
      tolerant, an arm of the next higher number of cycles will be open to next patients.
      Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and analyzed as well.

    <description>Peripheral blood lymphocytes will be collected and Programmed cell death protein 1(PDCD1) gene will be knocked out by CRISPR Cas9 in the laboratory (PD-1 Knockout T cells). The lymphocytes will be selected and expanded ex vivo and infused back into patients. Cyclophosphamide at 20mg/kg single dose will be administered 3 days i.v. before cell infusion. A total of 2 x 10^7/kg PD-1 Knockout T cells will be infused in one cycle. Each cycle is divided into three administrations, with 20% infused in the first administration, 30% in the second, and the remaining 50% in the third.Interleukin-2 (IL-2) will be given in the following 5 days, 720000 international unit（IU）/Kg/ day (if tolerant). Patients will receive a total of 2, 3, 4 cycles of treatment.</description>
