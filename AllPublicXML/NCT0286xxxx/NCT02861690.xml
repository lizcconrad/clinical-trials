      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Liposomal
      Paclitaxel With Nedaplatin as First-line in patients with Advanced or Recurrent Esophageal
      Carcinoma.Patients receive Liposomal Paclitaxel 175mg/m2 and Nedaplatin 80mg/m2 every 21 days
      until the presence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>To assess the response rate of Liposomal Paclitaxel and Nedaplatin in patients with pretreated advanced or recurrent esophageal carcinoma. Possible evaluations include: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

    <time_frame>from date of baseline to the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of objectively determined PD or death from any cause, whichever comes first. For patients who are still alive at the time of analysis, and who do not have PD, PFS will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment.</description>
