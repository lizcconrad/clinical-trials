      A randomized clinical study to assess the impact of Symbicort® pMDI medication reminders on
      adherence in COPD patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with substantial associated
      morbidity and mortality. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the US and claimed
      133,965 US lives in 2009. In 2011 12.7 million US adults were estimated to have COPD.
      However, approximately 24 million US adults have evidence of impaired lung function,
      indicating an under diagnosis of COPD. COPD also has a potentially harmful economic impact.
      In 2010, COPD resulted in over 10 million office visits, nearly 1.5 million emergency
      department visits, 700,000 hospitalizations, and 133,575 deaths in the US. In 2010, US total
      medical treatment costs attributed solely to COPD (i.e., excluding comorbidities) were
      estimated to be $32.1 billion with an additional $3.9 billion in COPD costs resulting from
      worker absenteeism. Even in industrialized countries such as the US, where anti-smoking
      initiatives have been relatively successful, the legacy of past smoking behavior in aging
      populations ensures that the COPD burden will unavoidably continue to climb over the next 20
      to 30 years. Adherence rates for inhaled combination therapy is poor (average 3.9 refills per
      year). COPD patients with lower adherence tend to have higher overall healthcare costs, as
      demonstrated in a 24 month study of 33,816 patients in the US, which found: Patients
      continuing therapy had lower costs of care by $3764 compared with patients who had ceased to
      take their maintenance therapy. COPD patients with higher adherence to prescribed regimens
      experienced fewer hospitalizations and lower Medicare costs (-$2185) than those who exhibited
      lower adherence behaviors. Given the poor adherence with inhaled combination therapy seen in
      patients with COPD, and associated morbidity/mortality and economic costs, the present study
      is being conducted to see if medication reminders can be used to improve adherence in this
      population.

    <description>The service known as 'BreatheMate' is a patient support tool that monitors daily Symbicort inhaler use. The BreatheMate service includes a bluetooth monitoring device that is attached to subjects' Symbicort pMDI inhaler which automatically detects and logs their maintenance medication use. Subjects will receive audio-visual daily reminders (beeps and flashes) on the BreatheMate Bluetooth device. The bluetooth device transmits this data to a cellular phone that is provided to all subjects in the study. Subjects in the intervention group will also receive audio-visual alerts (beeps, flashes) from the bluetooth device to take their medication.</description>

             provided.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are
        fulfilled:

          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and/or staff at the study site).

          -  Previous randomization in the present study.

          -  Patients who have been randomized in a clinical study and received an investigational
             product within 30 days of Visit 1 (participation is defined as the completion of a
             treatment related visit).

          -  Current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Known history of drug or alcohol abuse which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             interfere with subject's ability to participate or comply with the study.

          -  An acute exacerbation of COPD that required hospitalization or emergency room visit or
             treatment with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics during the 28 days before Visit 1.
             Patients who had a COPD exacerbation within 28 days of Visit 1 can be re-screened
             once. Re-screening can occur no earlier than 28 days from the last dose of systemic
             steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalization, whichever is later.

          -  Enrolled patients that have a COPD exacerbation during the run-in period, defined as
             worsening symptoms which in the judgment of the Investigator requires treatment with
             systemic steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalization. Patients who had a COPD
             exacerbation during the run-in period can be re-screened once. Re-screening can occur
             no earlier than 28 days from the last dose of systemic steroid and/or antibiotics
             and/or hospitalization, whichever is later.

          -  Any hospital admissions due to ischemic heart disease or heart failure within 3 months
             of study enrollment.

          -  Any significant disease or disorder (e.g., gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurologic,
             musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic, infectious, psychiatric, major physical
             impairment) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the patient at
             risk because of participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study,
             or the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          -  History of lung or upper airway cancer and any other malignancy not in remission for 5
             years or more, except for patients who have had basal cell carcinoma, or in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix provided that the patient is in remission and curative therapy
             was completed at least 12 months prior to the date informed consent was obtained.

          -  Use or planned use of systemic corticosteroids as a maintenance treatment (defined as
             daily or every other day treatment for 21 or more days) for inflammatory or
             immunologic conditions unrelated to their COPD.

          -  Planned hospitalization or surgical procedure requiring inpatient stay during the
             study.

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding or planned pregnancy during the study; fertile women not
             using acceptable contraceptive measures, as judged by the Investigator. Female
             subjects who are not post-menopausal or surgically sterile must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test (urine dipstick test only) prior to randomization and must comply with
             contraceptive methods.

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination or vital signs,
             which in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of
             his/her participation in the study.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to the study therapy (Symbicort).

          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to use mobile communication devices, or patients
             who plan to be away from home for a significant part of the study without access to
             cellular connectivity are excluded because of the challenges of collecting data and
             providing information to these patients who are unable to use the service.

          -  Patients with thoracic surgery within 6 months of Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have received a lung transplant or are currently active on the lung
             transplant waiting list.
