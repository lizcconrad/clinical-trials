  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beyond 60 years, the prevalence of epilepsy is estimated at approximately 1% and increases
      with age. In these patients, the etiology of epilepsy is unknown in 25% of cases, even up to
      55% after 65 years. Although new-onset epilepsy in the elderly is associated with a vascular
      disease in 50% of cases, the hypothesis of an ongoing neurodegenerative process, including an
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), is also common. However, investigators do not have any marker that
      might help to identify the patients who develop epilepsy after 60 years and who might be,
      despite a normal cognitive functioning, already engaged in the pathophysiological process of
      AD.

      A number of data suggest a link between the pathophysiological process of AD and
      epileptogenesis:

      (i) a third of patients with epilepsy develops MA, (ii) the occurrence of epilepsy in AD is
      an aggravating factor for cognition, (iii) in animal models of AD, the relationship between
      neuronal hyperexcitability and amyloid deposits is bidirectional, the amyloid protein has a
      pro-seizure effect and the presence of epilepsy increases the amyloid deposits, (iv) in these
      models, the administration of an antiepileptic drug protects from deterioration of cognition,
      (v) the close relationship between amyloid and neuronal hyperexcitability might be mediated
      by the inflammatory processes associated with AD, and particularly the microglial activation
      which role in epileptogenesis has been shown elsewhere.

      Investigators hypothesize that in a subgroup of patients who develop epilepsy after 60 years,
      the occurrence of epilepsy might reflect the presence of an ongoing amyloid pathology. Our
      goal is to identify through biomarkers of AD in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients who
      develop an epilepsy after 60 years with normal MRI and normal cognition those at high risk of
      later developing clinically defined AD.

      Identifying patients with amyloid pathology which would be expressed through epilepsy before
      the onset of cognitive dysfunction might help to adapt both the management of seizures and of
      the cognitive dysfunction.
