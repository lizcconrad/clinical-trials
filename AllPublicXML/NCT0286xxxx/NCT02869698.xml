  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective research aims to develop the use of Spectral Imaging in addition Dynamics of
      cortical electrical stimulation to identify major anatomical and functional networks in
      epileptic patients candidates for surgery and explored by stereoencephalography, to minimize
      risk of post-surgical cognitive deficits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits after epilepsy surgery are poorly known particularly because the tools
      used to evaluate them. In addition, the prevention of certain postoperative deficits, is
      extremely difficult because of the lack of robust markers to anticipate. The various
      examinations conventionally used for this purpose (neuropsychological testing, functional MRI
      and cortical stimulation) does indeed provide insufficient information or difficult to
      interpret, so the development of improved methods appears as an imperative in the field of
      the epilepsy surgery.

      SID appears as such particularly adapted to the case of epileptic patients explored SEEG to
      provide individualized cognitive map millimeter thereof without requiring, for additional
      invasive act, or risk of inducing unintended crisis. In practice, this clinical research
      project should lead to the definition of several simple cognitive tasks which, together,
      could be achieved by each volunteer patient in two or three hours, and then analyzed in a
      similar time to provide fast, even the patient is still explored SEEG and even before
      cortical electrical stimulation, a list of brain regions involved in most major cognitive
      functions.
