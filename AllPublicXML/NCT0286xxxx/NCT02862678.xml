  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are frequent. The chemoradiotherapy protocols are part
      of the reference treatment of locally advanced stage tumors. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI)
      is a non radiating imaging, not requiring injection of gadolinium, giving informations on
      tumor activity, based on the brownian motion of water molecules. The differences in motion
      are expressed by the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The ADC variations reflect changes
      in water molecules motion and redistribution between the intra- and extracellular
      compartments. Several studies have shown that malignant lesions have an ADC coefficient
      lowered as compared to benign lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      study the diagnostic performance of diffusion MRI performed in early post treatment, notably
      changes in the ADC factor, in the onset of tumor recurrence or progression in patients
      showing no residual tumor at the end a treatment by chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell
      carcinoma of head and neck seat.

      compare the characteristics of diffusion MRI, such as ADC coefficient, between patients with
      residual tumor and patients with no residual tumor after chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell
      carcinoma of head and neck location.
