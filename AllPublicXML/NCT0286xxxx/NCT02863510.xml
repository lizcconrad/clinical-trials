  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot, single-center, prospective, interventional study. The objective is to demonstrate
      that catheter-based renal denervation using carbon dioxide renal angiography in patients with
      moderate to severe chronic kidney disease can be performed for treatment of uncontrolled
      hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal sympathetic denervation has been shown to be safe and effective in patients with
      uncontrolled hypertension and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)&gt;45 mL/min per 1•73
      m². However, the safety and efficacy of this has not been studied in patients with more
      severe renal impairment. The investigators aim to examine safety and efficacy of renal
      denervation (RDN) in patients with eGFR between 44 and 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 (CKD 3b &amp; 4) in a
      pilot study which may be a precursor of a large observational study in the future. Moreover,
      the current imaging protocol and procedure protocol for renal sympathetic denervation
      requires the use of iodinated contrast, which can have deleterious effects on renal function.
      The investigators have a proven track record for the use of carbon dioxide angiography in
      renal artery intervention. The investigators would like to use carbon dioxide angiography in
      this study to minimize contrast induced deterioration in renal function in this cohort which
      may again be a precursor of a farther larger study.
