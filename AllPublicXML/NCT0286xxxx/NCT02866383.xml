    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase 2 study in patients with metastatic PC
      refractory or intolerant to at least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine
      or platinum-containing regimens to determine the efficacy and safety of nivolumab or
      nivolumab plus ipilimumab administered concurrently with high dose RT. Patients with
      metastatic PC who are feasible candidates for radiation and biopsy of primary and/or
      metastatic lesions will be included.

                  part of normal subject care

               -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment
                  schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study

          -  Histopathological confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma prior to entering this
             study OR histopathological confirmation of carcinoma in the setting of clinical and
             radiological characteristics which, together with the pathology, are consistent with a
             diagnosis of PC

          -  At least one measurable primary in-situ (or locally-recurrent) or metastatic tumor
             must be present and, in the opinion of radiation oncologist, be amenable to RT as
             planned in the protocol and at least one additional metastatic tumor that will not
             undergo RT and which is measurable according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Both lesions must
             be accessible for image-guided percutaneous biopsy

          -  There is no upper limit on the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received.
             Patients must have received and failed or intolerance to at least one line of prior
             systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine or platinum-containing regimens for
             unresectable and/or metastatic PC

          -  Age &gt; 18 years and older

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months

          -  ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 0-1

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 2 x 10⁹/L

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 5,6 mmol/l

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10⁹/L

          -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (patients with Gilbert's Syndrome
             must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

          -  ASAT/ALAT ≤ 3 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN if known liver metastasis)

          -  PP ≥ 40 or INR ≤ 1.5

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or CrCl ≥ 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception as
             indicated per protocol. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is insufficient
             information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been done), a
             highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is
             required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in
             consultation with the investigator. WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control
             when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception
             should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for the
             investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. WOCBP should therefore use an
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for
             nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.

          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L
             or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year The investigator shall review contraception
             methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men that are sexually
             active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the
             investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a
             period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five
             half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days,
             respectively. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for
             31 weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half lives)
             after the last dose of investigational drug. Women who are not of childbearing
             potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men
             do not require contraception

          -  Subjects must have signed and dated a BIOPAC IRB/IEC approved written informed consent
             form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained
             before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not part of normal
             subject care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignant ascites that is clinically detectable by physical examination or is
             symptomatic. Evidence of radiographic ascites that is not clinically significant will
             not be exclusion criteria

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4
             antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways

          -  No chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or major surgery within the last 2 weeks prior to
             entering the study

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune
             disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger

          -  Patients should be excluded if they are positive test for hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating
             acute or chronic infection

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other

             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution
             in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

          -  Women with a positive pregnancy test at enrollment or prior to administration of study
             medication

          -  Patients are excluded if they have active brain metastases or leptomeningeal
             metastases. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been
             treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for
             [lowest minimum is 4 weeks or more] after treatment is complete and within 28 days
             prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement
             for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone
             equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration
