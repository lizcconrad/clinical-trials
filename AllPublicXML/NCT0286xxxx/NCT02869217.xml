  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The target populations for this phase I study with TBI-1301 are patients with advanced solid
      tumors. Patients' tumors will be required to express NY-ESO-1, which include but is not
      limited to ovarian cancer, synovial sarcoma, esophageal cancer and malignant melanoma.
      Patients must be positive for HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*02:06 and the patient's tumor tissue must
      be positive for NY-ESO-1 antigen expression. The study will take the subject's T cells, which
      are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified.
      The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own T cells that have been
      genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer cells.

      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back
      to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the
      safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of TBI-1301, to determine the
      recommended phase 2 (RP2D) dose of TBI-1301 when administered following cyclophosphamide
      pre-treatment and to evaluate evidence of efficacy of TBI-1301 using RECIST v1.1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent unresectable solid
             tumor.

          -  HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*02:06 positive.

          -  Tumor NY-ESO-1 expression by immunohistochemistry.

          -  No anti-cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy or immunotherapy within 2 weeks of PBMC
             harvest.

          -  If approved and funded standard therapy is available, subjects must have failed, be
             intolerant to, be ineligible for, or have refused treatment.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or
             calipers by clinical exam. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.
             Patients must have radiographic evidence of disease progression following the most
             recent line of treatment. Areas of previous radiation may not serve as measurable
             disease unless there is evidence of progression post radiation.
