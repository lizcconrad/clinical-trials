    <textblock>
      Introduction: Diabetic mellitus (DM) is a prevalent disease in Hong Kong (HK) and diabetic
      retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common complications of DM. Screening for DR is a
      cost-effective method to identify patients who are at risk of vision loss so that timely
      treatment can be provided to patients. In Hong Kong, the Hospital Authority has recently set
      up screening services (RAMP) in the government outpatient clinics and all DM patients
      attending these clinics will be screened at least once every two years and some every six
      months, according to their individual risks. However, those diabetic patients who attend the
      private sector for their primary care may not have access to this service.

      Aim: This study from the University of Hong Kong aims to determine the characteristics of a
      sustainable approach to setting up an effective and quality-controlled screening service for
      DR in the private primary care sector of Hong Kong and to estimate the potential benefit to
      be gained in terms of impact on avoidable vision loss, costs of care and potential for
      further development of this model in chronic disease care.

      Methods:A screening centre is being set up and a randomised study carried out in which
      screening will be offered at three different fee levels to subjects recruited by their
      general practitioner (GP). The following data will be collected (a) willingness to attend
      screening at the different fee levels (b) screening findings in terms of DR and other eye
      diseases (c) risk factors and other characteristics of those screened and unscreened. The
      information will allow us to estimate the level of fee which best combines effectiveness with
      sustainability in the longer term.
