  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe a safe and consistent technique for neck
      rejuvenation using botulinum toxin. This study will also evaluate the efficiency of the
      intervention and determine the patients that would benefit most.

      The abobotulinumtoxinA will be used for the Nefertiti lift The abobotulinumtoxinA will be
      prepared by adding 2.5 cc of normal saline to a 500-unit Dysport© (Ipsen Ltd, Berks, UK) vial
      Preinjection frontal, oblique and lateral patient pictures will be taken (at rest and with
      contraction)

      Injection points:

        -  A series of 4 injection points 1-2 cm apart on a horizontal line under the mandible
           posterior to the hypothetical line were the nasolabial fold meets the mandible

        -  If present, injection of each platysmal band every 2 cm with 2 to 4 injection points per
           band (Injection of platysmal band will be done by holding the band between 2 fingers and
           injecting intramuscularly) For all injection points 5 units per point of
           abobotulinumtoxinA will be used

      A maximum of 125 units of abobotulinumtoxinA will be allowed for the global neck treatment

      Follow up will be done at 15 days for retouching or for post op pictures if no retouching is
      needed. if retouching is needed post injection pictures will be taken 10 days post retouching

      Retouching: each residual platysmal band will be reinjected every 2 cm with 2 to 4 injection
      points per band (Injection of platysmal band will be done by holding the band between 2
      fingers and injecting intramuscularly) (5 units per point of abobotulinumtoxinA will be used)

      A total of 30 patients will be recruited

    <description>Improvement in Overall appearance (global neck, jowls, skin laxity, platysmal bands, mandibular contour), as assessed by the investigators using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). GAIS will be completed based on photographic assessment comparing post-treatment photos taken at day 15-25 post intervention to baseline photos, to assess overall aesthetic improvement. The GAIS is a 5-point scale (1-5) as follows:
Very Much Improved: optimal cosmetic results
Much Improved: marked improvement in appearance from initial condition but not completely optimal
Improved: obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition but additional treatments are advised
No Change: the appearance is the same as the original condition
Worse: the appearance is worse from the original condition</description>

    <description>Improvement in Overall appearance (global neck, jowls, skin laxity, platysmal bands, mandibular contour), as assessed by the subject using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). GAIS will be completed based on a live assessment of the subject with a mirror in hand for real time assessment and and a photographic assessment comparing post-treatment photos taken at day 15-25 post intervention to baseline photos, to assess overall aesthetic improvement. The GAIS is a 5-point scale (1-5) as follows:
