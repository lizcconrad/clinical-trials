      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if busulfan with cyclophosphamide (when
      given with other helper drugs listed below) can help control acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphoproliferative
      disorder, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative syndrome, Non-Hodgkins lymphoma
      (NHL), Hodgkins lymphoma (HL), or multiple myeloma (MM) when given before a stem cell
      transplant. The safety of these study drug combinations will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Busulfan, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, filgrastim, MMF,
      tacrolimus, and thiotepa are FDA approved and commercially available. It is investigational
      to give cyclophosphamide in combination with busulfan and fludarabine with a stem cell
      transplant.

      You and/or your insurance provider will be responsible for the costs of all drugs and the
      infusion of stem cells.

      Up to 200 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      You will be assigned to 1 of 5 study groups, depending on what type of stem cells you will
      receive, your age, diagnosis, and health status. You will be placed in the study group that
      the the study doctor feels is in your best interest.

      If you are in Group 1, 3, or 5, you will receive busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine,
      tacrolimus, thiotepa, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and a stem transplant with cells from a
      haploidentical donor (a donor that is a half match to yours). If you are in Group 5, you will
      receive a lower dose of thiotepa than Group 1 and Group 3.

      If you are in Group 2 or 4, you will receive busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and
      tacrolimus and a stem cell transplant with cells from a matched related or unrelated donor (a
      donor that is a full match). If you are in Group 2 and have a matched unrelated donor or if
      you are in Group 4, you will receive MMF.

      Central Venous Catheter:

      The chemotherapy you receive, some of the other drugs in this study, and the stem cell
      transplant will be given by vein through a central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile
      flexible tube and needle that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local
      anesthesia. Some blood samples will also be drawn through your CVC. The CVC will remain in
      your body during treatment. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail,
      and you will be required to sign a separate consent form.

      Study Drug Administration:

      For a stem cell transplant, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus
      days. The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after you receive the stem
      cells are called plus days.

      Group 1:

      You will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital.

      If you receive busulfan as an outpatient, you will receive busulfan by vein over about 3
      hours on Days -13 and -12. You will be admitted to the hospital on Day -8 and will receive
      fluids by vein as part of your standard care.

      If you receive busulfan as an inpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -14 and
      will receive fluids by vein as part of your standard care. You will receive busulfan by vein
      over about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12.

      You will rest on Days -11 through -8.

      On Day -7, you will receive thiotepa by vein over 4 hours.

      On Days -6 through -3, you will receive busulfan by vein over 3 hours and fludarabine by vein
      over 1 hour.

      You will rest on Days -2 and -1.

      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein.

      You will rest on Days +1 and +2.

      On Days +3 and +4, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours to help lower the
      risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD -- when transplanted immune tissue, such as stem
      cells, attacks the tissues of the recipient's body). You will also receive mesna by vein over
      30 minutes every 4 hours for a total of 10 mesna doses on Days +3 and +4. Mesna is given to
      lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive tacrolimus nonstop by vein until you are able to take it
      by mouth to help lower the risk of GVHD. You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day
      for about 3 months. After that, your tacrolimus dose may be lowered if you do not have GVHD.
      Your doctor will discuss this with you. You will receive MMF as a tablet by mouth 3 times a
      day for 90 days or longer, if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      Starting 1 week after your stem cell transplant, you will receive filgrastim as an injection
      under the skin 1 time a day until your blood cell levels return to normal. Filgrastim is
      designed to help with the growth of white blood cells and is part of your standard care.

      Group 2:

      You will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital.

      If you receive busulfan as an outpatient, you will receive busulfan by vein over about 3
      hours on Days -13 and -12. You will be admitted to the hospital on Day -7 and will receive
      fluids by vein as part of your standard care.

      If you receive busulfan as an inpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -14 and
      will receive fluids by vein as part of your standard care. You will receive busulfan by vein
      over about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. You will rest on Days -11 through -7.

      On Days -6 through -3, you will receive busulfan by vein over 3 hours and fludarabine by vein
      over 1 hour.

      You will rest on Days -2 and -1.

      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein.

      You will rest on Days +1 and +2.

      On Days +3 and +4, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours to help lower the
      risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD -- when transplanted immune tissue, such as stem
      cells, attacks the tissues of the recipient's body). You will also receive mesna by vein over
      30 minutes every 4 hours for a total of 10 mesna doses on Days +3 and +4. Mesna is given to
      lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive tacrolimus nonstop by vein until you are able to take it
      by mouth to help lower the risk of GVHD. You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day
      for about 3 months. After that, your tacrolimus dose may be lowered if you do not have GVHD.
      Your doctor will discuss this with you. If you have a matched unrelated donor, you will
      receive MMF as a tablet by mouth 3 times a day for 90 days or longer, if the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest.

      Starting 1 week after your stem cell transplant, you will receive filgrastim as an injection
      under the skin 1 time a day until your blood cell levels return to normal. Filgrastim is
      designed to help with the growth of white blood cells and is part of your standard care.

      Group 3 and Group 5:

      You will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital.

      If you receive busulfan as an inpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -21 and
      will receive fluids by vein as part of your standard care. You will receive busulfan by vein
      over about 3 hours on Days -20 and -13. You will rest on Days -12 through -8.

      If you receive busulfan as an outpatient, you may receive busulfan on Days -20 and -13. You
      will rest on Days -12 through -9. You will be admitted to the hospital on Day -8 and will
      receive fluids by vein as part of your standard care.

      On Day -7, you will receive thiotepa by vein over 4 hours. If you are in Group 5, you will
      receive a lower dose of thiotepa than Group 3.

      On Days -6 through -3, you will receive busulfan by vein over 3 hours and fludarabine by vein
      over 1 hour.

      You will rest on Days -2 and -1.

      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein.

      You will rest on Days +1 and +2.

      On Days +3 and +4, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours to help lower the
      risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD -- when transplanted immune tissue, such as stem
      cells, attacks the tissues of the recipient's body). You will also receive mesna by vein over
      30 minutes every 4 hours for a total of 10 mesna doses on Days +3 and +4. Mesna is given to
      lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive tacrolimus nonstop by vein until you are able to take it
      by mouth to help lower the risk of GVHD. You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day
      for about 3 months. After that, your tacrolimus dose may be lowered if you do not have GVHD.
      Your doctor will discuss this with you. You will receive MMF as a tablet by mouth 3 times a

      Starting 1 week after your stem cell transplant, you will receive filgrastim as an injection
      under the skin 1 time a day until your blood cell levels return to normal. Filgrastim is
      designed to help with the growth of white blood cells and is part of your standard care.

      Group 4:

      You will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital.

      If you receive busulfan as an inpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -21 and
      will receive fluids by vein as part of your standard care. You will receive busulfan by vein
      over about 3 hours on Days -20 and -13. You will rest on Days -12 through -7.

      If you receive busulfan as an outpatient, you may receive busulfan on Days -20 and -13. You
      will rest on Days -12 through -8. You will be admitted to the hospital on Day -7 and will
      receive fluids by vein as part of your standard care.

      On Days -6 through -3, you will receive busulfan by vein over 3 hours and fludarabine by vein
      over 1 hour.

      You will rest on Days -2 and -1.

      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein.

      You will rest on Days +1 and +2.

      On Days +3 and +4, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours to help lower the
      risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD -- when transplanted immune tissue, such as stem
      cells, attacks the tissues of the recipient's body). You will also receive mesna by vein over
      30 minutes every 4 hours for a total of 10 mesna doses on Days +3 and +4. Mesna is given to
      lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive tacrolimus nonstop by vein until you are able to take it
      by mouth to help lower the risk of GVHD. You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day
      for about 3 months. After that, your tacrolimus dose may be lowered if you do not have GVHD.
      Your doctor will discuss this with you. If you have a matched unrelated donor, you will
      receive MMF as a tablet by mouth 3 times a day for 90 days or longer, if the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest.

      Starting 1 week after your stem cell transplant, you will receive filgrastim as an injection
      under the skin 1 time a day until your blood cell levels return to normal. Filgrastim is
      designed to help with the growth of white blood cells and is part of your standard care.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Testing:

      About 11 samples of blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing at
      time points before and after you receive your first dose of busulfan. The study staff will
      tell you the blood testing schedule. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body
      at different time points and will help the doctor decide your dose of busulfan for Days -6
      through -3. If the doctor thinks it is needed, PK blood testing may also be done on Day -6
      during your dose of busulfan.

      A heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed
      for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical
      reasons, you will be taken off study. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for up to 3 years after the transplant. You may be taken off study early
      if the disease gets worse, if you have any intolerable side effects, of if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. If you are taken
      off study early, you still may need to return for routine follow-up visits after the
      transplant, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      It may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have begun to receive the study drugs
      but before you receive the stem cells.

      Tests Before Study Drug Administration:

      Before you receive study drugs, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check for
      cytokines. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurs when a large amount of proteins are
      released into the blood. The risks of CRS, some of which are serious, are described in
      greater detail below.

      Study Tests:

      On Day -2 and Day +3, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn to check for
      cytokines. If you have CRS, you may receive steroids by mouth or by vein. Your doctor will
      explain this to you.

      As part of standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the
      transplant. While you are in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn every day
      to check for side effects, for routine tests, to check your blood counts, to check your
      kidney and liver function, and to check for infections.

      After you are sent home from the hospital, you must remain in the Houston area to be checked
      for infections and other transplant side effects until about 3 months after transplant.
      During this time, you will return to the clinic at least 1 time each week. At each visit,
      blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant:

        -  You will have a physical exam and you will be checked for symptoms of GVHD.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn to see how your body has reacted to the
           transplant.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the
           status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the hip or other
           site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a
           large needle.
