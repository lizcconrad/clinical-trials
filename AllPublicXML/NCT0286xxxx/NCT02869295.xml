    <description>This is a first in human, open-label, sequential dose escalation and expansion Phase 1 study of NKTR--214 in adult patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid tumors. The Phase 1 stage of the study is designed as an open-label dose escalation trial of NKTR--214 in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The goal of the dose escalation stage of the study is to find the recommended phase 2 dose, to evaluate the efficacy of NKTR--214 by assessing the objective response rate and to evaluate the safety of NKTR-214. Immunological biomarkers in plasma and tumor samples will also be measured.</description>
