  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, at UVA, handheld ultrasound devices (like those used to view an unborn baby) are
      only two dimensional. The Accuro is a three dimensional handheld ultrasound device. This
      device uses sound waves to create pictures of the spine in three dimensions. This may allow
      the physician to view the spine in more detail for procedures such as spinal anesthesia and
      other diagnostic procedures.

      The investigators aim to assess the benefit of using the Accuro versus traditional landmark
      palpation technique to determine accurate spinal level for procedures. Patients who undergo
      interventional pain procedure per standard care under fluoroscopy and require the presence of
      an anesthesia provider at the UVA Pain Management Clinic will be approached for enrollment.

      Anesthesia Providers will first identify the L4/L5 space using the traditional technique of
      palpating the iliac crests to estimate spinal level, which will be marked with a single dot
      from a marking pen. The provider will then use the Accuro 3000 to identify the L4/L5
      interspace and mark this point with two dots. Participants will then be taken into the
      fluoroscopy suite for their scheduled procedure. Since the skin marks will not show up on
      fluoroscopy, and metal instrument will be laid on the skin at the interspace or interspaces
      that were marked using the palpation and Accuro techniques. The anesthesiology attending
      provider in the fluoroscopy suite will then confirm the true interspace position of these
      marks under fluoroscopy. It will then be recorded how many spaces off the palpation and
      Accuro techniques are from the intended L4/L5 level.

      Patients who are undergoing any interventional pain procedure under fluoroscopy at the UVA
      Pain Management Clinic will be approached for consent.

        -  Each participant will sit up on the edge of the bed in the pre-procedural area of
           fluoroscopy.

        -  For each participant, a provider will first attempt to identify the L4/L5 space using
           the traditional technique of palpating the iliac crests to estimate spinal level. The
           provider will mark this space on the person's back with a single dot from a marking pen.
           The provider will then use the Accuro to again attempt to identify the L4/L5 interspace
           and mark this point with two dots.

        -  The participant will then be taken into the fluoroscopy suite for their scheduled
           procedure a metal instrument will be laid on the skin at the interspace or interspaces
           that were marked using the palpation and Accuro techniques. Metal instruments show up on
           fluoroscopy, but the skin markers will not.

        -  The anesthesiology attending in the fluoroscopy suite will then confirm the true
           interspace position of these marks under fluoroscopy performed for the standard of care
           procedure.

        -  The participant will not be exposed to any additional Fluro/ radiation time for this
           study

        -  It will then be recorded by the anesthesia provider, how many spaces off the palpation
           and Accuro techniques are from the intended L4/L5 level.
