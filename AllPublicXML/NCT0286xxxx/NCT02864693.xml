  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate benefits of a microprocessor controlled
      prosthetic ankle-foot device compared to a non-microprocessor controlled or passive carbon
      fiber prosthetic ankle-foot device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advancements in microprocessor controlled prosthetic ankle-foot systems have allowed
      additional functionality for the lower limb amputee, but research into the effectiveness of
      microprocessor controlled ankle-foot systems has been limited.

      In this research study, differences in perceived mobility, functional capabilities and gait
      parameters between energy storing and returning and microprocessor controlled ankle-foot
      mechanisms will be identified where they exist. Also a comparison of the initial function
      with a new system compared to the function after a four week accommodation period will
      provide insight into the time it takes for the prosthesis user to experience a benefit from a
      microprocessor ankle-foot.
