  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soccer is a sport that attracts many participants and leads to a substantial number of
      injuries, especially of the ankle. Enhancement of functional joint stability by kinesio
      taping proprioceptive training may be important both in prevention and rehabilitation of
      ankle injuries. The main aim of this study was to determine the effect of kinesio taping and
      proprioceptive exercises on parameters related to ankle stability, such as the injury
      incidence, pain, static or dynamic stability and flexibility, in amateur soccer players
      training 3 times a week.

    <description>Assessed by the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). The Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) is a dynamic test that requires strength, flexibility, and proprioception. The goal of the SEBT is to maintain single leg stance on one leg while reaching as far as possible with the contralateral leg. Subjects are instructed to stand with both feet positioned inside the boundaries of the starting box. A trial initiates when the subject begins to reach in one of the four diagonal directions. In this study anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral directions will be evaluated. When reaching along the lines to the subject's right, the subject uses his right leg to reach while using his left leg as the support limb and vice versa. Subjects are not allowed to touch the ground with the reaching leg at any time during the reach. The maximal reach distance is the furthest point along the directional line.</description>

    <measure>Static balance</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Unipedal Stance Test. Subjects are asked to close their eyes and to stand barefoot on the limb of their choice, with the other limb raised so that the raised foot is near but not touching the ankle of their stance limb. Prior to raising the limb, the subject is instructed to cross his arms over the chest. The investigator uses a stopwatch to measure the amount of time the subject is able to stand on one limb. Time commences when the subject raises the foot off the floor. Time ends when the subject either: (1) uses his arms (ie, uncrossed arms), (2) uses the raised foot (moves it toward or away from the standing limb or touches the floor), (3) moves the weight-bearing foot to maintain his balance (ie, rotates foot on the ground), (4) a maximum of 45 seconds has elapsed, or (5) opens eyes. The procedure is repeated 3 times and each time was recorded on the data collection sheet. The average of the 3 trials is recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the toe touch test. The subject stands on a box with his feet together and toes pointing forward. He is asked to bend from the hips forward and try to touch the ends of his fingers to the tips of your toes, without bending his knees. He should go as far as possible without pain, and try to keep his knees straight through the whole test. The distance to the basal line (top of the box) or over it is measured by a flexible tape.</description>

    <description>This group included 16 subjects. They received kinesio taping for both ankle joints and and performed proprioceptive exercises.
Proprioceptive exercises were incorporated into their normal training routine (twice per week), and included 20 min of standardised proprioceptive exercises: single leg balancing on stable surfaces, on bosu/togu balls, and hopping activities, all repeated with eyes open/closed. Kinesio taping technique was used on both ankles on the first day of training with the aim of functional and mechanical correction, following the method described by Duenas et al. It was removed on the second day of training.</description>

    <description>This group received placebo kinesio taping for ankle joint (no tension) and performed proprioceptive exercises.
Proprioceptive exercises were incorporated into their normal training routine (twice per week), and included 20 min of standardised proprioceptive exercises: single leg balancing on stable surfaces, on bosu/togu balls, and hopping activities, all repeated with eyes open/closed. Kinesio taping technique was used on both ankles on the first day of training in the same way as before but with no tension. It was removed on the second day of training.</description>
