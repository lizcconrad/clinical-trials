  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cosavirus and Salivirus are two new genera of Picornaviridae and are responsible for acute
      diarrhoea. They have been identified in the pathological stools of infants and
      immuno-compromised subjects on every continent with prevalences ranging from 2.8% to 8.8%
      depending on the virus, the cohort and the country studied.

      To date, no study on these two viruses has been conducted in France to evaluate the
      circulation and the pathogenicity of these viruses in subjects with diarrhoea.

      The aim of this study is thus to:

        -  show that these viruses are in circulation in France in infants younger than 5 years old
           and that the proportions are similar to those reported in the literature.

        -  confirm the relationship between the diarrhoea and the infection with these viruses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children younger than 5 years

          -  Children hospitalized or consulting at Dijon CHU during the 12 months of the study for
             acute gastroenteritis. Acute gastroenteritis is defined by at least 3 soft or liquid
             stools or at least 3 bouts of vomiting within 24 hours or signs (diarrhoea or
             vomiting) accompanied by at least 2 additional symptoms among diarrhoea or vomiting,
             abdominal pain, fever

        for controls

          -  Children younger than 5 years old

          -  Children hospitalized or consulting at Dijon CHU during the 12 months of the study for
             any illness without diarrhoea (other than exclusion criteria).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons without national health insurance cover

          -  Children older than 5 years.

          -  Children presenting chronic diarrhoea (&gt; 2 weeks) (e.g. Crohn and UC)

          -  Children with immune deficiency.

          -  Children with nosocomial gastroenteritis; the nosocomial aspect will be defined as the
             onset of acute diarrhoea occurring after the 48th hour after admission

        for controls

          -  Persons without national health insurance cover

          -  Children older than 5 years.

          -  Children with chronic diarrhoea (&gt; 2 weeks) (e.g. Crohn and UC)
