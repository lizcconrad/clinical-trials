  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal for the study is to test the efficacy of a smartphone app which includes an
      alcohol brief intervention (SP-BI) versus an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) condition for National
      Guard members in the State of Ohio who meet criteria for at-risk drinking in the previous 3
      months. The main hypothesis is that those in the SP-BI group with have reduced frequency and
      intensity of at-risk drinking and fewer binge drinking episodes.

      The project is a fully-powered randomized controlled trial of a smartphone app which includes
      an alcohol brief intervention (SP-BI) versus an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) condition for
      National Guard members in the State of Ohio, who are already participating in the OHARNGMHI
      study, titled &quot;Resilience and Risk Factors Associated with Deployment Related Posttraumatic
      Psychopathology&quot;, who meet criteria for at-risk drinking in the previous 3 months. After
      tailoring the content of the SP-BI intervention for NG soldiers, the study will screen ~
      3,100 individuals over the three year enrollment period as part of the larger ongoing
      longitudinal assessment of ONG members in the OHARNG MHI, to identify 750 participants with
      at-risk drinking. These ONG members will be randomized to either the SP-BI or the EUC
      condition and followed for one year. Participants who are randomized to the SP-BI condition
      will receive an informational brochure with resources available to members of the military
      related to mental health and alcohol use and will download a free app on to their
      smartphones. The app will be developed to be used on both Android and iPhone platforms and
      will be used over 12 weeks to deliver the study intervention. Those assigned to the EUC
      condition will receive the informational brochure only. All subjects will be contacted to
      complete 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up assessments.

      The specific aims of the study are to compare SP-BI and EUC in: 1) Reducing the frequency and
      intensity of at-risk drinking at 3 -, 6- and 12-months; 2) Decreasing binge drinking at 3-,
      6- and 12 months. The secondary aims are to: 1) Compare the SP-BI and EUC conditions in
      reducing the frequency of illicit drug use and depressive symptoms at 3-, 6- and 12-months;
      2) Examine if deployment status moderates the effect of intervention assignment (SP-BI or
      EUC) on post-intervention drinking, depressed feelings, and other substance use.

    <description>Participants in the SP-BI group will receive a 20-30 minute intervention through an app program based on the FRAMES format: providing personalized Feedback (regarding substance use, risk factors), emphasis on Responsibility for change, Advice, Menu of options, Empathic clinical behaviors, and support of Self-efficacy regarding making changes. The intervention is designed to address the target behavior of alcohol use, and will include a tailored review of participants' goals/values, feedback regarding their alcohol use patterns and consequences (either actual experiences or potential based on risk behaviors), developing a discrepancy between their alcohol use and ability to meet goals and values through a decisional balance exercise, and formulation of a &quot;change plan&quot;.</description>

             to treatment for those with more serious problems
