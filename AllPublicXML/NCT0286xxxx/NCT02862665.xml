  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In complex cardiac surgery with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, allogeneic blood products
      transfusions are often necessary to control intraoperative and postoperative bleeding.
      Furthermore, approximately 50% of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery are anemic before
      surgery, and patients with normal hemoglobin level may become anemic during and/or after
      surgery. Perioperative transfusion carries risks far beyond transmission of infection and has
      been demonstrated to be associated with adverse outcomes related to postoperative pulmonary
      complications, decreased renal function and increased mortality. Thus, the important of blood
      conservation stratigies to minimize transfusion is being increasingly emphasized. In recent
      trial by Johansson and colleagues, they concluded that the perioperative administration of
      intravenous iron isomaltoside 1000 increased the hemoglobin level and prevented anemia 4
      weeks after cardiac surgery. Therefore, perioperative iron isomaltoside 1000 administration
      among the patients undergoing complex valvular heart surgery could reduce not only the
      perioperative allogeneic transfusion but also the incidence of postoperative adverse events.
      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of perioperative iron isomaltoside 1000
      administration on transfusion requirements in patients undergoing complex valvular heart
      surgery.
