  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam in critically ill patients
      who have suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patients will be evaluated for development
      of augmented renal clearance and the effects and duration of effects this may have on
      levetiracetam clearance.
