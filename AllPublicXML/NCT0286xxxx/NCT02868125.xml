  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no standardized protocol regarding the post-operative radiographic follow up of
      patients that sustain pertrochanteric hip fractures and are treated with closed reduction and
      internal fixation. The policy in the investigator's institution as in other hospitals is to
      conduct a radiogram of the operated hip during the first days following operation after the
      patient bore weight on the fixated femur. The investigator's goal is to asses the added value
      of this policy and to offer recommendations regarding this specific followup component.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus regarding the proper radiographic protocol following closed reduction
      and internal fixation of pertrochanteric femoral fractures. Despite its' questionable
      necessity and significant economic burden, many medical centers practice a policy of imaging
      internally fixated proximal femurs after the patients bore weight on them. The investigator's
      goal is to assess the added value of the postoperative imaging study described.

      Materials and methods: We will conduct a prospective study. All patients who will be treated
      with closed reduction and internal fixation of AO31A fractures will be enrolled. Two sets of
      imaging studies will be assessed- the intra-operative AP and axial fluoroscopy studies and
      the radiograms that are taken following bearing weight on the operated hip. Three decision
      steps will take place regarding weight bearing limitations and a necessity for re-operation-
      (1) Immediately after the operation; (2) A day after the operation; (3) Following weight
      bearing according to a new radiogram. Objective measurements will be taken for each hip on
      both imaging modalities- neck-shaft angle, neck length and tip-apex distance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in weight bearing instructions on follow up x ray imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>OIne week</time_frame>
    <description>During the few day following surgery a decision has to be made regarding weight bearing limitations on the operated hip. patients can be instructed to: (1) Full weight bearing, (2) Partial weight bearing, (3) Touch-down weight bearing, (4) Non weight bearing. This decision is primary taken according to the intra-operative fluoroscopy images, and revised a few days later after examining the first follow up x-ray imaging of the operated hip. The investigators wish to learn whether a new data from the first follow up imaging study leads to changes in weight bearing instructions. If a change was made due to new findings on follow up x-ray, then the case would be regarded as &quot;change&quot;, while if no changes were made they would be regarded as &quot;no change&quot;. Finally the investigators will calculate the number of patients that need to go through follow up x-ray imaging studies in order for one patient to have their weight bearing instructions changed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in neck shaft angle between intra-operative fluoroscopy and follow-up x ray imaging studies</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>Neck-shaft angle is the angle between the femoral neck and femoral shaft, measured in degrees. The investigators wish to find whether there is a difference in the measurements' outcome for the same patients on intra-operative fluoroscopy and on the first post-operative followup x-ray imaging studies. The angle described will be calculated on both modalities and compared, with the outcome being the difference in degrees.</description>

    <measure>The need for reoperation</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>During the few day following surgery a decision has to be made regarding need for re-operation. This decision is primary taken according to the intra-operative fluoroscopy images, and revised a few days later after examining the first follow up x-ray imaging of the operated hip. The decision is based on both objective features such as nec-shaft angle, tip-apex index and neck length, and on subjective features such as the patients' basic medical functional status. The investigators wish to learn whether a new data from the first follow up imaging study leads to changes in the decision for re-operation. If a change was made due to new findings on follow up x-ray, then the case would be regarded as &quot;change&quot;, while if no changes were made they would be regarded as &quot;no change&quot;. Finally the investigators will calculate the number of patients that need to go through follow up x-ray imaging studies in order for one patient to be advised differently for re-operation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in neck length between intra-operative fluoroscopy and follow-up x ray imaging studies</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>Neck length is the distance between the femoral neck base and the femoral head, and is measured in millimeters. The investigators wish to find whether there is a difference in the measurement outcome for the same patients on intra-operative fluoroscopy and on the first post-operative followup x-ray imaging studies. The length described will be calculated on both modalities and compared, with the outcome being the difference in millimeters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in tip-apex distance between intra-operative fluoroscopy and follow-up x ray imaging studies</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>Tip apex distance is the sum of the distances measured on both AP and axial studies between the proximal lag screw tip and the proximal femoral head border . It is measured by millimeters. The investigators wish to find whether there is a difference in the measurement outcome for the same patients on intra-operative fluoroscopy and on the first post-operative followup x-ray imaging studies. The length described will be calculated on both modalities and compared, with the outcome being the difference in millimeters.</description>
