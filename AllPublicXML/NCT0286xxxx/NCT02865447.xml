      Sponsor is conducting this post-market study to evaluate the clinical outcome and femoral
      bone mineral density (BMD) changes associated with the PROFEMUR® PRESERVE hip stem when used
      as indicated for primary total hip arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip
      joint.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in the study, subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Subject is minimum age 21 years, maximum age of 80

          -  Subject is a candidate for primary THA for osteoarthritis of the hip

          -  Subject is able to undergo primary elective THA procedure

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete required study visits and assessments

          -  Subject is willing to sign the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC)
             approved Informed Consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:

          -  Overt infection;

          -  Distant foci of infections (which may cause hematogenous spread to the implant site);

          -  Rapid disease progression as manifested by joint destruction or bone absorption
             apparent on roentgenogram;

          -  Skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age at time of surgery);

          -  Inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or inadequate
             abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint which would
             make the procedure unjustifiable;

          -  Neuropathic joints;

          -  Known Hepatitis or HIV infection;

          -  Neurological or musculoskeletal disease that may adversely affect gait or
             weight-bearing

          -  Subjects with known osteoporosis of the affected hip

          -  Subjects with prior arthroplasty of the affected hip

          -  Subjects that are clinically obese (&gt;40 body mass index [BMI])

          -  Subjects with femoral dysplasia of the affected hip

          -  Subjects with trochanteric osteotomy of the affected hip

          -  Subject with inflammatory arthritis of the affected hip

          -  Subjects currently taking, or have taken within 12 months of enrollment,
             bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone (PTH), fluoride therapy or strontium ranelate or
             patients taking other chronic medications that in the investigator's opinion are known
             to affect BMD in a substantial way

          -  Subjects with severe medical condition(s) that in the view of the investigator
             prohibits participation in the study

          -  Subjects currently enrolled in another clinical study which could affect the endpoints
             of this protocol

          -  Subjects with known substance abuse issues

          -  Subjects who are incarcerated or have pending incarceration
