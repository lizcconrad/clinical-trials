    <textblock>
      This study is designed to study brain mechanisms associated with symptoms and severity of
      Fibromyalgia. This will be accomplished by relating results from PET scans to self-reported
      and objective measures of disease severity.

      The purpose of this study is to examine µ-opioid receptor (µOR)-mediated neurotransmission in
      patients diagnosed with persistent pain, fibromyalgia (FM), and its relationship with pain
      and affect measures. µOR activation is expected to take place in the following brain regions:
      rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate (rACC, dACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), thalamus
      (THA), nucleus accumbens (NAC), amygdala (AMY), periaqueductal gray (PAG). Greater regional
      activation is expected to be associated with improvements in clinical pain ratings and
      affective state.

      The endogenous opioid system and µ-opioid receptors (µORs) play a central role in the
      regulation of pain, the pathophysiology of chronic pain syndromes, mood and emotion; this
      system is dysregulated in persistent pain syndromes. A substantial body of literature
      addressing these mechanisms has been developed in our laboratory, including recent data on
      the cognitive and molecular mechanisms associated with reductions in pain, as well as trait
      personality and genetic predictors of emotional effects in the context of pain.

      Eighty individuals who have been diagnosed with FM and who fit the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled in this 14-week protocol. An initial visit for informed consent
      procedures and baseline characterization will then be scheduled, as well as the visits for
      positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures. Subjects
      will return for testing after 6 and 14 weeks.

      Volunteers will undergo imaging with structural and functional MRI and PET with
      [11C]carfentanil to determine baseline µOR non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) and
      changes in those BPND measures coinciding with symptom severity at the time of scanning.

      Blood will be sampled at baseline to test for genes that may be associated with the function
      of the chemical signals between nerve cells, function of hormones, and symptoms. The genetic
      portion of the study is optional.
