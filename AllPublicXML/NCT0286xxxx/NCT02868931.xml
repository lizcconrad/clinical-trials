  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled, prospective trial with a 6-month follow-up. A newly
      developed treatment and education programme for diabetic patients with an insulin pump
      therapy (INPUT) will be tested compared to a waiting group. Primary outcome variable is the
      difference in glycemic control between baseline and the 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcome
      variables are: severe hypoglycaemia, diabetes-related distress, depressive symptoms,
      health-related quality of life, diabetes empowerment, self-care behavior, hypoglycemia
      awareness, and attitudes towards insulin pump therapy.

  <detailed_description>

      INPUT is a self-management-based treatment and education program for diabetic patients with
      an insulin pump (CSII). It is designed to empower patients to adequately perform their
      therapy in daily life and to integrate their diabetes and their insulin pump into their lifes
      in order to enhance quality of life.

      INPUT ist tested in an randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a waiting-list control group
      since no certified and effective treatment and education program for CSII exists.

      This study is a multi-center study. Study centers are specialized diabetes practices
      throughout Germany. Patients will be approached by their respective practice and informed
      about the study. Study measurements as well as the conduct of INPUT will take place at the
      respective practice.

      Baseline measurement will take place 2 weeks prior to the beginning of INPUT. After
      completion of baseline measurement, all patients from one study center will be randomized
      centrally by the Research Institute of the Diabetes Academy Mergentheim (FIDAM). 2 weeks and
      6 months after the completion of INPUT, follow-up measurements will be conducted at the
      respective study center.

      HbA1c as a marker of glycemic control will be analyzed in a central laboratory. Secondary
      outcome measures will be assessed via psychometrically tested questionnaires, Case Reports
      Forms, or patient files.

    <description>The hypoglycemia awareness questionnaire provides a score indicating the severity of hypoglycaemia unawareness. This scale ranges from 0 (maximum hypoglycaemia awareness) to 7 (minimum hypoglycaemia awareness), where a score of 4 suggests reduced hypoglycaemia awareness.</description>

    <description>Empowerment is measured by a German version of the Diabetes Empowerment Scale, a measure of diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with current treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with current treatment is assessed via a 10-item scale. The total score ranges from 10 to 60 with lower scores indicating higher satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Attitudes towards insulin pump therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Specific attitudes towards different aspects of insulin pump therapy are assessed via Likert scales. The questionnaire consists of 6 subscales that can be placed within 4 dimensions: (I) Expectations on insulin pump therapy (subscale: achieving better glycaemic control) (II) Perceived advantages of an insulin pump (subscale: gaining more flexibility) (III) Ease of use (subscales: design + functionality) (IV) Psychosocial effects and barriers (subscales: technological dependence + impaired body image)</description>

    <description>INPUT consists of 12 lessons comprising all relevant information in order to treat diabetes with an insulin pump. Patients learn to effectively use the different features of their pump in order to improve not only glycemic control but also to improve the implementation of pump therapy in daily life. Psychological and motivational aspects of living with diabetes and living with an insulin pump are addressed as well.</description>
