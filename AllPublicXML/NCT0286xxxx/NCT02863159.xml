    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the uncorrected binocular distance, intermediate,
      and near visual acuities, and assess patient's spectacle independence and satisfaction in
      individuals undergoing bilateral cataract extraction that have received two different arms of
      near add design IOLs of the same diffractive multifocal model.

      This will be a multi-center, parallel comparison clinical study design with two treatment
      groups. One hundred (100) qualified study patients will receive a +2.75D (ZKB00) Tecnis
      Multifocal 1-Piece IOL in their dominant eye. Of these study patients, 50 patients will
      receive the +3.25D (ZLB00) Tecnis Multifocal 1-Piece IOL in their non-dominant eye and the
      other 50 patients will receive the +4.00D (ZMB00) Tecnis Multifocal 1-Piece IOL in their
      non-dominant eye. each study patient will undergo the same routine cataract extraction
      procedures for each eye, with the second eye scheduled to undergo cataract extraction within
      7 to 30 days after the first eye. In addition, as is customary for the surgeon, each study
      patient will receive the same open-label pre-operative, operative and post-operative
      medications over the course of the study period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient with bilateral cataracts for which phacoemulsification extraction and a
             posterior multifocal IOL implantation has been planned for both eyes.

          -  Male or female in good general health, 21 years of age or older at the time of the
             pre-operative examination and willing to have surgery on their second eye within 7 to
             30 days of their first eye.

          -  A patient must be willing to comply with study instructions, agree to make all office
             appointments, and complete the entire course of the study.

          -  A patient has the visual potential of 20/32 or better in each eye after cataract
             removal and IOL implantation in the judgment of the investigator.

          -  A patient with a preoperative corneal astigmatism of ≤ 1.5D in each eye
             [intraoperative management of corneal astigmatism is permissible, and may include
             arcuate incision(s) or LRI(s).]

          -  A patient has a post-operative astigmatism target of ≤ 0.5D in each eye.

          -  A patient with clear ocular media other than cataract in each eye.

          -  A patient with normal OCT of the macula in each eye or a macula judged to be normal by
             the investigator by clinical examination.

          -  A patient with naturally dilated pupil sizes of &gt; 3.5mm, evaluated under mesopic
             illumination.

          -  A patient must be able to read, comprehend and be willing to give HIPAA and Informed
             Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient with a known pathology that may affect visual acuity (as determined by the
             investigator); particularly retinal changes that affect vision (macular degeneration,
             cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, etc.) in either eye.

          -  A patient with amblyopia or strabismus.

          -  A patient with capsular or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative
             centration or tilt of the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome) in either eye.

          -  A patient with pupil abnormalities (non-reactive, tonic pupils, abnormally shaped
             pupils, or pupils that do not dilate as least 3.5mm under mesopic/scotopic conditions)
             in either eye.

          -  A patient with evidence of Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy on slit-lamp
             examination in either eye.

          -  A patient with evidence of keratoconus or significant irregular astigmatism on

          -  A patient with a history of ocular trauma, or ocular surgery in either eye.

          -  A patient that may, or is expected to undergo surgical intervention and/or ocular

          -  A patient that had refractive surgery (LASIK, LASEK, RK, PRK, etc.) prior to cataract
             surgery in either eye.

          -  A patient with a history of wearing PMMA lenses within 6 months, gas permeable lenses
             within one month, or extended wear daily soft contact lenses within seven days of
             their scheduled surgery.

          -  A patient that requires the use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect
             vision.

          -  A patient with an uncontrolled acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase
             risk or confound study results (e.g. diabetes, immunocompromised, etc.).

          -  A patient with any uncontrolled systemic disease. A potential patient in whom therapy
             for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized will not be considered for entry into the
             study.
