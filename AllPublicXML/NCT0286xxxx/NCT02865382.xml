      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the world.Colonoscopy is the gold
      standard screening test for colorectal cancer.There are also emerging data to support that
      screening by colonoscopy reduces both the incidence and mortality of colorectal
      cancer.However,Colonoscopy could still miss colorectal adenomas and even cancer.The miss rate
      for colonic adenomas was reported to be ranging from 15 to 32% in tandem colonoscopy
      studies.The reasons for the miss rate may be technical(insufficient during excessively fast
      instrument withdrawal),but may also be the imaging method.Smaller lesions ,particularly flat
      ones ,may be missed as a result of their subtle appearance and limited contrast in relation
      to the surrounding mucosa.

      Some image-enhanced modules were developed with an aim to improve colorectal polyp or adenoma
      detection.The widely available modules is the narrow band imaging(NBI).However,most studies
      failed to demonstrate any superiority of NBI system over white light colonoscopy in detecting
      colonic polyps.NBI provides dimmer images of the colonic mucosa ,which may limit its
      performance on polyp and adenoma detection.

      Like NBI,OE technology is image-enhanced module,providing a more intense look at the vascular
      pattern morphology.Besides,OE technology provides an much brighter image compared to NBI.This
      may possibly increase polyp detection by enhancing visibility of the colonic mucosa with
      brighter image.The current study aims to tested whether OE technology would improve adenoma
      detection when compared with high-definition colonoscopy.
