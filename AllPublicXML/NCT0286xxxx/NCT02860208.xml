  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the 3-year outcomes of
      anti-infective surgical treatment of peri-implantitis when a regular supportive peri-implant
      therapy (SPIT) programme was followed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients enrolled in this prospective study all received surgical treatment for
      peri-implantitis at one of 2 treatment centres (specialist periodontal practice, Molndal and
      Gothenburg, Public Dental Health Services, Region Vastra Gotaland, Sweden) and were enrolled
      between October 2010 and December 2013.). All were treated by experienced periodontists.

      Details of the peri-implantitis treatment protocol have been described in a previous
      publication reporting on the 12-month clinical and radiographic treatment outcomes,
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01857804) and approved by the Regional Ethical
      Committee, Gothenburg, Sweden (Dnr. 654-10).
