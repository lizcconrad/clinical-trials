    <textblock>
      The incidence of type one diabetes is still rising, especially in children under 5 years old.
      Mothers often are the primary caregivers of these children. To take care of a young child
      with diabetes is a great responsibility and mothers must be constantly vigilant. This study
      aims to assess the psychological state of these mothers (in term of depression, anxiety,
      stress, coping, fear of hypoglycemia) and factors which influence this state.
