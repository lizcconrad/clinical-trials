      This study objective is to evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect of two
      trabecular micro-bypass stents (iStent inject) in eyes of subjects with primary open-angle
      glaucoma on one topical hypotensive medication
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is as follows:

      Prospective

      Subjects with medicated IOP &gt; 18 mmHg and ≤ 30 mmHg

      Subjects on one topical ocular hypotensive medication prior to stent implantation

      Implantation of two iStent devices (if IOP is &lt; 6 mmHg, at any point during the postoperative
      follow-up, medication will not be prescribed or will be discontinued)

      IOP will be measured by two (2) observers to minimize bias; observer 1 will look through the
      slit lamp and turn the dial with readings being masked, and observer 2 will document the IOP

      Diurnal IOP measurements

      Follow-up through 60 months postoperative (but could be up to 61 months if subject needs to
      undergo terminal washout)

      Descriptive statistics will be tabulated

      Medical therapy considered necessary for the subject's welfare can be implemented at any time
      during the study at the investigator's discretion

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Screening Exam Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Phakic patients or pseudophakic patients with posterior chamber intraocular lenses
             (PC-IOLs).

          -  Primary open-angle glaucoma (including pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative).

          -  Cup-to-disc ratio ≤ 0.9.

          -  Visual field defects, or nerve abnormality characteristic of glaucoma.

          -  One topical hypotensive medication at time of screening exam.

          -  Intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; 18 mmHg and ≤ 30 mmHg (medicated) at screening exam.

          -  Study eye BCVA 20/100 or better.

          -  Normal angle anatomy as determined by gonioscopy.

          -  Absence of peripheral anterior synechia (PAS), rubeosis or other angle abnormalities
             that could impair proper placement of stent.

        Baseline Exam Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has completed appropriate medication washout.

          -  Mean IOP &gt; 22 mmHg and ≤ 38 mmHg after anti-glaucoma medication washout period.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Screening Exam Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Aphakic patients or pseudophakic patients with anterior chamber IOLs (AC-IOLs).

          -  Prior stent implantations (study eye).

          -  Traumatic, uveitic, neovascular, or angle-closure glaucoma; or glaucoma associated
             with vascular disorders.

          -  Functionally significant visual field loss, including severe nerve fiber bundle
             defects such as Bjerrum scotoma.

          -  Prior incisional glaucoma surgery.

          -  Iridectomy or laser iridotomy.

          -  Ineligibility for ocular hypotensive medication washout period as determined by the
             investigator such as: visual field status would be placed at risk by washout period,
             or unmedicated IOP after washout period would be expected to exceed upper limit of ≥
             38 mmHg.

          -  Congenital or traumatic cataract.

          -  Retinal or optic nerve disorders, either degenerative or evolutive, that are not

             etc.).

          -  Chronic ocular inflammatory disease or presence of active ocular inflammation (e.g.,
             uveitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, retinitis).

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

        Baseline Exam Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject did not complete medication washout.

          -  Mean IOP &lt; 22 mmHg or &gt; 38 mmHg after anti-glaucoma medication washout.
