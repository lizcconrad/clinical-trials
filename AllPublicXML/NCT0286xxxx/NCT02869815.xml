  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      is controversial. Lower detection rate and higher false negative rate are the main problem.
      The purpose of this study is to determine the detection rate and the false negative rate of
      SLNB by indocyanine green (ICG) in addition to blue dye (methylene blue) after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients with large or locally advanced breast cancer. This is a single arm
      clinical trial.

      Patients indicated for neoadjuvant therapy would be recruited in this study. During the
      surgery, SLNB using the dual tracing method would be applied before axillary clearance. After
      the surgery, histological results of the SLN and non-SLN would be analysed.

    <description>ICG+Methylene Blue Arm:
One ml of methylene blue (1%) would be in injected sub-areolarly 5 minutes before surgery, and 1ml of ICG (0.125%) in the same site 3 minutes later. Massage of the breast would be applied to facilitate the movement of the tracers. A small incision would be made in the axilla, and a special device would be used to search the light nodes. During the sampling, blue nodes would also be resected . After the completion of SLNB, complete axillary dissection would be carried out.</description>
