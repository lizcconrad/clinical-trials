  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital ichthyosis (CI) is a large, heterogeneous family of inherited skin disorders of
      cornification resulting from an abnormality of skin keratinization, such as scaling and
      thickening of the skin. Treatment options include keratolytic agents, which can abruptly lead
      to extensive shedding or peeling of scales. PAT-001 primarily acts as a keratolytic agent;
      thus, making it a potential drug candidate for the treatment of skin disorders associated
      with hyperkeratinization, such as CI. The current study intends to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of PAT-001 in patients with CI of either the Lamellar or X-Linked subtypes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of CI is a life-long endeavor, which remains largely symptomatic (i.e.,
      emollients with or without keratolytics agents) and commonly focused on reducing scaling
      and/or skin lubrication with both systemic and topical treatments. A first-line therapy
      includes hydration and lubrication accomplished by creams and ointments containing low
      concentrations of salt, urea, or glycerol, which increase the water-binding capacity of the
      horny layer. Addition of keratolytics agents are used to decrease corneocyte cohesiveness, to
      promote desquamation, and to dissolve keratins and lipids (e.g., Î±-hydroxy acids, salicylic
      acid, high dose urea, propylene glycol, N-acetylcysteine, and retinoids). Systemic retinoid
      treatment is reserved for those patients refractory to topical agents because of long-term
      adverse effects and teratogenicity.

      This is a two part, Phase 2, multicenter, proof-of-concept (POC) study of the safety and
      tolerability of PAT-001 for the treatment of Congenital ichthyosis (CI) in patients ages 12
      years of age and older. Part 1 will be a double-blind, randomized, vehicle controlled,
      bilateral comparison of two treatments (PAT-001 [0.1% or 0.2%] vs. vehicle) for eight (8)
      weeks.

      Part 2 will be a double-blind, active only treatment comparison of the two PAT-001
      concentrations (0.1% or 0.2%) for an additional four (4) weeks. Subjects will have the option
      to participate in the PK portion of the study.
