  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although clinical presentation of influenza is often symptomatic, asymptomatic cases also
      occur. The knowledge of the incidence of asymptomatic influenza among healthcare workers is
      very important because of the risk of cross-transmission to hospitalized patients. The
      principal objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic
      influenza among healthcare workers in short-stay wards. The results of this study will lead
      to a better understanding of the burden of asymptomatic influenza among healthcare workers
      and might be used as an argument to increase influenza vaccine coverage among healthcare
      workers.
