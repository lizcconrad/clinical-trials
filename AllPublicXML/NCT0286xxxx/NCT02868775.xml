    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study, with a recruitment goal of 60 patients. Patients who are
      female, above the age of 18, and with a diagnosis of IC/BPS based on clinical criteria and
      O'Leary Sant ICPI and ICSI scores undergoing cystoscopy, hydrodistention and bladder biopsy
      will be included. The bladder biopsies will be evaluated for TLR4 expression, and sent for
      histological assessment of mast cell count. Additionally, data will be collected at baseline,
      day of surgery, day 7, day 14 and day 28. Data will include validated questionnaires, lower
      urinary tract symptoms, and recorded pain medication use.
