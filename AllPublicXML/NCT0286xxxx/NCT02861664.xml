    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental dentifrice containing stannous
      fluoride, an established dentine tubule occlusion technology, at reducing dentine
      hypersensitivity (DH) compared to a negative control dentifrice. The test and control
      dentifrices will be administered for a total of 8 weeks, with assessments (via evaporative
      air and tactile stimuli) at baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks twice-daily use.

      This single centre, randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, 2 treatment arm, parallel group
      design study, stratified by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score (of the two selected
      teeth), with a treatment period of 8 weeks will investigate the clinical effectiveness of an
      experimental stannous fluoride dentifrice in the reduction of DH. DH will be assessed at
      Baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks treatment to monitor clinical efficacy and safety.

    <description>The examiner will indicate the participant's response to the evaporative air stimulus, after the stimulation of each individual tooth, using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale as follows: 0 Participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus, 3 Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and requests discontinuation of the stimulus.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in tactile threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will assess the response to a tactile stimulus using a Yeaple probe which allows the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10 grams (g) and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force is reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth is determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses is recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used will be 20g; at all subsequent visits, it will be 80g.</description>
