  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous lymphomas are the most frequent extranodal lymphomas after digestive lymphomas. A
      quarter are B-cell lymphomas. 80% of cutaneous B cell lymphomas are indolent cutaneous B cell
      lymphomas. These indolent cutaneous B cell lymphomas are characterized by good prognosis
      (survival rate at 5 years: 90%), but also by the frequency of cutaneous recurrences. The
      radiotherapy is currently the most widely used treatment, with complete response rate close
      to 100% for a lesion treated. However, it has limits when there are outset multiple lesions
      inaccessible to a single radiotherapy field (concerning one case in three), or during
      recurrences. In these situations, conventional chemotherapy is not recommended and
      multi-field radiotherapy is often used empirically, but its effectiveness has never been
      studied prospectively.

      Recently, retrospective studies with small numbers patients (totaling sixty patients)
      reported complete response rates of 80 to 100% with rituximab (anti-cluster of
      differentiation antigen 20 (CD20) antibodies) used as monotherapy in non-standardized
      treatment by intravenous with a recurrence rate of less than one case in three. These data
      suggest that rituximab by intravenous with a standardized initial cycle followed by a
      maintenance therapy could improve the prognosis of indolent cutaneous B cell lymphomas with
      multiple lesions or of recurrent lesions.

      Compare the efficacy and safety of two treatment strategies for indolent cutaneous B cell
      lymphomas with multiple or recurrent lesions: Rituximab by intravenous versus multi-field
      radiotherapy.
