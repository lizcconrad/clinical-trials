  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of The LEAN project intervention is to promote weight loss, healthy dietary habits,
      increased physical activity, improved blood glucose and cholesterol, and weight related
      quality of life in obese African American adults through a sustainable, technology enhanced,
      church-based program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LEAN Project is a community-based weight loss program that is delivered through churches
      serving lower-income, obese, African American adults. The intervention will involve training
      community health coaches to deliver the intervention. These community health coaches will be
      individuals who are members of the church and who are willing to be trained on how to deliver
      behaviorally-based, empirically proven, lifestyle change interventions. These community
      health coaches will be trained by the staff at Pennington Biomedical, who have experience
      training and delivering these types of interventions. The community health coaches will
      deliver the intervention through their respective church after being trained. Weekly text
      messages will be sent to participants in order to supplement the intervention sessions and
      provide support. The primary aim is to determine if the trained community health coach
      church-based intervention will result in significant weight loss. Secondary aims will assess
      blood glucose, cholesterol, physical activity, food intake, and weight related quality of
      life.

    <description>The Alere Cholestech LDX® Analyzer is engineered to provide accurate, actionable, and readily accessible glucose testing results. The Cholestech uses fingerstick sampling and small sample size (40μL) that makes results less time consuming and easy to obtain.</description>

    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Month 6 and Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured using an automatic blood pressure cuff (Omeron, Model BP710 or similar). Participants will rest for approximately 5 minutes prior to blood pressure measurement to ensure accurate at rest reading.</description>

    <measure>Change in Food Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Month 6 and Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) fat screener estimates the percentage of energy from fat by asking patients to report the frequency of consuming specific foods over the past 12 months. A standard 7-item fruit and vegetable screener developed by the NCI and National 5 a Day Program grantees asks how often fruit and vegetables were consumed in the past month.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Month 6 and Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire is a self-report measure of physical activity. The metabolic equivalent task (MET) minutes in each domain of leisure time activity, that is, sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity, will be calculated. The IPAQ has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of physical activity and has been sensitive to changes in physical activity resulting from intervention programs.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 6 and Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant's satisfaction with the different elements of the study, including the community health coaches, the intervention, and the text messages, will be measured using a questionnaire developed by the investigators.</description>

    <description>Churches in the delayed treatment control condition will receive information on various health topics relevant to African Americans, such as strokes, lupus, sickle cell, etc. via text message during the first six months. Participants in this group will not receive any behavioral strategies designed to alter weight, physical activity, or diet during this time. They will receive the community health coach delivered church based weight loss intervention after 6 months.</description>

    <description>The intervention will involve utilizing trained community health coaches to deliver the weight loss intervention. There will be 10 group based sessions conducted at each church over 6 months. Session frequency will be 4 weekly sessions (4) for the first month, bimonthly sessions for 2 months (4) and monthly sessions for 2 months (2). The study is based upon weight loss strategies that have been utilized in the Diabetes Prevention Program. The group sessions will be augmented by utilizing text messages. The text messages will be delivered weekly and three types of messages will be delivered: 1) lesson content, 2) motivational, 3) behavioral prompts.</description>
