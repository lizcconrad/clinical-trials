  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim was to examine the feasibility of an Energy Conservation + Problem Solving
      Therapy (EC+PST) intervention delivered over the telephone and to evaluate the preliminary
      intervention effect on fatigue impact in daily activities in post-cardiac arrest (CA) adults
      with chronic fatigue.

      The primary aim was to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants for
      an Energy Conservation + Problem Solving Therapy (EC+PST) intervention delivered over the
      telephone, to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention, and to assess the
      appropriateness of the outcome measures. The secondary aim was to evaluate the preliminary
      intervention effect on fatigue impact, activity performance, and participation in daily
      activities in post-cardiac arrest (CA) adults with chronic fatigue.

    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing the participants' satisfaction and the acceptability of the intervention
Four-point scale ranging from 1 to 4, and a total score ranging from 8 - 32 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring the severity of fatigue by self-report
Total score is the mean of scores ranging from 1 to 7, and a higher score indicates having more severe fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring overall fatigue by self-report and computerized adaptive test
Total score ranging from 10 to 90 with the average score of the US general population is 50. The higher the total score, the worse the fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Functional Activities Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring perceived performance in higher level instrumental activities of daily living by self-report

    <description>The intervention was delivered by telephone. Each EC+PST intervention session was planned to last approximately 45 minutes and occur twice a week for up to 4 weeks. Sessions terminated when the participants identified and solved two fatigue-related problems of their choice or had participated in the intervention for eight sessions. A Participant Workbook was used throughout the intervention. During eight intervention sessions, participants identified two fatigue-related problems and solutions for them, implemented the solution plans, and reviewed the implementations.</description>
