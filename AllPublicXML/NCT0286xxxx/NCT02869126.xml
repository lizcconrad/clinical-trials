    <textblock>
      The purpose is to demonstrate the concordance of diagnostic information obtained with:

        1. a conventional examination with 2 distinct recordings on D.SPECT camera after
           99mTc-sestamibi injections, the first post-stress and the second at rest, 2 to 3 hours
           later,

           and

        2. a double isotope examination with a supplementary recording after injection of a little
           activity of thallium-201 at rest after the first recording and before the second
           injection of 99mTc-sestamibi for conventional recording at rest,

      in patients showing abnormalities of myocardial perfusion in stress myocardial
      tomoscintigraphy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial perfusion tomoscintigraphy is very used for diagnosis and characterization of
      abnormalities of stress and rest myocardial perfusion. This examination can be performed with
      semiconductor gamma cameras that are more performant than conventional cameras regarding
      spatial resolution, detection sensitivity and energy resolution.

      The amelioration of energy resolution could allow the realization of simultaneous recordings
      of a dye injected at rest and another injected during stress (double isotope recording),
      while conventional examination needs 2 different recordings, stress and rest, separated from
      several hours.

      In this study patients undergo a conventional examination with D.SPECT camera with 2
      recordings, the first after injection of a little activity of 99mTc-sestamibi at stress (≤
      100 MBq) and the second, 2 hours later, after injection at rest of a 3 time bigger activity
      of 99mTc-sestamibi (≤ 300 MBq). An activity of thallium-201(≤ 50 MBq) is injected at rest
      after the first recording of stress. 5 minutes later, a supplementary double isotope
      recording is realized with D.SPECT camera (99mTc-Sestamibi-stress / thallium201-rest).

      The demonstration of the hypothesis of this study could considerably diminish the duration of
      the examination (from 3 to 4 hours to less than 1 hour).
