      Koning Breast CT (KBCT) was approved by FDA PMA. The X-ray detector originally used in Koning
      Breast CT was PaxScan 4030CB. Recently, Koning Breast CT uses a modified X-ray detector
      PaxScan 4030MCT. The modified detector is essentially identical to the previous model except
      a different detector housing which allows a narrower dead-space between the active area and
      the top of the housing.

      The benefit of the modified detector is that it allows Koning to modify the patient exam
      table, achieving a flatter surface in the center. The flatter surface will increase patient
      comfort and improve workflow.

      Meanwhile, flatter surface may also affect patient positioning and the coverage of the
      breast. The adequacy of the overall image quality with the new table/detector should be
      verified by radiologists.

      verified by radiologists.

      Images from ten (10) female patients (cases) with different breast sizes will be evaluated by
      3 independent board-certified, MQSA-qualified radiologists (readers). The images were
      acquired from a separate clinical trial using KBCT system with the new table/detector.

      Two readers will independently evaluate the image quality of each case and choose to &quot;accept&quot;
      or &quot;reject&quot; the case. If there is a disagreement for a certain case, a third reader will
      independently evaluate that case and give the final result.

        It is reported that digital mammography has reject rate between 8% and 10% and positioning
        is the major reason of rejection [1]. In order to prove that the KBCT detector/table is
        able to provide correct position and sufficient image quality to achieve equal or lower
        rejection rate than mammography, a minimum number of 10 cases is required.
