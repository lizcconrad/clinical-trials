    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized pilot study to test the efficacy of neuromodulation via caloric
      stimulation on vestibular migraines. All subject who meet the study criteria will be in an
      active treatment group. All subjects will report the frequency of the migraines and undergo
      periodic testing of symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, non-randomized pilot study of individuals with vestibular migraines.
      The goal is to test the efficacy of neuromodulation on both migraine and dizziness symptoms
      in patients with documented vestibular migraines. Treatment will consist of 9 months of
      active treatment followed by 3 months of observation. The active treatment requires two daily
      20 minute sessions wearing a device over the ears that delivers a very small amount of warm
      air to the ears. All subjects will undergo a series of tests at baseline and at discrete
      intervals during the 1 year of observation.

      Primary and Secondary endpoints are listed below:• Primary Efficacy Endpoints

        1. Reduction in the frequency and severity of migraine headaches (self reported in pain
           diary)

        2. Reduction in the frequency and intensity of perceived vestibular symptoms (Dizziness
           Handicap Inventory (DHI), Activity Balance confidence scale (ABC), Oscillopsia Test,
           Symptoms questionnaire), OVRT Goggle profile.

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints for the Pilot Study

        1. Improvement in sleep quality and/or quantity as assessed by the Epworth Sleep Scale.

        2. Improvement in quality of life as assessed by the HIT-6 survey.

        3. Improvement in mood/anxiety as assessed with the T2 Mood Tracker app (National Center
           for Telehealth &amp; Technology).

    <description>The following parameters will be set for active treatments using the CVS Device:
A standardized CVS time-varying waveform lasting approximately 19 minutes will be used. Treatments will be administered up to twice daily. The two daily treatments should ideally be separated by at least one hour.
The waveform schedule will consist of a warm sawtooth delivered to one ear and a cold sawtooth delivered to the other ear. The warm sawtooth will go from body temperature to 42 °C, and the cold sawtooth will go from body temperature to 17 °C. The two waveforms will be delivered simultaneously, but will have different oscillation frequencies.</description>
