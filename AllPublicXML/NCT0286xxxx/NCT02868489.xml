    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is to determine the effect of bacillus coagulans and galactomannans
      (LactoWise®) administration on microbiota of obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy by
      observing standard protocol measurements in patients following sleeve gastrectomy: blood
      markers and weight, in addition incorporating the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index
      (GIQLI)

      Loma Linda University's School of Allied Health Professions in collaboration with the
      Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Department under the Surgery Division is conducting research
      to evaluate the influence of LactoWise® (a proprietary blend of probiotic and prebiotic -
      bacillus coagulans/galactomannans, respectively) on the normal microbiota of obese patients
      post bariatric sleeve gastrectomy. Pre-surgery, participants will be required to sign a
      consent form and to complete the Gastro-Intestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). A total of
      60 bariatric sleeve patients will be recruited for this investigation. Post-surgery
      participants will be randomized into two groups, one will receive LactoWise® and one be the
      control (placebo). The LactoWise® blend has 300 mg of the bacillus coagulans and
      galactomannans and contains around 4.5 billion live cells. Daily intake of capsules coupled
      with bariatric sleeve standard of care will be conducted for the duration of 3 months, which
      is the anticipated clinical timeline. Participants will also be asked to complete the quality
      of life questionnaire at each of the following follow-ups post-surgery: 2nd week, 6th week,
      and 3rd month.

      Outcome measures will be the standard protocol for bariatric sleeve patients at the Metabolic
      and Bariatric Surgery Department which will include weight measurements, blood work. In
      addition to the standard of care procedures a research procedure to be added is the GIQLI.
      Pre and post clinical consults, administration of probiotic/prebiotic formulae, and
      follow-ups will be conducted at the Faculty Medical Offices - General Surgery - Bariatric
      Clinic at Loma Linda University Health.

    <description>Changes in weight expressed will be based off of the percent excess body weight loss (%EBWL) which is the weight loss relative to ideal weight expressed as a percentage. For the calculation of %EBWL the ideal body weight will be based off of BMI 25. BMI will be measured in kg/m^2. Studies have shown that changes in the physical structure or manipulation of the gastrointestinal system may influence normal microbiota which can be characterized by changes in metabolism which in turn will be tested by changes in weight</description>
