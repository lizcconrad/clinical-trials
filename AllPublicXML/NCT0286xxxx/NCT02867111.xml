  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is considered a disease by the World Health Organization and it is increasing
      worldwide affecting more than 70 million couples. About 50% of the cases are due to male
      inability to fertilize the oocyte. In the last 40 years, several techniques, known as
      Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) have been developed to treat infertility, but the
      efficiency is still relatively low (around 30%) whereas the remaining 70% attempts again
      several times, an expensive and emotionally moving treatment. Over 4million of infertility
      treatments are practiced around the world per year and a 50% increment is expected over the
      next 6years. Even though ART allows the birth of babies that would be impossible under
      natural circumstances, it is still necessary to improve the procedures in order to increase
      treatment efficiency. The success of ART depends, to some extent, on sperm quality. Indeed,
      the relevance of spermatozoa quality is notorious even beyond fertilization, extending to
      embryo development and implantation. In this context, it has been developed a new technology
      that allows the selection of those spermatozoa at their best functional state (Sperm
      Selection Assay, SSA; Patent approved for USA and Europe, pending for Japan and Argentina).
      This method is based on the attraction of spermatozoa ready to fertilize the egg, towards a
      physiological attractant molecule. The SSA may be applied to improve diagnosis and
      infertility treatment. The investigators hypothesis states that the use of the SSA will
      improve the number of good-quality embryos which are the ones to be transferred by
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), providing a healthy embryo development. The protocol
      involves three experimental groups where the SSA will be used or not, before performing the
      ICSI: 1)SSA containing the sperm attractant molecule, 2)SSA without the attractant molecule,
      and 3)without SSA. The patient inclusion criteria involve female factors associated to tubal
      obstruction and/or endometriosis and male factors associated to sperm disability. Several
      outcome parameters will be determined, the percentage of fertilization, embryo quality, rate
      of pregnancy and rate of birth. The study will be carried out in the Universitarian Institute
      of Reproductive Medicine (IUMER) which has been recently established in a public hospital
      depending on the National University of Córdoba, offering free high complexity infertility
      treatment to patients without health insurance or economic support

    <description>Capacitated spermatozoa may be oriented by following an increasing concentration gradient of an attractant molecule, a phenomenon called sperm chemotaxis. This is a guidance mechanism observed in vitro, which may transport and retain spermatozoa at the fertilization site. Though several molecules have been suggested to attract human spermatozoa, in the context of gamete interaction prior to fertilization, progesterone has biological importance for several reasons. After ovulation, this hormone is secreted by the cumulus cells that surround the oocyte, diffusing to form a molecular gradient toward the periphery of the cumulus and beyond. Notably, a gradient of very low concentrations (picomolar) of progesterone is sufficient to chemically attract capacitated human spermatozoa</description>
