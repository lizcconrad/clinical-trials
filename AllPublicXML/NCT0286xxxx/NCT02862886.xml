      CHRONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY

        1. Information provided to study participants

        2. Collection of written informed consent

        3. Harvesting of myometrial biopsies

        4. Creation of tissue explants using myometrial biopsies

        5. Stimulation of the explants with LPS

        6. Study of the effect of SAR150640 (beta3-adrenergic agonist) on LPS-induced oxidative
           stress Moreover, demonstrating the ability of beta3-adrenergic receptor agonists to
           prevent the appearance of oxidative stress and its consequences on tissues, as a
           complement to previous studies, is an additional argument for the clinical development
           of this class of pharmaceuticals in the management of threatened premature delivery and
           labour induction.

    <description>In vitro measurement of the ability of SAR150640 to prevent the release of free radicals (oxidative stress) induced by an inflammatory stimulus on tissue explants of the human myometrium. The level of oxidative stress will be determined using simultaneous assays of DAF/DHE using HPLC. This reference technique for the overall evaluation of oxidative stress is perfectly mastered at the LPPCE (Laboratoire de Physiopathologie et Pharmacologie Cardiovasculaire et Experimentales)</description>
