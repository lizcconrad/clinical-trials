    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major complication and the leading cause of hospitalization
      among people with diabetes mellitus. It occurs in 15% of all patients with diabetes and
      precedes 84% of all lower leg amputations. Despite many therapeutic advances over the past
      decades, including dressings (hydrocolloids, alginate, skin substitutes) and growth factors,
      healing rates of DFU remain low.

      Mechanisms of faulty wound healing in diabetic patients are complex, related to both
      intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The main reasons for impaired healing appears to be:
      1/exhaustion of local cell populations that promote wound healing; 2/excessive production of
      matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) coupled with reduced expression of the tissue inhibitors of
      MMPs; 3/impaired neovascularisation coupled with reduced numbers of endothelial progenitor
      cells and impairment of their functioning. These imbalances may result in excessive
      degradation of extracellular matrix components, as well as an inappropriate local
      inflammatory response .

      Adipose-derived stroma vascular fraction provides a rich and easily accessible source of
      autologous cells for regenerative medicine applications. Il contains multipotent stem cells
      and progenitors called adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) able to stimulate wound
      healing. There are attracted to the wound site where they supplement the wound bed with
      similar cell types, secrete numerous growth factors and cytokines, increase macrophage
      recruitment, enhance granulation tissue, and improve vascularisation . The reparative
      capabilities coupled with good safety of ADRCs have been illustrated in a study for treating
      severe and irreversible radiation-induced lesions, and in a study for treating sclerodactyly
      in patients with diffuse scleroderma. Numerous case reports showing healing of refractory
      wounds following treatment with autologous ADRCs have also been reported.

      Based on these previous reports, the present study aims to assess the efficacy and tolerance
      of injection of ADRCs for the local treatment of neuropathic or neuro-ischemic DFU.
