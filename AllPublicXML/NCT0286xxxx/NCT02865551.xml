  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to compare the rate of urinary retention among female patients after
      vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia, depending on bladder catheterization type, either
      by a foley catheter inserted adjacent to epidural anesthesia or intermittent catheterization
      applied every 4 hours during labor.

  <detailed_description>

      An explanation about the study will be delivered to each participant and each participant
      will sign a confirmed consent. Patients will be randomized between 2 groups of treatment: 1.
      intermittent catheterization applied every 4 hours during labor. 2. foley catheter inserted
      adjacent to epidural anesthesia.

      In patients with a foley catheter, the catheter will be removed soon after delivery.
      Participants will be followed by a clinician post labor. An abdominal US will be performed
      either 4 hours after delivery or after the participant urinates to check the bladder volume.

      Patient information including demographic information, information regarding the patient`s
      pregnancy and delivery will be collected from the patient`s electronic record.
