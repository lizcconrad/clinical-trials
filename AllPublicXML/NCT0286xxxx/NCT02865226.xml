  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-thoracotomy pain is one of the most severe. The local analgesia allows its effective
      control and a reduction of postoperative morbidity and mortality.

      The gold standard for local analgesia is the thoracic epidural. However, this technique can
      be dangerous with severe complications.

      The paravertebral block showed comparable efficacy to the thoracic epidural for local
      analgesia . In addition, it has a better safety profile. There are several installation
      techniques. The difference in efficiency of these laying techniques is unknown.

      Compare the clinical effectiveness of two strategies of realization of paravertebral block:
      by the anesthetist before incision (paravertebral block guided by ultrasound) and by the
      thoracic surgeon at chest closure (paravertebral block visual).
