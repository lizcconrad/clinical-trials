    <textblock>
      [18F]GP1 targets platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor in thrombus. [18F]GP1 PET/CT imaging will
      noninvasively assess thrombus in whole body with good sensitivity with information of
      thrombus. Safety, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, internal radiation dosimetry and
      diagnostic performance of [18F]GP1 will be assessed in all subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is ≥ 19 years of age and male or female of any race/ethnicity.

          -  Patient has signs or symptoms of acute DVT of the leg, acute PE or ATE; or had
             arterial intervention or surgery, such as endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm
             repair preferably within 14 days prior to the planned study with [18F]GP1.

          -  Patient has thromboembolic focus/foci confirmed by standard imaging modalities within
             5 days prior to administration of [18F]GP1.

          -  Patient has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 at
             time of screening.

          -  Patient has clinical laboratory tests that are within the following ranges, determined
             within 7 days prior to administration of [18F]GP1:

               -  White blood cell count ≥ 3.0 x 109/L;

               -  Platelets ≥ 75.0 x 109/L;

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 3.0 times upper limit of normal;

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal; and

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be excluded from this study if the patient does not fulfill the inclusion
        criteria, or if any of the following conditions are observed:

          -  Patient or patient's legally acceptable representative does not provide written
             informed consent.

          -  In case of acute DVT or PE, patient has a previous history of objectively diagnosed
             DVT or PE.

          -  Patient had pretreatment with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors within 15 days before
             the administration of [18F]GP1

          -  Chemotherapy is scheduled to given to patient before or within 24 hours after
             administration of [18F]GP1.

          -  Female patient is pregnant or nursing.

          -  Patient has concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease
             other than cancer (e.g. congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, severe
             pulmonary disease, chronic renal or hepatic disease which could compromise
             participation in the study) in the judgment of the investigator.

          -  Patient is a relative of the investigator, student of the investigator or otherwise
             dependent.

          -  Patient has been involved in another investigative clinical study involving
             administration of an investigational drug from preceding 4 weeks before to 24 hours
             after administration of [18F]GP1.

          -  Patient has been previously included in this study.

          -  Patient has any other condition or personal circumstances that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, might make collection of complete data difficult or impossible.

          -  Additive-related precautions: This investigational product contains sodium bisulfite,
             a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and
             life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The
             overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and
             probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in
             nonasthmatic people.
