    <textblock>
      The Laryngeal Tube Suction Disposable( LTS-D) has recently undergone considerable structural
      changes in design. As these changes may influence the performance of the LTS-D relative to
      the old LTS-D version the investigator decided to check the new LTS-D in the pediatric
      version The investigator hypothesized that the LTS-D perform clinically well during general
      anesthesia with controlled ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LTS-D, is a second generation supraglottic airway device, made from the medical polyvinyl
      chloride introduce in 2005. It is used for maintaining the airway during spontaneous and
      controlled ventilation during general anesthesia . It has been advocated for prehospital
      emergency airway management and serves as a useful tool during failed intubations The LTS-D
      has recently undergone considerable changes in design based on clinical studies and
      investigators feedback. The new LTS-D is available to adult and pediatric sizes.For childrens
      the devices is presented in the size 3 for patients of &lt; 155 cm (&gt; 30 Kg.), the size 2.5 for
      patients 125-150cm. (20-30 Kg.), the size 2 for patients of 12-25 Kg, the size 1 for patients
      of 5-12 Kg and the size 0 for patients &lt; 5 Kg.

      As these changes may influence the performance of the LTS-D relative to the old LTS-D version
      the investigator decided to check the new LTS-D in the pediatric version.

      The investigator hypothesized that the LTS-D perform clinically well during general
      anesthesia with controlled ventilation.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of insertion in seconds</measure>
    <time_frame>one minute</time_frame>
    <description>Was measured as the time after the anesthesiologist removed the facemask until the square-wave capnograph tracing was observed after insertion of the LTS-D. Two attempts at insertion were permitted.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Easy of insertion using a five-point Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>One minute</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators were asked to complete a questionnaire independently and anonymously to record the 'ease-of-use' of the LTS-D. Insertion of the devices was classified as 1= easy, 2= moderate, 3= difficult and 4=impossible.</description>
