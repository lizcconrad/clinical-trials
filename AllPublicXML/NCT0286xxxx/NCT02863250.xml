  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe and unstopped blood loss can occur for a number of different reasons including after a
      serious injury, delivery of a baby and following other medical and surgical emergencies. The
      investigators understanding of how to best treat people with serious bleeding is still
      incomplete, with many questions remaining. These include questions regarding how many people
      have serious bleeding events, what happens to them and the best way to treat them.

      The Massive Transfusion Registry (MTR) is a register of patients who have experienced major
      blood loss that required a massive transfusion in any clinical setting.

      The MTR uses electronic data extraction and data linkage methodologies. Pre-existing clinical
      data from hospital data sources, including Laboratory Information Systems (for transfusion
      history and laboratory results) and Health Information Services databases (for Patient
      demographics and admission data), are electronically extracted by staff employed at the
      participating hospitals. The data is then sent to the MTR Research Team, located at Monash
      University, where it is then linked, analysed and stored.

      The establishment of a Massive Transfusion Registry will be a unique and important resource
      for clinicians in Australia, New Zealand and internationally, for Blood Services and for the
      broader community. It will provide valuable observational data regarding the types and
      frequency of conditions associated with critical bleeding requiring massive transfusion, the
      use of blood component therapy (i.e. ratios and quantities of different types of red cell to
      non- red cell components) and patient outcomes.
