  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of society, more and more aged pregnant women because of various
      reasons, their abnormality rate of egg chromosome was higher than that of young women, then
      the abnormality rate of embryo chromosome is higher too, so the pregnancy rate in aged women
      is lower, abortion rate is higher. In order to improve the pregnancy rate in aged women, cut
      down their abortion rate 、fetal birth with abnormal chromosome, and the risk of pregnancy
      termination after the prenatal diagnosis, reduce their pain of body and mind, the
      investigators will carry out this study. This is a prospective randomized controlled study of
      preimplantation genetic screening with Next generation sequencing technology. The embryos
      with more developmental potential and normal chromosomes should be selected. There is no
      related studies in Chinese. Most international research are limited to fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) technique, not on the embryo chromosome comprehensive screening. So
      there is no evidence of the effects of PGS on advanced age women.

      This study is to compare the outcomes between the advanced age women with two methods
      respectively. After blastocyst culture, blastocysts will be transferred in the control group.
      In the Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) group, blastocyst embryo trophoblast biopsy
      will be performed and chromosome screening with Next generation sequencing（NGS） technology,
      at the same time, the blastocysts will be frozen, then the blastocysts with normal chromosome
      will be thawed and transferred. The investigators expect that, in PGS group live birth rate
      、cancellation rate and pregnancy rate are higher than in control group; abortion rate is
      lower than that of the control group.
