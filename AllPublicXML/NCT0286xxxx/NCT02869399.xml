  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized phase II multicenter trial. An estimated 350 patients deemed
      to be in complete remission at month 3 after curative treatment are considered for this
      trial. Two arms of intervention are foreseen: the experimental arm (arm A) based on dietary
      intervention in addition to standard recommendations and a control arm (arm B) including only
      standard recommendations. The intervention strategy is based on the AICR/WCRF recommendations
      for cancer and recurrences prevention and it is focused on decreasing inflammation, glycaemia
      and insulinaemia while promoting nutrient-rich diet. The reduction in the incidence of tumor
      recurrence will be analyzed comparing EFS curves between the two arms with the non-parametric
      Kaplan-Meier method. Secondary analyses will describe the time trend in the prevalence of
      side effects and quality of life, as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 questionnaire.
      Translational analysis (cytokine, salivary and plasmatic miRNA) will be performed. The trial
      is coordinated by Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan and conducted in 6 European countries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients deemed to be in complete remission at month 3 (+/- 1 month) after curative treatment
      will be considered for this trial.

      At each follow up visit the patients will state all the changes and new symptoms they
      experienced and they will receive both physical and fiberoptic endoscopic head and neck
      examination. Locoregional imaging should preferentially be performed within 6 months after
      treatment end and then will be recommended only on the occurrence of new signs or symptoms.
      Late adverse events of the treatment will be evaluated at each visit according to Common
      Toxicity Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). Quality of life questionnaire (EORTC
      QLQ HN35) and VSAQ questionnaire will be administered to patients every other visit.
      Laboratory tests including a complete blood count, renal, hepatic and thyroid function will
      be performed once a year. The analysis of blood biomarkers of compliance and efficacy will be
      conducted at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after randomization.

      The proposed study foresees two arms of intervention: the experimental arm based on dietary
      intervention in addition to standard recommendations and a control arm which includes only
      standard recommendations.

      The intervention strategy will focus on reducing inflammation and reducing glycaemia and
      insulinaemia while promoting nutrient-rich diet.

      Patients will be taught how to prepare traditional Mediterranean meals (healthy, satiating,
      palatable and easy to prepare).

      Patients in the control arm will not receive specific suggestions concerning diet, but
      standard healthy lifestyle recommendations will be given. The recommendations, including
      nutritional consultation if needed by standard practice of care, will be reinforced at each
      clinical visit and through a leaflet according to primary cancer prevention nutritional
      guidelines. Patients in the control group are encouraged to follow the WCRF/AICR
      recommendations but they will not receive any of the recipes or educational materials given
      to the intervention group.

    <description>Reduction in the incidence of tumor recurrence and second primaries will be assessed. When a clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence exists, all the efforts should be made in order to perform a histological confirmation. It is possible that a certain amount of recurrences will not be cyto/histologically confirmed due to tumor location not making the sampling feasible. It will be accepted a maximum percentage of 10% of such cases, if in presence of at least 2 different concordant radiological imaging.</description>
