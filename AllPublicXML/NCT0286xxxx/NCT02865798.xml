  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valvular heart diseases (VHD) are the most common causes of mortality and morbidity after
      coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure, especially in senile patients who
      have more comorbidities and often require intervention. The prevalence of senile VHD is
      increased gradually as the growth of the age. In addition important changes have occurred as
      regards the presentation and treatment of the disease over recent years. However, there is
      little information about senile VHD in China. The purposes of this study are to evaluate the
      clinical characteristics, reasons for hospitalization, risk stratification, treatment
      modalities, quality of life and outcomes of senile hospitalized patients with VHD, to
      determine the risk factors affecting the prognosis, further to lay the foundation for
      establishing a prognosis model suitable for Chinese senile VHD.

        In 71 hospitals have capable of valvular surgery in China, 4000 hospitalized patients over
        60 years old with valvular heart disease will be enrolled consecutively.
