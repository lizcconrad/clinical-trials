  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Asthma Control Test (ACT) guided
      treatment compared with usual care in asthma subjects in China. It is designed to assist
      Chinese subjects and physicians improving adherence to the guidelines through the inclusion
      of the ACT in the patient's asthma management plan. This is a prospective, multicentre,
      cluster-randomized, open-label 24-week study. In this cluster-randomization design, each
      study center, considered as a cluster, will be randomized to either ACT guided treatment
      group or control group (usual care group). For the subjects who are recruited in the ACT
      centers, they will be treated based on the ACT score. If ACT score are equal to (=) 25 for
      more than equal to (&gt;=) 3 months then the treatment will stepped-down; if ACT score &gt;=20,
      less than (&lt;) 25 or ACT=25 for &lt;3 months then there will be no change and if ACT score less
      than (&lt;=) 19 then the treatment will stepped-up. For subjects who are recruited in the
      control centers, they will be treated based on doctor's subjective judgment. Assignment to a
      treatment will not occur, as no treatment intervention is provided for this study. A total of
      528 asthma subjects are planned in the study. The randomization will be stratified according
      to the Tier of the hospitals (Tier 3 verses Tier 2).

    <measure>Percentage of subjects who have an ACT score &gt;=20 or an improvement of more than 3 points in ACT during the 24-week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ACT is a self-administered questionnaire comprising five items that are assessed on a five point scale and the scores are summed to give a total score ranging from 5 to 25, with a score of &gt;=20 denoting 'well-controlled asthma', a score of 16-19 denoting 'not well-controlled asthma', and a score of &lt;=15 denoting 'very poorly controlled asthma'. The recall period of the questionnaire is four weeks. For the control group, subjects should complete the ACT after investigator making the treatment decision.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean daytime symptom score over the 24-week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be instructed to record daytime asthma symptom scores prior to taking the morning dose of study medication or rescue medication. Any asthma-related symptoms, such as wheeze, shortness of breath, cough or chest tightness experienced during the previous 12 hours will be rated as follows: 0= no symptoms during the day, 1= symptoms for one short period during the day, 2= symptoms for two or more short periods during the day, 3= symptoms for most of the day which did not affect my daily activities, 4 = symptoms for most of the day which did affect my normal daily activities, 5= symptoms so severe that subjects could not go to work or perform normal daily activities. The subjects will record symptom scores twice daily in the daily record card (DRC).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean night-time symptom score over the 24-week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be instructed to record night-time asthma symptom scores prior to taking the evening dose of study medication or rescue medication. Any asthma-related symptoms, such as wheeze, shortness of breath, cough or chest tightness experienced during the previous 12 hours will be rated as follows: 0= no symptoms during the night, 1= symptoms causing me to wake once or wake early, 2= symptoms causing me to wake twice or more (including waking early), 3= symptoms causing me to be awake for most of the night, 4= symptoms so severe that subjects did not sleep at all. The subjects will record symptom scores twice daily in the DRC.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to the end of study in Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 will be measured at visits 0 and 6. Subjects should refrain from using short-acting bronchodilators for at least 6 hours prior to performing FEV1 measurements. The highest of three technically acceptable measurements of FEV1 will be taken.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean morning (ante meridiem [AM]) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) over the 24-week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. Subjects should record on diary card the best of three PEF measurements, using a Mini-Wright peak flow meter in the morning (7:00-10:00 AM) before taking any asthma drug. Bronchodilator therapy (e.g. salbutamol) is withheld, where possible, for 4 hours before recording PEF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean evening (post meridiem [PM]) PEF over the 24-week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. Subjects should record on diary card the best of three PEF measurements, using a mini-Wright peak flow meter in the evening (6:00-9:00 PM) before taking any asthma drug. Bronchodilator therapy (e.g. salbutamol) is withheld, where possible, for 4 hours before recording PEF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to the end of study in Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ[S]) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 32 questions in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli). Subjects are asked to think about how they have been during the previous two weeks and to respond to each of the 32 questions on a 7-point scale (7= not impaired at all - 1= severely impaired). A change in score of greater than 0.5 can be considered clinically important. In the present study, the AQLQ(S) will be used with 5 standardized activities (strenuous, moderate, social, work-related, and sleeping) to replace the patient-specific ones in the AQLQ.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to first ACT score &gt;=20 or improvement of more than 3 points in ACT over the 24-week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ACT is a self-administered questionnaire comprising five items that are assessed on a five point scale and the scores are summed to give a total score ranging from 5 to 25, with a score of &gt;=20 denoting 'well-controlled asthma', a score of 16-19 denoting 'not well-controlled asthma', and a score of &lt;=15 denoting 'very poorly controlled asthma'. The recall period of the questionnaire is four weeks. For the control group, subjects should complete the ACT after investigator making the treatment decision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of moderate to severe asthma exacerbation over the 24-week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exacerbations will be assessed by the physician at each scheduled visit by reviewing the DRC, as well as specific questioning on adverse events. A moderate asthma exacerbation is defined as a deterioration in asthma requiring treatment with an oral corticosteroid. Individual courses of oral corticosteroids are classified as separate exacerbations only if they are administered more than 1 week apart. Any course started within one week of finishing the previous course is considered part of the previous exacerbation. A severe asthma exacerbation is defined as a deterioration in asthma which requires hospital admission.</description>
