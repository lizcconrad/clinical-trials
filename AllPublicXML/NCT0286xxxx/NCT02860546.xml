      A Phase 2 Study with Safety Lead-in, Evaluating TAS-102 Plus Nivolumab in Patients with
      Microsatellite Stable Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm, safety lead-in, Phase 2 study, using Simon's 2 stage
      design evaluating the safety and efficacy of TAS-102 plus nivolumab in patients with
      Microsatellite-stable refractory metastatic colorectal cancer

      Stage 1: Patients will be enrolled and after Cycle 1 treatment, they will be evaluated for
      the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. Assuming a tolerated dose is
      confirmed additional patients evaluable for response will be enrolled and followed for a
      minimum of 6 months and there will be an interim analysis to assess the safety and efficacy
      to determine whether the second stage will open for enrollment.

      Stage 2: Additional patients evaluable for response assessment will be enrolled and followed
      for a minimum of 6 months.
