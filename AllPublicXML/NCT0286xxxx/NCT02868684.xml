      This longitudinal cohort study aims to detect the topographical nature of the white matter
      microstructure and resting state functional connectivity patterns across the whole brain in
      the evolution of pathology as a function of time following mild TBI. All consecutively
      patients with the non-contrast head CT because of acute head trauma from the local emergency
      department (ED) formed the initial population of this study. Age, sex, education-level
      matched healthy controls will also be enrolled. The initial scan will performed within 7 days
      post-injury. Clinical assessment was performed within 24 hours of MR imaging and included a
      broad neuropsychological and symptom assessments. Follow-up examination will conduct at 1
      month, 3 month, 6-12 months.

        All consecutively patients with the non-contrast head CT because of acute head trauma from
        the local emergency department (ED) formed the initial population of this study. Three
        research assistants (trained, board-certified neurologist or neurosurgeon) monitored the ED
        and hospital wards on a daily basis to identify new admissions. Screening for mild
        traumatic brain injury (TBI) was based on the World Health Organization's Collaborating
        Centre for Neurotrauma Task Force.
