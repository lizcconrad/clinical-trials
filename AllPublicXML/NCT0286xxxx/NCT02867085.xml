      The prospective BoHemE study is designed to evaluate the correlation between bone marrow
      function and skeletal health in elderly patients (&gt;= 60 years) with or without pre-existing
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

        The BoHemE study includes elderly patients (≥60 years) with or without MDS and age-related
        concomitant diseases.

        The therapeutic management of patients is subject to current treatment recommendations and
        is determined solely by the attending physician. It is planned to include at least 356
        patients (i. e. 178 per group) exhibiting the inclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria Group 1 (MDS group):

          -  Age ≥60 years

          -  With known or suspected MDS (according WHO, ＜20% blast count)

          -  Written informed consent

        Inclusion Criteria Group 2 (control group):

          -  Age ≥60 years

          -  Undergoing elective knee or hip replacement therapy

          -  Normal blood count (defined by Hb ♀ &gt;12 g/dL, ♂ &gt;13 g/dL; ANC &gt;1.8x10^9/L; PLT
             &gt;100x10^9/L)

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria Group 1 (MDS group) + 2 (control group):

          -  Patients that previously underwent bilateral total hip replacement or patients of the
             control group that were diagnosed with MDS or AML prior to the study will be excluded.

          -  In addition, patients with dementia (MMSE score of &lt;24), renal insufficiency with an
             eGFR &lt;45 mL/min, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B or C, active infection (HIV, hepatitis B
             or C, tuberculosis), heart insufficiency NYHA III or IV, severe cardiac valve disease
             are not eligible for this study.

          -  Moreover, participants who are not able to consent will be excluded from the BoHemE
             study.
