    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) of single
      escalating intravenous (IV) doses of JNJ-63623872 administered as a continuous infusion; to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of single escalating IV doses of JNJ-63623872
      administered as a continuous infusion; to characterize the single-dose PK of JNJ-63623872 of
      one selected dose administered as a continuous IV infusion at various durations and to
      characterize the single- and repeat-dose PK of JNJ-63623872 administered as a continuous
      infusion.
