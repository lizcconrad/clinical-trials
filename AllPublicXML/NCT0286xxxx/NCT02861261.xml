  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a multicenter randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial, evaluating the effects and change of gut microbiota after
      berberine and/or probiotics administration in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, about 400 newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients will be enrolled
      from multiple centers in China. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by age.
      After screening, eligible subjects will be given Gentamycin Sulfate Sustained-release Tablets
      80mg bid po for a week at the washout period, then all participants will be randomly assigned
      into one of the following four groups: Berberine hydrochloride tablets（0.6g bid po）and
      ProMetS probiotics powder（4g qN po), Berberine placebo tablets（6 pills bid po) and ProMetS
      probiotics powder (4g qN po), Berberine hydrochloride tablets（0.6g bid po）and Probiotics
      placebo powder (2 strips qN po), Berberine placebo tablets（6 pills bid po) and Probiotics
      placebo powder (2 strips qN po) for 3 months.

      The primary objective is to determine whether a combination of probiotics and berberine is
      preferable to either berberine alone or probiotics alone, in comparison with placebo in
      improving 1). glycemic control, as measured by change in HbA1c level from baseline to 13-week
      follow-up, and 2). glycemic control, as measured by change in HbA1c level from baseline to
      13-week follow-up in participants aged ≥ 50 years.

      Blood, feces and urine samples will be collected before and after treatment. HbA1C, fasting
      plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), GLP-1 , lipids, amino acids, bile
      acids and other metabolic related components and parameters will be measured. Furthermore,
      the change of gut microbiota will be evaluated too.

    <description>In aid of LC/MS and GC/MS technique, we will measure the metabolomics molecular profile in blood samples before and after treatment. The metabolomics measurement will help to detect the profile of all kinds of bile acid species, lipids species and amino acid species. The composition change of all these biological molecular induced by the treatment is our major interest rather than single molecular quantification</description>
