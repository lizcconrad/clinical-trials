  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PreTBI I study will investigate whether prehospital blood samples drawn already in the
      ambulance can rule-out intracranial lesions in patients suffering head trauma. The study aims
      to improve triage and treatment of patients suffering mild head trauma, who are considered
      low-risk patients. These patients do not always benefit from hospitalization, but are
      nevertheless admitted on precaution, as clinical assesment can be difficult.

      Hypotheses:

        1. A prehospital measurement of serum S100B â‰¤ 0,10 microgram/L in mild TBI patients rules
           out traumatic intracranial lesion with a sensitivity &gt;97%.

        2. A prehospital measurement of serum GFAP (glial acidic fibrillary protein) in mild TBI
           patients rules out traumatic intracranial lesion with sensitivity &gt;97% and results in
           lower false positive rate than S100B.

        3. Prehospital measurements of both GFAP and S100B results in lower false positive rates
           than in-hospital measurements.
