  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous treatment protocols geared towards accelerating orthodontic treatment have emerged
      in the past few years as an appealing alternative for patients and practitioners. In the
      context of a thin biotype, these approaches pose a burden that could precipitate periodontal
      detrimental changes. Therefore, case selection and the implementation of periodontal biotype
      enhancing strategies become a relevant consideration to ensure long-term successful treatment
      outcomes. This study focuses on the biological and clinical value of the use of a porcine
      naturally cross-linked collagen matrix known as Mucograft®. Within the scope of Surgically
      Accelerated Orthodontic Treatment (SAOT) the structural and material features of Mucograft®
      provide: 1) A protective effect to the thin biotype upon rapid orthodontic
      protusive/proinclination movements and 2) Mucograft® enhances the therapeutic window effect
      that supports an increase on tooth movement rate. The designs of this randomized controlled
      clinical trial includes a cohort of 40 subjects distributed on the following groups I) Ortho
      tx, II) Ortho tx + Decortication, III) Ortho tx + Decortication + Mucograft®, and IV) Ortho
      tx + Mucograft®. Comparing clinical, tomographic and digital impression derived measurements
      will capture the clinical phenotype; while the biologic phenotype will be derived from
      evaluating crevicular fluid levels of tooth movement mediators such as Interleukin 1-β and
      Interleukin-1RA. The significance and innovative value of this proposal stems from the use of
      Mucograft® as an ideal collagen-based biotype enhancer when performed along with the
      corticotomy. This approach could prove to be effective to further increase the therapeutic
      window that allows accelerating orthodontic treatment and, at the same time, could decrease
      the recession risk in movements of proclination of antero-inferior incisors. Besides, the use
      of a collagen scaffold alone could potentially trigger a comparable orthodontic acceleratory
      outcome that could be evaluated as an alternative to decortication.

    <description>Under local anesthesia, vertical and inter-radicular gingival incisions will be performed on the vestibular of the maxillary and mandibular arch, starting 2-3 mm below the interdental papilla and with sufficient depth to the periosteum to allow the scalpel to reach the alveolar bone. These incisions will be kept as small as possible; then, through them, using a piezoelectric scalpel (piezotome), several bone cuts will be performed. These cuts will have sufficient depth for drilling the cortical alveoli.</description>
