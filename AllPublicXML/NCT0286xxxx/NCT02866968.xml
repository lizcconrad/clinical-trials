      The study will be a pilot interventional case series aiming to treat 30 patients with
      Femtosecond Laser-assisted Pterygium Surgery (FLAPS). All patients included will undergo
      FLAPS in one eye. All procedures will be performed in SNEC by fully qualified surgeons. The
      doctor is informed of the procedure on the day of.

    <description>Surgical procedures will involve 1) excision of pterygium tissue from cornea and conjunctiva, 2) resection of residual Tenon and coagulation to stop any bleeding 3) preparation of a 8x8 mm conjunctiva autograft in the superior bulbar conjunctiva with the femtosecond laser (12 oÂ´clock position) and 4) fixation of the graft with fibrin glue to the resection site.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A pterygium will be defined as a wing-shaped growth of fibrotic connective tissue onto
             the cornea originating from the nasal conjunctiva.

          -  Only patients older than 21 years will be included.

          -  No gender criteria are applied.

          -  Only individuals with the mental capacity to provide informed consent will be
             included.

        More specifically, all the following inclusion criteria must be met:

          -  Patients have primary pterygium encroaching onto the cornea by a minimum of 1 mm.

          -  Patients are willing and able to sign a written Informed Consent Form prior to any
             study-specific procedures.

          -  Patients are willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations for 12
             months after the surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior history of pterygium surgery.

          -  Patients with a prior history of glaucoma filtration surgery.

          -  Patients with optic atrophy.

          -  Patients with ocular pathology or disease that might confound the outcome or increase
             the risk of adverse events.

          -  Patients with a prior history of vitrectomy.

          -  Patients with central corneal scarring.

          -  Patients with residual, recurrent, active or uncontrolled eyelid disease.

          -  Patients with any conjunctival scarring other than pterygium, that could affect
             surgery outcome.

          -  Patients with anterior segment pathology.

          -  Patients with any corneal abnormality.

          -  Patients with any progressive retinal disease or subjects with a history or evidence
             of retinal vascular occlusion and/or hypercoagulability, because of the risks
             associated with high pressures during suction application.

          -  Patients with amblyopia or strabismus or those who are at risk for developing
             strabismus postoperatively as determined by corneal light reflex and cover-uncover
             testing.

          -  Patients who are pregnant, lactating, of child-bearing potential and not practising a
             medically approved method of birth control, or planning to become pregnant during the
             course of the trial, and patients with other conditions associated with fluctuation of
             hormones that could lead to refractive changes.
