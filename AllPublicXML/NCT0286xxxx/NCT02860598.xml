  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia concerns a lot of patients with cancer and affects their quality of life (QOL).
      Numerous studies in oncology have demonstrated the benefit of erythropoiesis-stimulating
      agents (ESA) in the treatment of anemia. ESAs allow the improvement of QOL,of the hemoglobin
      level (Hb) and is a validated alternative to transfusion.

      However, in hematology, if there are some specific recommendations for the use of ESAs in
      lymphoid pathology, there are none for myeloid disorders and in the context of autografts and
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Thus, the investigators are in
      particular interested in both indications: treatment of anemia in acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) patients treated with chemotherapy, and the in patients receiving a myeloablative or a
      non-myeloablative conditioning before allogeneic HSCT, whatever type of donor and cell
      source.

      In this context, a prospective observatory was conducted from 2006 to 2009 in the hematology
      department of Prof. Michallet to assess the impact of prescribing ESAs (epoetin beta and
      darbepoetin) for these two distinct patient populations. A significant improvement in QOL
      during the six-month follow- up was observed in both groups. The effectiveness of the ESA on
      the red cell recovery and the reduction of red blood cell transfusions was established by
      comparing the evolution of Hb and transfusion needs of the population under ESA to a matched
      population. Moreover, no significant difference in the occurrence of thromboembolic events in
      survival and progression-free survival was observed between the ESA group and the control
      group.
