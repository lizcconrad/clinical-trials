    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase I study of epacadostat (INCB024360) alone and in
      combination with pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and pembrolizumab without chemotherapy in
      participants with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of epacadostat administered alone and in combination with
      pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy.
