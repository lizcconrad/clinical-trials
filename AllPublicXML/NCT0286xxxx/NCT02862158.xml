    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and reproducibility of
      frequency doubling technology (FDT)-based visual field devices compared to conventional
      Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) perimetry. The investigators plan to enroll 500 patients in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible and preventable blindness world-wide.
      Insufficient evidence exists to support routine screening for glaucoma in a primary care
      setting due to the relatively low prevalence of the disease (Guirguis-Blake, 2005 and Moyer,
      2013). Frequency doubling technology (FDT)-based perimetry is a relatively inexpensive and
      portable visual field testing device with a short testing time that has shown reasonable
      efficacy, sensitivity and specificity in screening for glaucoma in clinic- and
      community-based settings (Mansberger, 2005 and Nomoto 2009).

      The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and reproducibility of FDT perimetry
      platforms compared with Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) perimetry (which is the gold clinical
      standard in clinics and hospitals) in detecting glaucomatous visual field defects.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (18 and over) who speak English, Spanish or Creole, and are capable of
             providing informed consent and who have a Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) test within the
             prior the 6 months preceding enrollment are eligible for enrollment in this
             non-invasive study. Patients will be recruited from among patients at the Bascom
             Palmer Eye Institute clinics during their regularly scheduled clinic visits. No
             advertising will be used to recruit patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children and
             teenagers), pregnant women and prisoners and other vulnerable populations will be
             excluded from the study.
