    <textblock>
      Recent reports show increased prevalence of obesity in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DP)s
      while some studies stated that patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DPs) have islet cell
      auto-antibodies. These results raise the question of a common pathway in T1DM and T2DM via an
      association with T helper cells. In this study investigators aimed to investigate the
      difference between T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines levels in T1DPs, T2DPs and healthy subjects.

      The study included 114 T1DPs on insulin treatment, 35 newly diagnosed T2DPs who had not used
      oral antidiabetics but insulin before and 31 healthy subjects (CG).

      Serum interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
      levels were measured using ELISA method. Serum levels of those cytokines in T1DPs were
      compared with those in T2DPs and controls.
