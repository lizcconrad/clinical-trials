      This project proposes to implement and compare new community pharmacy-based strategies for
      improving vaccine coverage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there are many safe and effective vaccines for adults, the Public Health Agency of
      Canada has noted that public perception of vaccination is that it is primarily for infants
      and children. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends adults and
      adolescents receive the influenza vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine
      (Tdap), and meningococcal vaccine. While NACI makes recommendations, provinces and
      territories (P/Ts) determine if they will fund and implement vaccine programs. Unlike the
      childhood immunization programs which tend to be funded by P/Ts, many adult vaccines are
      unfunded, resulting in poor population uptake. In this project,the investigators propose to
      implement and compare new community pharmacy-based strategies for improving vaccine coverage.

      Patients are typically educated about preventative health care during face-to-face visits
      with physicians in office settings. The ability to educate and deliver preventative health
      care is limited by the available provider time during office visits - providers often focus
      on acute needs and current disease management. New delivery models and a means of extending
      preventative health care delivery outside of traditional face-to-face office visits are
      needed.

      Pharmacists are in a unique position of being among the most accessible of health
      professionals. Given their extended operating hours, accessibility, and established trust
      with patients, pharmacists are well-positioned to improve vaccination rates and health system
      efficacy through injection administration.

      Vaccine coverage rates will be measured using the following:

        1. pharmacy database analysis,

        2. public health vaccine reports by physicians,

        3. number of vaccine doses delivered to pharmacies in all four regions, and

        4. public survey within the study communities to determine immunization status.

      Intervention communities include Saint John, New Brunswick and New Glasgow/Pictou/Antigonish,
      Nova Scotia area, which include the smaller towns of Stellarton and Westville, Nova Scotia.
      Control communities include Moncton, New Brunswick and Kentville/New Minas/Wolfville, Nova
      Scotia, which include the smaller towns of Canning and Coldbrook, Nova Scotia.

    <measure>Effectiveness of targeted patient interventions by pharmacists on vaccine coverage measured using de-identified pharmacy database information, public health vaccine reports by physicians, and vaccine doses delivered.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>A demonstration program implementation and evaluation project will be conducted in two New Brunswick and two Nova Scotia communities. Communities will be allocated to one of two different two-year program implementation strategies specifically designed for each of the target vaccines. One of the communities will serve as the non-intervention control arm where immunization practice will continue unchanged. Uptake of targeted vaccines in intervention communities will be compared to the same information in the control communities.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days following immunization</time_frame>
    <description>The methodology used by the Canadian National Vaccine Safety Network (CANVAS) to conduct active surveillance during the first two weeks of the seasonal influenza vaccine campaign will be employed in this study. Patients in all intervention communities receiving high-dose TIV at the pharmacy or participating physicians' offices will be invited to participate in a specific survey of adverse events experienced during the 7 days following immunization.</description>
