    <textblock>
      Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) is a morphologically distinct, infrequent (o5%) acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) designed as M6 in the French- American-British (FAB) classification. The World
      Health Organization classification recognizes two subclasses, M6a, a leukemia with myeloid
      blast cells, and M6b, a very rare, purely erythroid AML. It may be difficult to distinguish
      between a myelodysplastic syndrome and AEL because of the erythroblastic proliferation, which
      is increased when dysplasia is present. No recurrent cytogenetic abnormality is specific of
      AEL and the prognosis is poor with a median survival of 17 months. A study of 14 genes in a
      series of 92 cases has shown that mutations are frequent in AEL and somewhat differ from the
      other AMLs by the lower and higher proportion of FLT3-ITD and TP53 mutations, respectively.
      Only three cases of AEL are reported in the TCGA database. To further characterize AEL,
      determine whether it constitutes a distinct class of AML and document the reasons for its
      poor prognosis, the investigators will search for molecular alterations in 40 M6a-AMLs using
      array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 106
      genes known or suspected to have a role in myeloid malignancies or in erythrocyte
      differentiation.
