        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who plan to undergo ESD for the treatment of superficial esophageal cancer

          2. Patients aged ≥20 years at the time of consent

          3. Patients with no clinical metastasis (cN0M0) by cervical to abdominal CT

          4. Patients with an endoscopically diagnosed depth of wall invasion remaining in the
             epithelium (EP) or lamina propria mucosae (LPM)

          5. Patients with ≥3/4 of circumference and a length of &lt;8 cm

          6. If the patient has multiple lesions, the circumference of all minor lesions other than
             the one lesion with the largest circumference (major lesion) must be &lt;1/2, and the
             distance between the minor lesions and the major lesion must be 5 cm or more on the
             major axis.

          7. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma (including high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia)
             as confirmed by biopsy

          8. Patients whose lesion is confirmed to be localized in the thoracic esophagus (lesions
             in the cervical esophagus or abdominal esophagus will be excluded). The location of
             the lesion will be determined by endoscopy.

          9. Patients who have not received pretreatment for esophageal cancer. Treatment by ESD
             for superficial esophageal cancer for which the depth of wall invasion has been
             assessed to remain in the epithelium (EP) or lamina propria mucosae (LPM) is not
             included in the definition of pretreatment. However, patients who have a scar due to
             previous ESD in the major or minor lesions will be excluded from the study.

         10. Patients with an ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1

         11. Patients in whom a commonly used endoscope with a tip diameter of 8.9 mm can pass

         12. Patients with a dysphagia score of 0

         13. Patients whose laboratory values within 28 days before enrolment meet all of the
             following criteria:

               -  White blood cell count: ≥4,000/µL

               -  Platelet count: ≥100,000/µL

               -  AST: ≤100 IU/L

               -  ALT: ≤100 IU/L

               -  Total bilirubin: ≤2.0 mg/dL

               -  Serum creatinine: ≤2.0 mg/dL

         14. Patients who have received sufficient explanation about the study and provided written
             voluntary consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with cardiac disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and heart
             failure), renal disease (nephrotic syndrome and kidney failure), or poorly controlled
             diabetes mellitus

          2. Patients who have an active (within 1 year) malignancy other than esophageal cancer

          3. Patients with active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection

          4. Patients who are being treated with a corticosteroid

          5. Patients with positive HBs antigen, positive HCV antibody, positive HIV antibody,
             positive HTLV antibody, or positive Treponema pallidum (tested at screening). For
             patients with positive HBc/HBs antibody, HBV-DNA test will be performed (if the result
             is negative, the patient will be allowed to enter the study).

          6. Patients with a mental disorder that is difficult to control

          7. Pregnant women, lactating women, and potentially pregnant women

               -  Lactating women may be enrolled in the study if they discontinue lactation during
                  the period from trans-plantation to confirmed wound healing.

               -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use the following birth control
                  methods or completely ab-stain from sexual intercourse during the period from
                  consent to participate in the study to the end of study participation.

                    -  Principal birth control methods: oral contraceptives, intrauterine
                       contraceptive devices including intrauterine luteal hormone-releasing
                       systems, tubal occlusion, and vasectomized partner

                    -  Supportive birth control methods: condoms and diaphragms

               -  The use of principal birth control methods is essential. Supportive birth control
                  methods should not be used alone and must be used together with the principal
                  birth control methods. For oral contraceptives, changes in the birth control
                  methods or other strategies should be considered because it is known that their
                  effect is reduced if they are missed or concomitantly taken with certain types of
                  drugs or dietary supplements.

          8. Patients who have participated in another clinical study within 6 months, those who
             are participating in another clinical study, and those who plan to participate in
             another clinical study during participation in Study CLS2702-ESO-01

          9. Patients from whom tissues cannot be collected due to a disease (e.g., stomatitis,
             erosion, mass, and blister) in the oral mucosa at the tissue collection site

         10. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to antibiotic preparations (ampicillin
             sodium, sulbactam sodium, streptomycin sulfate, gentamicin sulfate, or amphotericin B)
             or who have taken drugs that may affect the study (within 28 days before enrolment)

         11. Patients who have undergone radiotherapy in the cervical to upper abdominal region, or
             surgery for head and neck cancer that may affect the assessment of ESD or stenotic
             symptoms

         12. Patients whose swallowing function has been markedly reduced or completely lost due to
             a sequela of cerebral infarction or other reasons

         13. Patients with porcine or latex allergy

         14. Patients who, in the opinion of the treating physician, are not eligible for the study
             due to reasons other than those described above
