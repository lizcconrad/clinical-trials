      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of ASP1707 twice daily on the
      pharmacokinetics of once weekly oral methotrexate (MTX).

      This study will also evaluate the effect of MTX on multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of ASP1707,
      as well as safety and tolerability of coadministration of ASP1707 and MTX in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      Patients will check into the clinic on Day -1 and remain in the clinic until all exit
      procedures have been performed on the morning of Day 10.
