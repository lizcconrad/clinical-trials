  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this phase 1b study is to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of stereotactic
      body radiation therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with VEGFR,
      mTOR or immune checkpoint inhibitors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective phase 1b study.

      Patients with metastatic RCC receiving targeted or IO therapy (VEGFR inhibitor or mTOR
      inhibitor or checkpoint inhibitors in approved treatment lines and in standard therapeutic
      regimens) with stable diseaseor durable partial response for at least 4 months, are enrolled
      in the study.

      The initial examination includes CT with contrast, where the selected measured 2 metastatic
      sites, stable for at least 4 months but no more than 6 months of targeted therapy (increase
      or decrease in size in the course of targeted therapy should not exceed 10%). Metastases have
      to be located in one organ. Allowed location of metastases: lungs, liver, lymph nodes,
      contralateral kidney, adrenal gland.

      Size of selected metastases should not be less than 5 mm and not more than 4 cm.

In case of safety and 50% reduction in size of first metastasis, up to 10 metastasis will be treated with SBRT.</description>
