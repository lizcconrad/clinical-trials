  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized multicenter study is to evaluate the impact in offering the
      condolence letter to the family caregivers (indicated as the reliable person by the patient
      himself at each hospitalization) and a bereavement consultation with the reference physician.

      The hypothesis is that offering the opportunity to clarify questions about the patients'
      terminal care will influence positively the grieving process. In particular, the study team
      hypothesized that psychological morbidity will be reduced (main objective) as well as some
      aspects of QOL (secondary objective). It is also assumed that the situations of conflict
      (solicitations for medical records, number of legal procedures) will be reduced.
