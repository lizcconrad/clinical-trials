      The investigator will study the possibility of in situ heating of the liquid containing the
      chemotherapy, so as to avoid the need for an external pumping system with its complexity, and
      its associated risks and costs.

      The use of a heating cable (prototype hereinafter called Thermowire, made by the company EFS,
      which is in charge of its development) was patented and tested in pigs in two studies that
      included 15 animals altogether (in 7 of which the heating cable was used). The aim of the
      first study was the purely safety aspects, while the efficacy to obtain hyperthermia, the
      quality and the homogeneity of the hyperthermia and its effect on the tissue penetration of
      the chemotherapy were evaluated in a second study. The results obtained justify transfer to
      use in humans in the context of a clinical trial so as to obtain CE certification.
