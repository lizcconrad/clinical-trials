    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of andecaliximab (GS-5745)
      versus placebo as an add-on therapy to a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor and
      methotrexate in adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

             study drug

          -  Individuals on MTX may also be on concurrent chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at a
             stable dose (defined as no change in prescription) for at least 4 week prior to

             study

          -  Must have an inadequate response to ≥ 12 weeks of ongoing treatment with an approved,
             stable subcutaneous (SC) formulation of TNF inhibitor (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol,

             weeks of stable dose (defined as no change in prescription), defined as: must have a
             DAS28(CRP) &gt; 3.2 at screening AND must have ≥ 3 swollen and ≥ 3 tender joints (using

                  need be obtained. In addition, these cases must be approved by the medical
                  monitor prior to enrollment. . (Any new diagnosis of latent TB or prior untreated
