      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and is reported to be the most
      important reason behind functional disability and musculoskeletal disorders among aged
      individuals. OA is &quot;a total joint failure; represented by pathological damage to articular
      cartilage, that affects bone, menisci, synovium, ligaments, and neuromuscular tissue&quot;. Knee
      OA could be responsible for pain and functional disability in 19.2% of individuals aged more
      than 45 years in the Framingham study and in 27.8% of such individuals in the Johnston County
      Osteoarthritis Project. However, in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination
      Survey (NHANES III), nearly 37% of individuals aged 60 years or older had radiographic knee
      OA. Oliveria et al. (1995) reported that age- and sex-standardized incidence rates of
      symptomatic hip, knee, and hand OA were 88, 240, and 100/100,000 person-years, respectively.
      In addition, the incidence rates of symptomatic OA of the knee, hand, or hip increased
      rapidly at age 50 and then levelled off beyond age 70. There were not enough data to report
      the prevalence of OA in Arabic countries. However, a cross-sectional study performed in Saudi
      Arabia demonstrated radiographic knee OA in 53.3% of men and 60.9% of women, while about 18%
      of women and 10% of men had symptomatic OA. Although it is well established that OA is mainly
      caused by damage occurring in the joint because of degeneration and inflammation, there is no
      known cure for OA and our understanding of the pathological aetiology of OA is still
      deficient and poorly understood.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the immediate and the carry-over effect
      of MWM on pain and function in patients with knee OA. A secondary objective is to evaluate
      this effect among those patients who demonstrate features of central sensitization.

      Participants:

      A power analysis was performed using G*Power 3.1 (F tests, analysis of variance [ANOVA]:
      repeated measure, within-between interaction, and a priori: compute required sample size). A
      result of 16 patients (treatment group = 8 and sham group = 8) was used to calculate an
      effect size (ES) of 0.27 for the pressure pain threshold of the knee after the intervention
      between groups. The power estimated for ANOVA for the two groups with a significance of 0.05
      revealed that a total sample size of 27 patients was necessary to obtain a power of 0.80.
      Considering a 20% attrition rate, a minimum of 18 patients needed to be recruited for the
      first phase in this study.

      Patients with knee OA who attended King Fahd Hospital of the University will be recruited for
      this study. Patients will be diagnosed at the orthopedic clinic and referred to the
      Department of Physiotherapy. Patients who are willing to participate in the study will be
      screened for their eligibility

      Ethical considerations:

      The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Dammam
      (IRB Number: IRB-2014-04-323). Eligible individuals for this study will be informed of the
      risks and benefits and will be asked to read and sign a written consent form.

      Participant confidentiality will be maintained by using a code instead of the participant's
      name on the data collection form. All data collection forms will be saved in a file and
      secured in a locker. Only the researcher and the supervisor had a key to open this locker.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Data will be analyzed using International Business Machines (IBM) Statistical Package for
      Social Sciences (SPSS) for windows (version 20.0), significance level was set at p &lt; 0.05.

      In phase 1, patients characteristics between groups at baseline will be analyzed using an
      independent t-test. One way ANOVA with repeated measures will be used to analyze the
      differences for other parametric data, Bonferroni adjustment will be used to compare main
      effects. Post-hoc tests will be performed to reveal differences of within- between groups
      over time (baseline, immediately post intervention, and after 2 days of intervention). For
      Likert-scale WOMAC, the Mann-Whitney U test will be used to investigate between-group
      analysis. Whereas, the Wilcoxon test will be used for within-group analysis. Further analysis
      to reveal correlations between the outcome measures will be investigated using Pearson
      Correlation test.

      In phase 2, the groups are matched in age, gender, and BMI. The related t-test will be used
      to investigate differences between the groups.

    <description>Mobilization with movement (MWM) is a combination of sustained passive accessory joint mobilization with an active or functional movement.
MWM will be applied (three sets of 10 repetitions) during active knee flexion and extension range of motion (ROM). The therapist initially will apply the pain-free manual glide force on the tibia with the knee resting in a mid-range position. The glide force will be sustained while the patient performed 10 repetitions of self-active full range knee flexion and extension; overpressure was included at the end range.</description>

    <description>The patients will be handled similarly to MWM treatment group, except that they will not receive directional glide; instead, the physiotherapist's hands are just touch the knee skin without pressure; one hand on the tibia while the other hand on the femur. However, available active knee flexion and extension ROM will be performed (three sets of 10 repetitions).</description>
