      The investigators will perform this study to prospectively analyse the clinical outcome after
      percutaneous microwave ablation(MWA) of benign and malignant breast lesion under ultrasound
      (US) guidance.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of more than 500 patients diagnosed with benign breast lesions and 50 patients with
      malignant breast lesions in seven centers of China will be recruited in this study and
      underwent US-guided percutaneous MWA treatment. Information for each patient includes
      demographics; longest diameters of tumors; tumor numbers; tumor pathological type; location
      of tumor according to whether adjacent to skin, pectoralis, areola and papilla. Ablation
      variables including session, puncture, time, and power; complete ablation, complications;
      reduction in volume, palpability, pain and cosmetic satisfying outcomes,recurrence,survival
      will be measured and analyzed.

          -  patients unwilling or refused to receive other treatment and presence of an
             appropriate route for percutaneous puncture under US guidance.

        Exclusion Criteria:
