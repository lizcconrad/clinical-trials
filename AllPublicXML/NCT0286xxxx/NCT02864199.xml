  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (area under the curve [AUC], maximum
      concentration [Cmax], and other parameters) and tolerability of peginterferon alfa-2a and
      ribavirin combination therapy following single and multiple doses in participants with CHC
      infection and moderate to severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving
      hemodialysis. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 48 weeks, and the target
      sample size is 48 individuals.
