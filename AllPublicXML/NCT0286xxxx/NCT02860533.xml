    <textblock>
      The iPARR DELTA BP Study is designed to evaluate whether a new smartphone app using the
      photoplethysmography signal of the inbuilt camera can measure blood pressure (BP)
      fluctuations with sufficient correlation compared to the goldstandard oscillometric BP
      measurements. Investigators will recruit patients who are scheduled for a routine treadmill
      stress test and assess their blood pressure before and right after the test with the
      smartphone app and the standard BP measurements on the opposite upper extremity. Pronounced
      BP fluctuations are encountered during vigorous activities. The primary endpoint of the iPARR
      DELTA BP Study is the correlation of the absolute difference of subsequent measurements
      between both techniques. If the relative chances of BP fluctuations are sufficiently assessed
      with this new device, BP fluctuations could be monitored continuously after calibration.
