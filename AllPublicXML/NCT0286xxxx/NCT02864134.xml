      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The recent expansion of the applications of optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) demonstrated a higher correlation between the analysis of ganglion cells and
      visual function, in comparison with the analysis of the nerve fiber layer for several
      diseases of the optic nerve. Atrophy of the ganglion cells tends to induce the visual
      function deficits. In the case of optic neuritis, inflammation of the optic nerve causes a
      deficit of visual function initially with low vision, color blindness and visual field.
      Secondary atrophy of ganglion cell can result. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the
      correlation between the analysis of ganglion cells at the time of diagnosis of optic neuritis
      and the resulting visual acuity at 6 months and visual function (visual acuity, color vision
      and perimetry) 1 year regardless of treatment. A predictive effect could help predict the
      patient's clinical course and management of uncertainty and anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      An assessment at diagnosis and follow-ups at 6 months and 1 year with a measurement of best
      corrected visual acuity, a test color vision HRR (Hardy-Rand-Rittler), an OCT with analysis
      of ganglion cells and perimetry Humphrey 30 -2 fast will be done. Simple linear and logistic
      regressions will be used. RESULTS: We expect that there will be a significant association
      between atrophy of ganglion cells in the diagnosis and residual visual function after an
      episode of optic neuritis. We believe that the initial atrophy is associated with poorer
      visual prognosis. CONCLUSION: A predictive effect could help to inform the patient about the
      evolution of the disease and provide early visual rehabilitation.
