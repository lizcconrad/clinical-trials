      Background

      The trigger for the final maturation of the ovum by providing integration of Human Chorionic
      Gonadotropin (hCG) and Gonadotropin - releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist was first introduced
      long ago, but clinically not accepted until the advent of GnRH antagonist protocol in IVF
      treatment.

      In a recently published work which compared two types of ovulation induction (standard dose
      of hcg and in combination of GnRH agonist) in women with normal ovarian response, there was a
      statistically significant increase in the rates of implantation, clinical pregnancies and
      live births rates by providing integration of hCG and GnRH agonist.

      To conclude, providing GnRH agonist in combination of hCF in standard dose is today an
      accepted treatment for final maturation of the ovums.

      OBJECTIVE

      The investigators objective is to investigate whether providing integrated treatment of
      Gonadotropin - releasing hormone (GnRH) Agonist and human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) to
      final maturation of the ovum can improve the quality of the embryos, clinical pregnancies and
      live births rates in women treated with GnRH Antagonist protocol.

      The main objective is to compare between two existing treatments.

      long ago, but clinically not accepted until the advent of GnRH antagonist protocol in IVF
      treatment.

      In order to prevent Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome in the treatment cycles with GnRH
      antagonist protocol, it is possible to make the final maturation of the ovums by providing
      GnRH agonist.
