  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association between ultrasound-guided Pecs II block and parasternal block can represent a
      valid alternative in the management of acute and postoperative pain syndrome after
      quadrantectomy with or without axillary dissection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of Pecs II block and PaB provides good management of postoperative pain and
      can be considered a viable alternative to common anesthetic procedures performed for breast
      cancer surgery.

An ultrasound-guided ipsilateral PaB was performed via two separate injections of 4 ml of 0.375% levobupivacaine at the level of the 2nd and 4th intercostal space underneath the external intercostal membrane between the major pectoral and intercostal muscles close to the surface of the 2nd and 4th rib.</description>
