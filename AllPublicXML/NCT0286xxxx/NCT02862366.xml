  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms Philadelphia chromosome negative (MPNsPh1-) such
      as Essential thrombocytosis (ET), Polycythemia vera (PV) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) have
      a higher risk of arterial or deep-vein thrombosis. This is responsible for a significant
      increase in mortality (up to 31% of increase in thrombosis risk in ET). Cellular inflation
      and blood hyperviscosity, resulting from these diseases, fail to account for these
      thromboses, as more than 50% of thrombotic complications happen under adapted antineoplastic
      drug treatment.

      These last years, cellular microparticles (MPs) have been shown to play a major role in
      thrombogenesis. MPs are generated by apoptosis or the activation of malignant cells,
      platelets, endothelial cells or monocytes. They are fragments of plasma membrane, smaller
      than 1 µm, rich in phosphatidylserine, which can express the tissue factor and serve as
      support for the coagulation factors. Increase in the plasma concentration of procoagulant
      platelet microparticles has been demonstrated in other thrombotic diseases (acute coronary
      syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC, etc.). The working hypothesis is that
      platelet microparticles are involved in the hypercoagulability of MPNs patients.
