      This randomized clinical trial will conducted involving 60 patients under hemodialysis and
      hospitalized to Imam Reza and Montasareyeh hospitals of Mashhad in 2016. Patients were
      assigned to experimental and control groups of 30 people, randomly (double block). In the
      both intervention and control group, first will be washed the Catheter with Betadine, but in
      intervention group, after 2 minutes will be used of the clove extract with 2 ml of scrub for
      15 seconds. The incidence and severity of inflammation as well as infection of vascular
      access will be assessed in patients on hemodialysis for each patient before starting the
      process over a period of 2 weeks is equivalent to 6 sessions of hemodialysis.
