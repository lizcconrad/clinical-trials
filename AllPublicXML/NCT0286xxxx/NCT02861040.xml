    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this investigational research study is to determine how safe and
      tolerable the study drug volasertib is in combination with liposomal vincristine (Marqibo; an
      FDA-approved drug) in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. While
      VSLI demonstrated an overall response rate of 35% in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
      patients that had failed to respond to or relapsed after chemotherapy, combining it with
      other agents may increase clinical benefit.

      Volasertib inhibits proteins involved in the cell cycle that are increased in ALL. When
      volasertib inhibits these proteins ALL cells die. In the laboratory, volasertib has been
      shown to increase activity of vincristine against ALL cells. Therefore, we think the
      combination of volasertib and VSLI will be more effective against your leukemia than either
      drug used alone. This study will try to find out what effects, good and/or bad, this drug
      combination has on the patient and their cancer, and to find a dose that may be used in
      future studies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of volasertib and
      vincristine sulfate liposomal injection (VSLI) in relapsed/refractory (RR) acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of volasertib and VSLI, rate of complete remission (with
      or without complete hematologic recovery; complete response [CR]/CR with incomplete
      hematologic recovery [CRi]), duration of remission (DOR), rate of minimal residual disease
      (MRD)-negativity, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), 30-day mortality
      rate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if volasertib and polo-like kinase (plk)-inhibition down-regulates the
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.

      II. Whether plk and mTOR inhibition correlates with clinical response to treatment. III. to
      determine if volasertib acts synergistically to potentiate the bioavailability and
      distribution of VSLI.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of volasertib.

      Patients receive volasertib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and vincristine sulfate
      liposome IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      12 courses in the absence of disease progression, development of an inter-current illness
      that prevents further administration of treatment, unacceptable toxicity, patient decides to
      withdraw or treating investigator determines that the patient should be taken off treatment
      for any reason.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 28 days for up to 1 year.
