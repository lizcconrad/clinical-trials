      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy
      of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing regimens
      in participants with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and Stage 2 or greater chronic
      kidney disease who have received a liver transplant.
