      This randomized comparative effectiveness trial examines the potential psychosocial and
      physical health-related benefits of sharing personal websites with other women with breast
      cancer, as well as with family and friends (PCO PLUS condition) versus sharing with family
      and friends only (PCO condition) in a sample of women with metastatic breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  women at least 18 years of age;

             breast cancer, any interval since diagnosis;

          -  ability to complete the intervention and assessments in English; and

          -  willingness to attend in-person PCO workshop;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  male (because men constitute less than 1% of breast cancer patients, numbers would not
             be sufficient for reliable analyses);

          -  local (i.e., same breast, surgical scar, chest wall) or regional (i.e., lymph nodes)
             recurrent disease; and
