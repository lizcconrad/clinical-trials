      The goal of this laboratory research study is to learn more about genetic factors that may
      influence the risk for developing colorectal cancer at a young age.

      Questionnaires:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will fill out some questionnaires about your
      work, family history, medical history, and health habits. If you have already answered these
      questionnaires when you were registered as a patient at MD Anderson, the study staff will
      give you a copy and review your answers with you for any updates or if you have any
      questions. It should take about 10-15 minutes to complete the questionnaires.

      You will complete another questionnaire about your experience as a cancer survivor. These
      questions will be about your quality of life, well-being, concerns you may have, as well as
      the types of health care and follow-up care you are receiving. It should take about 20-25
      minutes to complete this questionnaire.

      You may be given the questionnaires electronically on REDcap (a secure, web-based application
      used to collect data for research studies that you can access from your phone, tablet, or
      computer), over the phone (either with a member of the study staff asking questions or by
      using an electronic response system called IVR), at home through the mail, or in person by a
      member of the research staff at one of your MD Anderson visits.

      If mailed, a postage-paid return envelope will be provided for the return of the
      questionnaire.

      Blood or Saliva Collection:

      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be collected 1 time. If possible, this blood will be drawn
      at a scheduled routine blood draw, so that an additional needle stick is not required.
      However, if it cannot be scheduled during a planned blood draw, an additional needle stick
      will be needed.

      If you are unwilling or unable to give a blood sample, a saliva sample will be collected
      instead. While you are at MD Anderson, a saliva collection kit will be given to you.

      Length of Study:

      If you are an active patient who has undergone treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center within
      the past year, you will receive additional questionnaires 6 and 12 months after you have
      completed treatment, and then every year for up to 5 years.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 1,000 patients and family members will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at
      MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. MDACC patients who have adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, diagnosed between ages
             18 through 50 (young-onset), or diagnosed at age 65 or older (later-onset), who had
             microsatellite status testing (by either immunohistochemistry or PCR testing or
             germline testing or a combination thereof).

          2. Patient must have sufficient command of the English language and mental capacity to
             provide consent.

        Family members who meet the following criteria will be eligible:

          1. Be a parent, sibling or child (first degree blood relative) of a registered MDACC
             patient meeting eligibility criteria above.

          2. Have sufficient command of the English language and mental capacity to provide
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must NOT have known or suspected clinical diagnosis of a hereditary polyposis
             syndrome including hereditary adenomatous polyposis syndromes, hereditary
             nonadenomatous polyposis syndromes, and hereditary nonpolyposis syndromes.

          2. Patient's adenocarcinoma must NOT be microsatellite high or unstable (defined by loss

             immunohistochemistry, and/or &gt;30% allelic shift by microsatellite PCR testing).

          3. Patient must NOT have a known germline mutation in DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1,
             MSH2, MSH6, PMS2), APC, or MYH genes.
