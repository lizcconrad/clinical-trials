      Newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) with complete or partial surgical resection, CMV
      seropositive patients will be eligible to enroll on this trial. Following standard of care
      chemoradiation, eligible subjects will be consented and begin adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ)
      cycles. Subjects will receive tetanus-diphtheria (Td) pre-conditioning on day 22 of the first
      post-radiation cycle of TMZ and the following day, receive the first of 3 every other week
      via intradermal (i.d.) injections of the study drug cytomegalovirus peptide (PEP-CMV), a
      vaccine mixture comprised in 2 components (referred to as Component A and Component B). The
      subjects will resume cycles of TMZ, resulting in a ~35-day delay between cycle 1 and 2, and
      continue PEP-CMV vaccinations every month with cycles of TMZ and then monthly to a maximum of
      20 vaccines unless progression occurs.

      Patients may be enrolled following radiation therapy and prior to initiation of
      post-radiation therapy cycles of TMZ provided they meet all eligibility criteria (a screening
      consent will be obtained for CMV screen only to confirm eligibility, this can be done prior
      to chemoradiation). At time of enrollment, after signing consent, patients will undergo
      immune monitoring blood work and Tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccination with 0.5 mL of Td
      (tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, adsorbed). Six patients will participate in a study drug safety
      cohort that receives standard 5-day TMZ, all other patients will be randomized to receive (1)
      standard TMZ (150-200 mg/m^2/day on days 1-5 of each 28 day cycle) with vaccination on Day 23
      (±1 day) of each TMZ cycle, or (2) dose-intensified TMZ (75-100 mg/m^2/day on days 1-21 of
      each 28 day cycle) with vaccination on day 23 (±1 day) of each TMZ cycle. Each randomized arm
      will have 18 patients.

      Patients must be screened at Duke within 3 +/- 1 weeks after completion of standard of care
      radiation. For patients receiving 5-day TMZ, the initial cycle of TMZ will begin 3 (±1) weeks
      after completing radiation therapy (RT) at a standard targeted dose of 150-200 mg/m^2/d for 5
      days. For patients receiving 21-day TMZ, the initial cycle will be at the dose-intensified
      dose of 75-100 mg/m^2/d for 21 days. All patients will receive a tetanus pre-conditioning
      injection in the right groin (as described below) on day 22 (±1 day) and the following day
      receive the vaccine prepared as follows: 500 µg of PEP-CMV Component A mixed with Montanide
      ISA-51 (Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant) intradermally administered in the right groin and 500
      µg of PEP-CMV Component B mixed in 150 µg of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor
      (GM-CSF) intradermally administered in the left groin. Vaccines #2 and #3 will be given at 2
      week intervals, which will result in a ~35-day delay before starting TMZ cycle 2. The study
      drug safety cohort will have the first vaccine with just Component A or Component B and all
      subsequent vaccinations with both components will have Component A and Component B
      administered with a 2-hour delay.

      An unacceptable toxicity will be defined as any of the following toxicities that are
      attributed to the vaccine: Grade 3 toxicity not attributable to TMZ or disease progression
      that does not resolve to baseline within 2 weeks, any Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions
      requiring steroids, and any Grade 4 toxicity, including neurologic events not due to
      progressive disease, or any life threatening-event not attributable to concomitant
      medication, co-morbid event, or disease progression. The prevalence of unacceptable
      toxicities occurring during the vaccinations administered concurrently with temozolomide will
      be continuously monitored. If more than 25% of accrued patients experience unacceptable
      toxicities, then accrual will be suspended and reported toxicity will be carefully reviewed
      to determine if modifications to the protocol treatment should occur. Peptide vaccinations
      employing GM-CSF and Montanide ISA-51 as adjuvants have generally been well tolerated in
      human patients in numerous phase I-III trials.

      Treatment Plan: Patients will be vaccinated in conjunction with subsequent 28-day TMZ cycles
      for a total of 6 to 12 cycles of TMZ after RT. Cycles may be given every 5 (± 1) weeks in
      order to adjust for slight delays on startup of each 28-day cycle and the total number of
      cycles are given at the discretion of the treating oncologist. During TMZ cycles,
      vaccinations will occur on day 22 (+ 1 day) of each TMZ cycle. All vaccines will be given
      i.d. approximately 10 cm below the inguinal ligament bilaterally (Component A will be
      administered in the right groin and Component B will be administered in the left groin). A
      target of six cycles with maximum of twelve cycles of TMZ may be given at the discretion of
      the treating neuro-oncologist. Vaccines will continue after the completion of TMZ cycles
      beginning 5 (± 1) weeks after completion of the last TMZ cycle to a maximum number of 20
      vaccines (unless tumor progression occurs).

      Patients will be imaged with contrast-enhanced MRI pre &amp; post-surgical resection (prior to
      initiation of chemoradiation), post-chemoradiation and every 2 months after starting TMZ. The
      modified Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria will be used for assessment of
      pseudoprogression and patients demonstrating definitive progression will be removed from
      study. Any patient removed prior to immune monitoring post vaccine 3 will be replaced for
      immunologic endpoints. Clinical endpoint comparisons will be made amongst patients
      successfully randomized to adjuvant TMZ treatment arms.

      Prior to post-RT TMZ cycle 1 and the upfront Td booster immunization, blood for immune
      monitoring will be obtained. In addition blood for immune monitoring will be obtained prior
      to vaccine 1 (or at the Td per-conditioning visit), at the clinic visit before second cycle
      TMZ, and prior to vaccines 4, and 6. Finally, blood for immune monitoring will be obtained at
      tumor progression (if feasible).

      As part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor progression, participants may undergo
      stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure, consent will be
      obtained separately. Patients that have this procedure done here at Duke University Health
      System, may be approached to participate in the Duke Brain Tumor Center Bio-repository study
      (Pro00007434). Tissue obtained from patients who consented to the Duke Brain Tumor Center
      Bio-repository will be used to assess immunologic cell infiltration, antigen expression, and
      bio-markers for immunologic response.
