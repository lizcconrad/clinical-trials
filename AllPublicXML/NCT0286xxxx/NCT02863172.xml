      Objectives:

        1. To examine the variations in clinical features, survival outcomes, family history, and
           health behavior among proband patients who are known or suspected to have a hereditary
           colorectal cancer syndrome

        2. To compare the clinical features, survival outcomes, and health behavior of the proband
           vs. his/her family members who may or may not be affected by the hereditary colorectal
           cancer syndrome

        3. To explore for correlations between germline genetic variations in both the probands and
           family members with observed variations in the overall disease phenotype across probands
           and kindreds, within a given syndrome. Disease phenotype is defined to include: (1)
           clinicopathologic features including patient demographics and oncologic outcomes; (2)
           clinical manifestations of disease including the timing, spectrum and severity of CRC
           and extracolonic cancers. Genetic variations may include the specific codon mutated, the
           type of mutation and sequence alteration (e.g. nonsence, missence etc), chromosomal/gene
           copy number changes, and gene polymorphisms.

        4. To explore for correlations between germline genetic variations in both the probands and
           family members with observed variations in somatic CRC tumor biology, including tumor
           pathology and other tumor molecular markers

      Participants:

      Questionnaires:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will fill out a some
      questionnaires about participant's work, family history, medical history, and health habits.
      If participant has already answered these questionnaires when participant was registered as a
      patient at MD Anderson, the study staff will give participant a copy and review participant's
      answers with participant for any updates or if participant has any questions. It should take
      about 20 minutes to complete the questionnaires.

      Participant will also complete a health and lifestyle questionnaire, which contains 20
      questions for men and 22 questions for women. This questionnaire should take about 10 minutes
      to complete.

      Participant may be given the questionnaires electronically on REDcap (a secure, web-based
      application used to collect data for research studies that participant can access from
      participant's phone, tablet, or computer), over the phone (either with a member of the study
      staff asking questions or by using an electronic response system called IVR), at home through
      the mail, or in person by a member of the research staff at participant's MD Anderson visit.
      If mailed, a postage-paid return envelope will be provided for the return of the
      questionnaire.

      Blood or Saliva Sample:

      Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn. If possible, the blood will be drawn during an
      already scheduled blood draw to avoid additional needle sticks.

      If participant is unwilling or unable to give a blood sample, participant may give a saliva
      sample instead. If participant is at MD Anderson, a saliva kit will be given to participant.
      If participant is not at MD Anderson, the kit will be mailed to participant with instructions
      for collecting the saliva sample and a prepaid envelope will be included to return the sample
      to the study staff.

      The blood or saliva sample will be sent to the research laboratory of the study chairs at MD
      Anderson for testing.

      Residual Tissue Collection:

      If participant has tissue from procedures performed at MD Anderson, this tissue may be
      requested from participant's previous procedures for testing. If participant has had
      procedures done at another institution, participant may be asked to sign a waiver to allow
      the tissue from the outside institution to be sent to MD Anderson for testing.

      Follow-Up Questionnaires:

      Participant will also fill out a follow-up questionnaire at least 1 time in 5 years to update
      participant's medical, cancer, and family history. Each questionnaire will take approximately
      20 minutes to complete.

      Withdrawing from the Study:

      Participant may withdraw from participation in this study at any time. If participant decides
      participant wants to stop taking part in this study, data collected about participant and
      data taken from the blood or saliva samples participant has provided up to the time
      participant withdraws will remain in study database and will be used for the purposes of the
      study.

      Length of Study:

      Participant's active participation on this study will be over after the blood, tissue, and/or
      saliva samples have been collected and participant has completed all of the questionnaires.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 2,000 patients and/or family members will take part in this study. All will be enrolled
      at MD Anderson.

      Family Members:

      Questionnaire:

      Participant will complete a health questionnaire, which will collect information about
      participant's personal medical history, demographics (age, race, sex, and so on), and
      questions about participant's alcohol and tobacco use. This questionnaire should take about
      20 minutes to complete.

      Participant may be given the questionnaires electronically on REDcap (a secure, web-based
      application used to collect data for research studies that participant can access from
      participant's phone, tablet, or computer), over the phone (either with a member of the study
      staff asking questions or by using an electronic response system called IVR), at home through
      the mail, or in person by a member of the research staff at participant's family member's MD
      Anderson visit.

      If mailed, a postage-paid return envelope will be provided for the return of the
      questionnaire.

      Blood or Saliva Sample:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study and participant is able to come to MD
      Anderson, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn.

      If participant is unwilling or unable to give a blood sample, participant may give a saliva
      sample instead. If participant is at MD Anderson, a saliva kit will be given to participant.
      If participant is not at MD Anderson, the kit will be mailed to participant with instructions
      for collecting the saliva sample and a prepaid envelope will be included to return the sample
      to the study staff.

      The blood or saliva sample will be sent to the research laboratory of the study chairs at MD
      Anderson for testing.

      Outside Tissue Collection:

      If participant has had a procedure done at a hospital, surgical center, or doctor's office
      outside of MD Anderson, participant may optionally be asked to sign a waiver to allow tissue
      stored at the outside hospital, surgical center, or doctor's office to be sent to researchers
      at MD Anderson.

      Follow-Up Questionnaires:

      Participant will also fill out a follow-up questionnaire at least 1 time in 5 years to update
      participant's medical, cancer, and family history. Each questionnaire will take approximately
      20 minutes to complete.

      Withdrawing from the Study:

      Participant may withdraw from participation in this study at any time. If participant decides
      participant wants to stop taking part in this study, data collected about participant and
      data taken from the blood or saliva samples participant has provided up to the time
      participant withdraws will remain in study database and will be used for the purposes of the
      study.

      Length of Study Participant's active participation on this study will be over after the
      blood, outside tissue and/or saliva samples have been collected and participant has completed
      all of the questionnaires.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 2,000 patients and/or family members will take part
      in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
