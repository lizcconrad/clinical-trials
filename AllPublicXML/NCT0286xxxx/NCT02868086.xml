  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is a major issue of
      public health. The therapeutic arsenal has widely grown throughout the years with the
      emergence of intra-vitreous anti-angiogenic treatments, under different surveillance
      protocols. The &quot;PRN&quot; surveillance (pro re nata: an on-demand treatment with monthly
      follow-up) allows a faster re-injection in case of neovascular relapse in order to maintain
      the best visual acuity. This therapeutic protocol is guided by the sub-retinal neovascular
      signs of activity. The monitoring is done during common practice via OCT B scans showing
      indirect signs of neovascular activity (exudation signs). OCT retinal imaging has been
      recently enriched with new programs allowing the visualization of sub-retinal neovessels
      without the use dyes (OCT angiography). The OCT angiography is automatically done by a
      program using standard OCT sections. During the monitoring of a patient using the OCT A, the
      signs of renewed neovascular activity are represented by an &quot;arterialization&quot; or the
      development of an arteriole network of the neovessel with the reappearance of a hyper
      reflective flow after a neovascular regressive phase. Indeed, the visualization of neovessels
      during the monitoring by Angio-OCT may lead to therapeutical modifications (anticipation of
      the injections). Knowing that the injection time-table of ARMD patients treated with
      anti-angiogenics is determined by sub-retinal neovascular signs of activity. This activity is
      evaluated during routine clinical practice by very specific signs, observable on OCT B scans.
      The hypothesis of this study is that the search of activity sins on the Angio-OCT, a new
      technic of image analysis performed on the OCT, may modify this injection time-table, with an
      impact of the patient's visual acuity.
