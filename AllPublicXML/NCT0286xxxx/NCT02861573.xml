  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      combination therapy in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
      There will be three cohorts in this study with 70 participants enrolled in each cohort:
      Cohort A will receive pembrolizumab + olaparib, Cohort B will receive pembrolizumab +
      docetaxel + prednisone, and Cohort C will receive pembrolizumab + enzalutamide. Outcome
      measures will be assessed individually for each cohort.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assignment of patients to a cohort will be based on prior treatment. Participants assigned to
      Cohort A must have previously received docetaxel for mCRPC. Participants assigned to Cohort B
      must have previously received either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (but not both) in
      the pre-chemotherapy mCRPC state. Participants assigned to Cohort C must have previously
      received abiraterone acetate in the pre-chemotherapy mCRPC state (prior docetaxel for
      metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is allowed if ≥4 weeks have elapsed from the
      last dose of docetaxel).
