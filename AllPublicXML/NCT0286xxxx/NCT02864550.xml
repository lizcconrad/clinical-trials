  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) disproportionately affecting gay, bisexual
      and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM), with the potential for significant sequelae -
      particularly in those who are Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive. Rising rates of
      this STI have prompted a search for novel prevention solutions. A recent pilot study of daily
      doxycycline prophylaxis demonstrated promise as a novel STI prevention tool. This innovative
      approach to STI prevention has solid clinical precedent, both from the HIV pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) literature, as well as doxycycline's use as prophylaxis for other
      infections. The overarching goal of this project is to determine whether the daily use of
      doxycycline is an efficacious and acceptable intervention for syphilis prevention in
      high-risk, HIV-positive gbMSM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis disproportionately impacts gbMSM:

      Syphilis remains an important cause of morbidity in gbMSM. Up to 75% of early syphilis
      infections occur in gbMSM - a population with syphilis rates nearly 10-fold higher than in
      those who are HIV negative. In Canada's urban centres, 2/3 of syphilis cases are in
      HIV-positive gbMSM, and re-infection remains high. HIV co-infection with syphilis has
      important implications for HIV management. Syphilis may increase HIV viral load levels in
      virologically suppressed individuals, and genital ulcers increase the risk of HIV
      transmission and acquisition.

      The era of novel, biomedical prevention technologies:

      Significant advancements have shaped the past two decades of HIV care. Antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) has substantially reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality and extended life
      expectancy to near-normal levels. With reduced morbidity and mortality associated with HIV,
      gbMSM may also be changing their sexual behaviours. Seroadaptive strategies, such as
      serosorting (selecting sexual partners of the same serostatus) and seropositioning (selecting
      a sexual position to minimize the risk of HIV transmission) are common among gbMSM. While
      this may be mitigating the risk of HIV transmission or acquisition, there is evidence to
      suggest that decreasing condom use may contribute to a rise in syphilis and other bacterial
      STIs in high-risk populations. Further, new evidence has emerged demonstrating the efficacy
      of HIV PrEP in preventing HIV acquisition. The combination use of tenofovir/emtricitabine was
      shown in the Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPREX) trial to reduce the risk of HIV
      acquisition by 44% in HIV-negative gbMSM when taken daily as PrEP. Among those with
      detectable drug levels, the risk reduction was &gt; 90%.

      A role for PrEP in other STIs? The exciting developments in HIV prevention have encouraged
      investigators to expand this strategy to the prevention of other STIs, a modality previously
      shown to be acceptable to gbMSM. A recent pilot study randomized participants to receive
      either the antimicrobial doxycycline daily or a monetary incentive to remain STI-free
      throughout the study period. After 48 weeks, those receiving doxycycline were significantly
      less likely to be diagnosed with any STI (odds ratio: 0.27; 95% confidence interval:
      0.09-0.83). Though there was also a trend toward benefit for doxycycline in specifically
      preventing syphilis, significance was not achieved for this outcome.

      The first large-scale syphilis PrEP study:

      Given the rising rates of syphilis and its disproportionate impact on HIV-positive gbMSM,
      there is an urgent need to replicate this study on a broader scale. This proposed study will
      contribute to this field by being - to the investigators' knowledge - the first large-scale,
      methodologically rigorous trial of syphilis PrEP, and has the potential to provide a
      completely novel and innovative tool to the syphilis prevention armamentarium. It will
      provide insight on whether daily doxycycline is an efficacious PrEP intervention for the
      prevention of syphilis and other bacterial STIs, as well as shedding light on issues relating
      to its feasibility as a prevention tool, including its safety, tolerability, how well
      individuals adhere to it, and its impact on the development of antimicrobial resistance.
      These outcomes are directly in line with the planned outputs of this study, and have the
      potential to drastically shift how people think about and manage syphilis and other STI
      prevention in gbMSM.

      The investigators' primary objectives are to:

        1. Determine efficacy of daily doxycycline in preventing new cases of syphilis in
           HIV-positive gbMSM.

           Anticipated output: A significant reduction in syphilis incidence in the doxycycline
           arm.

        2. Determine the safety of daily doxycycline prophylaxis. Anticipated output: No
           significant difference in adverse events and discontinuations between doxycycline and
           placebo arms.

      The investigators' secondary objectives are to:

        1. Determine the efficacy of daily doxycycline in preventing new cases of other bacterial
           STIs.

           Anticipated output: A significant reduction in chlamydia and gonorrhoea in the
           doxycycline arm.

        2. Measure adherence to doxycycline. Anticipated output: Adherence of â‰¥80%.

        3. Monitor for the impact of prolonged daily doxycycline prophylaxis on rates of
           antimicrobial resistance.

      Anticipated output: No significant differences in antimicrobial susceptibility profiles
      between trial arms.
