      Enhancing the anabolic effect of nutrition in critically ill patients by administering
      exogenous amino acids.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically-ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit are invariably catabolic and are
      commonly undernourished. Previous observational studies indicate that increased dietary
      administration of protein or essential amino acids might be associated with improved clinical
      outcomes. The investigators propose that the parenteral supplementation of intravenous amino
      acids in critically-ill patients will restore anabolic processes and that anabolism is
      associated with molecular markers of amino acid sensing and protein synthesis. The results
      from this study will establish biomarkers of anabolism (i.e., nutritional success) that can
      be used in future clinical trials on the use of amino acid supplementation in the
      critically-ill.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole body protein balance</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Primed continuous infusions of stable isotope tracers will be applied to assess dynamic changes in whole body and hepatic protein metabolism (i.e., protein breakdown, amino acid oxidation, protein synthesis, total protein, albumin and fibrinogen synthesis) before 48 hours after beginning the intervention. During the period of isotope infusion, nutrition will be held constant. A positive protein balance (difference between protein synthesis and protein breakdown) will be used as an indicator of whole body anabolism. All isotopes will be purchased from CDN Laboratories (Montreal, Canada). Sterile solutions will be tested to be free of pyrogens. Before beginning each experiment blood and expired air samples will be collected to determine baseline enrichments of [1-13C]-ketoisocaproate ([1-13C]-KIC), [6,6-2H2]glucose, L-[2H5]phenylalanine and expired 13CO2. Retention of H13CO3- in the bicarbonate pool will be measured in each patient using the approach of Kien.</description>

    <measure>Synthesis rates of hepatic secretory proteins (the total plasma protein pool, albumin, fibrinogen in %/d)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured from the rates of incorporation of L-[2H5] phenylalanine into the proteins using plasma very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein-B100 (VLDL-apoB-100) isotopic enrichment at plateau to represent the isotopic enrichment of the phenylalanine precursor pool from which the liver synthesizes the other plasma protein. A priming dose of L-[2H5]phenylalanine (4 μmol/kg, iv) will be given followed by a six-hour infusion at 0.10 μmol/kg/min. At baseline, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours thereafter blood will be drawn, immediately transferred into pre-chilled tubes containing Na2EDTA and a protease inhibitor cocktail of sodium azide, merthiolate and soybean trypsin inhibitor, then centrifuged and stored at -70ºC for later analysis. 10 ml blood will be required for secretory protein synthesis studies.</description>
