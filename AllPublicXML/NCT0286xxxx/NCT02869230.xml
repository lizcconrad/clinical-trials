      Here were present a controlled clinical trial comparing wire-guided lesion localization
      (WGLL)and radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) in patients treated for nonpalpable
      breast lesions at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (National Cancer Institute)in
      Bogotá,Colombia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL)
      technique with the wire-guided lesion localization (WGLL) technique to assess the optimal
      localization and excision of nonpalpable breast lesions in patients at a unique reference
      medical center.

      A controlled clinical trial was designed to compare the WGLL and ROLL techniques in women
      presenting with breast lesions diagnosed by mammography or ultrasound at the Instituto
      Nacional de Cancerología in Bogotá, Colombia from March 2006 to June 2011.

      This study evaluate 129 patients; 64 (49.6%) patients were treated using ROLL and 65 (51.4%)
      using WGLL.
