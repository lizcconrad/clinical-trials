      Objective: To analyze the association between sexual function of men with spinal cord injury
      with possible predictive factors for dysfunction.

      Method: Observational study (CAAE 41221414.5.0000.5208) conducted with 45 men, mean age 34
      (CI 31.5 to 37.1), with spinal cord injury and active sex life. Sexual function was assessed
      by the International Index of Erectile Function and level and degree of injury were
      determined following the guidelines of the International Standards for Neurological and
      Functional Examination Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Descriptive statistical
      techniques were applied and multivariate analysis using logistic regression adjusted to
      observe the association between factors, with 0.05 significance level.

        The study included 45 men, aged between 18 and 60 years with a clinical diagnosis of
        traumatic spinal cord injury, injury time less than six months heterosexual and sexually
        active. The study excluded patients who had erectile dysfunction attributed to endocrine or
        metabolic disease order, those who underwent surgery in the genital area, such as radical
        prostatectomy or penile implant and cognitive impairment.
