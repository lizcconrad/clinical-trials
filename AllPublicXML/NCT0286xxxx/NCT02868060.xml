        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) for at least 6 months prior to signing
             the informed consent form (ICF).

          -  Subject is ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 70 years old while signing the ICF.

          -  Patients who have no response or relapsed after splenectomy. Or patients who have not
             been splenectomised and have completed at least 1 prior treatment for ITP. Excluded
             having previously received recombinant human thrombopoietin (rHuTPO) or any other
             thrombopoietin receptor agonist.

          -  The mean of 3 scheduled platelet counts taken during the screening period must be: &lt;
             30 ×10^9/L, with none &gt;35×10^9/L.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any known history of bone marrow stem cell disorder. Any abnormal bone marrow findings
             other than typical of ITP.

          -  Any active malignancy. If prior history of cancer other than basal cell carcinoma or
             cervical carcinoma in situ, no treatment or active disease within 5 years prior to
             signing the ICF.

          -  Had received Eltrombopag, recombinant human thrombopoietin (rHuTPO) or other
             myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) stimulation product.

          -  Received hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,
             macrophage colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, interleukin-11) for any reason
             within 4 weeks prior to signing the ICF.

          -  Received any anti-malignancy agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine,
             vincristine, vinblastine, interferon-alfa) for any reason within 8 weeks prior to
             signing the ICF.

          -  Received any monoclonal antibody drugs (e.g., rituximab) for any reason within 14
             weeks prior to signing the ICF.

          -  Less than 4 weeks since end of any clinical trials about therapeutic drug or device
             for any indication prior to signing the ICF.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  In the opinions of the principal investigator or investigators, the patients are not
