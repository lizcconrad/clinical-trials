  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a therapeutic vaccine, named DPX-E7, as a possible treatment
      for Human Papilloma Virus or HPV related head and neck, cervical or anal cancer (positive for
      HLA-A*02).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II clinical trial. DPX-E7 is a therapeutic vaccine, intended to treat
      HPV-related head and neck, cervical or anal cancer. DPX-E7 is an investigational vaccine and
      the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved DPX-E7 vaccine as a
      treatment for any disease.

      DPX-E7 is being tested in humans for the first time. DPX-E7 is a kind of immunotherapy that
      will make the immune system to elicit an anti-tumor response by generating CD8+ T-cells. CD8+
      T-cells play a very important role in fighting against viral infections

      Cyclophosphamide is used to treat various types of cancer. It is a biological modifier drug
      that works by slowing or stopping cell growth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each patient must be positive for HLA-A*02 and meet all of the following inclusion
             criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven HPVOC or cervical cancer or anal cancer, based
             on expression of HPV type16 in immunohistochemistry and/or HPV 16 DNA analysis by ISH
             of tumor tissue from the primary or metastatic lesions.

          -  Incurable HPVOC, as defined by:

               -  Relapsed or progressive disease at the primary site and/or regional lymph nodes
                  after initial treatment (e.g. Surgery, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) with no
                  potentially curative option (i.e. surgery or radiation); OR

               -  Distant metastasis

          -  Incurable cervical or anal cancer, as defined by:
