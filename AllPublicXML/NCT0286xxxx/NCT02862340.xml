    <textblock>
      Autism, ranked among the '' pervasive developmental disorders' (ASD), is characterized by
      disturbances in the areas of reciprocal social interaction, communication and behavior,
      interests and activities restricted, repetitive. Various studies indicate that autistic
      disorder is subjected to a genetic predisposition, most likely polygenic and heterogeneous.
      However, no major gene responsible for this disorder has yet been identified. Given the link
      between the Fragile X syndrome (the most common form of mental retardation (MR) hereditary)
      and autistic behavior, it seems interesting to look, also, a possible link to the molecular
      level. Among the proteins interacting with FMRP (absent protein in fragile X patients), the
      investigators were interested to CYFIP1, protein encoded by the gene CYFIP1 appears to be a
      good candidate gene involved in the RM and autism by its chromosomal position and function.
      As FMR1, CYFIP1 is expressed in the brain cortex, hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the
      cerebellum. This protein co-localizes and interacts with Rac and FMRP, which are both
      involved in neurogenesis and cognitive development. In humans, the gene encoding CYFIP1 is
      located in the 15q11-q13. Now, the only autosomal abnormalities most frequently observed in
      autism are those involving the proximal 15q region, including duplications or 15q11-q13
      triplications interstitial, of maternal origin.

      These data suggest that an / or more autism genes responsible are probably present in the
      15q11-q13 chromosomal region, although no gene has yet been identified. Thus, the study of
      the role of CYFIP1 gene in patients with autism spectrum disorders would most likely
      contributory.

      The investigators wish to study the involvement of the 15q11-q13 chromosomal region and
      CYFIP1 gene in autistic disorder in a hundred patients from the Autism Resource Centre (ARC)
      Nice PACA antenna, over a two year period.

      The diagnosis and assessment report of children likely to be included in this study will be
      conducted at ARC Nice. Balance sheets are made according to the recommendations of the High
      Authority of Health for diagnosis of infantile autism and PDD. These children are then sent
      to the Genetic Consultation Nice Hospital where an analysis of the background and a specific
      morphological examination will be realized..
