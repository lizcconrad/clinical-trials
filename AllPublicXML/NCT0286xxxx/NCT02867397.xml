                  dipyridamole (may enhance S-1 activity).

               2. Nitroimidazoles, including metronidazole and misonidazole (may enhance S-1
                  activity)

               3. Methotrexate (may enhance S-1 activity)

               4. Clozapine (may increase risk and severity of hematologic toxicity with S-1)

               6. Phenytoin (S-1 may enhance phenytoin activity).

               7. Flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent (may enhance S-1
                  activity).

             epirubicin:

               1. Cimetidine (may increase the area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC]
                  of epirubicin).

               2. Dexverapamil (may alter the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin).

               3. Quinine (may accelerate the initial distribute on of epirubicin from blood into
                  the tissues and may have an influence on the red blood cells partitioning of
                  epirubicin).

               4. Interferon alfa-2b (may cause a reduction in both the terminal elimination
                  half-life and the total clearance of epirubicin).

          5. Is a pregnant or lactating female.

          6. Has known hypersensitivity to 5-FU, epirubicin, oxaliplatin or other platinum
             compounds.

             contraception (including male patients). Contraceptive measures must be taken by both
             male and female patients during and up to 6 months after stopping treatment with S-1.
