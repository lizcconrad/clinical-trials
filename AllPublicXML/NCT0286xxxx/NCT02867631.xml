    <textblock>
      The Postpartum Weight Management Study is a true community-academic collaboration, bringing
      together Maternity Care Coalition (MCC) staff and the investigator, Dr. Charmaine Smith
      Wright from the University of Pennsylvania to address the needs of postpartum moms. The
      project is an innovative intervention to help moms lose weight after the birth of their baby.
      Helping mothers control their weight during pregnancy and beyond can help both mother and
      baby avoid later obesity and cardiovascular disease. Although all women are at risk for
      retaining the weight gained during pregnancy, this problem is amplified for low-income,
      minority women. The holistic approach aims to prevent postpartum weight retention and
      increase breastfeeding duration with a multi-component, low-cost intervention that provides:
      1) Motivational appeals delivered in text message format; 2) Environmental aides, such as a
      baby carrier to combine exercise with infant care, and a pedometer to accurately measure
      exercise at home; 3) Enhanced peer support, including home visits and group classes with
      other mothers; and 4) Task-oriented professional support from nutrition and lactation
      experts, who assist women in developing a personalized health plan. The effectiveness of the
      intervention will be evaluated using a randomized control methodology among clients of MCC.
