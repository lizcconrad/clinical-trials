  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal carcinosis (PC) corresponds to a locoregional extension into the peritoneum of
      rare primary peritoneal cancers, or more frequently distant extension of digestive cancers
      (colorectal or gastric) or gynecological (ovarian, fallopian tube, or endometrial). PC can be
      considered as a distinct oncological entity as its genesis, natural history, and response to
      systematic treatments differ to those of other metastases. The development of PC, observed in
      25-35% of colorectal cancers, is generally considered as a unfavorable event in the course of
      the disease. The prognosis is defined by the possibility of complete resection, possibly
      after neoadjuvant treatment. The benefit provided by the combination of cytoreductive surgery
      and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with respect to systemic chemotherapy in
      patients with PC of colorectal origin has been demonstrated based on overall survival in
      several randomized trials, among which one evaluated oxaliplatin. The evaluation of the
      clinical benefit-risk related to the repeated administration of non-hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy, as has been validated in ovarian cancer, in patients with PC of
      colorectal origin is already being investigated by several international teams.

      The FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab every 2 weeks is a modern therapeutic option in patients with
      this disease. The intraperitoneal rather than intravenous (IV) administration of oxaliplatin,
      in this combination, could increase the response of peritoneal lesions known to be relatively
      insensitive to IV chemotherapy.
