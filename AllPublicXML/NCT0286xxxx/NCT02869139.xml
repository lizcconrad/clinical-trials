      Package of mentholated measures for the relief of thirst in the anesthesia recovery room:
      Randomized clinical trial

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative thirst is intense and has a high incidence. There is evidence that strategies
      using cold and menthol could be viable alternatives to reduce thirst and the discomforts
      arising from it. For that reason, this study evaluated the efficacy of a mentholated package
      of measures (lip moisturizer and ice popsicle) compared to a non-mentholated package of
      measures in alleviating thirst in the anesthesia recovery room.
