    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I/II, national, multicenter, open-label study starting with a Phase I
      part followed by a Phase II part.

      The phase I part of the study aims to evaluate the safety of the association of
      hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (hFSRT) and the anti-PD-L1 Durvalumab
      immunotherapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. A maximum number of 12 patients will
      be enrolled in this phase I part.

      Once the recommended combination schema will be declared, patients will be enrolled in the
      Phase II part of the study in order to evaluate the efficacy (local control rate) of the
      combined treatment in recurrent glioblastoma. In this Phase II part, patients will be
      assigned by randomization to one of the two following arms:

        -  Arm A (control arm): Radiation therapy alone (17 patients)

        -  Arm B (Experimental arm): Combined treatment with Anti-PD-L1 Durvalumab (33 patients)
