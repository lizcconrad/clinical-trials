  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomized 2 year study of patients admitted to the Hamad General
      Hospital (HGH) and the Stroke Prevention Clinic with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke (IS) and
      Transit ischemic attacks (TIAs). After signing of the informed consent forms and initial
      evaluation and investigations, all patients enrolled in the two arms ( study arm and control
      arm) of the study will be followed for one year (monthly visits for the first three months
      followed by visits three months until completion of study: total of 6 follow up visits) and
      the pre-specified investigations repeated at the one year follow up. In one arm (the control
      group), the patients will be offered best risk factor management strategies as currently
      being practiced by stroke specialists at HGH in Qatar. And in the second ( the subject group)
      arm, with assistance of a nurse-practitioner and pharmacist, the investigators will make
      aggressive attempts to meet &quot;to target&quot; defined risk factors and have the evaluations and
      investigations completed as in the initial year cohort. All patients will have risk factor
      stratification according the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and the change in score measured
      over time.The primary objective will be to determine if an approach that utilizes a
      comprehensive strategy results in a significantly outcome. A clinically 'meaningful'
      difference in the blood pressure (BP) and lipid control of 10% between the aggressively
      managed versus patients treated with the standard of care will require minimum of 200
      patients in each group (alpha error set at 0.05 and beta error at 0.20, power 80%) to be
      recruited over 1 year and followed for one year (total study duration 2 years).

      All patients will have screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including gradient echo
      (GRE) sequence), carotid 3D Doppler measurement of plaque volume, and PAD assessments,
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and evaluation for protein urea at baseline. These studies will be
      repeated in 1 year at the time of exit from the study. The co-primary objective would be to
      monitor progression (or regression) of plaque build-up on 3D Doppler imaging of the carotid
      arteries between the two cohorts. The investigators hypothesize that aggressive management of
      vascular risk factors to &quot;recommended target levels&quot; will lead to better vascular health.
      Compared to current practice, comprehensive and coordinated approach at preventive measures
      will lead to more patients with better control of blood pressure and lipid levels. Improved
      risk factor management will result in slowing of atherosclerosis and its downstream effects
      which will be measurable on sophisticated blood and imaging testing. Clinically this will
      translate into fewer hospital re-admissions.
