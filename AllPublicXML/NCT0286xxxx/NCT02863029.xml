  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New studies are revealing how a high-fat diet could be making the cells of the intestinal
      lining more likely to become cancerous. The investigators would like to study how obesity
      influences growth of intestinal stem cells, which could then trigger intestinal tumors.

      The investigators are proposing a Pilot Study of 20 subjects (comprised of 10 participants
      from each of two different BMI categories: 20-25 and 35 &amp; above), who will be asked to
      provide blood, stool, &amp; urine samples, undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy, and complete food
      frequency questionnaires

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that the gut microbiome drives many of the effects
      that a pro-obesity high-fat diet has on intestinal stem cell (ISC) biology, which includes 1)
      an increase in ISC numbers and proliferation, 2) a reduced dependency on niche cells for
      intestinal organoid initiation, or 3) the acquisition of organoid-initiation by non-stem cell
      population in the intestinal epithelium.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To determine whether differences in the gut microbiome in obese human subjects
           correlates with enhanced intestinal stem cell numbers and function.

        2. To validate whether obesity-driven changes in the gut microbiome of human recapitulate
           the effects of obesity on intestinal stem cell function in germ-free mice.

    <description>Participants will undergo an unsedated Flexible Sigmoidoscopy in order to obtain 12 mucosal biopsies. Serum cholesterol, triglyceride and HBA1C levels will be determined. Plasma, serum and whole blood will be stored for future use for next generation sequencing and metabolomics to determine the effect of different genetic loci on composition and function of gut microbiota</description>

          2. Adults aged 18-65

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease or
             other inflammatory conditions or diabetes mellitus

          2. Antibiotic use within the past 4 weeks (they can be enrolled after a four week washout
             period and subsequent use during the 6 month study duration does not exclude them)

          6. Any other disease(s), condition(s) or habit(s) that would interfere with completion of
             study, or in the judgment of the investigator would potentially interfere with
             compliance to this study or would adversely affect study outcomes.
