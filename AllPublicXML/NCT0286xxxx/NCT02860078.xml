      Qualitative and quantitatively evaluate the pain control and incidence of adverse effects in
      patients undergoing corticosteroid infiltration and local anesthetic through sacral epidural
      puncture with ultrasound assistance or isolated use of fluoroscopy to aid puncture and
      location of the sacral epidural space. A group will be submitted to epidural corticosteroid
      infiltration associated with local anesthetic with the use of fluoroscopy for locating the
      sacral epidural space, which is currently the gold standard for this technique, while in
      another location group will be held with the use of ultrasound.

      Introduction: Procedures guided by ultrasound (USG) have advantages over traditional
      techniques (fluoroscopy) with respect to regional anesthesia. Some studies have shown its
      usefulness as a quick, safe and simple tool for the location of the sacral hiatus and to
      guide the puncture of the sacral epidural space in patients with chronic low back pain,
      despite the lack of data with respect to clinical outcomes.

      OBJECTIVES: Evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the pain control and incidence of
      adverse effects in patients undergoing corticosteroid infiltration and local anesthetic
      through sacral epidural puncture with ultrasound assistance or isolated use of fluoroscopy to
      aid puncture and location of the sacral epidural space. It will also be evaluated success
      rate in the first puncture, and the time duration of the procedure in groups.

      METHODS: It is clinical, analytical, prospective trial, randomized, covered for evaluators.
      It will include 30 patients with chronic low back pain or pain in the lower limbs resulting
      in lumbar canal stenosis, refractory to medical treatment. A group will be submitted to
      epidural corticosteroid infiltration associated with local anesthetic with the use of
      fluoroscopy for locating the sacral epidural space, which is currently the gold standard for
      this technique, while in another location group will be held with the use of ultrasound.

    <description>After infiltration, the patient will be reassessed as to pain control in 15 days, 3, 6 and 12 months. Pain is assessed using a verbal analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. Patients will quantify the pain at rest, improvement factors and worse, smaller and higher scores during the day, and average daily pain.</description>

    <description>The group I will be subjected to epidural infiltration using methylprednisolone acetate diluted in ropivacaine 0.1%. Initially the sacral hiatus is identified by palpation. After, the ultrasound device is used (USG) for the puncture, with a linear transducer of high frequency. At the end of corticosteroid administration, the placement of the needle tip will be checked with fluoroscopy and noted.</description>
