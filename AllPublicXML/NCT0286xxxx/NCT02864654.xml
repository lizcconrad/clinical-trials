  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) will be extracted from lipoaspirate by enzymatic
      digestion. 10 mL of autologous ADRC suspension injected intramuscularly, close to the site of
      muscle injury. All patients will receive cell therapy. This is a single arm study with no
      control.

      Fat tissue obtainment:

      Subjects will undergo liposuction under local anesthesia. In this procedure, Ringer's
      solution with the anesthetic lidocaine and vasoconstrictor adrenaline infused into the
      adipose compartment to minimize blood loss and contamination of the tissue by peripheral
      blood cells. 15 minutes later a hollow blunt-tipped 3 mm cannula introduced into the
      subcutaneous space through small (0.5 cm) incision. The cannula attached to syringe and under
      gentle suction moved through the adipose compartment, mechanically disrupting the fat tissue.
      Aspirate volume - approximately 150-200 cc. Procedure time - 30 minutes.

      ADRC isolation:

      Harvested adipose tissue will be processed according to patent pending technology based on
      enzymatic digestion, washing and concentration of cell pellet in 10.5 ml of normal saline.
      Obtained ADRC divided into 2 portions. First portion (0.5 mL) used for counting, viability
      and sterility assessment. The second portion (10 ml) placed into sterile syringe for
      injection.

      Autologous ADRC administration

      10 mL of autologous ADRC suspension will be injected intramuscularly, close to the site of
      muscle injury. 10 to 20 injections (0.5 to 1.0 mL each) will be performed so as to infiltrate
      the injured muscle.
