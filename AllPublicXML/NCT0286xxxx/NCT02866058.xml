      This study will examine the effect of cesarean section on perinatal mortality, using data
      provided by the Canadian Institute for Health Information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine administrative data provided by the Canadian Institute for Health
      Information (CIHI). Maternal obstetrical delivery and neonatal hospitalization records
      provided by CIHI will be linked before analysis. The primary outcome is in-hospital perinatal
      mortality. The data will be analyzed by traditional multi-variate logistic regression, and
      the results from this analysis will be compared to the results from instrumental variable
      adjusted regression using the Generalized Method of Moments. The instrumental variable is the
      rate of cesarean delivery among women living within the same hospital catchment area. All
      analyses will be adjusted for maternal, infant, delivery provider, and hospital factors, as
      well as for clustering at the level of the delivery hospital.
