      The Hanapū Study: Incentivized Partnerships to Reduce Diabetes Disparities is a randomized
      control trial that will test the effectiveness of partnership incentives plus evidence-based
      education to optimize glycemic outcomes among diabetic patients compared with usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hanapū Study will use a block randomization study design to enroll 100 diabetic patients
      in each arm (n = 200) followed over 9 months. Providers will identify diabetic patients.
      After the baseline visit is completed, patient(s) and their provider will be randomized to
      either Intervention or Usual care arm as partners. The intervention arm will receive diabetes
      self-management education and modest financial incentives (gift cards) for completing
      diabetes process and glycemic outcomes according diabetes &quot;best practices&quot;. Usual care
      patients will receive an equal number of educational materials on diabetes self-management
      via mail and will receive usual care through their provider but will not receive additional
      incentives for reaching glycemic outcomes. Both arms of the study will complete outcome
      visits at baseline, 4.5 and 9 months.

    <description>Patient participants in the intervention arm will receive diabetes self-management program, Ma ka hana ka ̒ike which includes 5 interactive group sessions lasting 1-1/2 hours in length delivered by community peer educators once a month for 4.5 months. After 4.5 months, the patient will receive 4 monthly boosters by mail that will reinforce information from the Ma ka hana ka ̒ike program. Completion of diabetes process and glycemic outcomes will trigger the modest financial incentives.
Health care provider participants in the intervention arm will receive educational resources, Hanapū Provider Toolbox to guide their patients to optimal glycemic control.They will receive modest financial incentives when their patients complete clinical tests and achieve glycemic target.</description>

    <description>Patient participants in the usual care arm will receive 5 mail-out diabetes self management education booklets endorsed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Institute for Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney disease for 4.5 months. Patients will see their doctor according to usual care practice. After 4.5 months, the patients will receive 4 monthly boosters in mail reinforcing the previous mail-out diabetes self-management program materials.
Health care provider participants in the usual care arm will receive the latest ADA guidelines to use in their treatment plan of their patients.</description>
