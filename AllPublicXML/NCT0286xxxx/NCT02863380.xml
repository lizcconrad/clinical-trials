    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that personalizing the rTMS targets using functional MRI will
      increase its efficacy. The most dysfunctional regions or the most dysfunctional network will
      be stimulated homogeneously. Individualized rTMS will be compared to traditional rTMS
      procedure and to trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a randomized cross-over
      trial.

      In this pilot study the primary outcome measure will be the correction of the MRI anomalies.
      Symptoms reduction and the proportion of remitters will be secondary outcome measurements.

    <description>The target region will be defined by comparing the rCBF scan of the patient to a control population. rCBF will be measured using the average of 2 ∙ 3 (=6) measures of rCBF using QUIPS2 arterial spin labeling sequence on a Siemens 3T Verio. rCBF change of the target region will be compared before &amp; after therapeutic protocol between the different procedures (ANOVA).
Functional connectivity map of the target region will be performed by extracting its average temporal course and looking at the region(s) which activity is correlated. Contrast map of each patient will be compared to the one of a control population submitted to the same analysis. Change in the number of above threshold voxels (F-test, p &lt; 0.05 uncorrected, extension &gt; 1 cm3) will be compared before &amp; after therapeutic procedure (ANOVA). rCBF's change of the target region will be compared before &amp; after therapeutic protocol between the different procedures (ANOVA).</description>

    <description>The target region will be defined by comparing the rCBF scan of the patient to a control population (n = 38). rCBF will be measured using the QUIPS2 arterial spin labeling sequence on a Siemens 3T Verio.
The therapeutic protocol will be design to correct the rCBF anomaly first by defining each point where to deliver the stimulation than the stimulation protocol for each point (180% of active motor threshold, 4-second 10 Hz train duration, with 26-second intertrain interval for a total of 3000 pulses). The whole target will be homogeneously stimulated.
The active motor threshold will be assessed. The procedure will be repeated twice a day for 10 days over 2 weeks.</description>
