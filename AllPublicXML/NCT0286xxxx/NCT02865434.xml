    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, safety with PK and dosimetry study of
      injected Tc 99m tilmanocept in the detection of and assessment of localization to skeletal
      joints in subjects with and without active RA by SPECT imaging. All subjects will receive IV
      administration at one of 3 mass doses: 50 µg, 200 µg, or 400 µg. Within each mass dose group,
      subjects will receive Tc 99m tilmanocept labeled with one of 3 radiolabel doses: 1 mCi, 5
      mCi, or 10 mCi.

      All subjects will have a whole body planar SPECT scan. Subjects enrolled in Groups 1-9 will
      receive a whole body planar SPECT scan followed by a 3D SPECT or SPECT/CT scan on areas of
      interest at two specified time points post injection: 60 minutes ± 15 minutes and 180 minutes
      ± 15 minutes. Subjects enrolled in Groups 10-11 will receive a whole body planar SPECT scan
      performed at 4 specified time points post injection: 15 ± 5 minutes, 60 ± 15 minutes, 180 ±
      15 minutes and 18-20 hours. PK tests will be performed before injection (within 15 minutes),
      immediately following injection and at each scanning timepoint. Dosimetry tests will be
      performed at each scanning timepoint.
