  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The loss of central vision causes difficulty not only in reading but also in faces
      recognition, and in particular in the identification of facial expression, objects or spaces.
      These visual deficits have been mainly studied in relation with reading, which is the main
      complaint of these kind of patients. However, there are not enough data regarding perception
      of objects and spaces in this population. Then, the objectives are to study the
      visual-spatial abilities in individuals with vision loss, and altered cognitive processes,
      (2) to develop clinics tools for early detection and quantification of visual-spatial
      deficits and (3)to understand the capacities of normal peripheral vision in order to test the
      possibility of potential training for use of peripheral vision when central vision is
      impaired by an ophthalmic pathology.
