  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of acute isoquercetin supplementation,
      aspirin, and isoquercetin/aspirin combination on platelet aggregation, blood pressure and
      vasculat stiffness (eg digital volume pulse), as well as investigating the plasma
      accumulation and urine excretion profiles of quercetin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. In 2012, approximately
      17.5 million people worldwide died from CVD, representing 31% of global death. Flavonoids are
      a class of plant secondary metabolites, functioning in the plant to aid in growth. These
      compounds are found in diets worldwide, and many cohort studies have demonstrated the
      protective effect of diets high in flavonoids against CVD events, with some studies showing
      flavonoid intake inversely associated with CV event risk, CV non-fatal events and all-cause
      mortality. One consistent issue with quercetin as a dietary flavonoid is the plasma
      concentrations it is able to reach are not always sufficient to provide a protective effect.
      Therefore, supplementation or pharmacological intervention with flavonoids may offer a
      solution. Supplementation with isoquercetin, the 3-O-glucoside of quercetin, offers the
      potential for much higher plasma concentrations of quercetin and its metabolites than dietary
      sources can offer, with associated increased inhibitory, anti-platelet effects. It must
      therefore be addressed whether isoquercetin supplementation can effectively reduce platelet
      function ex vivo, measured by aggregation and closure time, as well as improve vascular
      function, measured through blood pressure (BP) and vascular stiffness (eg digital volume
      pulse (DVP)).
