      will be investigated in patients with OBPI.

    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve injury results in a number of cortical changes due to the lack of sensory
      and motor stimuli. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that
      revealed the changes in the cortical activation exist, the cortical activation changes in
      obstetrical brachial plexus injury is poorly known. For this reason, the aim of this study is
      to investigate the cortical activity during rest and with stimulation by fMRI in patients
      with OBPI.

      Patients with OBPI diagnosis in the cervical 5-6 (C5-6) (upper trunk) who are followed up in
      Gazi University Faculty of Health Sciences Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation
      Division of Hand Rehabilitation will participate in the study. Patients with a surgery
      history at least 5 years ago and over 10 years age will be included. Clinical motor and
      sensory assessments will be performed to help in explaining the analyses of cortical
      activation. In their first visit, clinical assessments including Active Movement Scale,
      modified Mallet Classification (MMC) and sensory tests will be performed; while fMRI scanning
      will be carried out in the second visit. Patients will be scanned for 3 paradigms at one
      single fMRI session: at rest and during sensory stimulation and watching videos of motor
      movements. Video images will include the 5 movements used in MMC and will be watched by
      glasses integrated in the MRI device. Images obtained from MR scanning will be analyzed with
      analysis programs like Leonardo, Fresurfer, SPM, BrainVoyager and clinical results will be
      compared to MR images.
