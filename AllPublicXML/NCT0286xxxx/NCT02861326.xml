      Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between initial probing depth
      (IPD) and changes in clinical parameters following non-surgical periodontal treatment (NPT)
      in chronic periodontitis patients.

      Material and Methods: A total of 1672 periodontal pockets having 3 mm≤IPD≤9 mm in 15 chronic
      periodontitis patients were included. NPT consisting of oral hygiene instructions, scaling
      and root planing was applied in two sessions. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level,
      gingival recession (GR) were measured before and eight weeks after treatment. Pocket sites
      were grouped according to their IPD and root number of teeth as single- or multi-rooted.
