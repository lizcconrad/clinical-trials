      The ForConti Fecal Incontinence Management System (FIMS) is indicated for the management of
      accidental bowel leakage due to bowel incontinence. The ForConti FIMS is designed for
      self-insertion to seal and help prevent the involuntary leakage of stool, liquids and gases
      from the rectum.

      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the ForConti FIMS is safe and that it
      improves management of fecal incontinence and improves quality of life.

      Patients will record bowel events in a daily diary over a 5 week period, which includes 1
      week of adjustment to device use, 2 weeks without using the device followed by 2 weeks using
      the device. Quality of Life questionnaire will be completed before and after use of the
      device. Stool leakage data collected when the device is not being used will be compared with
      data collected during use of the device to determine effectiveness.

      There are several devices for treating bowel incontinence. However, available devices have
      limited success. Sphincter bulking agents and electrical stimulation did not demonstrate
      effectiveness in clinical studies. Anal plugs did show some effectiveness but are associated
      with discomfort and pain. Hence, patients prefer not to use them.

      The main reason for pain and discomfort with the current available anal plugs is the plug
      location within the anus below the dentate line. This part of the anus which is highly
      sensitive it causes discomfort and pain to the user. The advantage of the ForConti device is
      that it is designed to be located at a more inner section of the anal canal, above the
      dentate line, which is much less sensitive thus does not cause discomfort to the user.

      This is a prospective, feasibility, non-randomized, single-arm, self-controlled study for
      preliminary safety and effectiveness. Total duration of the study for each patient will be 7
      weeks, including follow-up.

      The study will be conducted on up to 20 patients suffering from accidental bowel leakage due
      to bowel incontinence and who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria. Following first 5 cases, interim preliminary safety analysis will be conducted and
      a report submitted to Ministry of Health for approval to continue the study.

      Safety Endpoints:

      Primary: No device related serious adverse events. Secondary: Minimal rate of device or
      procedure adverse events with device use or in the follow-up period.

      Effectiveness Endpoints:

      Demonstrate the effectiveness of the system by: A Relative Percentage Change in Episodes of
      Accidental Bowel Leakage (ABL) Determined by Comparing Active Weeks to Control Weeks Results
      as measured by Daily Diary Recordings.

      Secondary: QOL and SUS Usability Survey Score

      Control and Active periods will be for 2 weeks each, to account for daily and weekly
      variability in subject bowel habits.

      The ForConti FIMS includes 2 main parts: the inserted part and the insertion system. The
      inserted part includes a balloon and a pulling string and the insertion system includes the
      applicator and the inflator. The balloon is a flexible biocompatible, silicone-based,
      oval-shaped, furled component. It is designed to be located in the rectum by an applicator
      and to be filled with a pre-determined amount of air to gain its final shape. The silicone
      surface is equipped with silicone gags which provide better sustainability in the rectum.
