      That study have the primary purpose identify if exist difference to the healing and quality
      of life between women that use of a surgical support bra, common support bra and without
      support bra after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

      To do this, will be assessed pain, healing of the wound (dehiscence, infection) and quality
      of life life through specific instruments.

      The patients will be randomized and share into three groups: women after coronary artery
      bypass surgery use surgical support bra, women after coronary artery bypass surgery use
      common support bra and those who will not use any support bra.

      They will be can tracked and invited to participate in the study few days before the surgery
      or during the post operatory (2 - 6 days after surgery). The assessement and the intervention
      must be start in the inpatient unit from the 2nd to 6th post operatory until their discharge.

      Initially, it will be apply a questionnaire of quality of life (SF36) to assess the quality
      of life before the surgical procedure. In this moment, will be measured for breast size and
      also wil be identify the risk factors through a brief historical.

      During the stay in the hospital, the patients will be assessed on a daily basis with respect
      to the following: pain (verbal numerical scale) and wound appearance.

      The questionnaire of quality of life(SF36) will be applied again for more three times, about
      one month, two months and six months after the discharge together with the assessement to the
      pain and wound healing.
