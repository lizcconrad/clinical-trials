  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the motor and sensory functions, sexual function changes after spinal cord
      injury and is considered one of the most common problems, ranging from a decrease in sexual
      desire to disturbances of erection, orgasm and ejaculation.

      Objective: To assess the impact of the complexity of traumatic spinal cord injury in male
      sexual function.

      Methods: Observational study (CEAC 41221414.5.0000.5208) conducted with 45 men, mean age 34
      (CI 31.5 to 37.1), with spinal cord injury and active sex life. Sexual function was assessed
      by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and level and degree of injury were
      determined following the guidelines of the International Standards for Neurological and
      Functional Examination Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Data were collected after at
      least six months of injury in referral hospitals. Descriptive statistics and bivariate
      analysis were applied to observe the association between sexual function and complexity of
      the lesion, with a 0.05 significance level.
