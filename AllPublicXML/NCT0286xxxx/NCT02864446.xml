  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP), a marker of intestinal mucosal cell
      damage, has recently been proposed as a clinically useful measure in the early detection of
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, there are no data on urinary i-FABP in meconium
      obstruction of prematurity (MOP). This study aimed to evaluate urinary i-FABP in MOP patient
      as a marker for early detection.

        Preterm infants weighing &lt;1,250g who were admitted in neonatal intensive care unit at Seoul
        National University Children's Hospital

          -  Initial urine samples are collected at the time of 12, 24, 48 hours (+/- 6 hours)
             after birth.

          -  Further urine samples are collected every 48 hours when the enteral feeding starts.
             (till the amount of feeding reaches to 40mL/kg/day)
