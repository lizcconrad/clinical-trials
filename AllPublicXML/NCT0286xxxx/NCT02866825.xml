    <textblock>
      The trial enrolls patients undergoing a complex cardiac surgery. The primary goal of the
      trial is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic dose response relationship of the monoclonal
      antibody IFX-1 in these patients. In addition, this trial further aims to characterize the
      safety and the pharmacokinetics of IFX-1 as well as to collect first data on its efficacy on
      clinical surrogate endpoints.
