  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Human Trisome Project will significantly increase the speed of Down syndrome research and
      the understanding of associated medical conditions. Its biobank will provide de-identified
      samples to research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide qualified and approved researchers with access to
      biological samples and health information to answer specific research questions. This project
      will significantly increase the speed of Down syndrome research and the understanding of
      associated medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, congenital heart defects,
      autoimmune disorders, autism, and some forms of leukemia.

      Participation includes a blood draw, a mouth swab, and allowing researchers to look at your
      health information yearly for the next 5 years. Optional procedures include providing a urine
      and/or stool sample and taking part in the study for a longer time frame.
