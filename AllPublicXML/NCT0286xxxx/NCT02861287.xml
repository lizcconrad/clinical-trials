    <textblock>
      This study aims to realize an economic evaluation of the introduction of Plerixafor in
      addition to G-CSF and alternative options, in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who failed
      or insufficiently mobilize peripheral blood stem and progenitor cells in response to G-CSF
      alone.

    <description>The cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed using the collection of a transplantable graft as effectiveness criteria; the suitability of collected cell products for transplantation will be judged as per institutional criteria.
Direct medical costs will be estimated by micro-costing, i.e. by measuring physical quantities (capital and labor) consumed for each patient and attributing corresponding monetary costs on the basis of average French prices. Costs (including room - inpatient and outpatient, drugs and laboratory tests) will be estimated on the basis of patients' medical records.</description>

        The study will retrospectively review 60 electronic health records of patients who
        underwent peripheral blood stem cell mobilization for Multiple Myeloma, and who failed to
        achieve efficient and clinically meaningful mobilization in response to a well-conducted
        &quot;G-CSF alone&quot; regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma who were eligible for high-dose
             melphalan supported with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as
             part of their treatment plan

          -  First mobilization attempt

          -  &quot;rhG-CSF alone&quot; mobilization regimen

          -  Failed mobilization as documented by an increase in CD34+ cell mobilization deemed
             insufficient to initiate apheresis (below 15/µL), after the 4 first injections of
             rhG-CSF that are administered in the evening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years;

          -  Primary diagnosis other than MM

          -  2nd or subsequent mobilization attempt

          -  Patients who previously received HDCT + autologous HSCT

          -  Chemotherapy-based mobilization regimen

          -  Efficient mobilization, allowing for apheresis and collection of the target cell
             number (5x106 CD34+ cells/kg for every planned autologous transplantation as per
             institutional SOPs).
