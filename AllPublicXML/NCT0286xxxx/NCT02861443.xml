      The main objective of this study was to determine the frequency of the practice of colonic
      irrigation (CI) among patients with a colostomy,.

      Other objectives are:

        -  To compare the quality of life between a group of patients with a colostomy and
           practicing CI versus a group of patients with a colostomy without CI.

        -  To determine the causes of non-realization of the CI or failure.

        -  To determine the conditions of realization of colonic irrigation by the return of user
           experience (time of day when the CI is practiced, amount and type of fluid used, time
           spent in the bathroom, time to recurrence of stool, media used between two irrigations).
