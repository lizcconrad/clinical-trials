      This study will comprise an 18-week open label safety and tolerability trial. In this study,
      a total of 35 subjects with primary lateral sclerosis PLS or upper motor neuron predominate
      ALS will be enrolled. At the initial screening evaluation, a baseline T25FW will be obtained.
      This baseline test will be repeated at weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, 14 18. The validity of this measure
      was shown in MS studies when compared to the MSWS-12 (12 item walking scale) and CGI
      (clinical global impression) scales (35-37). A consistent responder will be defined as
      improvement in 3 of 4 Timed 25Foot Wwalk while on medication, compared with the baseline
      results while off medication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 18-99;

          2. Diagnosis of upper motor neuron disease, compatible with PLS but may include upper
             motor neuron (UMN) predominant ALS, defined as only upper motor neuron (UMN) features
             in at least 2 body regions on examination.

          3. EMG within 3 months of enrollment with minimal or no evidence of lower motor neuron
             disease,

          4. Time from symptom onset &gt; 18 months

          5. No previous allergy to dalfampradine

          6. No current or exposure to any therapeutic agent targeting PLS or ALS within 30 days of
             enrollment.

          7. Must have a forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 60% of expected

          8. Written informed consent prior to screening is present.

          9. Subjects on a stable dose of or have not taken Riluzole for at least thirty days

         10. Impaired walking as measured by a Hauser Index of greater than 1 and less than 7 (2 to
             6, inclusive);

             informed consent and following trial procedures.

             months after study completion. Adequate contraception includes: abstinence, hormonal
             contraception (oral contraception, implanted contraception, injected contraception or
             other hormonal contraception, for example patch or contraceptive ring), intrauterine
             device (IUD) in place for ≥ 3 months, barrier method in conjunction with spermicide,
             or another adequate method.

         14. Elicitable Motor evoked potentials (MEP) recorded at 75% of the stimulator output,

             risk or preclude the subject's full compliance with or completion of the study.

         13. Inability to record an MEP at 75% of the stimulator output using a monophasic, reverse
