  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been observed that target fortification on different schedules leads to meal to meal
      variation. It changes the ratio of protein to energy and the percentage of carbohydrate to
      non-protein energy which may, affect growth. In the past, the investigators have analyzed the
      outcomes of breast milk composition when target fortification is done with different analysis
      schedules. The investigators were able to measure the macronutrient intake for different milk
      analysis schedules via a theoretical model and show that the more frequent schedules reduce
      the variation of fortified-breast milk, whereas a reduced schedule leads to a high variation
      of macronutrients. It was observed that, in all the breast milk samples measured twice per
      week, infants achieved on average the recommended macronutrients in line with current
      recommendations. Nonetheless, the model only looks at the macronutrient intake and does not
      investigates the relationship between macronutrient variation and its effect on growth.

      The aim of the current study is to compare a frequent schedule of measurement of
      macronutrient analysis with a reduced schedule of measurement and to study its affect on
      growth, protein accretion and metabolic parameter.
