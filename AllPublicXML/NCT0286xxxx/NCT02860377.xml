  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother spend a large amount of time with their children. It is assumed that mother
      contributes to their neurological development not only with visual stimuli, but also with
      auditory stimuli. A recent study revealed that prefrontal cortex can be activated in response
      to the self-name being spoken by the mother than by a stranger. Therefore, investigators
      suppose that recorded maternal voice can stimulate the pediatric patients and thereby fasten
      the emergence from general anesthesia.

    <measure>Incidence of emergence delirium (ED)</measure>
    <time_frame>During 30 minutes after PACU admission</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of emergence delirium (ED) was defined as pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) score of &gt;12 or Watcha scale over 3.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>peak PAED scale</measure>
    <time_frame>During 30 minutes after PACU admission</time_frame>
    <description>The PAED scale is a validated observational measure of 5 aspects of child behavior (caregiver eye contact, purposeful movement, evidence of awareness of surroundings, restlessness, and inconsolability). Ratings are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 20; greater scores indicate greater severity.</description>

    <time_frame>During 1 hour after operation</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of operation, investigators stop the anesthetics and carefully watch the bispectral index (BIS) monitor. Simultaneously, investigators check the duration of time from discontinuation of anesthetics until the BIS &gt;60.</description>

    <description>The amount of analgesics/anesthetic consumption was checked during hospital admission. At PACU, a total PAED score of &gt;12 or a FLACC scale &gt;4, intravenous fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg was administered as rescue medication and repeated after 10 min if the agitation does not subside.</description>

    <description>A voice recording will be performed before the operation. At a preoperative visit or preoperative clinic, informed consent was obtained before the recording. On a calm environment, the mother was asked to speak following sentences.
&quot; OO (first name of child), wake up~. Let's go home with mommy. OO, wake up~. Open your eyes. Take a deep breath. &quot;
At the end of surgery, the recorded maternal voice was delivered to the child every 15 seconds until he/she wakes up.</description>
