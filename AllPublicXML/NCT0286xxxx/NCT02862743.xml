  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of somatic mutations in tumors is currently indicated for daily practice in all
      metastatic melanoma. Actually, this research is limited to the mutation of three biomarkers
      validated by the l'Institut National du CAncer (INCA): BRAF, NRAS and CKIT. Moreover, in some
      cases it requires invasive biopsies.

      In this context, molecular characterization of a tumor material flowing (circulating tumor
      DNA and / or circulating tumor cells) could afford to benefit patients in the best conditions
      of current targeted therapies and future.

      The main objective of this study will be to define the diagnostic sensitivity of a panel of
      biomarker on the circulating tumor DNA from peripheral blood.

      The secondary objectives of this study will be:

        -  Study the concordance between mutations in circulating tumor DNA and mutations in tumor
           tissue - Study the associations between mutational profiles and clinical and
           histological features of melanoma.

        -  Study the prognostic impact on survival of the identified genetic profile from the
           circulating tumor DNA
