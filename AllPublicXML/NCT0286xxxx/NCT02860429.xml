      The clinical trail of Cinobufacini injection combined with Oxaliplatin regimen on
      gastrointestine carcinoma.This trail is randomized controled.Patients are diagnosed
      gastrointestinal cancer based on pathology or cell biology.They are randomized into 2
      groups:both groups receive Oxaliplatin regimen.The treatment group receives Cinobufotalin
      20ml mixed with 5% Glucose injection 500ml from the first day of chemotherapy until seven
      days in addition to the chemotherapy.The control group only receive the same chemotherapy
      with the treatment group.Both group have the same adjuvant therapy.Mainly to study of
      oxaliplatin into Cinobufacini injection leads to the influence of the peripheral nerve
      toxicity.Clinical evaluation includes neural electrophysiological test,chemotherapy drug
      toxicities,quality of life(QOL),etc.Blood biochemistry tests mainly include inflammatory
      cytokines,peroxidase reaction,immune cell number ratio and stress hormone,etc.
