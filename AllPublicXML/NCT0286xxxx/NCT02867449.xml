  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavior therapy is the most effective treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
      However, the majority of treated patients remain symptomatic. The metacognitive therapy by
      Wells (1997) could achieve substantial gains in first pilot studies. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate this approach with a randomized controlled trial by comparing
      metacognitive therapy with exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive
      disorder.
