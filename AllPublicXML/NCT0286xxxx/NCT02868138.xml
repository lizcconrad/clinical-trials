    <textblock>
      The aim of this single-center observational study was to evaluate quality of life, clinical
      effectiveness, and satisfaction in pediatric and young adult patients with sickle cell
      disease receiving hydroxyurea.

      In this study, 34 pediatric (HbSS: n= 5; HbSβ0: n= 29) and 16 (HbSS: n=5; HbSβ0: n= 11) young
      adult adult patients with sickle cell disease receiving hydroxyurea for at least a year were
      participated. Upon receipt of Informed Consent Form, Case Report Form, Demographic Data
      Collection Form, Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form, Life Quality Survey Short Form-36,
      and Hydroxyurea Therapy Satisfaction Survey were used to obtain data for effectiveness of
      hydroxyurea therapy and parameters that may affect compliance to treatment and life quality
      of the participants.

      Regarding the normal ranges, ferritin, hemoglobin A, A2, F, and S, platelet, mean corpuscular
      volume, erythrocyte distribution width, basophil percentage, monocyte, monocyte percentage,
      total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein values were higher while
      hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte values were lower in these patients. Our findings
      regarding quality of life and satisfaction with hydroxyurea therapy indicated that the
      patients with sickle cell disease had lower scores.

      Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic variables as well as comorbid diseases and concomitant
      drug use when considered together, these findings suggest that the health quality and
      compliance of the pediatric and young adult patients to therapy might be low due to not
      sufficiently effective hydroxyurea therapy in addition to comorbidities, concomitant drug
      use, and side effects.
