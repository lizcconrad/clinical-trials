  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized
      by progressive weakness and atrophy of specific skeletal muscles. One of the major problems
      of patients affected by FSHD is the limitation in performing daily activities induced by the
      progressive muscle weakness. This sedentary lifestyle can cause a &quot;debilitative cycle,&quot; and
      neuromuscular deconditioning can even aggravate the muscular deficiencies. Recent studies
      have indicated the safety and the effectiveness of moderate aerobic training programs in
      patients with FSHD. However, these training programs have limited applicability in patients
      with more severe muscular weakness. Artificial strength training by means of neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation (NMES) appears to be a promising rehabilitation strategy for FSHD
      patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders. Therefore we propose to investigate the
      feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of NMES strength training to counteract quadriceps
      muscle weakness in patients affected by FSHD.

      NMES will be delivered to both quadriceps by means of a Kneehab® XP device, which is an
      innovative and clinically-proven garment-based product designed specifically to treat
      quadriceps muscle atrophy. The main NMES current parameters are: 50-Hz frequency, 100-400 µs
      pulse duration, 5:10-second on:off time. Each session will last approximately 20 minutes and
      will be repeated 5 days/week for a total duration of the treatment program of 3 months.
