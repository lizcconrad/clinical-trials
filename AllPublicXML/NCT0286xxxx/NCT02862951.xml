      The specific aim is to attempt to quantify the amount and efficiency of sleep that
      parturients receive after placement of labor epidural analgesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the placement of labor epidural analgesia results in improved sleep
      efficiency and increased amount of sleep for parturients during their labor process as
      measured by an actigraph. An actigraph is a watch that monitors movement and allows for
      non-invasive determination of sleep-wake cycles. For this study, the Actiwatch 2 will be used
      due to departmental availability. For this study, 36 parturients will be enrolled that are
      coming in for induction of labor at term gestational age, regardless of whether they think
      they will desire epidural analgesia or not . These parturients will wear the Actiwatch from
      the beginning of induction of their labor until the delivery of their baby. Participants will
      be instructed to press a button on the watch to record the start and end times of when they
      are trying to sleep. The data will then be analyzed to determine the amount of time that
      participants were able to sleep after placement of an epidural catheter as well as their
      sleep efficiency, defined as the percentage of time spent sleeping during the time in which
      sleep is attempted.
