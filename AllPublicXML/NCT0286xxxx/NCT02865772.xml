      The aim of this study to determine the reference ranges of LBC on gastric aspirate in healthy
      term newborns.

      Lamellar bodies represent the storage form of lung surfactant. Surfactant is produced in
      alveolar type II cells and transported to the alveolar surface as lamellar bodies. Lamellar
      bodies are present in the amniotic fluid and also gastric aspirate.It has become a preferred
      test for determine fetal lung maturity, because of the rapid, inexpensive, easily accessible
      and easily applicable method.
