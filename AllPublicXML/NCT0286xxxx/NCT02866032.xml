          1. Males or females 18 - 70 years of age

          2. Distal subungual onychomycosis (DSO) of at least one of the great toenail(s) affecting
             20% to 50% of the target nail

          3. Positive culture for dermatophytes

          4. Signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Proximal subungual onychomycosis

          2. Distal subungual onychomycosis of both great toenails where involvement has extended
             into the proximal portion of the target nail (unaffected proximal nail is less than 3
             mm)

          3. Target toenail thickness more than 3 mm

          4. &quot;Spike&quot; of onychomycosis extending to eponychium of the target toenail

          5. Presence of dermatophytoma (defined as thick masses of fungal hyphae and necrotic
             keratin between the nail plate and nail bed) on the target nail

          6. Other conditions than DSO known to cause abnormal nail appearance

          7. Presence of toenail infection other than dermatophytes

          8. Previous target toenail surgery with any residual disfigurement

          9. Topical treatment of the nails with other antifungal medication or medical device
             within 1 month before Baseline/Visit 2

         10. Systemic use of antifungal treatment within 7 months before Baseline/ Visit 2

         11. Severe moccasin tinea pedis

         12. Signs of severe peripheral circulatory insufficiency

         13. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

         14. Known immunodeficiency

         15. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device during
             the previous 3 months before Baseline/ Visit 2

         16. Known allergy to any of the tested treatment products

         17. A positive pregnancy test indicating pregnancy in a woman of childbearing potential at
             Baseline/ Visit 2

         21. History of, or current drug or alcohol abuse

         22. Psychiatric condition that might limit the participation in the study and/or that lead
             to the assumption that the patient's ability to completely understand the consequences
             of consent is missing

         23. Close affiliation with the investigator (e.g. a close relative) or persons working at

         25. Any diseases or circumstances in which the patient should not participate in the study
