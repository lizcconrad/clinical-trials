      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the co-morbidities profile on
      treatment response in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, non-interventional, observational study that will include
      consecutive participants diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD) who
      started treatment with biologics between June 2011 and June 2013. This study will look at the
      impact of the co-morbidities on treatment response in IBD patients.

      The study will enroll approximately 400 patients: 200 UC patients and 200 CD patients.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted in Spain. Investigator will collect retrospective
      data in a single visit from participants who started biologic treatment between June 2011 and
      June 2013. Time since participants started biological treatment until study visit or until
      lack of treatment response or until treatment change will constitute the reference period for
      the study.
