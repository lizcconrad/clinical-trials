    <textblock>
      This project aims at identifying new determinants of type 2 diabetes in severe obesity. To do
      so, a biological collection, including tissues of interest in the field of metabolism, will
      be collected during bariatric surgery in obese patients. Three different groups of metabolic
      status of patients, corresponding to different stages of evolution of the disease, will be
      constituted: type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity.

      The main objective is to compare, between these 3 groups of patients, several biological
      processes that may be involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and disorders
      associated with obesity, including:

        -  Abnormalities of the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome in all target tissues (plasma,
           serum, muscle, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, omental artery, liver)

        -  Identification of metabolic signatures, protein and miRNA in plasma

        -  Immunoinflammatory response in adipose tissue

        -  Polymorphisms SNP from whole blood

        -  Histological analysis of tissue sections This main objective will be studied on samples
           taken at the time of surgery Secondary objectives will be to study the changes in
           metabolites, proteins and miRNA in plasma level 3 and 12 months after the completion of
           surgery, according to the initial metabolic state.
