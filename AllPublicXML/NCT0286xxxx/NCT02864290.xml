  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AGS62P1 given at
      three dosing schedules (Schedule A, every three weeks [Q3W] or Schedule B, every other week
      of a 4 week cycle [Q2W] or Schedule C once a week for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle) in subjects
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In
      addition, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), the immunogenicity and the
      anti-leukemic activity of AGS62P1.
