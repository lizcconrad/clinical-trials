      This research study is studying the combination of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) and
      Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for Recurrent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Peritoneal
      Cancer that is resistant to platinum therapy.

      The following interventions will be used in this study:

        -  Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)

        -  Pembrolizumab
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The investigators are looking to see if combining the standard therapy, PLD, and the study
      drug, Pembrolizumab, will be better than PLD alone. Pembrolizumab is a drug called a
      monoclonal antibody. Pembrolizumab blocks and interferes with a protein called PD-1; PD-1 can
      help the cancer cell evade the immune system, and thereby blocking PD-1 may help the immune
      system recognize and kill cancer cells.

      This will be the first time this combination will be tested for participants with Ovarian,
      Fallopian Tube or Peritoneal Cancer. Therefore, a group of 6 participants will be treated in
      a &quot;safety lead in&quot; portion of the trial. This lead in will determine the safest dose of PLD
      when given in combination with the study drug Pembrolizumab. These 6 participants will be
      treated with Pembrolizumab and PLD at the FDA approved dose to see if the combination is well
      tolerated or too severe. If the combination is well tolerated, 20 additional participants
      will be added. If the side effects are too severe, the dose of PLD will be lowered.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved PLD as a treatment option for
      this disease, but has not approved Pembrolizumab.

    <description>A safety lead in with 6 patients will be studied prior the start of the treatment.
If 2 out of the first 6 patients develop a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the dose of PLD will be reduced.
If no more than 1 patient of the first 6 patients has evidence of dose limiting toxicities, the dose level will be considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) pre-determine dosage will be administered every 4 weeks via IV
Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30 min IV infusion every 3 weeks at a pre-determine dosage</description>
