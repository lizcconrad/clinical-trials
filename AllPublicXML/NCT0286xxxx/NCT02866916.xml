      This is a single site, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I study designed to
      evaluate the safety, the tolerability and the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of SXL01, a
      synthetic small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) targeting the androgen receptor messenger
      RNA (mRNA), in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      A standard method &quot;3+3&quot; will be used for dose escalation. A maximum of 30 patients will
      complete the dose-escalation phase of the study; 12 additional patients will be included at
      the RP2D in the expansion phase.

    <description>The standard method &quot;3+3&quot; will be used for dose escalation: the first 3 patients will be treated at level 1; consecutive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will be treated with increasing doses of SXL01.
Treatment will be administered until patient experiences unacceptable toxicity, PSA raising, progressive disease and/or treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or withdrawal of consent.
Additional patients will be included at the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) in the expansion phase.</description>
