    <textblock>
      This study has two portions. The main goal of the Phase I portion of this research study is
      to see what doses of CB-839 and capecitabine can safely be given to patients without having
      too many side effects. Other purposes of this research study will be to determine what side
      effects are seen with this combination of medicines. The Phase II portion of the study will
      test how many patients show shrinkage in their tumor with this combination of medicines and
      what changes occur inside the cancer cells and blood cells after treatment.

      Phase I Primary Objective:

      To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of combination
      CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom there
      are no remaining treatment options or for whom single agent capecitabine is an acceptable
      therapy.

      Phase II Primary Objective:

      To determine the disease control rate of combination CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy in
      patients with metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancers who are refractory to
      fluoropyrimidine based therapy.

      Phase I Secondary Objectives:

      To determine the dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of combination therapy
      with CB-839 and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom there are no
      remaining treatment options or for whom single agent capecitabine is an acceptable therapy.

      To determine the antitumor response as assessed by RECIST criteria of combination therapy
      with CB-839 and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom there are no
      remaining treatment options or for whom single agent capecitabine is an acceptable therapy.

      Phase II Secondary Objectives:

      To determine the progression free survival following treatment with CB-839 and capecitabine
      chemotherapy in patients with metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer and are refractory
      to fluoropyrimidine therapy.

      To determine the overall survival following treatment with CB-839 and capecitabine
      chemotherapy in patients who have metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer and are
      refractory to fluoropyrimidine therapy.

    <description>The Phase I study has been designed to define the recommended phase II dose of CB-839 and capecitabine. A traditional 3+3 dose escalation design will be adopted. Nine to twenty-four patients are expected to be enrolled, depending on the number of dose escalations and assuming that a total of 6 patients will be treated at the final recommended phase II dose level. Patients who complete the first 21 day treatment cycle of CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy will be included in the analysis.</description>

    <measure>PHASE 2: Number of patients with response to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>In the phase II component of this study, the primary endpoint is response rate. Response rate will be determined using RECIST criteria.
RECIST response categories: Progressive disease (PD): &gt;=20% increase in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesion(s), taking as reference smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): &gt;=30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesion(s), taking as reference baseline sum LD. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD.</description>

               -  Patients with ongoing toxicities &gt; grade 1 according to National Cancer Institute
                  (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria For Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0

               -  Patients with untreated brain metastases/central nervous system disease will be
                  excluded due to their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
                  neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
                  adverse events.

               -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to or intolerance to
                  compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to either CB-839 or
                  capecitabine. If capecitabine has been received previously, must have tolerated
                  at least an equivalent dose to the dose to be administered at their assigned dose
                  level.

               -  Patients who are unable to swallow pills or who have undergone surgery that
                  prohibits the absorption of pills in the stomach.

               -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to
                  ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
                  angina pectoris or myocardial infarction within prior 6 months, cardiac
                  arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
                  with study requirements.

               -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from the study.

               -  Patients known to be HIV positive who are not receiving anti-retroviral therapy
                  will be excluded due to the marrow suppressive therapy involved in administration
                  of the study treatment.
