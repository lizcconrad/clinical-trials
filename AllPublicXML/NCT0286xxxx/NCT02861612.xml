      This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of nerve transfers in restoring hand function in
      patients with cervical spinal injuries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical spinal cord injury is a life‐altering injury that results in profound loss of upper
      limb function. Hand function is essential to basic activities of daily living and
      consequently has a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Tendon transfers and/or
      tenodesis have traditionally been used to restore hand function in spinal cord injuries -
      however, in recent years there is growing interest in the role of nerve transfers as a means
      of accomplishing this goal. Although preliminary results indicate nerve transfers may be
      well‐suited for patients with spinal cord injury, their long term efficacy has not been
      demonstrated.

      This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of nerve transfers in restoring hand function in
      patients with cervical spinal injuries. Eligible patients will receive nerve transfer
      procedure(s) (e.g. brachialis to anterior interosseous nerve, supinator to posterior
      interosseous) and will be followed post-operatively to assess for changes in strength,
      functional independence, and quality of life.

        Any patients with cervical spinal cord injury and upper extremity dysfunction who are
        medically stable, residents of Canada, willing and able to be assessed at the The Ottawa

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a spinal cord injury AIS level C5 to C7. Those with motor complete
             injuries (AIS A or B) will be considered for surgical intervention if they are ≥ 5
             months post injury. Motor incomplete patients (AIS C or D) will be considered if they
             are ≥ 1.5 years post injury.

          -  Patients will require ≥ MRC 4 strength of the muscle supplied by the donor nerve (e.g.
             brachialis, supinator).

          -  Finger flexor and extensor strength should be ≤ MRC 1 strength.

          -  Muscles supplied by the donor nerve, will need to have no or minimal of evidence of
             lower motor neuron injury as dictated by evidence of fibrillations, positive sharp
             waves, or moderate or severely decreased recruitment on needle electromyography.

          -  Those being evaluated for surgery outside nine-months post injury recipient muscles
             will be required to be free of lower motor neuron pathology.

          -  Ability to comply and participate in rigorous post-surgical therapy regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Comorbidities precluding safe surgery including autonomic/hemodynamic instability,
             pulmonary instability, active infection, chronic pressure sores or untreated urinary
             tract infections as determined by physician.

          -  Simultaneous tendon transfer or tenodesis surgery (which would preclude separation of
             the effect of nerve transfer alone).
