    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single blind study. Patients enrolled in the study were
      randomly assigned to a ketorolac or a gabapentin group for pain control. Different pain
      scores and variables will be evaluated, along with others side effects variables.

      This is a prospective, randomized, single blind study. Patients enrolled in the study were
      randomly assigned to the ketorolac or gabapentin group. The gabapentin (Neurontin, Pfizer,
      Mexico) group was instructed to take one 300-mg capsule the night before surgery and 1
      capsule every 8 hours on the day of surgery and for the first 3 postoperative days. The
      ketorolac group (Dolac, Siegfried Rhein, Mexico) was instructed to take their 10-mg tablets
      every 8 hours on the day of surgery and for the first 3 postoperative days. Different pain
      scores and variables will be evaluated, along with others side effects variables.

    <measure>Numeric scale of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Using a numeric scale of pain, patients were asked to state their pain intensity on a scale of 0 to 10, explaining the patient that a 0 represents no pain at all and a 10 would be the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The last four issues on the questionnaire were related to side effects associated with the use of the medication, specifically dizziness, drowsiness, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms</description>

    <measure>Symptoms related to pain</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to rate the severity of four different symptoms during the 24-hour period prior to follow-up: tearing, light sensitivity, foreign body sensation, and discomfort/irritation</description>
