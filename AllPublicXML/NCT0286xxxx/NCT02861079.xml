  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of transcervical Foley catheter balloon and vaginal
      prostaglandin E2 in induction of labor at term. Half of participants will be used combine
      transcervical Foley catheter balloon and vaginal prostaglandin E2, while the other half will
      be used alone vaginal prostaglandin E2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An unfavorable cervix during induction decreases the success rate of labor induction and
      vaginal delivery. Therefore it is required to apply cervical ripening methods for unfavorable
      cervices. Application of transcervical Foley catheter is an effective mechanical method and
      has the advantages of lower cost and lowest rate of fetal heart rate changes due to
      tachysystole compared with PGE1 and PGE2. Despite the advantages of mechanical methods, PGE1
      and PGE2 are reported to be more effective than mechanical methods to achieve vaginal
      delivery within 24 hours. Although there are a lot of studies comparing PGE1, PGE2 and
      transcervical Foley balloon catheter separately and PGE1 combined with transcervical Foley
      balloon catheter, less is known about combined usage of PGE2 and transcervical Foley balloon
      catheter.
