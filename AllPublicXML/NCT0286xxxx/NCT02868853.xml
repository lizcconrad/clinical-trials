      The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of two different methods of mobile
      dietary self-monitoring for weight loss. Both of these interventions will provide weight loss
      information through twice weekly audio podcasts. In addition to the podcasts, participants
      will be asked to track their diet using an assigned mobile applications (for their
      smartphone), which will be randomly assigned.

      This study will include an intensive phase for 6 weeks and a follow-up phase that will occur
      through the final 6 months of the study. Participants will attend one 1-hour orientation
      meeting at the beginning of the study and a 2-hour baseline assessment and training meeting.
      A final assessment will be conducted at the end of 6 weeks with a follow-up assessment at 6
      months. Everyone in the study will be asked to listen to 2 podcasts per week. Each of the
      podcasts will take about 15-20 minutes to listen to and so participants should expect to
      spend 30-40 minutes each week listening to podcasts. Participants also will be randomized to
      track diet with one of the two mobile dietary tracking applications that will be used in the
      study. Participants will be encouraged to monitor their exercise and body weight.
