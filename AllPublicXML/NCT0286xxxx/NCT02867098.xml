      The study will enroll approximately 50 eligible healthy male and female subjects between the
      ages of 18 to 55 inclusive. There will be 5 parallel dose cohorts (Cohorts 1-5) consisting of
      10 subjects in each cohort. No subject will be a member of more than 1 cohort. Subjects will
      receive 3 administrations of study medication.
