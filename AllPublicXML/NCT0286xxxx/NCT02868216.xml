      Stress, anger and depressed humor can operate as a trigger to an Acute Coronary Syndrome.1 It
      is often found in the literature that patients refer excessive anger, anxiety, sadness, pain
      or acute stress promptly before the acute myocardial infarction (AMI) onset, and recent
      meta-analysis report a strong association between the occurrence of AMI and many of these
      acute emotions.2 According to Mostofsky, Maclure, Tofler, Muller and Mittleman3 the risk of
      suffering an AMI doubles after anger burst episodes when compared to another experienced
      situations.

      Anger is a common manifestation of psychological stress,4 and has been considered as an
      hypothesis that this emotion could trigger off an atherogenic process through several
      mechanisms.5-9 Evidences even suggest that hostile people that inhibit their anger expression
      are more prone to develop coronary atherosclerosis.10

      Coronary atherosclerosis features narrowing of coronary arteries on account of endothelial
      thickening caused by the build up of atheromatous plaques.11 It is a process characterized by
      inflammatory and fiberproliferative response of the artery wall, caused by continuous
      aggression to its surface and whose thickening, evoked by the evolution of fat streaks
      atherosclerotic lesions, until fiber plaques is quite slow.12

      Vascular alterations present in atherosclerosis derive from some essential processes:
      endothelial dysfunction, that has an early establishment and alters vase responsiveness,
      leading to vessel constriction,13 coronary blood flood disorders, 13,14 atherosclerosis and
      thrombosis evolution. Endothelial dysfunction also results in the loss of natural
      anti-thrombotic properties involved in the endothelium patency.14

      According to a study performed by our group in the Hemodynamics Sector of the Cardiology
      Institute of Rio Grande do Sul and recently published in the International Journal of
      Cardiology, anger management was significantly lower among patients with CAD when compared to
      those without CAD, and the occurrence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) was significantly
      higher in patients presented with lower anger control. Both associations were independent
      from traditional risk factors, occurrence of previous events or another anger aspects.15
      Thus, this study was designed in order to evaluate the effect of the &quot;cognitive training to
      anger management and control&quot; on endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the arm artery in
      patients with acute myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation submitted to primary
      coronary intervention. Secondary objectives comprehend the assessment of the this treatment
      influence on the incidence of recurrent cardiovascular events in these patients.

      ANGER EVALUATION:

      Anger will be assessed by the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI).
      This instrument was developed to evaluate the expression of anger components and their role
      in a variety of medical conditions. These are statements to be assessed on a Likert scale of
      4 points. Individuals are asked about the intensity of his anger, and how often experience
      this emotion.

      The anger trait measures individual differences in willingness to experience anger. It is
      evaluated through 10 questions, with their scores between 10 and 40 points. It is divided in
      temperament and anger reaction. Anger expression provides a general index on the frequency
      with which anger is experienced, expressed, suppressed or controlled and is evaluated with
      three subscales: anger inside, when angry feelings are repressed or stored; anger-out, when
      the individual expresses anger toward other persons or objects in the environment; and anger
      management (control) which measures the frequency with which each individual tries to control
      the expression of raiva. Each of these subscales is assessed by eight questions, ranging from
      32 to 64 points. The total score for the expression of anger is evaluated by the results:
      Total + in total off - control +16.

      Randomization All patients were evaluated during hospitalization for AMI, but only those
      anger control score were less than 27 points were invited to participate. A randomization
      list was obtained by random.org site and were generated sequential envelopes, sealed and
      numbered which were opened in order day in assessment of endothelial function.

      Endothelial function Endothelial dysfunction is an early dysfunctional vascular responses
      observed in tissue prone to develop atherosclerosis and is also associated with vessel with
      atherosclerosis in later stages. The evaluation of endothelial function will be performed by
      researchers &quot;blinded&quot; as to treatment group. The endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the
      brachial artery will be evaluated by ultrasound with a linear transducer 3-12 MHz (EnVisor
      CHD, Philips, Bothell, WA, USA), being held automated measurements of vessel diameter to own
      the equipment used software. The evaluations will be conducted in the mornings after fasting
      for 12 hours under controlled temperature (22 Â° C). After ten minutes of images of the
      brachial artery rest will be recorded with the linear transducer placed above the antecubital
      fossa continuously for one minute (basal). The sphygmomanometer is placed on the arm and
      inflated up to 50 mmHg limit above systolic blood pressure for five minutes, and the change
      in diameter of the brachial artery after 60 seconds of cuff deflation will be compared with
      the basal diameter. The images of the vessel diameter at end-diastole (identified by R wave
      of the ECG) will be digitized and recorded at intervals of 3 seconds throughout the
      procedure, and subsequently analyzed off-line using software itself equipamento41.

      ANGER TREATMENT:

      Patients allocated to the experimental group will receive specific information and guidance
      on the anger, in order to develop more appropriate management of this feeling. There will be
      two meetings of 40 minutes with monthly frequency. The techniques used in each meeting are
      based on &quot;Cognitive Training Anger Control&quot;, developed and tested by Lipp and Malagris19 in
      several clinical groups. They are semi-structured interviews and focus based on cognitive
      behavioral therapy.

      Session 1 -Delivery of a handout (Appendix IV) to the participant on &quot;How to deal with
      anger.&quot; Reading and Discussion of the following concepts: What is anger? Questioning what
      usually makes you feel angry. Identification of cognitive, emotional and conductuais anger;
      Identification of the &quot;triggers&quot; of anger; anger relation of identification with
      cardiovascular physiology. According to Lipp and Malagris19 (p.115) &quot;anger changes the way
      the body works, changes the breathing, the pressure increases, etc. Mentioning somatic
      diseases linked to anger. When a person feels anger, physical reaction that occurs is
      automatic and unplanned, but then it is difficult to control; for example, to the phrases
      that others use to calm anger increase, as &quot;stay calm&quot;, &quot;control yourself&quot;, etc.

      Session 2 -Perform the survey of &quot;elicitors events of anger.&quot; Point as cognitions, how to
      interpret the facts leads to different emotions. Explanation of what is the Cognitive
      Training control anger. Talk about: Thought as an agent between the event and the person's
      behavior; People evaluate it differently event and this can give a lot of anger in the person
      who is judged right; The person himself can evaluate the same event in different ways at
      different times; As the angry behavior is directly linked to the interpretations that people
      give to events; When interpreting of erroneous or illogical, if not being rational, often not
      realizing is what you are thinking, or that thought is urging the actions that do not
      compensate; It is important to improve the way to evaluate the events and the world around.
      Closure: Deep Breathing Exercise Technical Time-out: isolate yourself from the situation that
      generates anger to take control. Reinforce the importance of returning here for 2 months to
      make the finals of research evaluations.

      The control group patients will not receive any psychological treatment at hospital at least.

      CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

      Phone calls to follow-up will be done to verify the occurrence of major cardiovascular
      events: cardiovascular death, new PTCA, stent thrombosis, stroke and hospitalization, at 30
      days and one year after acute myocardial infarction and will be registered in the database
      itself.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

      The minimum sample size was calculated in 88 patients to detect a 1% difference in
      flow-mediated dilation between the two study groups, with an average standard deviation of
      1.67%, p &lt;0.05 and statistical power of 90 %. The data are presented as means and confidence
      intervals (95% CIs), unless otherwise specified. All analyzes will be based on the principle
      of intention to treat, and will be conducted by researchers who do and whether or not the
      cognitive training for control of anger. Repeated measures of analysis of variance will be
      performed to determine differences in flow-mediated dilation (primary endpoint) and all
      secondary outcomes between the two groups over time, using a conservative F test for the
      interaction between time and study group ( SPSS software, version 18).

      The Geisser correction for the F test is used to adjust the degrees of freedom for the
      roundness deviation (one of the conditions of the repeated measures analysis of variance
      [ANOVA]). logarithmic transformation of the data will be undertaken as appropriate. Fisher's
      post hoc analysis for unpaired and paired data will be performed and interpreted using the
      Bonferroni-Holm adjustment for multiple comparisons.

      The post correlation hoc analysis (by the Spearman rank-correlation method) will be performed
      to evaluate the relationship between the change in flow-mediated dilation of the baseline to
      3 months and the changes in the anger control scores assessed by STAXI from the beginning up
      to 3 months. Differences between categorical variables are calculated using the chi-square
      test. A value of P-tailed &lt;0.05 is considered to indicate statistical significance.
