      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the concentrations of antibiotics (daptomycin,
      vancomycin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime) in serum and periprosthetic tissues(bone and
      synovial joint) used as empirical treatment during reimplantation of infected hip and knee
      prostheses (1-stage or 2-stage management).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (aged of 18 years or more) who undergo reimplantation surgery for
             infected hip or knee prosthesis (performed in 1 or 2-stage(s)), and for whom referral
             physicians plans to use an empirical antibiotic therapy including cefotaxime,
             ceftriaxone, cefepime, daptomycin, or vancomycin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with multiple prosthetic joint infections, or with curative antibiotic
             therapy ongoing within two weeks or less prior to surgery, or for whom an antibiotic
             prophylaxis is decided by referral for the reimplantation surgery, or for whom an
             antibiotic-loaded cement containing the same antibiotic chosen for empirical therapy
             after reimplantation was used in case of 2-stage exchange
