    <textblock>
      Quality of life (QoL) measurements have become an important way to evaluate the treatments
      and care provided to patients with schizophrenia. Understanding determinants of QoL in
      schizophrenia is of importance for developing effective interventions that would improve
      patient functional and subjective well-being. A challenge in the interpretation of QoL
      measures, especially in longitudinal studies, is that QoL is self-reported by the patient and
      might be influenced by psychological phenomena such as adaptation to illness. An important
      mediator of this adaptation process is a &quot;response shift&quot; (RS), which involves changing
      internal standards, values and the conceptualization of QoL. RS can be divided into three
      phases 1) reconceptualization (i.e., a redefinition of QoL), 2) reprioritization (i.e., a
      change in the importance attributed to component domains constituting QoL) and 3)
      recalibration (i.e., a change in a patient's internal standards of measurements). Patients
      may change their frame of reference, rendering scores from different measurement occasions
      incomparable. An RS is a potential explanation when the QoL of an individual who has
      experienced a serious health event or chronic condition is similar to the QoL of a healthy
      individual. With an RS, the concept of QoL changes over time and cannot be compared
      longitudinally because of changes in internal standards, values, and/or concepts. True change
      may be over- or underestimated when a RS is present, leading to biased estimates of the
      magnitude of change.The objective is to examine whether a response shift, a change in the
      internal standards of a patient, occurs in patients suffering from schizophrenia and in their
      caregivers.

      This is a monocentric and propective design study, with inclusion of patients and caregivers
      on a 12-month period, and a follow up on a 12-month period.

      100 patients with schizophrenia and 100 caregivers

      Test approach (Response shift (RS) (pre-test - then-test), unadjusted effect (post-test -
      pre-test), and adjusted effect (post-test - then-test scores)) will be completed with other
      statistical approaches such as confirmatory factorial analysis, multilevel models and CART
      method.
