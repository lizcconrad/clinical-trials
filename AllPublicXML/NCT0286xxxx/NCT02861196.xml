  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to explore the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in muscular
      invasive bladder cancer of T2-4aN0M0, and the survival effect of combined-modality treatment
      model，then to clarify the probability of bladder preservation, corresponding cancer specific
      survival, and the quality of life.
