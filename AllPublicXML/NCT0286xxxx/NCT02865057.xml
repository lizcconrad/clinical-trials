  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal exams are used routinely in labor to assess cervical dilation and position of the
      baby (facing anterior, facing to the right or left side, facing towards maternal spine). This
      technique has a widely variable accuracy rate (24.0-85.6%). Ultrasound has been used to help
      confirm or correct the vaginal assessment by obstetricians, but has not been used to assess
      the utility of immediate feedback to improve the accuracy of vaginal assessment by physicians
      in training. The investigators plan to use ultrasound assessment to determine if this
      education is effective in increasing accuracy in the resident population.

      Residents will be informed of the study through an education session (as a group) and then be
      consented individually. Each resident will complete 15 baseline exams, 20 exams with
      immediate ultrasound confirmation, and 15 exams for post-test baseline. Exams will take place
      periodically throughout the year. Both 3rd and 4th year residents will be assessed during the
      same time period by the MFM fellows. Ultrasounds will follow the vaginal exam as closely as
      possible to prepare for delivery. A picture of the fetal position (with no name or MRN) for
      documentation to be taken during the SOC ultrasound and kept in the research chart for the
      resident.

      In training feedback is not always standard. This teaching tool, consistent and standard
      feedback with regard to the correlation between vaginal exam and ultrasound, would allow the
      resident to learn to assess fetal position more accurately.

      Information from the maternal chart (history and delivery information) will be collected as
      de identified. Data will be recorded on the data collection sheet which is labeled with a
      code number linking the resident participant only.

      Data collected from the residents will be assigned a random Code numbers used to link the
      subject to their data.

      Code and identifiers will be kept separate. Paper copies will be kept in a locked cabinet, in
      a locked office, in a locked suite.

    <description>Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables will be expressed as means and standard deviations and/or medians and ranges. Demographic characteristics will be assessed using chi-square test and Fischer's Exact test for categorical variables. To examine improvement in the number of correct physical exams from baseline to post-intervention a repeated measures t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed. An independent measures t-test or Mann-Whitney U test will be performed to compare the number of correct physical exams between resident groups. Other pertinent statistical tests will be utilized as needed to account for group differences and control for variables of interest.</description>
