      High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are involved in cervical cancer development.
      Integration of HR-HPV DNA in cellular genomes is considered as a major event in the cervical
      cancer development. The aim of this study is to validate the integration of the HPV-HR as an
      appropriate biomarker of the severity of precancerous lesions and progression of cervical
      lesions towards cervical cancer. HR-HPV integration status will be analyzed by Molecular
      Combing technology, which allows direct and high-resolution visualization of the integration
      of high-risk HPV genomes.
