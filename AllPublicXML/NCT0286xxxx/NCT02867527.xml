      Few publications provide information on the natural history of glaucoma, outside of clinical
      trials do not always reflect what is observed in common situation for various reasons
      (specific selection criteria and sometimes restrictive, stronger motivations patients and
      physicians to comply with follow-up visits and prescribed treatments, etc.). Therefore, much
      information on the natural history of glaucoma are unknown to date (degradation rate of
      visual field and visual function over time, risk of blindness in the years following
      diagnosis, effects of various treatments to reduce intraocular pressure and preserving visual
      field deterioration, etc.). Obtaining such important data to improve the management of
      glaucoma patients (choice of treatment methods, identification of predictors of rapid change
      that can make choosing more aggressive treatment and more regular monitoring, etc.) requires
      the establishment of cohort of patients followed and treated with the methods usually used in
      current practice, and besides therapeutic trial.
