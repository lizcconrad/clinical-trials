      To assess the infective etiologies by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of acute
      exacerbation of COPD and asthma who required hospitalization.

      To identify the HRV subtypes that are associated with COPD and asthmaexacerbations.

      To assess if the infective aetiologies have associations with the clinical outcome of the

      Objective: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma exacerbations both
      contribute to significant health care burden. Viral infections are important cause of acute
      exacerbation of COPD and asthma.

      Hypothesis to be tested: 1. Assess infective etiologies by Multiplex Molecular Detection of
      nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) of patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and asthma; 2.
      Identify the human rhinovirus (HRV) (the commonest virus causing exacerbations) subtypes
      involved; 3.Assess if the infective etiologies have associations with clinical outcome of the
      patients.

      Design and subjects: Prospective observational study. Patients admitted to hospital for acute
      exacerbation of COPD and asthma. Stable COPD and asthma patients will be recruited as
      controls.

      Study instruments: Multiplex Molecular Detection of respiratory pathogens from NPA. Clinical
      data of the patient will be collected and spirometry will be performed.

      Interventions: NPA collection from subjects. Main outcome measures: Primary aim is assessment
      of the prevalence of different viruses in relation to acute exacerbation of asthma and COPD.
      Secondary aim is to assess if a certain pathogen is associated with clinical outcomes
      including duration of hospitalization and 30 and 60 day readmissions and mortality Data
      analysis: Data will be analyzed by the Statistical Package of the Social Science Statistical
      software for Window, Version 22 (IBM SPSS Inc, IL, USA). Statistical methods including
      chi-square test, student t test and ANOVA will be used as appropriate.

      Expected results: Understanding the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in COPD and asthma
      exacerbations allows further investigations of treatment options and gives information about
      the prognosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For COPD patients, patients who are admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital with AECOPD
        will be screened for this study. AECOPD is defined when a patient with background COPD
        (with lung function parameters of FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;70%)24 presented with at least two of the
        following major symptoms (increased dyspnoea, increased sputum purulence, increased sputum
        volume) or one major and one minor symptom (nasal discharge/congestion, wheeze, sore
        throat, cough) for at least two consecutive days.25,26

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients who has background COPD as mentioned above fulfilling the exacerbation
             criteria

          2. Age ≥40 years

        For asthma patients, patients who are admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital with asthma
        exacerbation will be screened for this study. Acute exacerbation of asthma is defined when
        an asthma patient presents with increasing dyspnea, wheeze or cough.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients who has background asthma (defined as those with a consistent history and
             prior documented evidence of variable airflow obstruction, with evidence of an
             increase in FEV1 greater than 12% or 400 mL following bronchodilator or bronchial
             hyperresponsiveness on bronchial provocation testing, when stable)6 with any of the
             above exacerbation criteria for at least 2 consecutive days.

          2. Age ≥18 years

        Control asthma and COPD subjects will be recruited from the respiratory clinic of the
        Prince of Wales Hospital. Subjects will be matched for age, sex and lung function of the
        COPD and asthma subjects. All recruited COPD subjects should have FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;70%.
        For asthma patients, they should have a clinical diagnosis of asthma (defined as those with
        a consistent history and prior documented evidence of variable airflow obstruction, with
        evidence of an increase in FEV1 greater than 12% or 400 mL following bronchodilator or
        bronchial hyperresponsiveness on bronchial provocation testing, when stable). These
        subjects should have no exacerbation of asthma or COPD 6 weeks prior to the assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for all patients:

          1. History of lung resection or other significant pulmonary disease like pulmonary
             fibrosis.

          2. Active infection like pulmonary tuberculosis

          3. Unable to complete assessment due to physical and/or cognitive impairment

          4. Having short life expectancy like subjects with terminal malignancy or intractable
             heart failure.
