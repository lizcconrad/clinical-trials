  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the VERROUREA study, there were two cases of an abnormal increase in TCA. In theory no
      leakage of the lock into the bloodstream should have been seen. Lock leakage could have
      particularly serious, and especially clinical, repercussions in these patients who already
      have a high risk of haemorrhage given the numerous associated comorbidities. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the leakage of locks into the bloodstream by measuring, before and
      after injection of the lock, the evolution of haemostasis tests and calcaemia. The findings
      will complete safety data already collected in the VERROU REA study.
