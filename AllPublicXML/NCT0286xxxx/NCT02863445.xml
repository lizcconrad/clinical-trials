  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese women are significantly more likely than their normal BMI counterparts to experience
      failure of orally-dosed emergency contraceptives. The PI's preliminary data provides evidence
      for testing a dose escalation strategy in an effort to provide improved efficacy from
      orally-dosed emergency contraceptives in obese women. The overall project will be focused on
      both levonorgestrel (LNG) - and ulipristal acetate-containing emergency contraception but
      this protocol registration is for the LNG aspect of the study procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency contraception (EC) provides a woman with an additional line of defense against
      unintended pregnancy following an act of unprotected intercourse. Orally-dosed EC works by
      delaying ovulation and reduces the risk of pregnancy for a single act of unprotected
      intercourse by 50-70%. Unfortunately, obese women are significantly more likely than their
      normal BMI counterparts to experience failure of orally-dosed EC and in some instances EC is
      equivalent to placebo.

      The PI's preliminary data provides evidence for testing a dose escalation strategy in an
      effort to provide improved efficacy from orally-dosed EC in obese women. The hypothesis is
      that increasing the dose of orally-dosed EC agents will normalize the pharmacokinetics
      resulting in the expected treatment effect (delay in follicle rupture) in obese women. In the
      overall proposal, the investigators plan to perform detailed pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies of ulipristal acetate-based EC in obese women and expand upon the
      preliminary findings of levonorgestrel-based EC. This protocol registration is for the LNG
      aspect of the study procedures focused on the pharmacodynamics of LNG dose escalation
