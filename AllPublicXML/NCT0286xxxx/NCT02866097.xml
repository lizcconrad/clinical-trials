  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide important evidence to the Ministry of Community Development, Mother
      and Child Health (MCDMCH) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) on how to effectively implement
      iCCM with a focus on improving both the flow of supplies to CHWs as well as the quality of
      their supervision and mentorship. The overall aim will be to determine whether improvements
      in supplies for community health workers (CHWs) and strengthened supervision result in
      improved early and appropriate treatment for children with malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea
      in rural Zambia when compared to CHWs offering iCCM without this logistics and supervision
      support.

      The main objective of this study is to strengthen the delivery of integrated community case
      management (iCCM) of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia in Chadiza and Chipata Districts of
      Eastern Province, through mHealth supported improved supply chain management of iCCM
      commodities and enhanced supportive supervision of iCCM-trained CHWs.
