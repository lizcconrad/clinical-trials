      A three-arm, multi-site clinical evaluation of the ARIES Bordetella Assay for the detection
      and identification of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) and Bordetella parapertussis (B.
      parapertussis) nucleic acids in prospectively collected, de-identified, left-over clinical
      specimens; banked, pre-selected clinical specimens; and contrived specimens.

        Clinical specimens collected from patients exhibiting clinical signs and symptoms of
        respiratory tract infection consistent with B. pertussis or B. parapertussis who are
        hospitalized, admitted to a hospital emergency department, visiting an outpatient clinic,
        or are residents of a long term care facility.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The specimen is a nasopharyngeal swab collected using a cleared nasopharyngeal swab
             and transport medium.

          2. The specimen is from an adult or pediatric, male or female subject who is either
             hospitalized, admitted to a hospital emergency department, visiting an outpatient
             clinica or resident of a long term care facility.

          3. The specimen is from a patient for whom a requisition has been made for B. pertussis
             and/or B. parapertussis testing.

          4. The specimen is from a patient exhibiting clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory
             tract infection consistent with B. pertussis or B. parapertussis.

          5. The specimen was received in good condition (no leakage or drying of the specimen).

          6. The specimen contains a minimum volume of 1000 μL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The specimen is not a nasopharyngeal swab collected using a cleared nasopharyngeal
             swab and transport medium.

          2. The specimen was not properly collected, transported, processed or stored according to
             the instructions provided by the Sponsor in Section 10 below.

          3. The specimen volume is &lt;1000 μL.

          4. Any specimen that was not tested per the complete testing algorithm provided by the
             Sponsor.
