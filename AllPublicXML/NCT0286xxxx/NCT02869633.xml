    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients after a donor stem
      cell transplant for lymphoma that is not responding to treatment or has come back. Ibrutinib
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the use of ibrutinib starting between day 60 and day 90 after allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) until 12 months post hematopoietic cell transplant to
      improve the progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months post hematopoietic cell transplant
      by 25% compared to historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To increase the incidence of successful outcome (defined as lack of requirement of second
      line therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease, lack of National Institutes of Health [NIH]
      severe chronic graft-versus-host disease, lack of progression or relapse of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia/mantle cell lymphoma [MCL], lack of death from disease or non-relapse
      causes) to at least 60% at 1 year post hematopoietic cell transplant. (Cohort A) II. To study
      the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib post hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) III. To study the
      incidence of grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease in the first 6 months post
      hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.
      (Cohort A and B combined) IV. To study the incidence of second line therapy (systemic only)
      for acute graft-versus-host disease in the first 6 months post hematopoietic cell transplant
      in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) V. To
      study the incidence of recurrent acute graft-versus-host disease in the first 6 months post
      hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.
      (Cohort A and B combined) VI. To study the incidence and severity of chronic
      graft-versus-host disease in the first 12 months post hematopoietic cell transplant in
      patients with not-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) VII. To
      study the incidence of lung involvement with graft-versus-host disease in the first 12 months
      post hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin
      lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) VIII. To study the incidence of sclerotic skin chronic
      graft-versus-host disease in the first 12 months post hematopoietic cell transplant in
      patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) IX. To
      study the incidence of infectious deaths not related to graft-versus-host disease in patients
      with non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the association of minimal residual disease (MRD) as detected by immunoglobulin
      heavy chain (IgH) sequencing prior to starting ibrutinib and compare to post ibrutinib at
      month 6, 9 and 12 after HCT. (Cohort A)

      II. To study the impact of onset of new acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease on minimal
      residual disease. (Cohort A)

      III. To study the association of T-cell clonality by T cell receptor (TCR) Vb sequencing
      prior to starting ibrutinib and compare to post ibrutinib at month 6, 9 and 12 after
      hematopoietic cell transplant. (Cohort A)

      IV. To study the impact of onset of new acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease on T cell
      receptor sequencing. (Cohort A)

      V. To study the association of B cell receptor signaling pathways and immune function with
      response by single cell mass cytometry prior to starting ibrutinib and compare to post
      ibrutinib at month 6, 9 and 12 after hematopoietic cell transplant. (Cohort A)

      VI. To study the association of single cell mass cytometry that investigates B cell receptor
      signaling and its association with new acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease on B-cell
      receptor (BCR) signaling. (Cohort A)

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning between 60-90 days post donor stem cell transplant, patients receive ibrutinib
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) until 1 year post donor stem cell transplant in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
