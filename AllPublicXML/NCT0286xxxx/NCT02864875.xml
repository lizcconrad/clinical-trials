      The objetive of this study is to compare the treatment of two groups of politrauma patients
      that have fibrinogen deficiency (Fibtem &lt; 9) diagnose by thromboelastography (ROTEM) but do
      not have clinical or laboratorial signs of coagulopathy at emergency room admission. One
      group will receive fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan) and the control group will be
      clinically followed. If any of the groups show clinical signs of coagulopathy it will be
      treated by anesthesiologist decision.

      Coagulation defects related to severe trauma, trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) has several
      related factors, including: the blood loss with extensive consumption of coagulation and
      platelet factors, dilutional coagulopathy after administration of crystalloids and colloids
      to maintain blood pressure, in addition to the main cause pathophysiological indicated that
      the activation of the fibrinolytic system or secondary hyperfibrinolysis activation of
      protein C. The presence of TIC reflects the extent and severity of the injury and is directly
      correlated with mortality; The fibrinogen plays an important role in coagulation. The
      concentration of fibrinogen in the plasma is the highest of all coagulation factors, and as
      acute phase protein undergoes elevation of plasma level during inflammation. In the final
      phase of coagulation, large amount of fibrinogen is captured by activated platelets by
      glycoprotein IIb / IIIa receptor. Especially the maximum value of the thrombus firmness is
      influenced by the number of platelets and plasma fibrinogen levels. Recent studies suggest
      that thromboelastography would be more appropriate to monitor hemostasis earlier than
      traditional laboratory methods (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time,
      serum fibrinogen). This method is able to provide information about the polymerization of
      fibrin in the presence of platelet activity, fibrinogen deficiency evaluation, factor XIII
      deficiency and hemofilia. Fibrinogen can be found in human plasma, cryoprecipitate and
      fibrinogen concentrate (Heamocompletan® ); The amount of fibrinogen cryoprecipitate per
      milliliter in cryoprecipitate is much higher than the plasma, which justifies the use of
      cryoprecipitate in place of the plasma when the goal is to offer the patient Fibrinogen.
      However, studies deserves to be performed to compare the use of cryoprecipitate with
      fibrinogen concentrate. This study aims to compare the classical approach in which we await
      signs of clinical coaguloplatia with a proactive approach in which the fibrinogen replacement
      is performed early using concentrated fibrinogen. Objective is to evaluate a possible
      decrease in the amount of concentrates transfused RBCs when the anticipatory approach. This
      study shows is important because being original, prospective, since there is a shortage in
      world literature comparative studies in this regard.
