  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder affects over 120 million people worldwide. Only 50% of Americans
      with depression receive adequate treatment, and one-third of those receiving treatment do not
      benefit. In this pilot project investigators will bring together two approaches that have the
      promise to reach large numbers of depression sufferers: a skills-based intervention for
      increasing positive affect and experiences in depressed individuals, delivered in an
      inexpensive self-paced mobile format. The study will make use of smartphone technology to
      improve conventional outcome measurement via in-the-moment emotion sampling and mobile
      assessment of heart rate variability, a predictor of cardiac health that may mediate some of
      the health effects of depression. The aims are: 1) Retool the existing web-based positive
      emotion intervention for use on smartphones, with innovative exercises that help participants
      bring the skills they are learning into real-life situations; 2) Perform a small feasibility
      trial of the mobile intervention on individuals with clinical depression recruited online 3)
      Eventually incorporate feedback from the small feasibility trial to improve the online
      intervention and conduct a full randomized trial on a larger scale

    <description>Determine the percentage of participants providing data at each stage of the study from baseline to study completion (average of 4.5 months). This includes capturing dropout rates and reasons for dropping out, where possible; Retention will also include analyzing any qualitative comments/feedback on the lessons and home practice exercises in order to gauge what participants like and don't like, and what is feasible for future iterations of this study to maximize retention.</description>
