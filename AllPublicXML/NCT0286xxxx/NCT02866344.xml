  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial is designed to compare the
      clinical characteristics and outcomes of hepatic resection and microwave ablation (MWA) to
      determine the optimal operative intervention for the local treatment of resectable colorectal
      cancer liver metastases. The primary aim of this study is to test the following hypothesis:
      2-year local disease control is equivalent between patients receiving the experimental
      therapy (MWA) and patients receiving the standard therapy (hepatic resection) as treatment
      for colorectal cancer liver metastases determined to be resectable by radiographic imaging.
      Secondarily, the investigators expect that 2-year intrahepatic (regional) and metastatic
      disease recurrence rates are equivalent between the two treatment arms in this study.

    <description>Patients will be given general anesthesia. A laparoscopic trocar and additional ports will be placed under direct visualization and pneumoperitoneum will be established. Once the operating surgeon determines that the lesions as evaluated on intraoperative ultrasound remain amenable to MWA, ablations will be performed with a 2.45-GHz generator with a 1.8-mm-diameter transcutaneous antenna (Acculis pMTA Accu2i; AngioDynamics Inc., Denmead, Hampshire, UK). Additional ablations will be performed sequentially. Laparoscopic core needle biopsy of lesions will be performed and submitted for permanent pathologic sectioning per current treatment standards. At the conclusion of the ablation, a collapsed titanium clip will be inserted into the microwave antenna tract as a radiographic fiducial marker. Hemostasis of the ablation track will be ensured using a combination of microwave energy, monopolar electrocautery, and/or topical hemostatics.</description>

    <description>General anesthesia will be induced. A laparoscopic trocar and additional ports will be placed under direct visualization and pneumoperitoneum will be established. The liver will be evaluated with intraoperative ultrasound (BK Medical A/S, Herlev, Denmark). Laparoscopic core needle biopsy of lesions will be performed. Partial hepatectomy may be carried out with parenchymal precoagulation with radiofrequency electrosurgical devices such as the LigaSure™ (Covidien, Medtronic; Minneapolis, MN), Harmonic® (Ethicon Endosurgery; Cincinnati, OH), or saline-coupled radiofrequency ablation device (Aquamantys™; Covidien/Medtronic; Minneapolis, MN); hepatic parenchymal transection can be performed as above or with the use of stapling devices to ligate and divide parenchyma. Hepatic vascular inflow occlusion will be performed at the surgeon's discretion. A topical hemostatic may be used along the transected hepatic parenchyma. Resected specimens will be preserved in formalin for pathology.</description>
