      The 300,000 chronically critically ill patients each year who require prolonged mechanical
      ventilation (PMV)1,2 represent an ever-growing, extremely vulnerable, proportion of intensive
      care unit (ICU) survivors.3 The increasing number of these patients is an important factor in
      the expanded use of long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs), centers that specialize in
      mechanical ventilation weaning and rehabilitation. The 412 LTACHs currently operated in the
      United States admit more than 130,000 patients annually and account for more than $5 billion
      in Medicare expenditures each year.4,5 Unfortunately, LTACH stays for patients requiring PMV
      are typically complicated and associated with a number of poor outcomes including very high
      one-year mortality rates (44-77%),6,7 severe and enduring brain dysfunction (i.e., coma
      and/or delirium), life-altering functional decline, substantial pain and suffering, caregiver
      burden and diminished quality of life.6-11 While returning home is often an important goal
      for patients and their families,3 this is a rare outcome in this population.11 Rather,
      patients requiring PMV often experience multiple transitions in care in the year following
      their original hospital admission (median of 4), which results in further costs and
      persistent, profound disability.9 Despite these disheartening findings, to date there is very
      limited scientific evidence available to help clinicians care for the chronically critically
      ill, particularly those requiring PMV in LTACHs.

      Chronically critically ill patients are generally older, sicker and have more comorbidities
      than their acutely ill counterparts.12 Importantly, they also suffer from much greater
      symptom burden, with up to 90% of patients experiencing at least one distressing symptom
      during the course of their illness (e.g., pain, dyspnea, weakness).13 While these symptoms
      are often thought of as unfortunate and inevitable consequences of critical illness,14
      evidence suggests that the inappropriate management of these symptoms may actually be causal
      to the poor outcomes experienced by this group.15 For example, the results of numerous,
      well-designed, clinical trials conducted in the traditional ICU setting by our team and
      others suggest regular pain, agitation, and delirium assessment, prevention and treatment,
      coupled with strategies that decrease patients' exposure to sedative medications, support
      early mobilization, promote evidence-based mechanical ventilation discontinuation approaches,
      and actively engage and empower family members in patient care can positively affect
      important patient-centered outcomes (e.g., improved survival and physical/cognitive
      ability).16-26 One unifying method of implementing these evidence based interventions into
      everyday practice is consistent and reliable use of the ABCDEF bundle (i.e., Assess, prevent,
      and manage pain, Both Spontaneous Awakening Trials (SATs) &amp; Spontaneous Breathing Trials
      (SBTs), Choice of analgesia and sedation, Delirium assess, prevent, and manage, Early
      mobility and exercise, and Family engagement and empowerment).27 Congruent with the Society
      of Critical Care Medicine's Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Pain,
      Agitation, and Delirium and endorsed by a number of patient safety and quality organizations
      including the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation,
      the ABCDEF bundle is being actively implemented in ICUs throughout the world. The strength of
      evidence supporting the ABCDEF bundle, coupled with this strong implementation momentum, has
      prompted interest in the LTACH in applying the bundle into the everyday care of chronically
      critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation.

      Select Specialty, a national network of more than 100 LTACHs across the United States, has
      expressed the desire to adopt the ABCDEF bundle as a &quot;standard of care&quot; for its patients. As
      part of this initiative, Select first plans to conduct an ABCDEF bundle quality improvement
      project in one of its local hospitals. The overall purpose of this before-after study is to
      study prospectively the process and effects of implementing the ABCDEF bundle into the
      everyday care of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in the LTACH setting.
      Specifically the study's aims are to:

      Aim 1: Identify facilitators and barriers to successful ABCDEF bundle implementation in the
      LTACH setting.

      Aim 2: Compare the symptom experience (e.g., pain, agitation, anxiety, fatigue, shortness of
      breath, restlessness, sadness, hunger, fear, thirst, confusion sedative medication exposure)
      of patients receiving usual LTACH care (during months 1-4.5) to those treated with the ABCDEF
      bundle (during months 4.5-9).

      Aim 3. Evaluate the impact ABCDEF bundle implementation has on safety (i.e., new pneumonias,
      device self-removal) and patient-centered outcomes (i.e., delirium/coma free days, weaning
      duration, tracheostomy removal , mortality, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,
      functional and cognitive ability, discharge disposition, opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal
      rates, and quality of life) of patients receiving usual LTACH care (during months 1-4.5) to
      those treated with the ABCDEF bundle (during months 4.5-9).

      To complete these aims the investigators will administer an on-line survey and conduct focus
      group interviews with LTACH staff before and after the ABCDEF bundle is implemented into
      everyday care. Over the course of a nine month period, the investigators will also consent
      and enroll 81 patients who require mechanical ventilation at the time of LTACH admission.
      These patients will undergo daily, in-person symptom assessment using valid and reliable
      screening tools. Finally, medical record reviews and brief patient interviews will be
      conducted to obtain data on our outcomes of interest.
