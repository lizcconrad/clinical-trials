  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syndromic congenital neutropenia (SCN) includes a heterogeneous group of diseases
      characterized by congenital neutropenia associated with the involvement of other organs. Most
      patients have syndromic congenital neutropenia, which does not correspond, either clinically
      or genetically, to any other previously described form. A large number of genes still have to
      be identified in these syndromic forms.

      The aim of this study is to identify the molecular bases of congenital neutropenias that have
      not yet been classified, by taking advantage of high-throughput exome sequencing.
