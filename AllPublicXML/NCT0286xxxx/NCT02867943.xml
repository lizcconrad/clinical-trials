    <textblock>
      As an approximate of the difference between venous-to-arterial CO2 tension (∆PCO2), ∆PCO2 is
      proportional to CO2 production and inversely related to cardiac output (Fick equation).
      Anaerobic CO2 production is thought to occur when tissue hypoxia is present, mostly because
      of buffering of bicarbonate ions by the protons produced in excess secondary to the
      hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate. Therefore ∆PCO2 has been proposed as a marker of tissue
      hypoxia.

      An increased ∆PCO2 (&gt; 6 mmHg) could be used to identify patients who still remain
      inadequately resuscitated, when deciding when to continue resuscitation despite a central
      venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) &gt; 70% associated with elevated blood lactate levels.

      Under steady states of both VO2 and VCO2, P (v-a) CO2 was observed to increase in parallel
      with the reduction in cardiac output. However, spontaneous breathing and hyperventilation may
      reduce PaCO2 and prevent the CO2 stagnation-induced rise in PvCO2.

      To date,these studies of ∆PCO2 and respiratory rate in septic shock patients Under Volume
      Mechanical Ventilation are rarely.
