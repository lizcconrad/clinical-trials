      Osteoarthritis is the most common rheumatic disease. Knee OA (KOA), gonarthrosis (GA), is
      characterized by high prevalence, progressive course with early disability of the subject,
      persistent pain syndrome for the treatment of which non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) are actively used in clinical practice. It was revealed that NSAIDs may cause
      gastrointestinal adverse effects (AEs), from mild dyspepsia to bleeding and perforation as
      well as cardiovascular effects. Gastroprotection with misoprosol, Н2-receptor antagonists and
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is not always effective. NSAIDs with the lowest gastrointestinal
      toxicity with efficacy adequate to suppress joint pain is justified and reasonable.

      Amtolmetin guacil (AMG) is a new NSAID which proved to be the least gastrointestinally toxic
      in experimental studies in vivo, in vitro and in comparative clinical studies. AMG does not
      have selectivity towards COX-2 or NO. AMG exerts gastroprotective effect due to stimulation
      of capsaicin receptors (vanilloid receptors) in gastrointestinal wall. To assess tolerability
      of amtolmetin guacil, it is first necessary to obtain data on potential reduction of
      dyspeptic symptoms including in subjects with these signs of NSAIDs intolerability.
