      Introduction : Patients with heart failure (HF ) with systolic dysfunction of moderate to
      severe exhibit significant reduction in the ability to exercise compared to those with mild
      dysfunction , and have worse prognosis. However, some clinical markers of severity and
      diagnosis widely used in this population such as ejection fraction (EF) , are not always able
      to translate the actual degree of cardiac damage as well as their relationship with the
      cardiorespiratory fitness of these individuals and prognosis .

      Objective: To evaluate the ability of the global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) in predicting
      exercise tolerance in heart failure patients with moderate and significant systolic
      dysfunction.

    <measure>Echocardiography for obtaining the &quot;strain &quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To strain of technical analysis will be used echocardiography analysis software ( EchoPAC , GE Medical Systems, Horten , Norway, version 10.0 ) . The images will be analyzed in the longitudinal sections ( 4 bedrooms , 3 bedrooms and 2 cameras) . The endocardium is drawn manually from the septum to the lateral mitral annulus. A region of interest will be applied automatically by the software.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiopulmonary Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be carried out by the treadmill ramp method ( Centurium 300 , Micromed , Brazil ) through ErgoPC Elite® software associated with the electrocardiogram ( Micromed , Brazil ) with 12 channels. Respiratory variables will be evaluated by a gas analyzer ( Cortex - Metalyzer II , Germany) being obtained in standard conditions of temperature , pressure and humidity ( STPD ) , breath - by - breath , with the patient breathing in a face mask without leaks during exercise. Will be assessed during the test , functional capacity , measured in METs , VO2 , VE / VCO 2 , VE / VCO 2 slope , T1 / 2VO2 and RFC1 .</description>
