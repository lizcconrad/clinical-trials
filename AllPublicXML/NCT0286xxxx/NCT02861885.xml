  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a few studies regarding Sessile Serrated Lesions (SSL). They are recently
      identified as precancerous lesions. Yet, digestive tract serrated lesions would be part of a
      new colic carcinogenesis way : the serrated tumor way. Evolution from polyp to cancer would
      be faster than through the usual adenoma to cancer way. It would be then responsible of a lot
      of &quot;missed&quot; lesions or interval cancer. The missed SSL rate is estimated at between 27% and
      59%.

      Current diagnosis methods show weakness to identify those SSL. In order to improve their
      detection, the investigators dispose of several coloration techniques. Indigo carmine
      chromoendoscopy enhance neoplastic lesion detection as part of the hereditary rectal
      carcinoma screening. NBI electronic coloration, which is faster and easier has not shown any
      efficacy on the adenoma detection rate, except for patients with Lynch syndrome.

      The objective is to better describe the SSL endoscopic semiology (detection and
      characterization) and to establish standards for the endoscopic techniques in order to
      improve the colonoscopy diagnosis quality. The investigators propose to evaluate 2
      fundamental endoscopic techniques (Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) and indigo carmine), widely used
      for other indications, in comparison with the White Light technique (WLI).

      Therefore, the investigators propose a prospective, observational, multicentric cohort study
      in order to 1) define SSL endoscopic various aspects 2) establish which technique (white
      light, Narrow Band Imaging, indigo carmine chromoendoscopy) is the best to diagnose SSL,
      namely detection and characterization 3) evaluate the multifocal dimension rate for those
      lesions at ascending colon level.

      The diagnosis impact is immediate, and could allow to consider an update for boh endoscopic
      NICE and Kudo Pit Pattern classification, and good practice guidances for colonoscopic
      diagnosis. Better SSL detectability thus their systematic resection could have a long term
      effect in reducing both colon cancer rate and interval cancer

    <description>Colonoscopy will run in accordance with standard procedure, including air insufflation throughout the endoscope rise. The endoscope will be a Olympus NBI videoscope (180 series and latest). First, progression will run until caecum without systematic terminal ileum intubation. Polyps will be searched out during descent phase. The patient will be eligible as soon as the operator suspects an ascendant colon SSL with white light. The operator will have to initiate the WLI colonoscopy. If a SSL is suspected in the colon, the operator will run at the same time, a NBI colon examination, then an indigo carmine chromoendoscopy colon examination. Each lesion will be pictured before and after mucus clean-up. Lesions biopsy or resection will be ran in accordance with standard procedure.</description>
