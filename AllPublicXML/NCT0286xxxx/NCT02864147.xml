    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase II, three arm control trial in patients with Cervical
      Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 high grade cervical dysplasia. Patients with CIN 2/3
      meeting eligibility criteria will have cervical biopsy specimens centrally reviewed by study
      pathologist to confirm diagnosis. HPV DNA test and HPV 16/18 genotyping will be performed
      from endocervical cytobrush samples to determine HPV status associated with the dysplasia.

      Patients who have CIN 2/3 with HPV+ disease will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be
      randomized to one of three arms: observation only (control), imiquimod only, imiquimod +
      9-valent HPV vaccine.

      The primary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To determine treatment efficacy defined as histologic regression to CIN 1 or less at
           weeks 20-24 (4 to 8 weeks after the end of imiquimod treatment) in the HPV Vaccine +
           Imiquimod group compared to control,

        -  To determine treatment efficacy defined as histologic regression to CIN 1 or less at
           weeks 20-24 (4 to 8 weeks after the end of imiquimod treatment) in the Imiquimod group
           compared to control.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To assess complete regression (i.e., histologic remission) at weeks 20-24 (4 to 8 weeks
           after the end of imiquimod treatment) in each group,

        -  To assess HPV clearance in each group,

        -  To assess treatment tolerability.

      In addition to the primary and secondary objectives of this study, there additional
      exploratory/correlative objectives. The exploratory/correlative objectives are as follows:

        -  To assess T cell infiltration in post-treatment cervical biopsies and endocervical
           cytobrush samples,

        -  To assess HPV16 E7 immunity in CD4/CD8 T cells.

    <description>The major parameters of objective response to be assessed include treatment efficacy defined as histologic regression of cervical dysplasia to CIN 1 or less after the end of imiquimod treatment, HPV clearance and treatment tolerance. Objective response will be categorized as 'yes' or 'no' and included in the evaluations are the following criteria:
Histologic regression (HR): Histologic regression of all index lesions to CIN 1 or less after end of imiquimod treatment period.
Histologic remission (HM): Complete regression of cervical dysplasia at all index biopsy sites after end of imiquimod treatment period.
Persistent Disease (PR): One or more index lesions persists with CIN 2,3 high grade dysplasia or new lesions are identified colposcopically and histologically confirmed to be CIN 2,3.
Progressive Disease (PD): Worsening histology of an index lesion.</description>

    <description>HPV Clearance will be categorized as 'yes' or 'no' and the evaluations are the following criteria: HPV clearance will be measured by both the Roche cobas HPV Test utilized by pathology concomitant with the pap test at final study visit which assesses for presence of 14 high risk HPV types as well as HPV 16/18 genotyping performed by Santin Lab.</description>
