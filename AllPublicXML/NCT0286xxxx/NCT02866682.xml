    <textblock>
      As the patents for brand-name immunosuppressive medications expire, there is increasing
      interest in using generic immunosuppressive drugs. However, despite pharmacokinetic studies
      showing bioequivalence, questions remain regarding the clinical impact of use of generic
      immunosuppression.

      The most important immunosuppressive agent in the modern transplant era is arguably
      tacrolimus, a calcineurin-inhibitor with a narrow therapeutic index. This study seeks to
      answer the question regarding the clinical impact of generic tacrolimus use as measured
      primarily by acute rejection, loss of graft function, and patient death through a randomized
      trial of 4 parallel groups: Brand tacrolimus only, brand tacrolimus for 6 months than switch
      to Generic A, Generic A only, or Generic A for 6 months than switch to any other generic
      tacrolimus. Given that kidney, liver, and heart transplantation are the most commonly
      performed transplants with well-defined measures of rejection and graft failure, these organs
      will be studied in a two-center study designed to accrue the target number of transplant
      recipients within the three-year study period.

    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel, observational study to assess
      safety and efficacy of 300 kidney, heart and liver transplant recipients comparing brand
      tacrolimus to generic and a combination of generic and brand tacrolimus over the three year
      follow up period. All subjects will receive other immunosuppressive medications including
      induction therapy (thymoglobulin, basiliximab, or no induction) and maintenance including
      mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroid therapy as directed by standard-of-care at each
      center. Their medication information will be recorded in their study files.

      The study population includes recipients of kidney, liver, or heart allografts in the first
      14 days after transplantation.

      The totals of 15 visits over 36 months period are planned as follows. The blood samples
      specified below are for the translational research study labs. Subjects will continue to
      receive routine labs as part of their standard of care from their treating physician. For
      detailed information about the study labs schedule see Table 5 Study Schedule, and for the
      study safety labs by organ see Appendix 4. These safety labs are done as part of their stand
      of care from their treating physician.

      If the subject needs more study drug medication before his or her next study visit the
      subject will come in to the clinic to get a new supply.

      Total blood 32 cc of blood (approximately 6.5 teaspoons) will be drawn from the subject at
      Month 6 study visit. At Baseline, Month 3, Month 9, Month 12, Month 24 and Month 36 study
      visits the subject will have drawn about 16 cc (approximately 3.2 teaspoons) of blood. During
      the course of the study (after approximately 3 years of participation in the study), the
      total amount of blood that will be drawn is approximately 128 cc (approximately 8.7
      tablespoons or 1/2 cup). This is about a third of the amount usually drawn when someone
      donates a pint of blood. Also, the subject will continue having his or her routine blood and
      urine collection to monitor heart, liver or kidney function as part of his or her standard of
      care treatment at UCLA or UCSD and UCI. These routine blood collections are not included in
      the total blood for the study discussed above. The schedule for these routine blood and urine
      collection will depend on the subject's condition and will be at their treating physician's
      discretion.

      Adherence will be measured with daily medication diaries, the CleverCaps electronic pill
      bottle caps, and with the coefficient of variation of tacrolimus in subjects' blood.

             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness must
             not be enrolled into this study.

          8. Any psychiatric or medical that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at
