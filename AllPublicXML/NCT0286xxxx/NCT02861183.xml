    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of two weekly
      peri-osteotendinous injections of OVT for relief of pain in patients with lateral
      epicondylosis in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled superiority
      study. A total of 186 subjects will be enrolled at up to 20 centers in the US and Europe. The
      randomization ratio will be 2:1 (2 OVT subjects: 1 placebo subject). The entire study
      duration from first subject in to last subject out is approximately one year. The enrollment
      phase is approximately 6 months with a follow-up phase of 6 months. Visits are scheduled at
      baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 18 weeks, and 26 weeks. Study injections will be given
      at the baseline and 1 week visits.

                  origin; and

          3. Subject is symptomatic for at least 6 weeks

          4. Subject has pain in the index lateral epicondyle after grip strength testing that
             measures â‰¥ 40 mm on a 100 mm VAS
