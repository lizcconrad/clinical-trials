  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uric acid is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CED) in postmenopausal women but the
      association with inflammation and coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction is not
      well-defined. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of serum uric acid,
      inflammatory markers and CED.

    <description>All subjects had blood work with included measurement of C-reactive protein, complete blood count with differential, basic chemistry panel, and uric acid level. All subjects completed a standardized questionnaire to assess baseline characteristics. All subjects underwent comprehensive coronary endothelial function assessment. Subjects completed a questionnaire of overall health several years after the index coronary angiogram and endothelial function study.</description>
