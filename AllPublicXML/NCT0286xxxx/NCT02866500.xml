    <textblock>
      Context: the oral cancer is the 5th cancer in order of frequency for human in France. It is
      the country where the mortality by oral cancer is the most raised in Europe. The most
      frequent location concerns the oral cavity prevalency of which is one of higher in the world.
      The main risk factors are the tobacco and the alcohol.

      The oral cancer is treated in the great majority of the cases by radiotherapy which is going
      to pull xerostomy, responsible for the degradation of the oral state. Furthermore, it will
      increase the risk of appearance of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) when the patient is carrier of
      buccal lesions and\or when he will have to undergo surgical acts. Consequently, the initial
      oral state of the patients is to be estimated so as to eliminate any source of the infection.
      An unfavourable initial state will increase the risk of degradation of this one and
      appearance of ORN. However, at present few epidemiological data are available concerning the
      oral state of the patients presenting an oral cancer.

      Objective: the main objective of this study is to describe, before radiotherapy, the oral
      state of the patients presenting an oral cancer and to follow the evolution of this oral
      state for three years and to register the patients quality of life. The secondary objectives
      are to describe the distribution of risk factors of the degradation of the oral state (oral
      hygiene, food habits, xerostomy, consumption of tobacco and alcohol) in this population and
      to register the impact of the dental restorations on the radiological assessment.

      Methods: this prospective epidemiological study of observation will be realized in the
      service of odontology of the Timone hospital (Marseille, France) in association with the
      services of ORL and maxillofacial surgery of Timone as well as the services of radiotherapy
      and medical oncology of Timone and Paoli Calmettes institute (IPC). All the toothed patients
      affected by an oral cancer untreated will be included, or treated surgically only, of more
      than 18 years old and for whom an initial dental assessment will be realized. The main
      assessment criteria will be the CAD index and the parodontal state.

      Expected results and perspectives: This study will allow to have epidemiological data
      concerning patients' oral state affected by an oral cancer before and after radiotherapy. It
      will allow to set up a consensus of good practice.
