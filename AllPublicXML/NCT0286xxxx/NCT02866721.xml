  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test if it is safe to give stem cells to adult patients with
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The kind of stem cells we are studying are called allogeneic human
      mesenchymal stem cells or MSCs. MSCs are cells in the body that can grow into different types
      of cells and respond to various environmental situations. Allogeneic means the cells come
      from another person (a donor).

      This study is only looking at whether or not it is safe to give the stem cells to adults with
      CF and how the infusion is tolerated. In the future, other studies may be done to see if stem
      cells can be a new therapeutic treatment for CF.

      Stem cells, like other medical products that are intended to treat, cure or prevent disease,
      generally require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can
      be marketed. The FDA has not approved any stem cell-based products for usual medical care,
      other than some specific blood forming stem cells for certain indications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, single-center, dose-escalation, open-label interventional study
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of allogeneic hMSCs in 15 clinically stable subjects
      with CF age ≥ 18 years. After a two to six week screening period, subjects will have a
      Baseline visit (Days 1-2) where they will undergo a single intravenous infusion of up to 5 x
      10EE6 allogeneic hMSCs/kg of body weight. Infusions will be performed in the Dahms Clinical
      Research Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Subjects will be
      monitored for any infusion related toxicities for 24 hours after the infusion. Subsequent
      study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, Months 3 and 6 and telephone calls will occur on
      Days 4 (or 5), 21, 56 and Month 12. Subject safety and tolerability of a single dose of hMSCs
      will be evaluated at study visits by review of subject diaries, interval history, pulmonary
      exacerbations, physical examination, spirometry, and analysis of safety laboratories. Special
      attention will be placed upon detecting pulmonary exacerbations because anti-inflammatory
      therapies theoretically could suppress the immune system to the point where it leads to
      increased infectious complications, although MSC therapeutics are proposed to be
      antimicrobial. In addition to evaluating safety, this study will also explore efficacy
      end-points for future clinical trials of MSCs in CF including inflammatory biomarkers from
      blood and sputum. Serum markers (calprotectin, MPO, GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL8, IL-17, and
      TNF-a) and sputum markers (white cell counts and differentials, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
      IL-17, GM-CSF, MIP- 3a, TNF-a, and active proteases including neutrophil elastase,
      a1-anti-trypsin, and MMP-9) will be determined at Baseline and on Days 7 and 28 for with-in
      subject comparison. All subject samples will be archived for future projects. Finally, a
      diagnostic bone marrow exam will be performed on subjects with CF who consent to undergo this
      optional procedure. Bone marrow samples will be banked and used for future translational
      studies.
