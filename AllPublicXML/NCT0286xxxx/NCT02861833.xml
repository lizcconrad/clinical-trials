      This is a first care research focuses on the study of adaptation strategies implemented by
      cancerous wound patients. Today, advances in treatment generally increases the life
      expectancy of a patient with cancer. the patients thus live longer with their wound. How to
      live then? The literature review shows that there is research on adaptation strategies in
      cancer pathology and that different factors seem to interact with these strategies. However
      the investigators have not found written on the theme cancerous wound and adaptation
      strategies.

      the investigators conducted a pilot study of this research in medical oncology, Prof. service
      Duffaud CHU Timone, which allowed us to highlight patient adherence and motivation centers
      contacted but also areas for improvement. Indeed, the investigators now were doing a study of
      adaptation strategies implemented by the patient time T of his life. However, adaptation is a
      process in constant motion, the investigators want to identify two different time patients
      coping strategies following a specific charge nurse taking.
