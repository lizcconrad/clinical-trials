      This test is a single center, one-armed exploratory clinical research, aimed at the
      evaluation the efficacy and safety of Apatinib with Gemcitabine in the patients with advanced
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      This study plan in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital.From launched in
      July 2016, this research intends to recruit the end time about as of December 2017, is
      expected to the end of the test time is in December 2017.

      If do not have the appearance of the following circumstances, such as the subjects out of
      informed consent, drug toxicity tolerance or the researchers think that do not fit for
      further test, each subject research and treatment time is expected until imaging of tumor
      progression.
