      The purpose of this study is to collect the data on the safety and potential effectiveness of
      intra-tumor injection of MG7-CART cells under ultrasound guidance in patients with liver
      metastases expressing MG7 positively.

    <textblock>
      Designer T cells are prepared by PBMC which from patients by leukapheresis, and then
      activated and re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for MG7,
      which is a glycosylated protein of CEA. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the
      participant by intra-tumor injection at the dose of (1-6)×108 CAR positive T cells. The cells
      perfusion process would last for 1min to 2min. The dose of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide
      will be given two days before CART cell infusion.

The infusion will be scheduled to occur 2 days after two doses of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide, which will be administered according to standard procedures. The cells perfusion process would lasts 1min to 2min, and an interventional radiologist would operate the cell infusion.</description>

    <description>Ultrasound-guided intra-tumor injection as the route of T cell delivery, so that more T cells gathered at the tumor site, less migrate to the normal tissue, thereby enhancing the efficacy of anti-tumor, reducing the potential of side effects. And MG7-CART is a 2nd CAR, with MG7 as the target protein, 4-1BB as co- stimulator</description>
