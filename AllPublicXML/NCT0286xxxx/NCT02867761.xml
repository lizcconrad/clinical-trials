      The study hypothesis is that symptomatic current and former smokers with spirometric values
      within the normal range (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC≥0.70 and post-BD FVC ≥ 80% predicted
      [to guard against restrictive lung disease]) will still derive symptomatic benefit from
      long-acting bronchodilator therapy even though they are excluded from current GOLD guideline
      recommendations.

      RETHINC is a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate
      27.5/15.6 mcg inhaled twice daily in symptomatic current and former smokers with respiratory
      symptoms despite preserved spirometry as defined by CAT ≥ 10 and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC
      ratio ≥0.70, respectively.

          2. Subject is pregnant, breast-feeding, or plans to become pregnant.

          3. Active pulmonary infection or prior pulmonary infection where antibiotic and/or
             steroid treatment was completed ≤4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          4. Post-BD FVC &lt; 80% predicted

          5. A primary diagnosis of asthma established by each study investigator based on ATS/ERS
             criteria as previously implemented in the MACRO clinical trial.

          6. Known concomitant lung disease, pulmonary tuberculosis (unless confirmed by chest
             x-ray to be no longer active), or clinically significant bronchiectasis.

             atrial fibrillation for at least 6 months and controlled with a rate control strategy
             (i.e., selective beta blocker, calcium channel blocker, pacemaker placement, digoxin
             or ablation therapy) for at least 6 months may be considered for inclusion. In such
             patients, heart rate at enrollment must be &lt; 100/min.
