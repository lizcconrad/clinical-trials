  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) presents as a long-lasting decline in cognitive
      function following surgery. Recognized as an important neuropsychological complication of
      anesthesia and surgery, POCD occurs predominantly in elderly patients, and even after minor
      procedures. It affects 41% of patients over the age of 60 years one week after major
      noncardiac surgery, and persists until the third postoperative month in 13% of cases. POCD
      has an adverse impact on quality of life, may result in prolonged hospitalization and
      increased health care costs, and is associated with the risk of leaving the labor market
      prematurely and dependency on social transfer payments, as well as increased one-year
      mortality. Elderly patients are particularly at risk. Other risk factors include a
      pre-existing cognitive impairment, cerebral, cardiac or vascular disease, diabetes, alcohol
      consumption and a lower level of education. The occurrence of postoperative delirium seems to
      predispose patients to POCD. However, POCD itself is not associated with the development of
      dementia.

      The pathogenic mechanism leading to POCD remains unclear. Numerous etiologic pathways have
      been suggested: cerebral ischemia due to impaired intraoperative cerebral perfusion and/or
      oxygenation, systemic inflammation and the effect of proinflammatory cytokines on the brain,
      altered cholinergic neurotransmission, anesthetic neurotoxicity, hormonal changes induced by
      surgical stress, sleep or circadian disturbances, or genetic factors.

      Several studies have explored possible associations between a specific genotype and POCD;
      however, these were predominantly performed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or carotid
      endarterectomy. Previous reports primarily focused on the analysis of the apolipoprotein E
      genotype as a predisposing factor for POCD. Results of some of these studies have been pooled
      in a recent meta-analysis. Other studies have investigated polymorphisms of the human
      circadian clock gene HPER3, complement, cytochrome P450, platelet glycoprotein IIIa,
      phosphodiesterase 4D, P-selectin, C-reactive protein, and the inducible nitric oxide synthase
      promoter.

      The primary aim of this retrospective study of available cohort data is to investigate a
      specific genotype and to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which may predispose
      elderly patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery to POCD.
