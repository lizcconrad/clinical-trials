      Purpose: To determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of human recombinant decorin
      protein, a transforming growth factor ß (TGFß) inhibitor in preventing proliferative
      vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in patients with perforating globe injuries.

      Methods: This is a prospective, single-center, open-label, interventional case series. A
      single intravitreal injection of decorin 200ug (n=4) and 400ug (n=8) was given within 24
      hours of injury. Pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil injection was done if indicated. ERG
      was done before injections, at day 10, and 3 months. Serial plasma decorin levels were
      assessed before injections, day 3, 5, and 10 post-injection. Clinical assessment included
      globe survival, retinal attachment rate, and PVR evaluation.

      This is prospective, single-center, open-label, interventional case series. Twelve patients
      with open globe injuries presenting to the causality department at Kasr Al Ainy Teaching
      Hospital, Cairo University, were enrolled in our study. Those patients were assigned to
      Ocular Trauma Score category 1 or 2 in which the visual prognosis after treatment is poor
      (Category 1 prognosis: 74% no light perception, 15% light perception to hand movements,
      Category 2 prognosis: 27% no light perception, 26% light perception to hand movements) (31).

      An informed consent was obtained from the participant prior to the conduct of any study
      procedure. The participant was adequately informed about the study, understood risks,
      benefits and alternative treatments, and voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. He /
      She was given ample time to consider participation and had his / her questions addressed in a
      satisfactory manner before agreeing to participate and signing the informed consent form.
      Participants were free to choose to withdraw from the study at any time without any
      responsibility, even if the study has not been completed.

      Pre-operative Evaluation: 1. Baseline systemic examination: including clinical evaluation,
      complete blood picture, liver function tests and kidney function tests. 2. Full ocular
      examination: All patients were subjected to complete ophthalmological examination including:
      Best corrected visual acuity (according to the Snellen VA chart). Slit lamp examination. 3.
      CT scan (Sytec and BrightSpeed; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis): Unenhanced CT of the orbits
      was performed; axial, coronal and sagittal views with contiguous 2-mm-thick sections.

      4. Full Field ERG using a full field flash Ganzfeld stimulator (Roland Consult,
      Electrophysiologic Diagnostic Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany): The ISCEV-ERG GF program was used
      to record standard ERGs. All responses were differentially amplified, displayed on an
      oscilloscope, digitized and stored on a compact disc. An adjustable voltage window was used
      to reject records contaminated by artifacts.

      Dark adapted ERG responses were obtained after a minimum of 30 minutes of dark adaptation and
      included an isolated rod, standard flash (maximal) response, and oscillatory potentials.
      Light adapted responses included a single white flash and 30-Hz flicker. ERG amplitudes and
      implicit time values were measured according to recommendations by the International Society
      for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision.

      The time interval between the time of injury and the time of primary repair was recorded.

      Decorin Injection:

      One dose of 200 µg/0.1ml or 400 µg/0.1ml Recombinant Human Decorin (R&amp;D Systems, Inc.,
      Minneapolis, MN, USA) are to be evaluated in this study and is to be injected intravitreally.
      Those doses were reported to be effective and safe in a rabbit model of traumatic PVR.
      Considering the difference of the vitreous volume between human and rabbits; three times
      larger in the former; the dose was expected to be tolerable in human. The drug was injected
      within 48 hours after the trauma taking all the safety measures for intravitreal drug
      injections according to the The Royal College of Ophthalmologist guidelines of intravitreal
      injections procedure 2009.

      Surgical management:

      Surgery is done in two steps:

      Step I: Primary repair:

      Initial repair of the globe is to be done at the time of presentation. The globe is explored
      for injuries. The severity of the trauma is evaluated and documented to insure that the case
      fulfill the inclusion criteria of the study.

      Step II: Secondary intervention:

      Delayed vitrectomy at the tenth day after the injury was done with silicon oil temponade.

      Primary repair: General anaesthesia. Sterilization with betadine 10% for the eye lids.
      Application of sterile drapes and wire speculum. Conjunctival dissection and removal of any
      tenon tissue at edges of the inlet scleral wound. Rectus muscle is hooked and cut whenever
      needed for proper exposure of the wound. Vitrectomy was done for any prolapsed vitreous from
      the wound. Scleral wound was sutured using 7/0 vicryl suture on reverse cutting needle.
      Conjunctiva was closed with inverted knot using 7/0 vicryl suture.

      Post Primary Repair Follow Up: 1. Systemic follow up: including clinical evaluation, complete
      blood picture, liver function tests and kidney function tests at the tenth day. 2. Ocular
      examination follow up: Slit lamp examination accessing; Sutured wound. Anterior chamber cells
      and flare; Intraocular pressure. Follow up ERG: at tenth day. Measuring plasma Decorin level
      at third, fifth, eighth and tenth day. Ocular Ultrasound: to detect site of exist, presence
      of retinal detachment, state of posterior hyaloid, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, subretinal
      hemorrhage and presence of intraocular foreign body.

      Pars Plana Vitrectomy: General anaesthesia. Sterilization with betadine 10% for the eye lids
      and betadine eye drops 5% for the surface of the globe. Application of sterile drapes and
      wire speculum. 23G vitrectomy system was used. Using one step technique, the 23G cannulas
      were inserted obliquely after minimal displacement of the intact conjunctiva using a pressure
      plate for globe fixation and as a measure. The infusion line was inserted into the
      infero-temporal cannula. Before opening the infusion, a vitreous sample was taken by
      vitrectomy cutter with the aspiration line plugged to a 5ml syringe to measure vitreous
      Decorin level. Hemorrhagic anterior hyaloid behind the posterior capsule was removed,
      utilizing light from operating microscope, taking care not to injure posterior capsule.
      Infusion cannula was verified that it was in vitreous cavity not in the suprachoriod space.
      Non-contact wide-angle viewing system binocular indirect ophthalmomicroscope (BIOM) was used
      for visualization. Hemorrhagic vitreous gel was excised, layer by layer, taking care not to
      injure the retina especially in cases associated with retinal detachment. The hemorrhagic
      tissue over the posterior exist wound was trimmed by the vitrectomy probe. The vitrectomy
      probe, with the vacuum mode, was used to look for adherent posterior cortical vitreous. The
      probe was placed just above the optic disc with the aspiration port directed away from the
      macular area. Vacuum was gradually increased until the cortical vitreous was engaged in the
      aspiration port. The probe was withdrawn anteriorly while gradually increasing the vacuum
      until the posterior hyaloid was detached and elevated from the posterior pole. This was
      assured by observing the circular wave spreading peripherally. Next, the detached posterior
      hyaloid engaged in the aspiration port, was peeled from posterior to anterior. The
      vitreoretinal interface during surgical posterior hyaloid peeling was closely observed, so
      that peeling was stopped once strong attachments were encountered for fear of creating
      retinal tear. Whenever possible, peeling was continued till the posterior border of vitreous
      base. To ensure complete detachment of the posterior hyaloid, triamcinolone acetinoide was
      injected gently into the mid vitreous cavity. Posterior cortical vitreous still adherent to
      the retinal became highlighted. The later was removed using vacuum generated at the probe
      aspiration port, soft tip back-flush flute needle or by using Tano's scrapper. If there is
      retinal detachment, PFCL was injected gently through a small bored blunt cannula directed
      towards optic disc, while lowering the intraocular pressure, to flatten the already mobilized
      retina over the posterior pole. Subretinal fluid was drained through existing retinal breaks
      or retinotomies when necessary. Vitrectomy for the vitreous base was performed meticulously
      360 degrees with scleral indentation accomplished by the assistant. The IOP was lowered
      during base vitrectomy to reduce counter-resistance and allow easy depression of the sclera.
      The vitreous cutter was set at 5,000 cuts per minute and the suction was adjusted with the
      foot pedal. The sclera was depressed gently with the narrow shaft of the scleral depressor
      while the suction was increased. Both hands were used to remove the vitreous base; vitrectomy
      at the vitreous base from the 6- to 12-o'clock position was performed with the vitreous
      cutter held with the right hand, and that from the 12- to 6-o'clock position was performed
      with the left hand. Endolaser photocoagulation was applied around posterior exist site, 360
      degrees and to all retinal breaks. Silicone oil was injected through the infusion cannula.
      Closure of two sclerotomies. Removal of the infusion cannula and closure of the third
      sclerotomy. Eye patching. Adjuvant scleral buckling was not performed in any case. Patients
      were instructed to maintain the appropriate position for 1 week following surgery.

      Post-operative follow-up: Full ophthalmological examination was done on the first day
      post-operatively then at 1st week and 1st month. Examination included: Best corrected visual
      acuity (according to the Snellen VA chart). Slit lamp examination. Assessment of IOP. Dilated
      fundus examination with binocular indirect slit-lamp biomicroscopy using (Super Field lens;
      VOLK, Mentor, Ohio, USA).After 3 months, silicone oil was removed. The retinal status was
      evaluated again, after silicone removal, with binocular indirect slit-lamp biomicroscopy
      using (Super Field lens; VOLK, Mentor, Ohio, USA). Furthur assessment of the retina was done,
      functionally by ERG and anatomically by sweept source OCT. SS-OCT (DRI OCT-1, Topcon, Japan)
      using radial and raster scans was done over the macula and the edge of the posterior exist
      scar (Figure 31). The investigators evaluated the presence or absence of any epi or sub
      retinal membranes, vitreoretinal interface abnormalities, intra-retinal fluid, subretinal
      fluid, the status of the IS/OS junction and ELM.
