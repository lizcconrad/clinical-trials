  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAD-57 pulse CO-oximeter is a lightweight device allowing non-invasive measurement of
      blood carboxyhemoglobin. Previous studies comparing RAD-57 measurements (SpCO) to standard
      laboratory blood gas analysis (COHb) have reported contradictory results.

      the RAD-57 pulse CO-oximeter could be useful as a first-line screening test for acute CO
      poisoning, enabling rapid detection and management of patients with suspected CO poisoning in
      the prehospital emergency setting This study assesses the diagnostic value of pulse
      CO-oximetry, comparing SpCO to standard laboratory blood measurement for prehospital
      management of patients with suspected carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.

      Transcutaneous SpCO will be obtained using the RAD-57 simultaneously with blood sampling for
      laboratory blood gas analysis, at the time of prehospital management by emergency medical
      services. The diagnostic performance of SpCO for the screening of CO poisoning will be
      determined using ROC curve analysis, and Blood COHb levels &gt;5% and 10% as the reference
      standard for CO poisonning for non-smokers and smokers respectively. Correlation between SpCO
      and COHb will be assessed using Bland and Altman's method.

    <description>SpCO measurement (Experimental)
Non invasive pulse CO-oximetry will be carried out by prehospital emergency nursing staff trained in the use of the Rad-57 pulse CO-oximeter (Masimo, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), using the adult sized sensor (Sensor, Rev. B) placed on the 3rd or 4th digit, according to manufacturer recommendations. Nail polish will be removed if necessary. SpCO was expressed in total percentage of hemoglobin.</description>

    <description>COHb measurement (Active Comparator)
Venous blood will be collected into EDTA treated tubes (Beckton Dickinson) prehospitally and sent to the toxicology laboratory for further carboxyhemoglobin testing. Blood carboxyhemoglobin will be analyzed by derivative spectrophotometry using an automated CO-oximeter (IL 682, Instrumentation Laboratory SpA V.le Monza 338-20128 Milan, Italy). Blood carboxyhemoglobin will be detected within a range of 0-100% and accuracy of 0.5% and reported as percentage of total haemoglobin.</description>
