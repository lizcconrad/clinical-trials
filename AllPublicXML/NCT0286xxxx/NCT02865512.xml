    <textblock>
      It is known that postoperative pain after thoracotomy or lobectomy is very severe, therefore,
      intraoperative or postoperative pain management using continuous thoracic epidural
      catheterization is suggested good option to prevent this complication.

      The spread of local anesthetics is influenced by various factors including volume, location
      of needle insertion, speed of injection, patient position, age, weight and height. However,
      there are few studies about the effect of different patient position during thoracic epidural
      catheterization.

      This study was designed to evaluate the effect of different patient position affecting
      thoracic epidurography.

      It is known that postoperative pain after thoracotomy or lobectomy is very severe, therefore,
      intraoperative or postoperative pain management using continuous thoracic epidural
      catheterization is suggested good option to prevent this complication.

      The spread of local anesthetics is influenced by various factors including volume, location
      of needle insertion, speed of injection, patient position, age, weight and height. However,
      there are few studies about the effect of different patient position during thoracic epidural
      catheterization.

      Studies of lumbar epidural blockade have shown that lateral position can produce 0-3 segment
      more to the dependent position compared to the supine position. When the same amount of local
      anesthetic was injected in supine of sitting position, the most cephalad level of spread was
      indifferent.

      Recent studies showed that neck flexion demonstrated significant cephalad spread of contrast
      dye in high thoracic epidural blockade.

      The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate the contrast dye spread between
      different patient position
