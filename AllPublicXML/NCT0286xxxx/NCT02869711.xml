  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study focuses on the quality of care and how the health executives can bring it
      to a central place in their management. A training-action has been set-up at the Health
      Executive training institute (University Hospital Grenoble) to improve care quality. Reports
      prepared by students (tutored projects) related to operational diagnosis and action plans
      about care quality improvement are given to health executives. The objective is to evaluate
      how the health executive will use the tutored project to improve care quality and set-up
      actions.The hypothesis is that the health executive will use the tutored project to improve
      project management.
