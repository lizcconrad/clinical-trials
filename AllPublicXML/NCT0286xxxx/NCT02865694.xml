  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a most prevalent genetic disorder define as high
      cholesterol level and premature death. The prevalence of FH reported in few countries however
      unknown in Iran. Thus determine the FH patient, finding diagnostic strategy and appropriate
      treatment are important. We intent to use cascade method to screening patients, also our
      expected outputs are to develop and implement a registry program for FH patients and their
      families and to study their genetic disorder. FH patients will be followed from management,
      treatment and prevention of Cardio vascular disease in order to increase premature death.

      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder define as high cholesterol levels,
      particularly very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in the blood and early
      cardiovascular disease and premature death. FH is an autosomal dominant disease with a
      prevalence 1:500 (new study in Netherlands demonstrated 1:244) in population more frequent
      than Cystic fibrosis, mellitus diabetes or neonatal hypothyroidism. Canadian registry
      demonstrated FH is more common among people if French Canadian, Christian Lebanese, and
      Afrikaner descent. The Major causes of FH are pathogenic variant in the LDL-receptor (LDLR)
      gene or the Apo lipoprotein B (APOB) gene. The clinical signs of FH are high level of
      Cholesterol (between 350-550 mg/dL in heterozygous), Yellow deposits of cholesterol-rich fat
      in various places on the body such as around the eyelids (known as xanthelasma palpebrarum),
      the outer margin of the iris (known as arcus senilis corneae), and in the tendons of the
      hands, elbows, knees and feet, particularly the Achilles tendon (known as a tendon xanthoma).
      FH is a hidden syndrome which leads to cardiovascular disease.

      After introducing the statins total mortality have reduced significantly in these patients.
      Thus screening and identification of patients and treatment with the most effective therapies
      will decrease the risk of premature death.

      Also, most of patients require an appropriate lipid-lowering medications. Although the
      genetic problem is the most important factor to expression of FH other factors like
      environmental and metabolic factor can be effective in CVD and premature death.

      Therefore, identification and follow-up FH patients is important for CVD Rate cuts and
      decrease Treatment costs thus this study can gain these outcomes.
