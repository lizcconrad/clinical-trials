    <textblock>
      Traveler's diarrhoea or turista is the most common disease in travelers. It has been reported
      based on studies in 20 to 60% of travelers, depending among other conditions and travel
      destinations. Currently, less than 30% of the etiology of diarrhoea is identified by
      bacteriological v,irological and parasitology traditional techniques. This ignorance of the
      diarrhoea etiology causes difficulties in the establishment of a specific and rapid
      management in this extremely common condition and having a significant cost to society.
      Technological advances in laboratory diagnosis, such as quantitative real-time Polymerase
      Chain Reaction (PCR), can allow us now to improve the etiological diagnosis of traveler's
      diarrhoea using simple rectal swabs.

      So, the principal objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of a new diagnosis
      strategy in order to establissh the etiological diagnosis of traveler's diarrhoea. The
      hypothesis consists in improving the number of patients with a confirmed etiological
      diagnosis of traveler's diarrhoea by 5%.
