  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The USC PRC's applied research project will study the dissemination and implementation of an
      evidence-based program shown previously to significantly increase physical activity and fruit
      and vegetable intake in churches in South Carolina (Faith, Activity, and Nutrition; FAN).
      Guided by two theoretical frameworks, the specific aims of the applied research project are
      to: 1) examine the adoption and reach of FAN in churches and organizational factors
      associated with adoption; 2) characterize implementation fidelity and multilevel factors
      associated with implementation; 3) describe organizational maintenance of FAN and factors
      associated with maintenance; and 4) study the effectiveness of FAN. In Phase 1, churches in a
      rural county with a high proportion of African American residents will be randomized to
      receive training in FAN from a community health advisor (n=40) or to be part of a delayed
      intervention control group (n=20). In Phase 2, a quasi-experimental study wil be done with a
      large religious denomination in SC (churches are not randomized).

    <description>Committees from 40 churches will be trained in the Faith, Activity, and Nutrition program by Community Health Advisors. The training focuses on helping churches create healthier church environments for physical activity and healthy eating using Cohen's structural model of health behavior as a guide. Each church committee participates in a full-day training and submits a program plan and budget. Churches receive materials to support implementation of the program. After the full-day training, trained churches receive 12 monthly technical assistance calls to help them implement their program plan. The church coordinator receives 8 calls and the pastor receives 4 calls over the 12 months. In Phase 2, the intervention is open to any church in the SC Conference of the United Methodist Church.</description>
