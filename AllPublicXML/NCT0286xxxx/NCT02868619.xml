  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, defined as BMI&gt; 30kg / m2, is a major public health problem, with devastating
      medical and psychological consequences. 30% of obese suffer from BED type of eating
      disorders. The optimal treatment of obesity remains bariatric surgery, failed in 20% of
      cases. Many arguments are in favor of the involvement of the reward circuitry, with the
      central role of NAc in the pathophysiology of BED and obesity. The recent application and
      effectiveness of DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) in refractory psychiatric disorders suggest
      that DBS may be of interest in treating obesity and BED with potential target for the NAc.
      This project propose to study fMRI activation of the reward system in response to food
      stimuli to better direct the DBS targets. This is a pilot study to define indication criteria
      based on fMRI to obese BED patients are potential candidates for treatment with DBS.

      The aim of this functional neuroimaging study is to analyze brain responses to visual food
      cues in obese (body mass index &gt; 97th percentile) adolescents with BED (according to the
      criteria Marcus and Kalarchian) compared with healthy control adolescents in two situations :
      hunger et satiety.

      Fifteen obese adolescents (12/16 years) with BED and fifteen healthy control adolescents will
      be enrolled in the study protocol. Participants will be instructed not to eat food for at
      least 6 hours prior to the first imaging session. After the initial set of functional and
      anatomic scans, participants will be fed a standard calorie meal. Approximately 1 hour later,
      the experiment will be repeated while participants are in a satiated condition. The cortical
      fMRI activation will be measured during the following four experimental visual conditions :
      high calory food, low calory food, disgust and neutral presented in block design.

      First-level and second-level differences in neural activation assessed during functional MRI
      in the different conditions will then be analyzed.

    <description>The main objective of this study is the identification in patients with obesity and Binge Eating Disorder (BED) of functional MRI activation profiles (reward system) in response to food stimuli. The activation profiles will be analyzed by varying physiological conditions of hunger and satiety, and motivational value attributed to the food (calorie).</description>
