  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CyberKnife (CK) has been developed recently. This is a linear accelerator carried by an
      industrial robot. It has, due to its tumor tracking capabilities and high accuracy, an
      interest in irradiation (boost) of tumor site after conventional irradiation. The radiation
      boost is currently issued by electrons, protons or brachytherapy. These techniques require
      several fractions and are associated with cutaneous toxicities and aesthetic problems. CK has
      an interest in reducing the number of fractions and a reduction of dose delivered to the
      skin.

      CK has been used in a phase I protocol (CYBERNEO) with concomitant chemotherapy for
      inoperable breast tumors and has proven its effectiveness and safety of treatments.

      The investigator is considering conducting a Phase II protocol to a single dose of 8 Grays
      issued by CK for boost to the tumor site after conventional breast irradiation.

      The results, in terms of local control, will be evaluated on clinical monitoring.
