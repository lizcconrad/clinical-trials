    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the impact of the intervention (PAX GBG) in
      Estonian-language 1st grade classrooms on students' mental health and behaviour, and
      teacher's self-efficacy.

    <textblock>
      2-year, matched-pair, cluster-randomized controlled trial with a intervention and wait-list
      control arm is conducted during school years 2016/17 and 2017/18. 42 volunteering schools
      were matched to pairs. One school in each pair was randomly selected to receive the PAX GBG
      or continue their normal activities without intervention. After a post-test assessment in
      spring 2018 the control group teachers are trained and supported to implement PAX GBG.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in children's social and emotional well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 months post-baseline and 19 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Children's social and emotional well-being will be measured by the teacher-completed Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire with impact supplement (SDQ; Goodman, 1999) and parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among the children</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 months post-baseline and 19 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Swanson, Nolan and Pelham-IV Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) (Swanson et al., 2001) is an 18-item instrument for rating ADHD-related symptoms and will be completed by parents.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in children's behavioral inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of the intervention on inhibitory control will be measured using cognitive task (Go/No-Go task). The task will be developed specially for this research and completed by children.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in teachers' sense of efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 months post-baseline and 19 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Teachers' efficacy will be measured with The Teachers' Sense of Efficacy Scale (TSES; Tschannen-Moran &amp; Hoy, 2001). It is a self-reported measure for teachers that consists of 24 items and assesses the teacher's perception of their sense of effectiveness as a teacher.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in classroom behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 months post-baseline and 19 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Teacher-rated 4-item measure will be used to assess classroom behavior. The measure originates from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2013 teacher's questionnaire (question nr 41) and asks to indicate how strongly does the teacher agree or disagree with statements about the classroom behavior.</description>

    <description>The intervention is delivered by teachers within the normal school curriculum. Teachers from intervention classes completed 3-day training and were supported by the mentor, who visited their class during the 2016/17 school year and provided counseling via e-mail and phone. During the second year (2017/18) teachers could use the PAX GBG methods, but they did not receive additional support from the mentors.</description>
