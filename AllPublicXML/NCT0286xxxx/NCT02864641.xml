      The purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of Planet K, a mobile and web-based
      technology infrastructure specifically designed to (a) enhance youths' chronic kidney
      disease- and treatment-related knowledge through interactive and game-based educational
      materials; (b) support adherence to the treatment regimen through customized task prompts via
      mobile and web-based delivery; and (c) promote patient-provider communication through
      real-world data collection and feedback loops. Investigators will examine the effectiveness
      of the Planet K mobile app and website in improving treatment adherence, disease-related
      knowledge, transition readiness, condition management, and the psychological correlates of
      these variables in adolescents and young adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in medical treatment options over the past several decades have translated into
      substantially higher survival rates for those who suffer with chronic illness. Consequently,
      the prevalence of chronic illness has risen significantly in recent years, such that one out
      of every four youth in the United States currently lives with a chronic illness. The health
      and well-being of these youth is directly impacted by the degree to which they adhere to
      their treatment regimen. However, treatment regimens for chronic illness can be highly
      complex, making adherence problematic, particularly when combined with deficits in memory and
      executive functioning concomitant with many chronic illnesses. Adherence also tends to
      deteriorate over time; the youth's motivation or commitment to treatment may decline as
      symptoms improve or negative side effects occur. With low adherence comes worsening symptoms
      and significantly greater risk for serious medical complications and mortality in young
      adulthood. The costs associated with low adherence, such as the need for additional care, are
      also substantial both for the patient and society.

      While a number of factors have been found to impact treatment adherence, risk for
      non-adherence—across varied forms of chronic illness—is markedly elevated when the youth
      lacks disease- and treatment-related knowledge and when parents provide little supervision
      for carrying out regimen tasks. With nearly 90% of youth with chronic illness expected to
      survive and therefore transition from pediatric care into adult-focused healthcare systems,
      it is critically important to empower youth to take ownership of their own healthcare. To do
      so, tools there is a need to provide accessible, affordable tools that can effectively
      increase patients' skills and knowledge for managing their illness and support on-going
      adherence to their treatment regimen.

      The purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of Planet K, a mobile and web-based
      technology infrastructure specifically designed to (a) enhance youths' chronic kidney
      disease- and treatment-related knowledge through interactive and game-based educational
      materials; (b) support adherence to the treatment regimen through customized task prompts via
      mobile and web-based delivery; and (c) promote patient-provider communication through
      real-world data collection and feedback loops. Investigators will examine the effectiveness
      of the Planet K mobile app and website in improving treatment adherence, disease-related
      knowledge, transition readiness, condition management, and the psychological correlates of
      these variables in adolescents and young adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      All participants will complete study measures at pre- and post-assessment time points. In
      total, participants will take part in this study for approximately 2 months from pre- to
      post-assessment. Families will be recruited to participate in either the treatment condition
      or the control group. Families in the treatment condition will receive the Planet K app and
      access to the associated website for the full duration of the study (4 months) between
      pre-test and post-test. Families in the control group will not receive access to the app and
      website but instead will be asked to complete a series of online questionnaires at each of
      the two data collection time points (pre-test, post-test).

      Investigators hypothesize that greater use (i.e., dosage) and prolonged use of Planet K will:
      increase disease-related knowledge, treatment adherence, self-efficacy for management of CKD,
      current CKD self-management behaviors, perceived severity of CKD, readiness to transition to
      independent self-care, and perceived benefits of CKD treatment, while also decreasing
      perceived barriers to CKD treatment. Moreover, investigators believe that improvement of
      these outcomes through use of Planet K will result in more positive mental health outcomes
      for participants, including lower depression and higher reported quality of life.
      Investigators expect that those in the treatment condition will have better outcomes than
      those in the control group on all of these measures at both midpoint and post-assessment time
      points. Finally, investigators expect all participants to report high usability, quality, and
      value of the Planet K mobile app and website and to positively rate their experience with
      Planet K.

    <description>Both adolescents and their parents will report on their perceptions of the benefits and barriers of adherence to the condition treatment regimen. This measure was adapted from the Beliefs about Dietary Compliance scale (BDCS; Bennett et al, 2001) and contains 9 items on both the parent and youth versions.</description>

    <description>This 18-item measure assesses the extent to which youth are ready to transition to independent care and manage their health-related needs independently. Items assess adolescents' independence in scheduling doctor's appointments, remembering to take medication, finding answers to health-related questions, knowledge of their condition, and how easy/difficult these tasks are for the youth.</description>

    <description>Adolescents will complete the 25-item Chronic Kidney Disease Self-Efficacy Instrument (CKD-SE; Lin, C., Wu, C., Anderson, R., et al., 2012). This measure assesses patients' self-confidence in managing their condition, including self-confidence in (a) managing the disease autonomously, (b) integrating treatment requirements to fit new situations or social activities, (c) finding solutions to CKD-related problems, and (d) finding social support when needing help.</description>

    <description>Adolescents will complete a subset of 19 items from the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQOL-SF; Hays et al., 1997). Items were modified to be more general and applicable to any medical condition. These items comprise subscales that assess patients' symptoms, burden of condition in interfering with life, cognitive functioning, social support, and difficulty sleeping.</description>

    <description>Participants in the TX Group will receive access to Planet K. Families participating in the TX condition will be asked to attend a one-hour orientation session, during which study expectations and tasks will be explained. Families will be asked to watch a short 2-minute study overview video that summarizes study requirements and expectations. Parents and their children will then have the opportunity to provide informed consent/assent prior to their participation in the study. Adolescent and young adult participants will then receive a mobile phone preloaded with the Planet K app and a brief orientation to the app and associated website.</description>

    <description>A national sample of CKD participants will be recruited. Because of the inability to meet with remotely located participants for orientation and distribution of phones, these participants will be assigned to the treatment-as-usual, online control (CO) condition. For recruitment of the online control group, youth and parents interested in participating will be asked to complete a brief eligibility survey. Participants in the treatment-as-usual CO condition will not receive access to the Planet K app and website but will receive email reminders to complete surveys online at each time point.</description>
