  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to exploratively assess the efficacy and safety of hydrophilic polyurethane
      foam dressing (MedifoamⓇ or BetafoamⓇ) in pressure ulcer specifically. The target enrolment
      is 20 patients, with 10 patients per arm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the primary objective, the percentage of completely healed patients and the time to
      complete healing will be assessed after applying the study device, MedifoamⓇ or BetafoamⓇ,
      for 12 weeks to pressure ulcer patients. In addition, the pressure ulcer size reduction rate
      over 12 weeks will be evaluated.

      Patients will make once weekly site visits. There are 14 visits in total, including a
      screening visit 14 days (maximum) before the baseline visit.

    <measure>Pressure ulcer size reduction rate as measured using a ruler to determine the area reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ulcer area (for ulcers without re-epithelization) is measured at each visit after foam dressing application. A photograph of the ulcer is taken and a using a ruler (MediRuleⓇ) is used to measure its length and width to obtain the area in cm2.</description>

    <measure>Pressure Ulcer Scores for Healing (PUSH) reduction rate measured using PUSH tool version 3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PUSH score is measured at alternate visits (2-week intervals) starting from baseline and will be compared against baseline.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of new infections at the pressure ulcer based on Clinical Signs and Symptoms Checklist (CCSC)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with at least 1 new infection after the foam dressing application at baseline until Visit 14 will be taken into account.
Infection is defined as presence of purulent exudates or 2 or more symptoms stated in the CCSC. For patients with existing infection at baseline, infection is defined as the development of an additional symptom or recurrence of the baseline symptom after it was completely healed.</description>
