    <textblock>
      Evaluation of diagnostic whole exome sequencing in patients with syndromic or isolated severe
      intellectual disability without a molecular diagnostic, with suspected autosomal recessive
      inheritance, allowing accurate genetic counseling in this high risk of recurrence group of
      diseases

        Retrospectively included patients presenting severe intellectual disability without a
        molecular diagnosis, born from consanguineous parents and / or with intra-familial
        recurrence, whose parents are requesting for molecular diagnosis, in a context of deadlock
        with conventional techniques

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of syndromic or isolated severe intellectual disability (IQ &lt;50)
             without a molecular diagnosis

          -  Recurrence in siblings (multiplex families) suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance
             (with or without parental consanguinity) or sporadic cases from a consanguineous union

          -  Conventional genetic tests performed (including array-CGH) and MRI/CT-scan available

          -  DNA samples from parents and from both unaffected or affected siblings available, for
             parental segregation and confirmation of candidate variations identified.

          -  Availability of a signed informed consent

          -  To be affiliated or beneficiary of French social security/healthcare system

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents in the exclusion period of another study or as provided by the national
             register of volunteers

          -  High-probability diagnostic hypothesis for which a molecular test is available at
             lower cost than exome sequencing
