  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The strategy of neonatal screening for Cystic Fibrosis in France relies on Immuno Reactive
      Trypsinogen (IRT) at day 3/DNA analysis with a CF Elucigen 30 mutations kit/ IRT safety-net
      at day 21. This strategy has significantly improved the performance of CF neonatal screening
      (NNS) in terms of positive predictive value and sensitivity but revealed new difficulties. Up
      to 85-90% of CF patients detected through the NNS program has a classical CF form with a
      positive sweat test and 2, 1 or no CF causing mutations but the remainder has either 2 CFTR
      mutations with at least one non-CF causing mutation and a sweat test &lt;60mmol/L or 1, 0 CFTR
      mutation and an intermediate sweat test value ≥ 30 et &lt; 60mmol/L raising a diagnosis and
      prognosis dilemma. Meanwhile the vast majority of these cohorts will remain asymptomatic over
      time, some will develop symptoms prompting clinicians to maintain a rigorous surveillance for
      the entire atypical cohort, whose modalities vary a lot among centers and countries.

      This prospective multicenter study with a standardized assessment of a matched cohort with
      &quot;atypical&quot; CF versus &quot;classical&quot; CF from 6 years of age (60-65 cases in each cohort) is aimed
      at evaluating pulmonary and nutritional status to, better define the best monitoring
      follow-up, therapeutic management and familial genetic counseling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Atypical CF cohort: children identified trough newborn screening on a
             hypertrypsinemia, who are older than 6 years of age at the time of inclusion and who
             carry a) 2 CFTR gene mutations of the CF30 kit with at least one R117H whatever the
             value of the sweat test or b) 2 CFTR gene mutations of the CF30 kit with a sweat test
             chloride &lt; 60mmol/L or c) 1 or 0 mutation in the CF30 kit with a sweat test ≥ 30 and
             &lt;60mmol/L and identification of additional mutations by comprehensive screening of the
             gene

          -  Classical CF cohort: children identified by newborn screening on a hypertrypsinemia,
             who are matched with an Atypical CF by age and sex if possible and who were diagnosed
             with a classical CF based on a sweat test &gt; 60 mmol/ L with 0, 1 or 2 CF causing gene
             mutations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Drugs such as CFTR modulators interfering with the phenotypic expression of the
             disease.
