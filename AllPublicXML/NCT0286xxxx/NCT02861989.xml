  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis (OP) and subsequent fractures (OP fractures) are a source of morbidity and high
      mortality in the elderly. Despite numerous programs aiming at improving OP care, the
      prevention, diagnostic and treatment remain suboptimal. Barriers to a better care are
      multiple, both in the general and at-risk population, and in medical practitioners. Since
      they do not perceive their susceptibility to OP, people do not see the benefit of prevention.
      In addition, physicians do not give sufficient importance to OP prevention and care, despite
      the existence of guidelines.

      The investigators implemented a qualitative study to explore the knowledge and
      representations regarding osteoporosis in the general and at-risk population and in doctors
      in Rh么ne-Alpes Region, France, using focus groups with women and men and semi-structured
      face-to-face interviews with general practitioners. Understanding barriers to osteoporosis
      care in patients and general practitioners will help to set up effective strategies to
      improve prevention and treatment.

    <description>Representations of osteoporosis, in general practitioners and in 4 groups of people.
Representations were drawn from focus groups interviews based on the theory of social representations of illness developed by Moscovici and Durkheim. Four types of focus groups were conducted until data saturation: 9 groups with women aged 50 to 85 years and 7 groups with men aged 60 to 85 years, with or without a history of fragility fracture or an osteoporosis diagnostic.
In parallel, semi-structured face-to face interviews were conducted with 16 general practitioners</description>

    <description>Factors favoring and barriers to a better management of OP were collected during the focus groups interviews. Specific questions were asked to collect information on reasons for not complying with recommendations or prescriptions. Four types of focus groups were conducted until data saturation: 9 groups with women aged 50 to 85 years and 7 groups with men aged 60 to 85 years, with or without a history of fragility fracture or an osteoporosis diagnostic.
