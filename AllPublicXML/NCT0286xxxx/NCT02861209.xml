  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, implement and evaluate a care pathway for patients with cancer
      who are treated with oral anticancer drugs (OACD).

      The care pathway will be developed in six hospitals in Flanders, and will be adapted to the
      local setting and situation.

      The investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a care pathway will increase the
      quality of the drug therapy, the communication between health care professionals (HCPs) and
      patients, and will lead to an improved level of self-management and adherence. Moreover, the
      invesitgators hypothesize that the care pathway will facilitate the communication between
      HCPs in the hospital setting and in ambulatory care, and will improve counseling skills,
      self-efficacy and self-confidence of HCPs.

      At the end of the study, a roadmap for the nation-wide implementation of a similar care
      pathway will be constructed based on the experiences of the participating hospitals. This
      roadmap will certainly include an e-learning platform for healthcare professionals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each hospital, an individual care pathway will be developed following the 7-phase model
      by Vanhaecht et al., 2011. This methodology aims to offer a systematic approach in 7 phases
      for the support of an interdisciplinary team in the development of new care pathways or in
      the improvement of existing ones.

      The before-part of the study includes phases 1 to 4 that aim to map current practice in
      detail and to translate these findings into the development of a care pathway. Current
      practice will be investigated using mixed methods comprising:

        -  surveys evaluating care on the level of the hospital

        -  semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals (HCP) and patients

        -  outcome assessments in patients included in the study (self-management, adherence,
           satisfaction with care, satisfaction with information, quality of life) using validated
           questionnaires at the start of the therapy, after 1 month and after three months

        -  outcome assessments in healthcare professionals at baseline (self-efficacy and
           perceptions on self-management) using validated questionnaires

        -  training and feedback sessions on counseling for HCPs

      Based upon these findings, a care pathway in each hospital will be developed by a local
      project team of different stakeholders from different disciplines.

      The after-part of the study includes phase 5-7 in which the care pathway is implemented,
      evaluated and continuously followed up.

      Implementation and evaluation take place at the same time. The evaluation includes:

        -  outcome assessments in patients (newly recruited) at the start of the therapy, after 1
           month and after three months

        -  outcome assessments in HCPs (follow up)

        -  evaluation of counseling skills

        -  focus group discussions and interviews with HCPs to evaluate the development and
           implementation of the care pathway.

      At the end of the study a comparison of outcomes before and after the implementation will be
      made to study the impact of the care pathway on the before mentioned aspects (see &quot;Brief
      Summary&quot;).

    <description>There is no gold standard to define self-management. A definition from Barlow et al., 2002 (2) defines self-management as follows: the ability of an individual to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial consequences and life style changes due to his/her condition. Adequate self-management refers to the ability to monitor one's condition and to effect cognitive, behavioural and emotional responses necessary to maintain a satisfactory quality of life.
The studied self-management skills in this project comprise &quot;social integration and support&quot;, &quot;health service navigation&quot;, &quot;constructive attitudes and approaches&quot;, &quot;skill and technique acquisition&quot; and &quot;emotional distress&quot;.</description>
