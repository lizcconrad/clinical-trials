  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery is gaining currency in the field of oncologic care, particularly for
      colorectal and gynecologic cancers. This innovation could be used either for staging purpose
      and therefore could steer global therapeutic options or for surgical management only.

      Increase knowledge and skills lead to an increase in the number and rate of the women this
      innovation could be offered. The project team observed a shift from traditional surgical
      management (abdominal radical surgery) towards laparoscopic with a focus on lymphadenectomy.

      This innovation however increases some costs (the surgical stage) but decrease some others
      (the post surgical stage).

      Foreseeing the pace of the dissemination needs to have objective and reliable data about who
      had access to laparoscopic surgery and who didn't (and why) and accurate assessment of
      related costs.

      This program will focus on uterine cancer (both cervix and corpus).
