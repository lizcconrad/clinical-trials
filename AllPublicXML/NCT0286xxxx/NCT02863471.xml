      In patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer could be a radical removal of all
      tumor foci a significantly improved survival compared to a sole systemic chemotherapy are
      additionally achieved by a hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC).

      Despite medical progress in recent years in pancreatic reach the 5-year survival rates even
      after radical surgical resection only 20%, which is due to high rates of local recurrence and
      distant metastases in the postoperative course. Due to the anatomical position of the
      pancreas resections are having a &quot;wide margin&quot; technically almost impossible, so that the
      tumor on postoperative preparation is often marginal forming. A further possible explanation
      for the high number of local recurrences, intraoperative tumor cell displacement in question.

      In patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer could be a radical removal of all
      tumor foci a significantly improved survival compared to a sole systemic chemotherapy are
      additionally achieved by a hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC). Purpose of HIPEC
      it is to kill any remaining microscopic residual tumor or residual tumor cells free. The aim
      of the present phase I / II study is therefore to examine the importance of HIPEC in addition
      to radical resection of ductal pancreatic cancer in terms of mortality and morbidity.
