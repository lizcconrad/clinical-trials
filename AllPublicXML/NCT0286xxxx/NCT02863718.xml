  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III
      study that compares the efficacy and safety of oral ibrutinib in previously untreated Binet
      stage A CLL patients without treatment indication according to iwCLL guidelines but risk of
      early disease progression.

      For event-free survival (EFS), an improvement from 24 months for untreated intermediate or
      (very) high risk CLL to 48 months for subjects treated with ibrutinib is considered
      clinically relevant. Ibrutinib / placebo is administered continuously orally until
      symptomatic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary treatment withdrawal,
      whichever occurs first.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of ibrutinib over placebo in
      prolonging EFS for subjects with treatment-naïve CLL stage A and intermediate or (very) high
      risk of disease progression. All subjects with intermediate, (very) high risk randomized to
      the experimental treatment arm will be treated up to active progressive disease with
      treatment indication according to iwCLL-Guidelines with the objective to demonstrate
      prolongation of EFS for the ibrutinib arm. EFS is defined as the time between randomization
      until active progressive disease with treatment indication according to the iwCLL-Guidelines
      with subsequent treatment for CLL or death.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the prolongation of overall survival of ibrutinib versus placebo

        -  To evaluate the safety of ibrutinib versus placebo

Additionally, OS will also be calculated for the time period between first diagnosis of CLL and death due to any cause. Subjects who have not yet died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last follow-up information they were assessed to be alive.
The exact cause of death will be recorded, with additional differentiation between CLL-related, treatment-related and other causes.
Furthermore overall survival will be analyzed using a multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for risk category, study arm, and baseline prognostic factors</description>
