  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS), when combined with different forms of computer based training, improves the ability
      to discriminate small differences between sounds in people diagnosed with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder.

      This study uses an experimental procedure called transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS). Little is known about how tDCS affects the brain or why some people diagnosed with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have trouble with certain kinds of hearing. This
      study is being done to see if an experimental computer training program, when combined with
      tDCS, can help people to hear better. In tDCS, a small amount of electricity is passed
      through electrodes placed on the head that is able to stimulate the brain. By stimulating the
      brain, the investigators believe that the functioning of the brain can be altered. This study
      will test whether such stimulation of the brain, when done with computer training, can
      improve hearing ability and if this improvement helps in other ways, like detecting changes
      in someone's tone of voice or understanding other people's emotions better. The data being
      collected aims to better understand how the brain processes sounds and how tDCS affects the
      brain.
