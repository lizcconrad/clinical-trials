      To investigate the treatment effect of continuous transcranial magnetic stimulation on
      schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations, and the underlying neural mechanism by
      functional MRI

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients underwent a medical evaluation that included physical examination and routine
      laboratory studies before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      treatment. Patients were randomly allocated to rTMS group and the sham group. There are about
      30 patients in each group. For the first 30 patients, allocation was by coin toss. For the
      subsequent 30 patients, allocation was according to computer generated random numbers. The
      decision to enroll a patient was always made prior to randomization. Patients were studied
      using a double-blind design. Study participants, clinical raters, and all personnel
      responsible for the clinical care of the patient remained masked to allocated condition and
      allocation parameters. Only rTMS administrators had access to the randomization list; they
      had minimal contact with the patients, and no role in assessing AVH. Each patient would be
      treated for continuous 15 days by rTMS

      Before the rTMS treatment, the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating
      Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were obtained by a trained investigator
      to assess baseline severity of auditory verbal hallucination (AVH) and other symptoms. The
      patients had receiving a battery measure of neuropsychological tests (standardized tests to
      investigate their cognitive problems, anxiety and depressive symptoms in daily life),
      magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, electroencephalography (EEG),
      event-related potentials during stop signal test and Iowa-gambling test record.

      After the last treatment, the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating
      Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were obtained, as well as the Global
      Index of Safety to assess adverse events of the treatment. Patients were instructed to focus
      their answers on the past 15 days. The patients had also receiving a battery measure of
      neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and EEG record.

      A month after the last treatment, participants were interviewed to obtain the Auditory
      Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale, the Positive, and Negative
      Syndrome Scale. They were instructed to focus their answers on the past week. Additionally,
      they were also asked to assess the battery of neuropsychological tests, and have magnetic
      resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and EEG record. Afterwards, they were unblinded by
      the study coordinator.

    <description>The continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol lasted 40 s and consisted of burst of 3 pulses delivered at 50 Hz, with bursts being repeated every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) for a total of 600 pulses. In the cTBS session, this 40s protocol was repeated for three times (1800 pulses in total) separated by two 15 min breaks (controlled by a stopwatch). MRI dataset should be acquired before the first cTBS session and after the last cTBS session.</description>

    <description>The procedure of this protocol was performed by a placebo coil. Each session lasted 40 s and consisted of burst of 3 pulses delivered at 50 Hz, with bursts being repeated every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) for a total of 600 pulses. No actual magnetic stimulation was applied on the head of the volunteers. MRI dataset should be acquired before the first sham TBS session and after the last sham TBS session.</description>
