    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, double blinded study, the needle tip and needle shaft
      visibility of echogenic and nonechogenic needle were compared in ultrasound guided
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block. Sixty patients scheduled for upper extremity surgery
      were included in the study. Patients were randomised into two groups, group E (Echogenic) and
      group NE (Nonechogenic) with 30 subjects in each group. Under ultrasound guidance
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block was performed. In Group E, Pajunk Sonoplex echogenic
      needle was used and in Group NE, Stimuplex Braun nonechogenic needle was used. The subjective
      assessment for needle tip/shaft visibility as scored by the performer and the objective
      assessment from the recorded block procedure video were noted.

      The aim of the investigators study was to find out the better among the echogenic and
      nonechogenic needle in needle tip/shaft visibility and the block success rate in ultrasound
      guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block. Sixty patients were randomized into two groups,
      Group E (echogenic group) and Group NE (nonechogenic group) with thirty patients in each
      group. The ultrasound imaging of each nerve block was video recorded for later analysis.
      Recording commenced from skin puncture and stopped at the time of final needle removal (total
      block time). After each block the performer was asked to subjectively score the percentage
      time he had visualized the needle tip and needle shaft on a 5 point scale (1 = 0%-20%, 2 =
      20%-40%, 3 = 40%- 60%, 4 = 60%-80%, 5 = 80%-100%). The recorded video was later analysed by
      an investigator. An objective measurement of percentage needle tip visibility and needle
      shaft visibility was calculated for each nerve block using the formula,

      Time in view (needle tip) / total block time x 100

      Time in view (needle shaft) / total block time x 100

      The subjective assessment for needle tip/shaft visibility as scored by the performer and the
      objective assessment from the recorded block procedure video were noted. Other block
      parameters were also compared.
