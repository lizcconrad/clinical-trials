      This is a multicenter, randomized, 1:1, double blinded phase II trial. Patients with
      unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) will be randomized between arm A:
      nintedanib and arm B:placebo

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, double blinded, randomized, two-arm phase II trial aiming
      to evaluate nintedanib treatment as switch maintenance in patients with unresectable MPM.

      After signing of the informed consent and upon confirmation of all eligibility criteria,
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to:

        -  Arm A: twice daily nintedanib at a dose of 200 mg until progression or unacceptable
           toxicities.

        -  Arm B: matched placebo.

      Response evaluation will be performed through CT scans every 8 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of unresectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM);

          -  Response or Stable disease according to modified RECIST criteria [48] after first line
             platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles;

          -  Last platinum chemotherapy dose administered within 60 days (i.e. randomization must
             occur within 60 days from the last dose of the last cycle of platinum-pemetrexed
             chemotherapy);

          -  Age &gt;18 years;

          -  ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2;

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks in the opinion of the investigator;

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to start of first dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  prior systemic anticancer therapy including cytotoxic therapy or immune-checkpoint
             inhibitor, for MPM, other than first line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy;

          -  previous extra-pleural pneumonectomy (other forms of previous surgery eg pleurectomy
             are acceptable);

          -  previous Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors (eg bevacizumab,
             sorafenib, etc);

          -  treatment with other investigational drugs or treatment in another clinical
             interventional trial within the past 4 weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly
             with the trial;

          -  patients that, in the opinion of the investigator, have reduced performance status by
             2 ECOG levels (e.g. PS 0 to 2 or PS 1 to 3) from beginning to completion of 1st line
             chemotherapy;

          -  radiotherapy (with the exception of palliative radiotherapy) during study or within 4
             weeks of start of study drug;

          -  known brain metastasis or lepto-meningeal disease. Patients with suspicious
             neurological symptoms should undergo a CT scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain
             metastasisNo active brain metastases (e.g. stable for &lt; 4 weeks;, no adequate previous
             treatment with radiotherapy;, symptomatic, requiring treatment with anti-convulsants;
             dexamethasone therapy will be allowed if administered as stable dose for at least one
             month before randomization); patients with suspicious neurological symptoms should
             undergo a CT scan/MRI of the brain to assess brain metastasis;

          -  leptomeningeal metastases;

          -  significant weight loss (&gt; 10 %) within the past 6 weeks prior to treatment in the
             present trial;

          -  pre-existing clinically significant ascites and/or clinically significant pleural
             effusion;

          -  active or history of bleeding complications that would prevent anti-angiogenic therapy

          -  centrally located tumors with radiographic evidence (CT or MRI) of local invasion of
             major blood vessels; typical mediastinal pleural involvement with mesothelioma remains
             eligible;

          -  clinically active cancer other than mesothelioma within 5 years prior to start of
             study treatment;

          -  radiographic evidence of cavitatory or necrotic tumors;

          -  unstoppable use of therapeutic anticoagulation (except low dose heparin and/or heparin
             flush as needed for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous device) or antiplatelet
             therapy (except for chronic low-dose therapy with acetylsalicylic acid =325mg per
             day);

          -  clinically significant cardiovascular diseases (i.e. hypertension not controlled by
             medical therapy, unstable angina, history of myocardial infarction within the past 6
             months, congestive New York Heart Association (NYHA) II, serious cardiac arrhythmia,
             clinically significant pericardial effusion)
