  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test a complementary therapy intervention (reflexology) that will
      assist in improving quality of life (QOL) for patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute
      myeloid leukemia. within the context of conventional medical care. Quality of life will be
      assessed via intermediate indicators: 1) physical indicators (greater physical functioning,
      lower presence of symptoms) 2) emotional indicators (greater spirituality, lower anxiety, and
      lower depressive symptomology); by a specific questionnaire. 3) chemotherapy side effects
      associated with the digestive system.

      The goal of this study is to test a complementary therapy intervention that will assist in
      improving quality of life (QOL) for patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute myeloid
      leukemia within the context of conventional medical care. This open study will test a one
      group design in which participants will continue to receive conventional care. All patients
      will receive reflexology (a specialized foot therapy) from a certified reflexologist twice
      weekly from the beginning of chemotherapy treatment.

      The specific aims are: 1) to evaluate the effect of reflexology treatment on chemotherapy
      side effects effecting the digestive system. 2) to evaluate the effect of reflexology
      treatment on Quality of life. The assessment of the treatment will be executed on the FACIT-D
      VERSION 3.The influences of the treatment will also be evaluated by the nursing staff, in
      order to describe the patient's mental health and the condition of his intestinal
      movement.The side effect before during and after the chemotherapy treatment will be compared
      using the questionnaire.
