    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the acute bioavailability of EPA and
      DHA in wax ester form provided as a dietary supplement compared to a well-studied and defined
      ethyl ester formulation in generally healthy men and women.

      A randomized, controlled two-period crossover study included one screening/baseline visit
      (visit 1, day -7) with four test visits during Period I (visits 2, 3, 4, and 5; days 0, 1, 2,
      and 3) and four tests visits during Period II (visits 6, 7, 8, and 9; days 14, 15, 16, and
      17) with at least a 7-d washout between test periods. Eighteen healthy adults with fasting
      TAG concentrations &lt;200 mg/dL were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences:
      receive 8 capsules containing Calanus oil® (Calanus AS, Tromso, Norway) supplying a total of
      4 g of oil providing 260 mg EPA and 156 mg/day DHA primarily as wax esters, followed by 1
      capsule supplying 1 g of oil providing 465 mg EPA and 375 mg DHA as ethyl esters (Lovaza®,
      GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC); or, to receive Lovaza followed by Calanus Oil.
      Product was dispensed in-clinic with an standardized EPA- and DHA- free breakfast meal (t=0).
      Blood samples were obtained in-clinic at t= -30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h
      timepoints. Subjects were provided a standardized EPA- and DHA-free meal at t=4 h and t=8.
      Subject were dismissed from the clinic after t-12 h blood draw and returned the morning of
      days 1, 2 and 3 (days 15, 16 and 17) for a 24 h, 48 h and 72 h fasting blood draw.
