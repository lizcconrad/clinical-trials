    <textblock>
      Background and significance: Though the problem of bullying among adolescents is evidently
      increasing and of a serious social concern, it is often undetected until serious outcomes
      have surfaced. In recent years, along with the rapid expansion of the Internet, social
      network services (SNS) and smart phones, &quot;cyber-bullying&quot; has been growing. Compared to the
      traditional bullying, cyberbullying is unique in nature and potentially more hazardous in
      terms of invisibility, lack of control, where it enables communication with a broad range of
      people at any time and place.

      To explore deeper understanding of the magnitude and the impact of the bullying among
      adolescents in Taiwan to inform public policy and future health intervention programs may be
      beneficial not only to Taiwan but also to Asia as a whole. Many Asian countries now suffer
      the similar problems of bullying among adolescents, since these countries share similar
      characteristics of development (spread of internet, SNSs and smart phones).

      Goal and objectives: This study aims to explore Taiwanese adolescents' experiences,
      perceptions, opinions and mental health regarding cyberbullying and traditional bullying to
      inform the development of questionnaire in the quantitative phase of mixed methods study.

      Study design: A qualitative study design with in depth interviews will be adopted.

      Target population and study setting: Senior high school students will be recruited from
      Taipei city, Taiwan.

      Sample size and sampling method: Participants will be sampled by convenience sampling until
      thematic saturation is attained, probably around 50 students.

      Data collection: Face-to-face in-depth interview with semi-structured questionnaire will be
      used.

      Data analysis: All interviews will be voice-recorded, transcribed, analyzed by thematic
      analysis procedure. Analysis process will include familiarization, coding, searching for
      themes, reviewing the themes, defining, naming themes and writing up or weaving the analytic
      narrative. Triangulation and supervision will also ensure credibility and balance in the
      process.

      Background and significance: Though the problem of bullying among adolescents is evidently
      increasing and of a serious social concern, it is often undetected, overlooked and noticeable
      only after serious outcomes have surfaced. In the recent years, along with the rapid
      expansion of internet, social network services (SNS) and smart phones, bullying through such
      electronic means, &quot;cyber-bullying&quot;, has been growing. Compared to the traditional bullying
      cyberbullying is unique in nature and potentially more hazardous in terms of invisibility,
      lack of control, where it enables communication with a broad range of people at any time and
      at any place. This study is based on mixed methods study. The investigators hope that the
      investigators study could contribute to the deeper understanding of the magnitude and impact
      of the bullying among adolescents in Taiwan and to inform public policy and future health
      intervention programs which may be beneficial not only to the Taiwan but to Asia, as a whole,
      as many Asian countries now suffer the similar problems of bullying among adolescents as the
      countries share similar characteristics of development (spread of internet, SNSs and smart
      phones) having resembling lifestyle and values.

      Study purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of traditional
      bullying and cyberbullying and the association between cyber-bullying and traditional
      bullying with mental health among Taiwanese adolescents.

      Study design: A mixed methods research design with qualitative study followed by quantitative
      study will be used in this research. Senior high school students will be included in Taiwan.
      For qualitative phase of this study, purposive sampling will be used to recruit students. For
      the quantitative phase of the study, sampling will be conducted by probability proportionate
      to size sampling procedure. For the qualitative phase of this study, in depth interview will
      be used to develop the quantitative questionnaire. An anonymous questionnaire developed from
      qualitative will be used to measure the variable of self-esteem, depression, suicidal
      ideation, traditional bullying and cyberbullying.

      Data analysis: For qualitative study, all interviews will be voice-recorded, transcribed,
      analyzed by thematic analysis procedure. Quantitative data will be statistically analyzed by
      using SAS software. Descriptive data will be calculated for all variables. Multiple
      regressions will be performed to understand the relationship between socio-demographic
      variables, cyberbullying, traditional bullying, self-esteem, depression and suicidal ideation
      which separated by gender.
