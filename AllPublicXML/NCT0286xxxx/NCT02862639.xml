  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current management of osteoarthritis is based on non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      means which include intra-articular injections.

      The recommendations on the management of hip osteoarthritis stipulate that intra-articular
      injections of corticosteroid may be considered in patients with an exacerbation not
      responding to oral treatments. Several recent studies show the effectiveness of
      intra-articular corticosteroids compared with anesthetics. The intra-articular injection of
      viscosupplementation alone has never been validated in this indication since controlled
      studies did not show efficacy over placebo. At present, viscosupplementation is considered an
      anti-osteoarthritic symptomatic slow-acting and its interest is not yet established in hip
      osteoarthritis.
