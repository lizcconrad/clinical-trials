  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cachexia associated with cancer is a grave and most of the time irreversible common
      situation. It seems independent from the size of the tumor or from its metastatic character.
      The consequences for the management of the patient are major and exceed widely the frame of
      the nutrition.

      Undernutrition of patients with cancer is described by a decrease of the energy contributions
      and a loss of muscular and fat mass, leading to a progressive functional deficiency which can
      go to the cachectic state.

      Actually, clinical criteria are proposed allowing to characterize the state of pre-cachexia
      but it remain too indistinct to allow an early and efficient screening and set up effective
      measures of prevention of the cachexia, to avoid the loss of muscular tissue and the cast
      iron of the energy reserves.

      It is necessary to have clinical and biological markers with diagnostic aim and forecasts
      during the situations precedents the appearance of cachexia.

      The present study will allow calibrating a longitudinal study, which could confirm the value
      of measures made for the diagnosis of pre-cachexia.
