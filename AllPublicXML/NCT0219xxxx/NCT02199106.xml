    <textblock>
      Neuronavigated continuous theta burst stimulation of the left Heschl's gyrus is used to
      modulate auditory cortex activity and plasticity contributing to the perception and distress
      of chronic tinnitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the phantom auditory perception of sound in the absence of an external or
      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with
      the ability to lead a normal life. One significant modulator of tinnitus is stress. Tinnitus
      has been shown to be generated in the brain, as a result of functional reorganization of
      auditory neural pathways and the central auditory system. Repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) is also effective in treatment of tinnitus with moderate effect size.
      Pilot data were positive for low-frequency rTMS applied to the temporal and temporoparietal
      areas. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) is a new protocol of rTMS with a possible
      superior effect in contrast to low-frequency rTMS. Also anatomical neuronavigation might
      increase the efficacy of rTMS due to exact targeting of the primary auditory cortex. Thus,
      the aim of this study is the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of neuronavigated left-sided
      cTBS in chronic tinnitus in a randomised sham-controlled two-arm design.
