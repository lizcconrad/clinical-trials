        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants should be healthy males and females

          -  All female volunteers must use a safe contraception (i.e. oral contraceptive, spiral;
             sterilized) and must have a negative pregnancy test

          -  In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation each volunteer
             is supposed to give his written informed consent prior to admission to the study

          -  Each subject will have his medical history taken and will receive a complete medical
             examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as well as a 12-lead
             Electrocardiogram (ECG) within 14 days before the first administration of the test
             substance

          -  Haematopoietic, hepatic and renal function test will be carried out in the laboratory

          -  The subjects will fast for 12 hours before collection of specimens for all laboratory
             evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers will be excluded from the study if the results of the medical examination
             or laboratory tests (especially those which indicate liver malfunction) are judged by
             the clinical investigator to differ significantly from normal clinical values

          -  Volunteers with known gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,
             metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders

             to the trial as judged by the investigator

          -  Intake of a drug with a long half-life (&gt;= 24 hours) within ten half-lives of the
             respective drug before enrolment in the study

          -  Use of any other drugs which might influence the results of the trial during the week
             previous to the start of the study

          -  Participation in another study with an investigational drug within the last two months
             preceding this study

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day)

          -  Drug abuse

          -  Blood donation ( &gt;= 100 ml) within the last 4 weeks

          -  Excessive physical activities (e.g. competitive sports) within the last week before
             the study
