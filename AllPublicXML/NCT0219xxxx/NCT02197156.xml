    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to establish a dose-response relationship among several capsule
      strengths of Hydrocodone Bitartrate Extended Release (HC-ER) and to compare the efficacy to
      placebo following bunionectomy surgery

             regarding the study prior to the performance of any study- specific procedures.

          -  Subject required primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery with or
             without hammertoe repair with no other collateral procedures allowed

          -  Subject was male or female at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject weighed &gt; or = 100 lbs (pounds).

             intensity.

          -  Subject was in good health as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical
             history, physical examination, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and screening laboratory
             results.

          -  Subject had not developed a condition or complications as result of the bunionectomy
             procedure that would preclude their participation in the study.

          -  Subject was willing and able to remain at the recovery day care center for the entire
             24-hour Treatment period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject was pregnant or lactating.

          -  Subject had a condition that would contraindicate the use of opioid analgesia (e.g.,
             pulmonary disease or paralytic ileus).

          -  Subject had received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), monoamine
             oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) carbamazepine, quinidine, and/or tricyclic antidepressants
             (TCA) compounds within 1-month prior to Check-in.

          -  Subject had received opioids, tranquilizers, sedatives, or hypnotics within 48 hours
