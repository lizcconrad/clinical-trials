  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that in situ MNA-directed chemo-immunotherapy using doxorubicin will
      kill tumor cells locally and alter the tumor microenvironment to induce durable systemic
      tumor-specific immunity.

      The purpose of this study is to test a new method of experimental treatment for CTCL, using
      small adhesive-like patches (a micro-needle applicator or MNA for short), which have dozens
      of very small micro-needles loaded with extremely low doses of doxorubicin, a chemotherapy
      agent. The overall goal of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of these
      patches. We also want to determine which micro-dose of the drug is the best to achieve the
      best response. To make sure that we observe the effects of the very low dose of the drug and
      not the MNA patch itself, we will also use a placebo (a patch without drug in some patients)
      in addition to the doxorubicin coated patches. We will thoroughly evaluate the skin where the
      patches are applied. Once the best dose is determined for use in the patch, we will also
      begin to look at how well the patches work in clearing the skin.

      This study will evaluate a novel approach to the treatment of patches and plaques in the skin
      of patients diagnosed with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma utilizing a dissolvable microneedle
      array (MNA) delivery device that is used to directly and specifically deliver a drug to the
      tumor microenvironment for skin cancer therapy. We will utilize MNAs to deliver a
      well-characterized, potent chemotherapeutic agent (doxorubicin) to kill topically accessible,
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells. In addition to directly killing cancer cells, doxorubicin is
      known to induce an immunologic cell death with the potential to simultaneously convert a
      cutaneous neoplasm into a highly potent patient specific immunogen capable of inducing
      innate, adaptive, and tumor specific effector and memory immune responses. Importantly,
      doxorubicin is currently in clinical use with a well-established safety profile. It is
      anticipated that use of the MNA-Doxorubicin (MNA-D) delivery system will enable direct and
      specific delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor, thereby avoiding any potential for systemic
      toxicity. The study will be conducted in two phases, with the first being a safety
      dose-finding phase and the second phase for efficacy and safety evaluation.
