      Title Staged Bilateral Carpal Tunnel Release: Which Side Hurts More? Primary null hypothesis
      Patients undergoing staged bilateral open Carpal Tunnel Release (CTR) have no difference in
      overall pain intensity of pain between sides.

      Secondary null hypotheses

        -  There is no correlation in overall pain intensity after open CTR surgery and distal
           sensory latency, distal motor latency, electromyography (EMG), demographics, occupation,
           avocation, relevant comorbidities, dominance, left vs. right, Pain Self-Efficacy,
           Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity or
           PROMIS depression when both surgeries are performed within 6 months.

        -  There is no difference in satisfaction with treatment at the time of suture removal
           after the first and second open CTR surgery when both are performed within 6 months..

      IRB: 2009-p-001-019 ClinicalTrials.gov: Not mandatory, (b/o observational) Authors:
      Drijkoningen, Braun, Ring Journal: To be discussed Design: Prospective cohort study
      Background Many hand surgeons note that patients undergoing staged bilateral open carpal
      tunnel release often experience more pain with the second side. The investigator felt this
      was an easily testable hypothesis worthy of study.

      Subjects

      Eligibility:

      Inclusion:

        -  Age 18 or older

        -  Idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome

        -  No prior surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome

      Exclude:

        -  Pregnant women

        -  Not fluent in English

      Response Variables:

        -  11-point ordinal measure of overall pain intensity during and after surgery measured at
           the time of suture removal.

        -  11-point ordinal measure of satisfaction with treatment

        -  PROMIS upper extremity

      Explanatory Variables:

        -  Distal Sensory Latency (DSL)

        -  Distal Motor Latency (DML)

        -  EMG changes

        -  Demographics: age, sex, race, occupation, avocation

        -  Time limit between two surgeries &lt; 6 months

        -  Relevant comorbidities: Trapeziometacarpal (TMC) arthrosis, ulnar neuropathy, trigger
           finger

        -  Involved hand (Dominance, Side)

        -  First side vs. second side surgery

        -  PROMIS Pain Interference Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT)

        -  Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ-2)

        -  PROMIS Depression

      Methods The investigator and study staff will invite all adult patients (age 18 and older)
      presenting to the Orthopaedic Hand and Upper Extremity Service Department at Massachusetts
      General Hospital (MGH) with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome planning staged bilateral carpal
      tunnel release.

      Analysis Power analysis An a priori power analysis for matched pairs was performed. To detect
      the difference between two dependent means an effect size of 0.5 at alpha of 0.05 and 80%
      power, a total sample size of 34 patients is needed.As the investigator expects to have
      patients who will be lost to follow-up the investigators will count 10% extra, a total of 38
      patients will be needed.

      Univariate analysis: Variables will be presented with frequencies and percentages for
      categorical variables and as mean with standard deviation or median with interquartile range
      for respectively normal or non-normal distributed continuous variables. Normality of
      continuous distributed variables will be tested a paired T-Test.

      Bivariate and multivariable analysis will be performed and subsequently all variables with a
      probability &lt; 0.10 in bivariate analysis will be inserted in a backward, stepwise,
      multivariable linear regression analysis to assess their ability to explain variation in
      outcome. The 11 point Likert Pain scale score is considered significant when there is a
      difference of more than 1.4 points (2.8 SD*0.5 effect size)on a scale from 1-10.[9]
