  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fruquintinib administered at 5mg once daily in 4 weeks treatment cycle (three weeks on and
      one week off) was well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging preliminary clinical antitumor
      activity in patients with advanced CRC in phIb study.

      This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib in the treatment of
      patients with metastatic CRC who have progressed after metastatic CRC second line or above
      standard chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase II clinical trial
      to compare the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) versus
      placebo plus BSC in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed after
      second-line or above standard chemotherapy.

      After checking eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized into Fruquintinib plus BSC
      group (treatment group) or placebo plus BSC group (control group) in a ration of 2:1.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

      Progression free survival (PFS) (According to RECIST Version 1.1).

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

      Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Overall Survival (OS).

      Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and
      categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.
