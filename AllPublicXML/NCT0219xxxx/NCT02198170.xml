      p-glycoprotein inhibition on lenvatinib pharmacokinetics following a single oral dose of 5 mg
      lenvatinib.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover study consisting of
      two phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase will have two
      periods: Screening and Baseline 1. The Randomization Phase will have two periods: Treatment
      Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 with a Baseline 2 assessment prior to Treatment Period 2. In
      the Randomization Phase, subjects will be randomized to one of two possible treatment
      sequences (placebo/ketoconazole or ketoconazole/placebo). Ketoconazole 400 mg or placebo will
      be orally administered once daily for the first four days of each treatment period. On the
      fifth day of each treatment period, in addition to ketoconazole/placebo, 5 mg lenvatinib will
      be orally administered. Ketoconazole/placebo administration will then continue for 13
      additional days. Subjects are crossed over from Treatment Period 1 to Treatment Period 2
      after a 2-week washout.

             intrauterine device [IUD], condom + spermicide or condom + diaphragm with spermicide,
             a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive; or have a vasectomized partner)

             (defined as greater than age 50 and at least 12 months of amenorrhea) or subjects who
             have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (e.g., bilateral
             tubal ligation with surgery at least 6 months prior to dosing, hysterectomy, or
             bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 2 months prior to dosing). All women who
             are of reproductive potential and who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been
             on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 12 weeks
             prior to dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

          4. Male subjects who are not abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy, who are
             partners of women of childbearing potential must use, or their partners must use a
             highly effective method of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom +
             diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to
             starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study and for 30 days after the last
             dose of study drug. Those with partners using hormonal contraceptives must also be
             using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously).
