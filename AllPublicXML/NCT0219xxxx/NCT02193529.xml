      Weight reducing surgery is the only effective therapy for morbid obese patients.

      Sleeve gastrectomy is a popular choice for bariatric surgery because of less sequela. There
      is poor knowledge about the nutritional status inpatients after LSG. The aim of our study was
      to investigate the relationship between dietary intake and weight loss after LSG.

      Weight reducing surgery is the only effective therapy for morbid obese patients. Restrictive
      type surgery is safer than mal-absorptive type surgery. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is an
      effective surgery. In laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), about 90% of the stomach is
      surgically removed by vertical resection of the great curvature side, including the fundus.
      The simplicity of surgical procedures, the low occurrence of complications, and the
      efficiency of reducing excess weight have made LSG as a popular choice for bariatric surgery.
      After LSG, the amount of food eaten is drastically reduced, leading to nutritional
      deficiencies potentially. There is poor knowledge about the nutritional status inpatients
      after LSG. Some literatures suggest that LSG results in less nutritional deficiencies than
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between
      dietary intake and weight loss after LSG.
