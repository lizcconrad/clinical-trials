  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centre study will follow a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group,
      active-controlled design and will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of bupropion
      extended-release (XL) (300 mg/day) compared with escitalopram (10-20 mg/day) in outpatients
      and inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The total duration of the study will be
      11 weeks consisting of three phases. The screening phase (phase I) will be lasting for 0-14
      days, subjects will be randomised to bupropion XL or escitalopram in a 1:1 ratio for acute
      phase treatment phase (phase II) for 8 weeks. There are 3 dose levels during this acute
      treatment phase. The 3-dose level plan is designed to ensure each drug is titrated according
      to the prescribing information and to reach an optimal clinical dose. Finally patients will
      enter the taper phase (phase III) for up to 1 week to assess and reduce the possible
      withdrawal symptoms.

      In China almost all existing antidepressants are available on the market, but bupropion XL
      has not yet been approved. This Phase III clinical trial will be used for the purpose of
      registering bupropion XL in China.
