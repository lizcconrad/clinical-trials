  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that
      has been approved as a treatment of depression in patients that have not responded to a trial
      of one antidepressant medication. The investigators hypothesize that low frequency TMS exerts
      inhibitory effect on hyper excitable cortical state in patients with chronic insomnia and
      therefore is therapeutic. The investigators want to compare the change in insomnia scores
      between baseline and end of treatment in an open label trial with bifrontal low frequency TMS
      stimulation in 20 patients with primary insomnia using daily stimulation of 3 weeks (15 week
      days).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common clinical problem that affects about 25 million people in the US.
      Insomnia exacts health and economic consequences well beyond inadequate and non-restorative
      sleep. It increases healthcare costs, causes or adds to medical and psychiatric
      comorbidities, cognitive impairments, accidents, absenteeism and reduced quality of life.
      Treatment of insomnia is difficult and usually needs a multimodal approach incorporating
      various cognitive and behavioral approaches in addition to medication treatment. TMS and
      other neurophysiological studies have shown presence of a diffuse cortical hyper-arousal in
      patients with chronic insomnia. High frequency TMS (&gt;1 Hz) has been shown to be activating
      whereas low frequency TMS (&lt;1Hz) has been shown to be inhibitory in clinical and
      neurophysiological studies. TMS has been approved as a treatment of depression in patients
      who have not responded to a trial of at least one antidepressant medication. The goal of this
      study is to translate the knowledge learned from neurophysiological studies of insomnia to
      the clinical treatment of insomnia using TMS as the primary modality.

      Aim: Compare the change in insomnia scores between baseline and end of treatment with
      bifrontal low frequency TMS stimulation in 20 patients with primary insomnia using daily
      stimulation of 3 weeks (15 week days).

    <description>Change in insomnia severity index scores at the ned of three weeks stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>
