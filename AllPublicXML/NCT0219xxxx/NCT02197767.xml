  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label study to determine if the use of Rituximab reduces proteinuria
      over a 12 month period and is there preservation of kidney function with the use of this
      study drug.

      Aim 1) Preservation of kidney function at 12 months as defined by stable or improved 24 hour
      creatinine clearance.

      Aim 2) Reduction in proteinuria at 12 months &amp; improved quality of life at 12 months
      validated by questionnaire.
