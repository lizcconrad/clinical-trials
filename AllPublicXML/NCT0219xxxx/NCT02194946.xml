  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), also end stage renal disease(ESRD), usually presents
      overt clinical symptoms and is a critical stage when patients are encountered with dialysis.
      The optimal time to initiating dialysis in patients with stage 5 CKD is addressed as the most
      important dialysis-related question. As indicated by the recently published European Renal
      Best Practice (ERBP) guideline, early initiation seemed to produce no benefit but greater
      expenditure and sometimes more harm.Renal replacement therapies (RRT) including dialysis are
      the most common procedures for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but conservative
      management should be an option in patients who still experience the stable period without
      clinical indications of dialysis.Chinese Medicine (CM) is recognized as an alternative
      therapy on alleviating uremic symptoms, deferring dialysis initiation, and improving quality
      of life. Although the effects of CM on kidney disease have been demonstrated in animal
      experiments, evidence from large clinical trial is insufficient. So we raise the hypothesis
      that CM therapies including Chinese herbal formula, Chinese patent medicine via oral pattern
      and/or Colonic administration, will defer the initiation of dialysis in adults with stage 5
      CKD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chinese Medicine (CM) treatment has been applied to CKD patients commonly in China,
      especially those independent of dialysis. Based on the personal experience of experts from
      different areas in China, patients with stage 5 CKD have been treated with different
      formulations of herbs including Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi), Codonopsis pilosula
      (Dangshen), Semen Cuscutae (Tusizi) and Radix et Rhizoma Rhei (Dahuang) etc. . Based on the
      Traditional Chinese Medicine theory and clinical practise, these herbal medicines help
      strengthening &quot;spleen-kidney&quot; and dispelling &quot;turbidity&quot; . To determine whether CM therapies
      including Chinese herbal formula, Chinese patent medicine via oral pattern and/or Colonic
      administration, will significantly defer dialysis initiation, we conduct the Chinese Medicine
      on Deferring Dialysis Initiation (C-MODDI) study. It's a multicenter, prospective, controlled
      trial, also an effectiveness study that are conducted in the &quot;real world&quot; of a variety of
      busy clinical practices, with heterogeneous interventions that are more representative of the
      general effectiveness of CM therapies.

    <description>Averaged time from enrollment to dialysis initiation or death from any cause, whichever comes first.
Patients commence dialysis based on the following criteria:
Clinical indications of dialysis include medically refractory serum potassium&gt; 6.5mmol/L, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) &lt;13mmol/L, eGFR≤5ml/min/1.73m2 (calculated by EPI formula), or the patient is symptomatic (see criteria #2). If these indications remain occur after receiving conservative CKD-related management for 1 week, or if relapse twice within one month, the patient definitely reaches the endpoint.
Uremic symptoms include nausea, vomit, malnutrition, pericarditis or pleurisy, volume overload, encephalopathy, bleeding tendency, refractory hypertension, or other symptoms that are likely to be ameliorated by dialysis.</description>
