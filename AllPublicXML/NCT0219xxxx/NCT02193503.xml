    <textblock>
      The objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of 6 vaccine doses of MVX-ONCO-1,
      administered sub-cutaneously (injections and capsules implantations), in patients with
      advanced metastatic solid tumor in progression who are not or not any longer amenable to any
      standard therapy of their tumour disease.

    <textblock>
      Endpoints:

      Primary: To assess safety parameters including adverse and serious adverse events (incidence,
      causality, severity), local and systemic tolerance to the administered study treatment,
      changes in laboratory values and vital signs in patients with solid tumor; Secondary: to
      measure some tumor responses in using imaging technique, serological tumor markers, immune
      monitoring and metabolic monitoring.
