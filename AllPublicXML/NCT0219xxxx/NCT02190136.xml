    <textblock>
      Stretching and flexibility exercise such as yoga and functional resistance exercise are two
      forms of exercise that are growing in popularity. However, they have not been scientifically
      tested to demonstrate their ability to improve body composition, fitness, heart and metabolic
      health, and mood state in overweight/obese women. The investigators hypothesize that during
      an 11 week intervention, both forms of exercise will improve body composition, heart and
      metabolic health and mood state.

      This study was a 11 week protein-rich whole food diet and exercise training intervention in
      middle aged overweight/obese women. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups: Protein-rich
      whole food only consumed as 20-25 grams per serving 4-6 per day (P); protein and resistance
      exercise training (R); and protein and stretching/yoga exercise training (S). All outcomes,
      including the primary outcomes of body composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers were
      measured at baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 12) in all study subjects.
