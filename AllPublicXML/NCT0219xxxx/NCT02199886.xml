  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to assess the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and imaging characteristics
      associated with increasing doses of 131I-BIBH 1, to compare the uptake of 131I-BIBH 1 in
      tumour to that of normal tissue in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and to measure
      human anti-human antibody (HAHA) concentrations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed primary or secondary advanced non-small cell lung cancer

          -  Eligible for a lung biopsy or scheduled for surgery that would provide biopsy material

          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 70

          -  Expected survival of ≥ 3 months

          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age

          -  Absolute granulocyte count ≥ 2.5 x 10**9/L

          -  Lymphocyte count &gt; 0.7 x 10**9/L

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10**9/L

          -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl (0.20 mmol/L)

          -  Alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) ≤ 3x upper limit of
             normal

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl or 34µmol (SI unit equivalent)

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active metastatic disease to the central nervous system, exhibited by new or enlarging
             lesions on CT or MRI scan or within 3 months of treatment (i.e., surgery or
             radiotherapy) for brain metastases

          -  Exposure to an investigational agent within four weeks of the BIBH 1 infusion

          -  Patients that are not fully recovered from surgery. Because of the potential binding
             of BIBH 1 to healing scars, patients with incomplete healing at an incision site, as
             evidenced by incomplete granulation, infection or localized edema are excluded

          -  Chemotherapy or immunotherapy within four weeks preceding entry (six weeks for
             nitrsoureas and/or mitomycin-C.)

          -  Previous administration of a murine, chimeric or humanised measurement and/or antibody
             fragment

          -  Serious illness: e.g., active infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders or
             diseases considered by the investigator to have potential for interfering with
             obtaining accurate results from this study

          -  Women who are breast-feeding or pregnant

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to utilize a medically
             acceptable method of contraception

          -  Previous participation in this study

          -  Patients who have autoimmune disease or hypertopic skin conditions that possibly
             over-express Fibroblast Activation Protein and may be targeted by the antibody. These
             diseases include active inflammatory arthritis, cirrhosis and keloids.

          -  Patients with unstable angina pectoris. Patients prescribed medication to control
             their angina pectoris must be on a fixed dose for at least 1 month prior to screening
             to be eligible for the trial.

          -  Patients who experienced a myocardial infarction within 3 months of Screening.
