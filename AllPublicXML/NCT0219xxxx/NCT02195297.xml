  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study was to evaluate by clinical, morphometric and non invasive instrumental
      evaluations the activity of an &quot;anticellulitis&quot; cosmetic product vs a reference product of
      the market (comparison within subjects), applied once a day, for an uninterrupted period of 4
      weeks, on 22 female healthy volunteers with low/moderate oedematous - fibrosclerotic
      lipodystrophy on the thighs.

      It was also aim of the study to evaluate cosmetic acceptability by the volunteers and
      products efficacy and tolerance both by investigator and volunteers.

    <measure>Morphometric evaluations: change from baseline (T2 and T4 vs. T0)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 and 4 week-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>All the measures were performed in standard conditions at level of the thigh (III superior, III middle and inferior), thanks to a specific electro-optical system.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ultrasonographic evaluations: change from baseline (T2 and T4 vs. T0)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 and 4 week-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasonographic measurement of adipose panniculum thickness (mm) was performed at level of the external thigh (III superior) through the instrument Body Metrix™ BX 2000 (Genex).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin plastoelasticity: change from baseline (T2 and T4 vs. T0)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 and 4 week-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Skin elasticity was measured through the instrument Dermal Torque Meter (Dia-Stron Ltd., UK). This instrument is based on the principle of the torsion given to the skin surface by a probe made of two circles that adhere to the skin through shaped adhesive tapes. The instrument measures the torsion angle (θ) during the mechanical stimulus (&quot;torque on&quot;) and after it has ceased (&quot;torque off&quot;). For each of the considered curves it was measured the cutaneous rotational ratio relative to defined measured times, obtaining the parameters listed below:
Ue: immediate extensibility (&quot;torque on&quot; at 0.2 sec.) Uf: final extensibility (&quot;torque on&quot; at 9 sec.) Uv: viscoelasticity Ur: immediate elastic recovery (&quot;torque off&quot; at 0.2 sec.)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tissue dielectric constant of deep skin layers: change from baseline (T2 and T4 vs. T0)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 and 4 week-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue dielectric constant of deep skin layers misures non-invasively the dielectric constant of the subcutaneous fat; it is a dimensionless physical quantity and it is directly proportional to the water content in the measured tissue. The used probe corresponds to an effective measurement depth of 5 mm; the measure were performed at level of the external thigh (III superior).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optical densitometry: change from baseline (T2 and T4 vs. T0)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 and 4 week-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of the skin erythema at level of the internal area of the knee was performed by the use of an optical densitometer (X-RITE 404) allowing to quantify, on a logarithmic scale, total reflected optical density (visual=V) and the values of primary subtractive colours of reflected light: cyan(=C), magenta(=M) and yellow(=Y). Calculation of erythema index was done as follows: E.I.=logRmagenta-logRcyan, where R represents the reflectance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thermography evaluation: change from baseline (T2 and T4 vs. T0)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 and 4 week-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Contact thermography permits visualizing, through colors, the temperatures of the areas being examined by using encapsulated liquid crystals plates; it allows to detect information about cutaneous microcirculation in normal conditions, after functional stimuli or vasoactive treatments: skin temperature grows in case of vasodilatation, increase of blood vessels, increase local metabolism and reduced in case of vasoconstriction, pathological decrease of blood vessels, decrease of local metabolism, oedema and increase of adipose tissue. A characteristic thermography aspect of legs' oedematous - fibrosclerotic lipodystrophy is represented by the typical leopard skin with large hypothermic zones. Panniculopatia evaluation follows next classification:
0 = uniform hyperthermal image
= shaded spots thermal image (hyperthermal images)
= leopard spots (numerous hyperthermal images)
= hypothermal black holes
= uniform hypothermal image</description>
