  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that result
      in abnormal bone formation in muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Flare-ups begin early in life
      and may occur spontaneously or after soft tissue trauma, vaccinations, or influenza
      infections. Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict movement by locking joints leading to
      cumulative loss of function and disability. Mouse models of FOP have demonstrated the ability
      of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) gamma agonists to prevent heterotopic ossification (HO)
      following injury. The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether palovarotene, an RAR gamma
      agonist, will prevent HO during and following a flare-up in subjects with FOP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the ability of different doses of palovarotene to
      prevent HO at the flare-up site in subjects with FOP as assessed by plain radiographs.

      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, sponsor-unblinded,
      placebo-controlled study. Two cohorts of subjects will be randomized into different dosing
      regimens of palovarotene for a 6-week (42 days) treatment period. The study will consist of
      three periods:

        1. A Screening period to occur within 7 days of a distinct flare-up. The first dose of
           study drug will be taken within 7 days of the flare-up initiation.

        2. A double-blind treatment period of 6 weeks (42 days) duration.

        3. A follow-up period of 6 weeks (42 days) duration.

      An initial cohort (Cohort 1) of subjects will be randomly assigned 3:1 to either palovarotene
      or placebo daily for 42 days. Subjects randomized to palovarotene in Cohort 1 will receive an
      initial daily dose of 10 mg for 14 days followed by 5 mg daily for 28 days.

      In Cohort 2, new FOP subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly
      assigned 3:3:2 to two dose regimens of palovarotene (10 mg for 14 days and 5 mg for 28 days;
      5 mg for 14 days and 2.5 mg for 28 days) or placebo daily for 42 days. Doses will be
      weight-adjusted and subjects randomized within three weight-range categories (20 to &lt;40 kg,
      40 to &lt;60 kg, and ≥60 kg).

      Subjects completing the study and still meeting eligibility requirements will be given the
      opportunity to enroll into an open-label extension study.
