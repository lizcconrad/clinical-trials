  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a withdrawal regulation training program compared to relaxation
      training for individuals that are interested in smoking cessation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited through newspaper and internet advertisements, advertisements
      on public transportation, community centers and community based organizations. All
      recruitment materials will contain a toll-free telephone number with 24-hour voice mail. The
      first contact with potential participant will be by telephone interview to assess for
      eligibility of participant. Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be invited to an
      orientation meeting where a breath carbon monoxide sample will be obtained. Women participant
      of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test administered.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: Early Withdrawal Exposure +
      Withdrawal Relaxation Training (E+WT) or Relaxation Training (RT) control. The E+WT condition
      will consist of the development, application, modification, and repeated practice of
      individualized withdrawal regulation for behavioral and cognitive strategies. the RT
      condition will control for the therapeutic contact received by those in the E+WT condition
      and will consist of the development, application, modification, and repeated practice of
      individualized relaxation techniques (e.g. breathing exercises, imagery).

    <description>Smoking abstinence will be determined by self-report and confirmed via breath carbon monoxide (CO) analysis. Self-report of no smoking over the past 7 days (7-day point prevalence abstinence) and a CO value of less than 8 parts per million will be indicative of smoking abstinence. Self-report of any smoking over the past 7 days and/or CO values of 8 or greater will be indicative of cigarette use.</description>
