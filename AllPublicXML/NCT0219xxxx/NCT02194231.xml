  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether trabectedin is effective in the treatment
      of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no approved agents for second-line treatment of MPM in patients who failed first
      line pemetrexed plus platinum derivatives regimens. Chemotherapy options are limited and
      include gemcitabine, vinorelbine and other antifolate compounds. The role of second-line
      chemotherapy is therefore not yet established and second-line patient population is
      considered suitable for phase II studies with investigational agents.

      Trabectedin is an originally natural marine product, now obtained by a semisynthetic process,
      that induces a delay in S phase progression and a blockade in G2 phase of the cell cycle by a
      mode of action that seems different from that of other DNA-damaging agents (see citations).
      Although the exact mechanism of action of trabectedin has not been fully elucidated yet, it
      appears to be unique compared to other anticancer agents (see citations). Trabectedin binds
      to N2 of guanines in the minor groove of DNA, causing a bending of the minor groove towards
      the major groove.

      In the randomised clinical trials in metastatic leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma and in
      recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, trabectedin is infused at 1.5 mg/m2 as a 24-hour
      infusion or 1.3 mg/m2 as a 3 hour infusion every 3 weeks (see citations). Balancing efficacy
      with safety the short infusion is preferable in clinical practice.

      In soft tissue sarcoma the response rate did not exceed 10%, however, trabectedin has been
      shown to provide disease control, with progression arrest rates exceeding 50% and
      progression-free survival rates exceeding 20% at 6 months. In pre-treated ovarian cancer the
      objective response rate was 30% with a median time to disease progression of 5.7 months.

      Trabectedin has not been extensively employed in MPM, however in phase I studies, some
      objective response in heavily pre-treated mesothelioma patients was seen.

      The present study is aimed at evaluating the activity of trabectedin in MPM patients not
      candidate for radical surgery. This option is of particular interest due to lack of valid
      therapeutic options.

      Translational studies will be performed to identify factors predictive of the activity of
      trabectedin in MPM.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>miRs profile evaluation will be performed with the aim of characterising the tumour biological features associated to the different response patterns. Since recent published studies suggests that trabectedin modulates the expression of some miRs in cancer cells exposed to the drug and, also, the resistance to anticancer drugs seems to be well correlated to the expression of some specific miRs, the evaluation of miRs expression may become a powerful prognostic and predictive marker.
miRNA landscape in both plasma and tumour tissues will be profiled using commercially available oligo arrays platforms.</description>

    <description>Recent data indicate that the high mobility group B1 (HMGB1) is implicated in the transformation of meshothelial cells and is strongly secreted in sera of patients with mesothelioma. These findings provide the rationale for considering HMGB1 as a potential useful marker to monitor therapeutic effectiveness in patients with mesothelioma.
HMGB1 will be determined in plasma of patients at the same time points previously indicated for the assessment of miR profiles by using an ELISA essay</description>

    <description>We propose to analyse the effects of trabectedin on the number of circulating monocytes and the plasma levels of selected biological mediators. A decrease in the number of circulating monocytes could be a surrogate marker of a biological effect of trabectedin on the precursor cells of tumour macrophages.
We propose to collect the number of circulating monocytes during the first 3 treatment cycles, immediately before and 7 days after trabectedin administration</description>
