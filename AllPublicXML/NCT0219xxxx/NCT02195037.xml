    <textblock>
      Recently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended a delay
      of 30-60 seconds in umbilical cord clamping for all newborn infants. This delay allows the
      newborn to receive his/her own blood from the placenta (placental transfusion) which helps
      their transition in the first hours of life. The purpose of the study is to learn about the
      amount of blood flow to and from the baby's heart during normal newborn transition
