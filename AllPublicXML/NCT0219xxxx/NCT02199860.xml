  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to obtain information about the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of BIBN 4096 BS after single inhalation administration of rising doses of
      spray-dried powder in healthy male and female volunteers. According to the original protocol,
      the primary objective was to investigate the safety and tolerability of single doses of a new
      spray-dried inhalation formulation of BIBN 4096 BS (SD I). Following implementation of
      Amendment 2, this objective was extended to the second spray-dried inhalation formulation SD
      II with and without concomitant administration of lactose
