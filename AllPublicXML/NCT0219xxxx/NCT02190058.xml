        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects aged 18-55 years.

          -  A body mass index (BMI) in the range 18-30 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighing between 50
             and 100 kg at screening.

          -  Willing to comply with all study restrictions, including the use of contraception,
             concomitant medication, and dietary and lifestyle restrictions.

          -  Sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the study and any hazards of
             participating in it. Ability to communicate satisfactorily with the Investigator and
             to participate in, and comply with requirements of, the entire study.

          -  Have given written consent to participate in the study after reading the ICF, and
             after having the opportunity to discuss the study with the Investigator or his
             delegate.

          -  Have given written consent to have his data entered into The Over-volunteering
             Prevention System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory
             values that could interfere with the objectives of the study or compromise the safety
             of the subject.

          -  Presence or history of acute or chronic illness, including (but not limited to) liver
             or kidney disease, hypertension, seizures, or any known impairment of endocrine, or
             other specific body-organ dysfunction.

          -  History of serious reaction to any medicine.

          -  Presence or history of malignant disease.

             the first dose of study medication; use of any other prescription or OTC medicine
             (with the exception of acetaminophen (paracetamol)), including dietary supplements or
             herbal remedies, during the 7 days before the dose of study medication.

          -  Consumption of certain foods or beverages before the first dose and throughout the
             study period.

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood or donation of blood, plasma, platelets, or any other
             blood components during the 3 months before the first dose of study medication, or
             unwilling to abstain from doing so during the study and for 3 months after receipt of
             study medication.

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol during the 2 years before the first dose of study
             medication, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly.

          -  Use of tobacco products or nicotine-containing products during the 3 months before the
             first dose of study medication and during the study.

          -  Evidence of drug or alcohol abuse at screening or admission.
