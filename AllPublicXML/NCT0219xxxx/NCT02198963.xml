      This Cumulative Irritation Evaluation is designed to determine the skin irritation potential
      of RUT058-60, after repetitive patch application to abraded and non-abraded skin of healthy
      human subjects. Abraded skin will be challenged because the Test Product may be used, in
      practice, on non-intact skin. The primary research objective in this study is determine the
      skin irritation potential of RUT058-60. This question will be answered based on the observed
      results acquired evaluating its application to the abraded and non-abraded skin of at least
      30 volunteer subjects, on the test product relative to the control readings.

      A sufficient number of subjects will be recruited into the study to ensure 30 subjects,
      including both males and females, complete the study. Prior to the first application of test
      materials, designated skin sites will be abraded using the Tape Stripping Procedure.
      Occlusive patches will be used to apply approximately 0.02 mL of Test Product, Positive
      Control and Negative Control to abraded and non-abraded sites on the skin in the scapular
      region of each subject's back. The irritation potential of the test materials will be
      determined over the course of a 21-day challenge period on at least 30 subjects. A test
      material will be applied to the same site, abraded and non-abraded, on each day for 21 days.
      The six skin sites will be evaluated visually prior to each patch application and following
      the final patch removal.

    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Analysis After a 23-hour Â± 1-hour period of exposure, patches were removed, and the sites evaluated and visually scored for irritancy. The procedures will be repeated on the same test sites an additional twenty times. On each day,mean values, sample sizes, ranges, etc., of the irritation scores, for a total of six configurations, were recorded.
Grading Scale for Visual Evaluation of Skin Condition: 0= no evidence of irritation, 1= minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= erythema and papules, 4= definite edema, 5= erythema, edema, and papules, 6=' vesicular eruption, 7= strong reaction spreading beyond test site Visual observations of 3, 4, or 5 resulted in discontinuance of product application to that site. Observations of 6 or 7 were considered an adverse event and subject discontinued from the study.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Irritation Score of RUT058-60 Hypochlorous Acid Solution (106 mg/L) on Healthy Human Skin</title>
        <description>Primary Analysis After a 23-hour Â± 1-hour period of exposure, patches were removed, and the sites evaluated and visually scored for irritancy. The procedures will be repeated on the same test sites an additional twenty times. On each day,mean values, sample sizes, ranges, etc., of the irritation scores, for a total of six configurations, were recorded.
Grading Scale for Visual Evaluation of Skin Condition: 0= no evidence of irritation, 1= minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= erythema and papules, 4= definite edema, 5= erythema, edema, and papules, 6=' vesicular eruption, 7= strong reaction spreading beyond test site Visual observations of 3, 4, or 5 resulted in discontinuance of product application to that site. Observations of 6 or 7 were considered an adverse event and subject discontinued from the study.</description>
