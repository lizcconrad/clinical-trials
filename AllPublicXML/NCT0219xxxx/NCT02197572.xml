      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of a single dose of 40 mg MLN0128 on
      the electrocardiographic QT/QTc interval in participants with advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0128. MLN0128 is being tested to determine
      the effect of a single 40 mg dose on the electrocardiographic measure of the time between the
      start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of the heart (QT)/rate
      corrected QT (QTc) interval in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will look at
      electrocardiogram (ECG) results before and after a single dose of MLN0128.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. All participants will receive a single 40 mg
      dose of MLN0128 capsules on Day 1. To avoid nausea and vomiting, participants will also be
      administered 0.25 mg palonosetron on Day 1 as an antiemetic agent. Participants may continue
      to receive MLN0128 for up to 1 year at a dose of up to 30 mg once weekly if a clinical
      benefit is being derived.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 14 months. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic
      including and end of study visit 30 to 40 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment. Participants that continue treatment with MLN0128 will continue to make
      additional visits to the clinic once or twice every 4 weeks and the end of study visit 30 to
      40 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
Serious adverse event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by the Investigator.</description>

          8. Manifestations of malabsorption due to prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, GI
             disease, or for an unknown or other reason that may alter the absorption of MLN0128.

             ◦ History of arrhythmia requiring an implantable cardiac defibrillator

         11. Clinically significant comorbidities such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease, active
             central nervous system disease, active infection, serious infection within 14 days
