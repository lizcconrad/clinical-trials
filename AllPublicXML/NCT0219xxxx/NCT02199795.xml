  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot randomized controlled trial which will enroll both subacute (&lt;6 mos)
      and chronic (&gt;6 mos) stroke survivors with ankle dorsiflexion weakness. The subjects will be
      randomized to Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (CCNMES) versus
      control. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of 6-weeks of lower
      extremity CCNMES, applied in an anti-phase application, on motor impairment and functional
      mobility to a control group.

    <measure>Change in Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer (LEFM) Assessment is a measure of lower limb motor impairment. Participants are asked to attempt to perform a list of isolated and simultaneous movements of the hip, knee, and ankle that take into account synergy patterns, isolated strength, coordination, and hypertonia. Each movement attempt is graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0, cannot perform; 1, perform partially; and 2, perform fully) and these subscores are summed to provide a maximum score of 34, minimum score of 0 (i.e., full scale range 0-34).
Higher scores are considered to be a better outcome. For each individual, the score prior to treatment was subtracted from the score at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change scores were averaged.</description>

    <measure>Change in 10-Meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to walk 10 m was measured using a stop-watch. For each individual, the time to walk 10 m prior to treatment was subtracted from the time to walk 10 m at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these changes in time were averaged.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ankle Movement Tracking Error at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle dorsiflexion angle was measured continuously using an electrogoniometer. The subject was seated in front of a computer screen which displayed a 30-sec long sine-wave trace scrolling right to left across the screen. The peak to peak amplitude of the sine wave was set equal to the participant's achievable active range of ankle movement and put on a scale of 0 to 100. Three 30-sec trials were run in which the participant's task was to trace the sine wave by moving their paretic ankle. Error was calculated as the average vertical distance between the sine wave and the ankle angle. The lowest error across three trials was taken as the error for that time point.
Lower errors are considered to be better outcomes.
For each participant, the error prior to treatment was subtracted from the error at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change scores were averaged. A negative change in error scores is considered an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile (MEFAP) at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The MEFAP is a measure of functional ambulation, measuring the time to ambulate through 5 common environmental terrains: 1) 5-meter walk on a hard floor, 2) 5-meter walk on a carpeted floor, 3) rise from a chair, 3-meter walk, return to seated position, 4) standardized obstacle course (bricks to step over), 5) stair ascent and descent. The five times subscores were added to derive a total time.
Lower times are considered to be a better outcome.
For each individual, the MEFAP completion time prior to treatment was subtracted from the MEFAP completion time at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change values were averaged.</description>

    <description>Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (CCNMES): CCNMES uses electrical stimulation to move the weaker ankle up and down. The user will control the stimulation using the other (stronger) ankle. A special sock is worn on the stronger ankle. When the stronger ankle is moved, a signal is sent from a sensor on the sock to the electrical stimulator. The stimulator then sends stimulation to the weaker ankle which causes it to move. Sound and light cues coming from the stimulator will tell the user when to move the stronger ankle and when to relax.</description>

        <title>Change in Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score at End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer (LEFM) Assessment is a measure of lower limb motor impairment. Participants are asked to attempt to perform a list of isolated and simultaneous movements of the hip, knee, and ankle that take into account synergy patterns, isolated strength, coordination, and hypertonia. Each movement attempt is graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0, cannot perform; 1, perform partially; and 2, perform fully) and these subscores are summed to provide a maximum score of 34, minimum score of 0 (i.e., full scale range 0-34).
Higher scores are considered to be a better outcome. For each individual, the score prior to treatment was subtracted from the score at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change scores were averaged.</description>

            <description>Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (CCNMES): CCNMES uses electrical stimulation to move the weaker ankle up and down. The user will control the stimulation using the other (stronger) ankle. A special sock is worn on the stronger ankle. When the stronger ankle is moved, a signal is sent from a sensor on the sock to the electrical stimulator. The stimulator then sends stimulation to the weaker ankle which causes it to move. Sound and light cues coming from the stimulator will tell the user when to move the stronger ankle and when to relax.

        <title>Change in Ankle Movement Tracking Error at End of Treatment</title>
        <description>Ankle dorsiflexion angle was measured continuously using an electrogoniometer. The subject was seated in front of a computer screen which displayed a 30-sec long sine-wave trace scrolling right to left across the screen. The peak to peak amplitude of the sine wave was set equal to the participant's achievable active range of ankle movement and put on a scale of 0 to 100. Three 30-sec trials were run in which the participant's task was to trace the sine wave by moving their paretic ankle. Error was calculated as the average vertical distance between the sine wave and the ankle angle. The lowest error across three trials was taken as the error for that time point.
Lower errors are considered to be better outcomes.
For each participant, the error prior to treatment was subtracted from the error at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change scores were averaged. A negative change in error scores is considered an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in Modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile (MEFAP) at End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The MEFAP is a measure of functional ambulation, measuring the time to ambulate through 5 common environmental terrains: 1) 5-meter walk on a hard floor, 2) 5-meter walk on a carpeted floor, 3) rise from a chair, 3-meter walk, return to seated position, 4) standardized obstacle course (bricks to step over), 5) stair ascent and descent. The five times subscores were added to derive a total time.
Lower times are considered to be a better outcome.
For each individual, the MEFAP completion time prior to treatment was subtracted from the MEFAP completion time at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change values were averaged.</description>
