  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to better understand the social needs of a population seeking care in a large,
      urban children's hospital emergency department with a large Medicaid population. Consenting
      English and Spanish-speaking adult caregivers will be randomized to social screening via a
      face -to-face interview with a trained bilingual researcher or via a self-completed
      tablet-based survey. We hypothesize that there will be no difference in disclosure rates
      between the two screening formats for items other than highly sensitive items. For highly
      sensitive items we hypothesize disclosure rates will be higher for the self-completed
      tablet-based survey.

    <description>Participants randomized to the computer based self-completed survey arm were issued a tablet computer to answer survey questions. All participants were encouraged to ask for technical assistance if needed at any point, and like in the face-to-face interviews, electronic survey could be re-initiated at the point of discontinuation after any interruption. Those in the tablet survey arm also could complete the survey in their preferred language and all were additionally given headsets so they could use audio assist with identical, pre-recorded questions in the selected language.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Face-to-face interview arm</arm_group_label>
    <description>Participants randomized to this condition were interviewed in-person by a fully bilingual (English-Spanish), bi-cultural research assistant trained in cultural humility, standard research protocols and interviewing practices. Interviews were conducted in clinical rooms in respondent's preferred language, were easily interrupted for medical care, and the survey could be re-initiated at the point of discontinuation after any interruption. Participant responses during face-to-face interviews were recorded by the research assistant on paper and later recorded electronically.</description>
