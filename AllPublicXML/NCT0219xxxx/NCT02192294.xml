  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systemic Clearance (CL)</measure>
    <time_frame>96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>CL is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the body.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss)</measure>
    <time_frame>96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state.</description>
