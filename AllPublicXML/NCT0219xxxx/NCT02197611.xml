      Research project for the development, construction and validation of a questionnaire of
      adherence to treatment in adult patients with hemophilia. It aims to build a scale according
      to five relevant dimensions of adherence to treatment: 1) physician-patient relationship, 2)
      knowledge of the disease, 3) previous bleeding problems, 4) knowledge of future consequences
      and difficulties, and 5) benefits of treatment.

      -  Descriptive study for the construction of a multidimensional scale of adherence to
           treatment in adult patients with hemophilia.

        -  Validation of a scale specific measure for patients with hemophilia that includes 5
           dimensions that may affect adherence to treatment: a) the doctor-patient, b) regarding
           knowledge of the disease, c) the previous hemorrhages, d) knowledge future sequels, e)
           difficulties with treatment.

        -  Statistical and psychometric analysis of the adherence questionnaire for adult patients
           with hemophilia.

        -  Description of the theoretical framework that justifies the completion of the
           questionnaire, and the choice of the dimensions and items that make up the measurement
           scale.

        -  The questionnaire obtained in this project will identify the actual degree of patient
           adherence to multidisciplinary treatment, taking as gold standard, compliance with
           pharmacological treatment (the difference between the treatment prescribed and
           consumed).

    <description>The theoretical framework and objectives for the creation of the scale is created. The questionnaire was developed teóricasdel dimensions and items of each dimension are identified. In this testing phase, the pilot is 5 Hematologists physicians experienced in hemophilia (no contact between them) and a sample of the target population (± 12 patients with hemophilia). The structure of this phase include:
Identify and define the theorical framework of customs and attributes.
Identification of behaviors that represent the attribute.
Test design specifications.
Construction of the items.
External judgment by judges
Discussion with the target population
Analysis of item-objective congruence
Analysis of the interview with patients and selection of items
Selection of an initial set of items
Application of the first version and analysis items
Selection of items in accordance with standard psychometric</description>

    <description>This phase is carried out the questionnaire to a pilot sample (± 50 patients with hemophilia) and the choice of format is made. Similarly, an analysis of differential functioning or bias of the items is performed. The structure of this phase include:
Implementation of the final scale
Determination of ground and ceiling effect of the scale
Analysis of the structure of the scale
Identifying relevant dimensions
Calculate the reliability
Determination of the reproducibility
Establishing convergent and discriminant validity</description>

    <description>This phase is carried out applying the scale to a general sample (patient 100-150). After the statistical and convergence and discriminant analysis (other scales) and the study of responsibility (with drug consumption data) will be made. The structure of this phase include:
Selecting one or more external criteria
To establish concurrent validity
Checking empirical hypotheses
Determination of responsiveness
Study interpretability
Design guidelines for the administration and scoring of scales
