          -  Prior to admission of study all volunteers will have given their written informed
             consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the local legislation

          -  Each subject will have his medical history taken and will receive a complete medical
             examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as well as a 12-lead
