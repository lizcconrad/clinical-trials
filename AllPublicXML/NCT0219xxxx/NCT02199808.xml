      Purpose: To examine the effect of the omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio on age-related
      changes in executive functions in children and older adults.

      Participants: Eighty-four typically-developing 7-to 12-year-old children.

      Procedure (methods): Participants and a caregiver will participate in 4 sessions. Three
      sessions will consist of the screening. These sessions will be telephone calls to collect
      24-hour diet information that will be used to determine whether they are eligible for the
      fourth session. Approximately 120 participants will be screened to find 84 participants who
      are eligible for the fourth session, in which participants will complete a series of tests on
      the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) - a touch-screen device that
      provides computerized versions of standardized cognitive tests. They will also complete a
      maze task in which they figure out a path through the maze by walking on the correct squares.
      Brain activity will be recorded using a portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system.

    <measure>Error (count) and latency (in milliseconds) measures from executive function tasks</measure>
    <time_frame>One time with children who are 7-12 years old</time_frame>
    <description>For one specific aim, the omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio will be determined by summing the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid levels in plasma and dividing omega-6 fatty acids by omega-3 fatty acids. The calculated ratio will be used to predict error and latency scores on executive function tasks.
For a second specific aim, the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements will be used to predict the error and latency measures from executive function tasks.</description>

        All participants will be typically-developing, healthy 7-to-12-year-olds who are fluent in
        English. Every effort will be made to recruit roughly equal numbers of boys and girls.
        Recruitment will be conducted irrespective of race and ethnicity. An attempt will be made
        to match the sample to the race and ethnicity of the region: 80% White, 15%
        African-American, and 5% Native American, Asian, and Other descent.
