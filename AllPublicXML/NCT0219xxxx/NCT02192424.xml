  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by progressive
      deterioration in the function of the pancreatic beta-cells, which are the cells that produce
      and secrete insulin (the hormone primarily responsible for the handling of glucose in the
      body). The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether
      intermittent intensive insulin therapy is an effective therapeutic strategy that can preserve
      pancreatic beta-cell function and maintain glycemic control early in the course of type 2
      diabetes.

    <textblock>
      In this study, eligible patients with type 2 diabetes will be randomized to either
      intermittent insulin therapy or not, on a background of metformin, after first undergoing a
      short course of intensive insulin therapy. The hypothesis under study is whether intermittent
      insulin therapy can preserve beta-cell function.

Participants will stop their metformin for 2 weeks every 3 months, during which time they will receive intermittent intensive insulin therapy for 2 weeks. The 2-week course of insulin therapy will be repeated at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-,18- and 21-months, with final outcome measurement performed at 24-months.</description>
