  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study examines the effect of hyaluronidase on the length of time of insulin
      infusion set wear. The aim of the study is to improve the length of time that an infusion set
      can be worn by infusing hyaluronidase directly into the insulin infusion site. The
      investigators will also assess the accuracy of the Dexcom G4 Platinum (G4P) sensors with
      extended sensor wear beyond the 7 day FDA approved time frame.

      The investigators would like to see if the use of hyaluronidase will improve insulin infusion
      set survival and improve the onset of insulin action. The investigators will also assess the
      accuracy of the Dexcom G4P sensors with extended site use beyond the 7 day FDA approved time
      frame.

      The use of sensor information combined with the knowledge of infused insulin from pump
      therapy could potentially help us detect when an infusion set is beginning to fail.
      Information from the sensor function to the point of failure, and sensor function in response
      to Tylenol may allow us to develop special formulas to determine when a sensor is not working
      well. This will be very important for creating an artificial pancreas.

      You are invited to participate in a research study to see if the use of hyaluronidase will
      improve insulin infusion set survival and improve the onset of insulin action. The
      investigators will also assess the accuracy of the Dexcom G4P sensors with extended site use
      beyond the 7 day FDA approved time frame. Eligible subjects are those with type 1 diabetes
      who wear an insulin pump.

      Thirty subjects will be enrolled. Fifteen patients from each of the two sites: Stanford
      University and University of Colorado.

    <time_frame>participants will be followed for 4 weeks as outpatients, including 5 visits to CTRU (prior to enrollment and after each week)</time_frame>
    <description>To generate data sets with sensor and infusion set failure. These data will generate 120 weeks of infusion set data (and we anticipate 72 infusion site failures), and 120 &quot;two week&quot; sensor wears (with an anticipated 72 sensor failures). This will provide sufficient data sets for the initial development of prediction models to detect sensor and infusion set failure to be used in closed-loop artificial pancreas algorithms.</description>

    <description>Once during week 4 at breakfast, we will ask subjects to take acetaminophen in the form of two 500 mg Tylenol Regular Strength tablets and then obtain meter readings at ½ hour, 1 hour, and then 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the Tylenol ingestion. During this time they should not use any data from their Dexcom G4P sensors for diabetes management decisions. Subjects will be given a log to documents their blood glucose values.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate insulin precipitation in infusion site cannulas via DTZ staining</measure>
    <time_frame>After each of the 4 weeks, participants will provide their infusion set catheters for analysis</time_frame>
    <description>We plan to stain insulin infusion set catheter tip with diphenylthiocarbazone (DTZ) to evaluate for insulin precipitation as a potential cause of infusion set failure. DTZ is a chelating ligand that forms photochromic complexes with a variety of metals. It is known to selectively stain pancreatic cells crimson read because of the large amount of zinc in the islets. Catheters will be photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 digital microscope, and photographs of the catheter staining will be analyzed using software for image analysis.</description>

    <description>If assigned to hyaluronidase week, subjects will inject 1 milliliter (ml) Hylenex (150 units/ml) into the catheter hub prior to connecting the insulin infusion set. They will then give a catheter fixed prime of 0.7 cc to clear the infusion set of hyaluronidase. On the morning of day 3 during a Hyaluronidase week, a second dose of 1ml Hylenex (150 units/1ml) will be injected through the catheter hub prior to breakfast using the Duo Infusion Set Tubing. They will then reconnect their pump catheter and give a fixed prime of 0.7 cc to clear the infusion set of hyaluronidase.</description>
