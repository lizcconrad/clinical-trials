      Attention has been focused recently on the development of modalities that can protect healthy
      organs from the harmful effects of radiation applied during different cancer treatment
      schedules. As radiation-induced DNA damage involves oxidative stress, the protective role of
      antioxidants has been tested in different dietary studies. Previous experience by the
      collaborative team of the principal investigator and radiotherapists at the Catholic
      University of Campobasso has shown in a retrospective study that moderate wine consumption
      can reduce the side-effects of radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer. This effect
      was presumably due to the polyphenol non alcoholic fraction of wine, a finding in agreement
      with a cross-over intervention study in adult male volunteers, on protection by
      de-alcoholized red wine from ex vivo radiation-induced DNA damage.

      The purpose of this clinical trial will be to test the impact of supplementation with
      anthocyanin-enriched food on the acute and medium-term side effects of radiotherapy in breast
      cancer patients, in a prospective study design. Therefore a double blind, randomised,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial will be organised by assigning patients with breast cancer
      scheduled for radiotherapy to a diet supplemented with an anthocyanin soluble extract.

      Detailed Description

        1. Study Rationale:

           Attention has been focused recently on the development of modalities that can protect
           healthy organs from the harmful effects of radiation applied during different cancer
           treatment schedules. As radiation-induced DNA and cellular damage involve oxidative
           stress, the protective role of antioxidants will be tested on the toxic condition
           induced by radiotherapy in breast cancer treatment. Consumption of polyphenol-rich
           foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and beverages derived from plants, such as cocoa,
           red wine and tea, may represent a beneficial diet in terms of oxidative protection.
           Indeed, a retrospective study reports that that moderate wine consumption can reduce the
           side-effects of radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer. This effect was
           presumably due to the polyphenol non alcoholic fraction of wine, a finding in agreement
           with a cross-over intervention study in adult male volunteers, on protection by
           de-alcoholized red wine from ex vivo radiation-induced DNA damage. However, there are no
           studies that address the relationship of polyphenol-rich food consumption with the toxic
           effects of radiations in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer treatment.

        2. Aim of the study. The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the association
           between the effect of polyphenol-rich food supplementation and toxicity of radiotherapy
           for breast cancer.

        3. Study design: Randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial with 2 parallel arms:
           soluble corn flour at high content in anthocyanins and placebo. Placebo consists of
           soluble corn flour poor in anthocyanins. The treatment will start one week before
           starting radiotherapy, and continue during all radiotherapy treatment (of 3 or 5 weeks).

        4. Study Population and recruitment: A total of 300 consecutive breast cancer patients
           eligible for radiotherapy. Participants will be identified at the Department of
           Radiotherapy of the Giovanni Paolo II Foundation of Campobasso.

      Eligible subjects will be recruited at their first consultation and subsequently referred to
      the research investigators. The research staff in charge of the recruitment will pre-screen
      participants on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria and will explain the study at this
      time.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must consent to be in the study and must have signed an approved consent
             form conforming with institutional guidelines.

          2. Patients must be â‰¥ 18 years old.

          3. On histological examination, the tumor must be DCIS or invasive carcinoma of the
             breast.

          4. Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy or quadrantectomy. The
             margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (DCIS and
             invasive). Reexcision of surgical margins is permitted.

          5. Patients with invasive breast cancer are required to have axillary staging which can
             include sentinel node biopsy alone (if sentinel node is negative), sentinel node
             biopsy followed by axillary dissection or sampling with a minimum total of 6 axillary
             nodes (if sentinel node is positive), or axillary dissection alone (with a minimum of
             6 axillary nodes). (Axillary staging is not required for patients with DCIS.)

          6. The patient must be randomized within 45 days following the last surgery for breast
             cancer (lumpectomy, re-excision of margins, or axillary staging procedure) or within
             30 days following the last chemotherapy cycle.

          7. Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been
             disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their
             physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are
             eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Axillary nodes with definite evidence of microscopic or macroscopic extracapsular
             extension.

          2. One or more positive non-axillary sentinel node(s). (Note that intramammary nodes are
             staged as axillary nodes.)

          3. Palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or contralateral axillary,
             supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes, unless there is
             histologic confirmation that these nodes are negative for tumor.

          4. Suspicious microcalcifications, densities, or palpable abnormalities (in the
             ipsilateral or contralateral breast) unless biopsied and found to be benign.

          5. Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma.

          6. Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive cancer or DCIS) in more than one quadrant or
             separated by 4 or more centimeters.

          7. Paget's disease of the nipple.

          8. Synchronous bilateral invasive or non-invasive breast cancer.

          9. Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are positive at pathologic
             evaluation. (If surgical margins are rendered free of disease by reexcision, the
             patient is eligible.)

         10. Breast implants. (Patients who have had implants removed are eligible.)

         11. Prior breast or thoracic radiation therapy for any condition.

         12. Collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a creatine phosphokinase
             level above normal or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosus, or
             scleroderma.

         13. Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive
             potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during
             therapy.

         14. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.
