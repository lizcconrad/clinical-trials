  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the impact of a self-directed walking program on post-chemotherapy
      survivors experiencing fatigue. It is hypothesized that the walking program will help lessen
      fatigue.

      The investiagors propose to evaluate the impact of a home-based self-directed walking program
      on post-chemotherapy fatigue among 150 cancer survivors age 65 and older -- Senior Physical
      Activity after Chemotherapy (S-PACT). Participants must have potentially curable cancer,
      moderate to severe fatigue (score of 4 or higher on the Brief Fatigue Inventory), currently
      exercise less than 120 minutes per week and have completed chemotherapy treatment (radiation
      treatment must also be completed if it is part of the patient's treatment plan) within the
      last 6 weeks. The design is a randomized controlled trial, with participants randomized to a
      3-month physical activity program (intervention group) or to wait-list control (this group
      begins the walking program at 3 months post-randomization). The primary objective is to
      compare the change in fatigue scores from baseline to 3 months between the intervention and
      wait-list control groups.

    <description>Walk With Ease is the Arthritis Foundation's evidence-based walking intervention to help with fatigue and pain. The intervention is a self-directed program that helps guide participants in a safe and comfortable paced walking program with an ultimate goal of walking for 30 minutes a day, five days a week.</description>
