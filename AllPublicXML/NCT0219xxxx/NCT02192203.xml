    <textblock>
      This research study is being carried out to determine the possibility that a new medication
      causes allergic reactions. This new medication contains two active ingredients (diclofenac
      and menthol) together in a gel and is being developed to treat mild to moderate pain and
      inflammation, such as acute sport injuries, and sprains and strains. Approximately 240
      participants will have the medication (gel) applied to the skin on a small area of the upper
      back for approximately 48-hour or 72-hour periods over the course of six weeks. Participation
      in this research study is voluntary, requiring participants to visit the study clinic on 17
      occasions for about 45 minutes each visit. During the visits, doctors or trained staff
      members will examine the amount of redness, swelling, and other signs of irritation (if any)
      of the skin where the medication (gel) was applied.

    <time_frame>At least 23 days but not more than 30 days for induction and challenge phases combined</time_frame>
    <description>During the Induction Phase, the test article and three controls will be applied to adjacent treatment sites on the infrascapular area of the back for nine 48-hour patch applications. Evaluation of dermal reactions at the application sites will be conducted clinically using a visual scale that rates the degree of erythema, edema, and other signs of cutaneous irritation at nine intervals spaced approximately 48-72 hours apart. Following the Induction Phase participants will return to the clinic to begin the Challenge Phase after 12 to 14- day rest phase. The Challenge Phase will consist of one 48-hour patch application to a naive site on the opposite side of the back. Evaluations of dermal reactions at the application sites will be conducted clinically during the Challenge Phase using the same visual scale at 30 minutes, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after removal of the challenge patch.</description>

    <measure>Effects on Superficial Layers of the Skin</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 23 days but not more than 30 days for induction and challenge phases combined</time_frame>
    <description>The responses will be assessed using symbol (A-H) and grade (0 -3) scale for each of the four test products: A 0 Slight glazed appearance; C 1 Marked glazing; E 2 Glazing with peeling and cracking; F 3 Glazing with fissures; G 3 Film of dried serous exudate covering all or portion of the patch; H 3 Small petechial erosions and/or scabs</description>

    <measure>Response notation</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 23 days but not more than 30 days for induction and challenge phases combined</time_frame>
    <description>Notations will be made in place of a score to designate particular circumstances preventing the assignment of a score or in addition to a score to identify damage to the epidermis and/or spreading of a reaction beyond the patch site.S: Spreading of reaction beyond patch study site (i.e., reaction where study material was not in contact with the skin); B: Burning or stinging sensation; P: Papular response &gt;50%; Pv: Papulovesicular response &gt;50%; D: Damage to epidermis: oozing, crusting and/or superficial erosions; I; Itching; X: absent Subject absent; PD: Patch dislodged; NA Not applied; NP: Not patched (due to reaction achieved); N9G: No ninth grading</description>
