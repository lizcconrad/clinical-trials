        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subjects to be enrolled are healthy volunteers, defined as follows:

          -  Having given informed consent and signed the form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious disorder that might interfere with his/her participation in this study and
             the evaluation of the safety of the test drug (e.g. renal insufficiency, hepatic
             dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, hypervitaminosis A, psychic disorder etc.).

          -  Treatment with other drug that might interfere with the evaluation of the safety of
             the test drug

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the study drug

          -  Pregnancy, lactation, women of childbearing potential who do not use an established
             contraceptive

          -  Drug and alcohol abuse

          -  Participation in another trial

          -  Known abnormal values of the laboratory tests (if detected after enrolment, subjects
             will continue the treatment provided there are not medical objections)

          -  Specific dietary requirements that do not allow the volunteers to meet the dietary
             guidelines set out for this study
