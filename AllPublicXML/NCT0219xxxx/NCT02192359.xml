      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of carboxylesterase-expressing
      allogeneic neural stem cells when given together with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating
      patients with high-grade gliomas that have come back. Placing genetically modified neural
      stem cells into brain tumor cells may make the tumor more sensitive to irinotecan
      hydrochloride. Irinotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural
      stem cells and irinotecan hydrochloride may be a better treatment for high-grade gliomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the recommended phase II doses (RP2D) of intracranially administered hCE1m6-NSCs
      (carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells) in combination with intravenous
      irinotecan in patients with recurrent high grade glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the relationship between hCE1m6-NSC dose and SN-38 (liposomal SN-38)
      concentrations in brain interstitium.

      II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of
      irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) and SN-38.

      III. To investigate the biologic activity of hCE1m6 NSCs by comparing SN-38 concentrations in
      the brain after treatment with hCE1m6-NSCs and irinotecan versus irinotecan alone.

      IV. To assess for possible development of adenovirally transduced neural stem cell (NSC)
      immunogenicity after first exposure and with repeat doses of NSCs.

      V. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete
      response) in patients who receive treatment with repeat cycles of NSCs and irinotecan.

      VI. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural
      stem cells.

      Patients receive carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells intracranially over
      1.5-4.5 hours on days 1 and 15 (day 1 only for patients at dose level 1) and irinotecan
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 3 and 17. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months and then
      annually thereafter for 15 years.
