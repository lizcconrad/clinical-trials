  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, 2-part study in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (EGFRm+) non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC), who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) agent.

      Part A will assess the effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of AZD9291
      and metabolites AZ5104 and AZ7550 following multiple oral dosing of both rifampicin and
      AZD9291 in a fasted state.

      Part B will allow patients further access to AZD9291 after the PK phase (Part A) and will
      provide for additional safety data collection. All patients who complete Part A will be able
      to enter part B, and continue to receive AZD9291 80 mg once daily until: disease progression;
      they are no longer deriving clinical benefit; or any other reason.

        TKI sensitivity (including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q).

      <recruitment_details>First patient enrolled: 04 December 2014; Last Subject Last Visit Part A: 09 July 2015 and Part B: 29 June 2016. Study performed at 18 sites across Asia, North America and Western Europe. Part A assessed effect of multiple doses of rifampicin on PK of AZD9291; Part B allowed subjects further access to AZD9291 and provided additional safety data.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>51 patients were enrolled (signed informed consent). Patients were assigned to treatment if they met all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. 10 subjects were enrolled but failed inclusion/exclusion criteria and so were not eligible to be assigned treatment. The remaining 41 patients started Period 1 and received treatment.</pre_assignment_details>
