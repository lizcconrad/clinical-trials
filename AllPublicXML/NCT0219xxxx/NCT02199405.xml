  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cervical spondylosis on young people is increasing every year. Suffering
      from this disease will affect the normal life and learning of young people. Episode younger
      and incidence higher of this disease could increase health care spending of the government in
      the economy. Cervical spondylosis of cervical type is the main type of cervical spondylosis
      of young people. Patients of cervical spondylosis of cervical type always manifest the head,
      neck and shoulder pain accompanied by corresponding pressure point, the X-ray display of
      Upper cervical curvature change and instability of intervertebral joint performance ,and the
      dynamic lateral X-ray shows vertebral instability or trapezoidal change. The conservative
      treatment is the primary and preferred treatment of the disease.

      This study is designed as a random, control, single blind study. It will recruit 140 cases of
      cervical spondylosis of cervical type. Both the treatment group and the control group will be
      randomly assigned 70 cases. Patients in the treatment group will be treated by Massage of
      chiropractic and adjusting cervical curvature and practice Sishi Daoyin for 4 weeksï¼Œand the
      control group by conventional massage and cervical traction. The total study includes 2 views
      that are baseline and post-4week intervention. At all of the 2 views, all participants will
      be examined range of motion of cervical vertebra, cervical curvature, and Surface
      Electromyography of neck muscles, and will be estimated scores of The Neck Disability
      Index(NDI), the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ),Short-form McGill Pain
      Questionnaire(SF-MPQ) and Evaluation of the therapeutic effect. This study aims to
      investigate the efficacy of Massage of chiropractic and adjusting cervical curvature and
      Sishi Daoyin practice, and discover the correlation between these scales and these objective
      indicators to discover the indicators of early warning signs of cervical spondylosis of
      cervical type of young people.

      Quality control: The study site and all researchers must comply with the required
      qualifications. All researchers must be trained before the study. The study will take a
      number of measures to ensure the recruitment of the required sample size, and compliance of
      intervention providers and participants.
