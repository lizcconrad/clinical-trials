      • Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Pain assessment calculated as the area under the curve of VAS
      pain intensity scores through 48 hours.

      • Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

        1. Consumption of diclofenac (Day 1-2) via Intramuscular Injection (IM injection).

        2. Time from the end of operation to the first IM injection diclofenac dose

        3. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

        4. Patient satisfaction.

             non-opioid pain medications more than 5 times per week.

          9. Use of any long-acting opioid medication within 3 days of surgery or any opioid
             medication within 24 hours of surgery.
