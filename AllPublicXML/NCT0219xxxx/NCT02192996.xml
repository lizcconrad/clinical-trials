    <textblock>
      This pilot trial is designed to investigate the benefits of the use of probiotics in GUT
      microbiota development and/or immunological biomarkers and how this can be related with the
      clinical status of very low birth weight preterms during their first weeks of life at the
      neonatal intensive care unit(NICU).

      This pilot trial is designed to investigate the benefits of the use of mixtures of probiotics
      isolated from human milk in GUT microbiota development and/or immunological biomarkers.
      Furthermore, the relationship between evaluated parameters and the clinical status of very
      low birth weight preterms during their first weeks of life at the NICU will be analysed.

    <description>Five very low birth weight (VLBW) infants enrolled within 2 days of birth, with a weight &lt; 1300 g and gestational age &lt; 29 weeks and without any malformation or metabolic disease at birth were supplemented with two daily doses of a mixture of &quot;Bifidobacterium breve&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus salivarius&quot; , probiotic strains isolated from human milk during their first weeks of life. The lyophilized powder has contained at least 1x10^9 colony forming units (CFU) per doses of each one of the probiotic bacteria.</description>
