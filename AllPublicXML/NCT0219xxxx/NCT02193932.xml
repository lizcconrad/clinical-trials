    <textblock>
      A prospective exploratory study in patients with drug resistant epilepsy with a target
      comparison of long term outcome. NeuroScan software modules and a MagLink will be used to
      acquire EEG in combination with MRI/fMRI data. The MagLink system is used for obtaining
      integrated EEG and Event Related Potential (ERP) recordings while the subject is inside the
      MRI machine, without compromising the raw EEG data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Refractory epilepsy cases, referred by the service of Neurology. These are cases whose
             pathophysiology is resistant to treatment, including change in medication and or added
             medication.

          2. Patients will be included if they agree to sign an Institutional Review Board approved
             written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with overt symptoms or signs of anxiety than cannot cooperate during the
             recording inside the scanner, unless consent is given for the procedure to be
             performed with sedation by the anesthesia department.

          2. Patients who meet the regular exclusion criteria for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
             studies per the prescreening form reviewed with all patients prior to exams
