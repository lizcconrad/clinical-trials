    <measure>Change in Centrally Read Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score From Baseline to Week 12 Using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of TD over time. The AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. AIMS was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, and extremity and truncal dyskinesia. Severity ratings were from 0 (none) to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0 (no orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia) to 28 (severe orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.
A MMRM analysis with change from baseline in AIMS score as dependent variable was used. The model included fixed effects for treatment, time point, treatment-by-time point interaction, DRA status, and baseline AIMS as a covariate. An unstructured covariance model was used.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Are a Treatment Success at Week 12 as Assessed by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC is a single-item questionnaire that asks the investigator to assess a patient's TD symptoms at specific visits after initiating therapy. The CGIC uses a 7 point Likert Scale, ranging from very much worse (-3) to very much improved (+3), to assess overall response to therapy. A treatment success was defined as &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; at the week 12 visit. Patients whose status at week 12 was not known, as well as patients who were not &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; at the week 12 visit, were considered treatment failures.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Modified Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (CDQ-24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline), Week 12 with last observation carried forward</time_frame>
    <description>The CDQ-24 is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in patients with craniocervical dystonia, including both cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BPS). The CDQ 24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality of life. The following domains are evaluated in the CDQ-24: stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/family life. Each of the 24 questions were rated by patients on a scale of 0=no impairment to 4=severest impairment for a total scale of 0 (no impairment) to 96 (severe impairment). Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Adverse Events for the Overall Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator and includes possibly, probably and definitely related categories. Serious AEs (SAE) include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

A negative percent change from baseline score indicates improvement.
The MMRM model includes fixed effects for treatment, time point (weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, 12), treatment-by-time point interaction, DRA status, and baseline AIMS as a covariate. Patient is a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative Percentage of Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Responders by Response Level (Percentage Improvement From Baseline) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Response level represents the % improvement in AIMS from baseline. AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of TD over time. The AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. AIMS was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, and extremity and truncal dyskinesia. Severity ratings were from 0 (none) to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0 (no orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia) to 28 (severe orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia).
Patients with a missing AIMS score were considered to be AIMS nonresponders.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>202 patients were screened and gave informed consent to enter the study. 85 were either ineligible for entry into the study or declined study participation. The most common reason for ineligibility (49 patients) was insufficient TD severity as assessed with Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). 117 patients were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>SD-809</title>
          <description>Patients underwent dose adjustment of SD-809 over the initial 6 weeks of treatment, starting treatment with SD-809 at 6 mg twice daily and titrating to a maximum total daily dose of 48 mg per day. The optimal dose was continued by a 6-week maintenance period, which was followed by a 1-week washout.
Patients who completed the study had the option to rollover into a long-term safety study (Study SD-809-C-20, NCT02198794). For patients who did not enter the long-term safety study, there was an additional 3-week safety follow-up period after treatment.</description>

The CDQ 24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality of life. Each of the 24 questions was rated by patients on a scale of 0=no impairment to 4=severest impairment for a total scale of 0 (no impairment) to 96 (severe impairment).</description>

        <title>Change in Centrally Read Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score From Baseline to Week 12 Using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis</title>
        <description>AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of TD over time. The AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. AIMS was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, and extremity and truncal dyskinesia. Severity ratings were from 0 (none) to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0 (no orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia) to 28 (severe orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.
A MMRM analysis with change from baseline in AIMS score as dependent variable was used. The model included fixed effects for treatment, time point, treatment-by-time point interaction, DRA status, and baseline AIMS as a covariate. An unstructured covariance model was used.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
        <population>The Modified ITT (mITT) Population was defined as all patients in the ITT Population who received study drug and had at least 1 centrally read post-baseline assessment of the AIMS from at least 1 scheduled post-baseline time point. Number analyzed includes participants who had week 12 readings minus one placebo patient missing a baseline reading.</population>

          <title>Change in Centrally Read Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score From Baseline to Week 12 Using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis</title>
          <description>AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of TD over time. The AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. AIMS was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, and extremity and truncal dyskinesia. Severity ratings were from 0 (none) to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0 (no orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia) to 28 (severe orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.
A MMRM analysis with change from baseline in AIMS score as dependent variable was used. The model included fixed effects for treatment, time point, treatment-by-time point interaction, DRA status, and baseline AIMS as a covariate. An unstructured covariance model was used.</description>
          <population>The Modified ITT (mITT) Population was defined as all patients in the ITT Population who received study drug and had at least 1 centrally read post-baseline assessment of the AIMS from at least 1 scheduled post-baseline time point. Number analyzed includes participants who had week 12 readings minus one placebo patient missing a baseline reading.</population>

        <description>The CGIC is a single-item questionnaire that asks the investigator to assess a patient’s TD symptoms at specific visits after initiating therapy. The CGIC uses a 7 point Likert Scale, ranging from very much worse (–3) to very much improved (+3), to assess overall response to therapy. A treatment success was defined as “much improved” or “very much improved” at the week 12 visit. Patients whose status at week 12 was not known, as well as patients who were not “much improved” or “very much improved” at the week 12 visit, were considered treatment failures.</description>

        <description>The CDQ-24 is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in patients with craniocervical dystonia, including both cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BPS). The CDQ 24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality of life. The following domains are evaluated in the CDQ-24: stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/family life. Each of the 24 questions were rated by patients on a scale of 0=no impairment to 4=severest impairment for a total scale of 0 (no impairment) to 96 (severe impairment). Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Centrally Read Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score From Baseline to Week 12 Using MMRM Analysis</title>
        <description>AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of TD over time. The AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. AIMS was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, and extremity and truncal dyskinesia. Severity ratings were from 0 (none) to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0 (no orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia) to 28 (severe orofacial, truncal, and extremity dyskinesia). A negative percent change from baseline score indicates improvement.
The MMRM model includes fixed effects for treatment, time point (weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, 12), treatment-by-time point interaction, DRA status, and baseline AIMS as a covariate. Patient is a random effect.</description>

A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.
A MMRM analysis with change from baseline in AIMS score as dependent variable was used. The model included fixed effects for treatment, time point (weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12), treatment-by-time point interaction, DRA status, and baseline AIMS as a covariate.</description>

          <description>Patients underwent dose adjustment of SD-809 over the initial 6 weeks of treatment, starting treatment with SD-809 at 6 mg twice daily and titrating to a maximum total daily dose of 48 mg per day. The optimal dose was continued by a 6-week maintenance period, which was followed by a 1-week washout.
Patients who completed the study had the option to rollover into a long-term safety study (Study SD-809-C-20, NCT02198794). For patients who did not enter the long-term safety study, there was an additional 3-week safety follow-up period after treatment.</description>
