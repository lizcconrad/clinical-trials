    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some people have cancers that don't respond to standard treatments. In these cases, doctors
      may try to use drugs to slow the growth of the cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and efficacy of the drug combination of ganetespib and ziv-aflibercept.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18 and over with advanced cancer of the colon, lung, urinary tract, and
      sarcomas.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, blood tests, and scans to measure
           their tumors.

        -  Participants will have one or two eye exams, with dilating eye drops.

        -  Participants will get the study drugs at the clinic as an infusion in a vein. Ganetespib
           will be given once a week on the same day for 3 weeks in a row, followed by a 1-week
           rest period. Ziv-aflibercept will be given once every other week. The drugs will be
           given in 28-day cycles.

        -  Participants may have a small piece of their tumor collected once or twice. This is done
           using a small needle during computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
           or ultrasound scan.

        -  Participants will have their blood pressure checked at each visit. They will check it at
           home every day of the study.

        -  Participants may have one or more whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scans
           with 89Zr-panitumumab. A small amount of a radioactive chemical will be injected through
           a tube in an arm. Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the
           donut-shaped PET scanner. They will have small amounts of blood drawn.

        -  Participants may stay in the study as long as they are tolerating the drugs and their
           tumor is not getting worse.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Ganetespib is a non-geldamycin synthetic inhibitor of Hsp90 that has demonstrated
           activity against multiple cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts in preclinical models.
           Inhibiting the Hsp90 chaperone complex results in the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases,
           polyubiquination, and proteosomal degradation of Hsp90 client proteins, including
           transcription factors and proteins involved in angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth
           factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), hypoxia-inducible
           factor 1 (HIF-1), signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 3 (STAT-3);
           growth factor independence rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF), epidermal growth
           factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), insulin-like
           growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR); resistance to anti-growth signals cyclin-dependent
           kinase 4 (CDK4); tissue invasion and metastases mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor
           (MET), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2); and avoidance of apoptosis protein kinase B
           (AKT), rat insulin promoter (RIP), Survivin, B cell lymphoma (Bcl-2).

        -  HIF-1-alpha activation has been implicated in mediating resistance to anti-angiogenic
           therapy; recent evidence implicates a greater role for Hsp90 in direct modulation of
           VEGF signaling.

        -  Combining Hsp90 inhibition with ganetespib and anti-angiogenic therapy with
           Ziv-Aflibercept, a soluble fusion protein with high binding affinity for vascular
           endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B), and
           placenta growth factor (PIGF), presents a rational novel strategy for improving upon and
           overcoming resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      - To establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination
      of ganetespib and Ziv-Aflibercept in patients with refractory gastrointestinal carcinomas,
      non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, and sarcomas

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To assess modulation of HIF-1-alpha as a pharmacodynamic marker of therapy with the
           combination of ganetespib and Ziv-Aflibercept

        -  To assess modulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression using
           89Zr-labeled, EGFR-targeting antibody panitumumab positron emission tomography
           (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging of tumor lesions prior to and following treatment
           with study drugs

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic gastrointestinal carcinomas,
           non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, and sarcomas with
           disease progression after at least one line of standard therapy

        -  Participants in the expansion phase must demonstrate EGFR expression on archival tumor
           samples and have disease amenable to biopsy with willingness to undergo pre- and
           post-treatment biopsies

        -  No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment, no radiation or chemotherapy
           within 3 weeks prior to enrollment; patients must have recovered from toxicities of
           prior therapies to at least eligibility levels prior to enrollment.

      STUDY DESIGN:

        -  Ganetespib will be administered intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day
           cycle. Ziv-Aflibercept will be administered intravenously every 2 weeks, on days 1 and
           15, during a 28-day cycle.

        -  The escalation portion of the trial will follow a standard 3+3 design, whereby patients
           are dose-escalated in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting toxicity is observed.

        -  Once the MTD is established, 10 additional patients will be enrolled to the expansion
           phase, at the MTD, and tumor biopsies will be obtained to assess pharmacodynamic
           endpoints. During cycle 1 of the expansion phase, ganetespib will be administered
           intravenously weekly, on days 8 and 15 with omission of day 1 treatment to accommodate a
           baseline biopsy pre-ganetespib but after administration of Ziv-Aflibercept. For all
           subsequent cycles, ganetespib will be administered days 1, 8, and 15. Ziv-Aflibercept
           will still be administered intravenously every 2 weeks, on days 1 and 15, of a 28-day
           cycle.

        -  PET/CT imaging with 89Zr-labeled panitumumab will be performed to evaluate tumor
           distribution prior to and following treatment with study agents.

        Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 msec on electrocardiogram (by Bazett's; average of
        triplicate recordings at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) will exclude
        patients from entry on study. Medications that are known to cause QTc interval prolongation
        are prohibited for patients entering on trial. Patients for whom a given medication that
        may cause QTc interval prolongation cannot be discontinued, may be eligible at the
        discretion of the study PI, provided QTc interval criteria is met at enrollment. A
        comprehensive list of agents with the potential to cause QTc prolongation can be found in
        Appendix C and at http://crediblemeds.org.

        effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown.

        Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy
        are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ganetespib
        and zivaflibercept. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections
        when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
        patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

        Substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) or cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19):

          -  Preliminary results of a clinical drug-drug interaction study, examining the effect of
             ganetespib on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2C19-sensitive probe omeprazole, show a
             modest (20%) increase in omeprazole exposure when coadministered with ganetespib.

          -  In vitro data implies expectation of greater interaction with CYP2C19 substrates than
             with CYP3A4 substrates.

          -  Caution is advised when sensitive narrow therapeutic range CYP3A4 or CYP2C19
             substrates are concomitantly administered.

        Inhibitors of P-Glycoprotein Efflux Transporters: Concomitant medications that are strong
        inhibitors of P-glycoprotein efflux transporters should be used with caution during the
        study; examples of these medications include:

        Concurrent anticoagulation will be permitted providing the patient is receiving a stable
        dose of anticoagulants before study entry. Patients receiving anticoagulants will be
        eligible for this trial. Evidence of clinically significant bleeding diathesis or
        underlying coagulopathy (e.g., INR &gt; 1.5 without vitamin K antagonist therapy) will not be
        permitted.

Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated. Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to adverse event (AE). AEs were considered possibly attributable to both study drugs, except where otherwise noted.

        <description>To determine whether the combination of ganetespib and ziv-aflibercept modulated intratumoral Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-alpha expression, tumor biopsies were to be analyzed for change in HIF-1-alpha expression by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Paired pre-and post-combination treatment samples were to be compared for qualitative changes in levels of HIF-1- alpha expression. Cores were to be normalized against the percentage of tumor within the sample.</description>
