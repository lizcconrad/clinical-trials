  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aims of this project are to 1) determine the quality of life effects and safety
      of a combination herbal galactagogue tea in lactating women, and 2) measure changes in
      maternal blood concentration of oxytocin, prolactin, and milk production. The defined outcome
      measures will include quality of life measures and safety parameters in the breastfeeding
      woman and basic infant health. If the tea proves safe and effective, then it can provide a
      proven all-natural and organic supplement for increasing lactation in women. This in turn
      will increase quality of life for both the infant and the mother.

    <textblock>
      In order to establish the quality of life and safety effects of combination herbal
      galactagogue tea in lactating women, a randomized controlled trial of combination herbal
      galactagogue tea vs. placebo is being undertaken in 120 fully lactating women beginning at
      2-12 weeks postpartum for four weeks. Women will be randomized to one of two teas:
      combination herbal galactagogue tea vs. an herbal placebo tea. The study duration will be 4
      weeks total beginning in the second to twelfth week postpartum, with follow up phone calls at
      postpartum months 3, 6, 9 and 12, to ascertain if the mother is continuing to breastfeed.
      During the 4-week study, participants and their infants will have three scheduled outpatient
      visits to the Medical University of South Carolina or an affiliated study center: one visit
      at 2-12 weeks postpartum, a second visit at 4-14 weeks postpartum, and a final visit at 6-16
      weeks postpartum. The first visit, will include watching a video on how to correctly steep
      the tea and then brewing tea in the presence of the study coordinator, in addition to the
      procedures listed below. This initial visit will last approximately 90 minutes. Each
      subsequent visit will take less than 60 minutes for a maternal blood drawing, pumping a
      breast milk sample, answering questionnaires, and both weighing and measuring the infant.
      Study participants will be given a study journal to be completed with the number of cups of
      tea they drink every day and to document an assessment of how they felt throughout the day
      both physically and emotionally. All participants will receive telephone calls/texts,
      depending on the study participants preferred method of communication. This will be done by a
      Study Coordinator at the end of weeks 1 and 3 of the study in order to ensure safety and to
      remind them to complete their journals. This call will also be an opportunity to assess if
      the participant is in need of additional dietetic or lactation support by the team
      professionals or if she is having any difficulty brewing her tea. At the last study visit,
      participants will be asked to call and report any adverse events for 3 months after the end
      of their time on the active study.

      Post Active-Study Communication: After the active-study, the Study Coordinators will call
      each study participant when their infants are 3, 6, 9 and 12 months old, if applicable in
      order to record the number of months that she continues to fully or partially breastfeed.

    <description>To determine quality of life, the following measurement tools will be utilized during each of their 3 study visits:
The Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons et al. 1985; Pavot, Diener et al. 1991; Pavot and Diener 1993; Shevlin, Brunsden et al. 1998)—an overall global life satisfaction questionnaire.
World Health Organization's World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief Survey [WHOQOL-BREF] (WHO 1997; Skevington, Lotfy et al. 2004)—Current perception of position in life in context of personal culture and value systems.
Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Inventory:(Murray and Carothers 1990)—a postpartum depression screen
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) (Spielberger, Gorsuch et al. 1970; Ramanaiah, Franzen et al. 1983; Spielberger and Vagg 1984) —differentiates between temporary or emotional state anxiety versus long standing personality trait anxiety in adults.</description>

    <description>Safety is measured at each of the three assessments, during the first month of the 4 week active study. It is also monitored on a daily basis through self-report in the daily journal writings by the participant. Possible adverse events: allergic reactions; maple-smell in body fluids; bloating, aggravation of asthma, dizziness, rhinorrhea, facial angioedema, and bleeding.</description>
