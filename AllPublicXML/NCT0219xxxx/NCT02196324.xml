    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether or not VPD-737, an NK1 receptor
      antagonist is safe and effective for treatment of prurigo nodularis versus placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sensation of itch is transmitted to the brain through the nervous system. Several
      chemicals are involved in transmitting this signal.This trial of VPD 737 is intended to treat
      this condition by blocking one of the chemicals involved in the transmission of the itch
      signal. This is an oral drug administered once daily It has been used in other trials and has
      shown to be safe at the doses used in this trial. The trial will involve once daily pills for
      8 weeks. Subject will be asked to fill out questionnaires both electronically and on paper
      during the study period. Patients will also be monitored for safety and will have blood taken
      for testing and several points during the trial. Overall participation will last about 14
      weeks
