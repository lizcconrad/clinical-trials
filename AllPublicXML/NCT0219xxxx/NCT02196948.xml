    <textblock>
      Therapeutic management of supraspinatus tendinopathy is conflicting. There is evidence that
      eccentric exercise protocols can be effective for this condition. The inclusion of other
      therapeutic modalities could help to the management of these patients. A new therapeutic
      approach, called Electrolysis Percutaneous Therapeutic (EPTE) has been clinically developed.
      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of the
      inclusion of EPTE into a eccentric exercise protocol for the management of patients with
      unilateral supraspinatus tendinopathy

    <description>Electrolysis Percutaneous Therapeutic (EPTE) consists of the application of a galvanic electrical current with an acupuncture needle in the soft tissue, in this case the supraspinatus tendon, to initiate a local inflammatory process allowing phagocytosis and repair of the affected tissue. The technique is pain-free since the electrical intensity is adapted to each patient. In addition, patients will be asked to perform an eccentric loading exercise program for the shoulder musculature, particularly the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, to be performed on an individual basis twice every day. The therapeutic protocol will be applied for 4 weeks.</description>
