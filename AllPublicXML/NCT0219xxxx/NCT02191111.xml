    <textblock>
      Background: Despite evidence of benefit for pharmacist involvement in chronic disease
      management, the provision of these services in community pharmacy has been suboptimal. The
      Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework suggests
      that for knowledge translation to be effective, there must be evidence of benefit, a context
      conducive to implementation, and facilitation to support uptake. We hypothesize that while
      the evidence and context components of this framework are satisfied, that uptake into
      practice has been insufficient because of a lack of facilitation. This protocol describes the
      rationale and methods of a feasibility study to test a facilitated pharmacy practice
      intervention based on the PARiHS framework, to assist community pharmacists in increasing the
      number of formal and documented medication management services completed for patients with
      diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

      Methods: A cluster-randomized before-after design will compare ten pharmacies from within a
      single organization, with the unit of randomization being the pharmacy. Pharmacies will be
      randomized to facilitated intervention based on the PARiHS framework or usual practice. The
      Alberta Context Tool will be used to establish the context of practice in each pharmacy.
      Pharmacies randomized to the intervention will receive task-focused facilitation from an
      external facilitator, with the goal of developing alternative team processes to allow the
      greater provision of medication management services for patients with diabetes, hypertension,
      and dyslipidemia. The primary outcome will be a process evaluation of the needs of community
      pharmacies to provide more clinical services, the acceptability and uptake of modifications
      made, and the willingness of pharmacies to participate. Secondary outcomes will include the
      change in the number of formal and documented medication management services in the
      aforementioned chronic conditions provided 6 months before, versus after, the intervention
      between the two groups, and identification of feasible quantitative outcomes for evaluating
      the effect of the intervention on patient care outcomes.

      Results: To date, the study has identified and enrolled the ten pharmacies required and
      initiated the intervention process.

      Conclusion: This study will be the first to examine the role of facilitation in pharmacy
      practice, with the goal of scalable and sustainable practice change.

    <description>A process evaluation is intended to evaluate the quality of the implementation of the intervention (i.e. the task-focused facilitation) and the contextual factors associated with variations across the study sites. This will be measured using the Alberta Context Tool, interviews with staff of intervention sites, facilitator field notes, and facilitation evaluation interviews with the pharmacy staff at the close of the study.</description>

    <description>With the ultimate goal of improving patient care, this study also aims to identify feasible clinical outcomes for collection and analysis, including changes in clinical measures specific to diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia management as recorded on applicable patients' follow-up documentation. Pharmacy staff and management will be consulted to determine if additional outcomes can be reasonably collected and are relevant for clinical and/or administrative purposes.</description>
