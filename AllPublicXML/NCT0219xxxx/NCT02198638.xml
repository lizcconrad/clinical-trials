  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital acquired influenza is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in
      hospitalized patients notably elderly patients. Vaccination of HCW is recommended to prevent
      influenza transmission in healthcare setting.

      Outbreaks of hospital acquired influenza were reported in stays with high vaccine coverage in
      patients (higher than 85%). It is necessary to underline that an adequate vaccine cover in
      the elderly population will not necessarily result in a total control of the incidence.
      Consequently, the prevention of influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population must also
      include the reduction of the exposure to the influenza viruses, in particular thanks to the
      vaccination of HCW.

      A pilote case-control study, implemented in Edouard Herriot hospital (at Lyon University
      hospitals), indicates that a shielding effect of more than 35% of vaccinated HCW on hospital
      acquired influenza among patients (Bénet et al.; BMC Infectious Diseases 2012). The results
      suggest a protective effect but investigations, carried out on a more important sample are
      needed to validate the benefit of HCW vaccination.

      The aim of this prospective multicentric cohort study is to estimate incidence of influenza
      among hospitalized patients according to % of influenza vaccination of HCW in short stay
      units.

    <description>Study participation was proposed to each patient who presented ILI (influenza like illness) at admission or during hospitalization. ILI was defined as fever &gt;37.8°C or cough or sore throat. Vaccination against influenza during the ILI season was collected by oral interview. After the interview, a nasal swab was performed by a research assistant and influenza virus infection was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on viral cultures.</description>
