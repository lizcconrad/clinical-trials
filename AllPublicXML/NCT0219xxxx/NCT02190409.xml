  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of (Platelet Rich Fibrin) PRF
      application on implant osseointegration in the early phase of healing.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives:Achieving accelerated implant osseointegration could provide immediate or early
      loading of implants. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is widely used to accelerate soft and hard
      tissue healing. Activated platelets in PRF release growth factors resulting in cellular
      proliferation, collagen synthesis and osteoid production. The aim of this study was to
      compare the stability of dental implants inserted with one-stage surgical protocol with or
      without PRF application.

      Design: Non-randomized, Active Controlled Trial. Material and Methods: Twenty healthy
      patients (n=10 test group, n= control group) with adequate alveolar bone, having 2 or more
      adjacent missing teeth, extracted at least 6 months ago were included in this study. Minimum
      two tapered implants (Ankylosis, DentsplyFriadent) were placed to each patient. After
      surgical preparation of implant sockets, PRF that was prepared preoperatively was placed
      randomly to one of the sockets (PRF+). Acellular plasma portion of PRF was used to wet the
      implant placed into the PRF-coated socket. Resonance frequency measurements were made by
      Osstell ISQ after placement of implants, at 1 week and one month postoperatively.

    <description>The stability of the implants were evaluated with the resonance frequency analysis (RFA) method. The measurements were carried out with Osstell ISQ (Implant Stability Quotient) (Osstell, Göteborg, Sweden) by connecting the transducer (smartpeg) to the implant. Two mesio-distal and bucco-lingual measurements were recorded and mean ISQ values were calculated. The resonance frequency measurements were repeated at first and fourth weeks.</description>

Acellular plasma portion of PRF was used to wet the implant placed into the PRF-coated socket Control: Other socket was selected as a control group (No Platelet Rich Fibrin used): In the control group no extra intervention used and the conventional procedure was done. Thus the readings of the experimental arm compared with this control.</description>
