        Inclusion Criteria:

             informed consent

          -  Established diagnosis of PBC according to the EASL criteria (European Association for
             the Study of the Liver 2009): A diagnosis of PBC can be made with confidence in adult
             patients with otherwise unexplained elevation of ALP and presence of
             anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA≥1:40), and/or AMA type M2. A liver biopsy is not
             essential for the diagnosis of PBC in these patients, but allows activity and stage of
             the disease to be assessed.

          -  Having a screening ALP serum level between 1.67 and 5x ULN inclusive.

          -  Be on a stable dose of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 12-20 mg/kg/day for at least 3
             months prior to Screening or intolerant of UDCA in the opinion of the investigator (no
             UDCA for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening).

             child during the study. Female subjects (of childbearing potential) must be willing to
             use two medically accepted forms of contraception throughout the study and must be

             accepted contraception methods with their partners throughout the study as described
             above, unless they have had a prior vasectomy.
