  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clarify whether the matching acupoints are more effective
      than a single point by electro-acupuncture in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea
      and vomiting .

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>choose single point: Neiguan(PC6).Neiguan(PC6): On the anterior aspect of the forearm,between the tendons of the palmaris longus and the flexor carpi radialis, 2 B-cun proximal to the palmar wrist crease.Manipulating until achieving a &quot;de Qi&quot; sensation, then the needle is connected through a electro-acupuncture apparatus,the positive pole is linked to the needle, and the reference pole is located near the acupoint about 1cm with a paster. Frequency 10Hz,the intensity of stimulation is adjusted according to the patient's tolerance, and the electric current is less than 10mA. The operation lasts for 30 min. The treatment is scheduled to occur within 30min-60min before chemotherapy infusion for 4 days.</description>

    <description>choose another single point Zhongwan（CV12）. Zhongwan(CV12): On the upper abdomen, 4 B-cun superior to the centre of the umbilicus, on the anterior median line. Manipulating until achieving a &quot;de Qi&quot; sensation, then the needle is connected through a electro-acupuncture apparatus,the positive pole is linked to the needle, and the reference pole is located near the acupoint about 1cm with a paster. Frequency 10Hz,the intensity of stimulation is adjusted according to the patient's tolerance, and the electric current is less than 10mA.The operation lasts for 30 min. The treatment is scheduled to occur within 30min-60min before chemotherapy infusion for 4 days.</description>

    <description>Choose both Neiguan point(PC6) and Zhongwan point(CV12). Manipulating until achieving a &quot;de Qi&quot; sensation, then the needles are connected through a electro-acupuncture apparatus, the positive poles are linked to the needle, and the reference poles are located near the acupoint about 1cm with a paster. Frequency 10Hz,the intensity of stimulation is adjusted according to the patient's tolerance, and the electric current is less than 10mA. The operation lasts for 30 min.

    <description>The control group will receive standard antiemetic alone. Standard antiemetic for all groups is based on American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline. 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonist (Ramosetron, Tropisetron) and dexamethasone are supplied from the first day of chemotherapy, and lasting for 3-5 days.</description>
