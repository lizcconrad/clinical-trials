  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laboratory testing has suggested that lithium may decrease the incidence of certain types of
      cancer, including prostate cancer. Additional research has suggested that lithium decreases
      prostate cancer tumor size over time. This study will investigate the effect of lithium on
      men with prostate cancer.

      As lithium has been shown in an in vitro model to suppress cellular proliferation, and
      suppress tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model, we propose to determine its effect on
      prostate cancer cells in human patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. In this pilot study
      we plan to assess the toxicity of lithium administration in patients prior to radical
      prostatectomy. This will include any clinical toxicity as well as any increase in intra-,
      peri- or postoperative complications.

             within 90 days of study enrollment.

          -  Subjects &gt;/= 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of &lt;/= 1.

             the study period.

          -  Subjects must be able to safety take lithium carbonate for at least 4 weeks before
             scheduled prostatectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have received any investigational medication within 30 days of first
             lithium dose.
