  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovenous laser treatment is a minimally invasive procedure that has been shown to be a safe
      and effective treatment for varicose veins. Essential to the successful ablation of refluxing
      veins by endovenous laser treatment is the use of tumescent anesthesia. One of the components
      of tumescent anesthesia is lidocaine, a commonly used local anesthetic. While lidocaine can
      be used safely as long as serum concentrations remain low, its use carries the risk of
      lidocaine toxicity. In order to minimize the risk of lidocaine toxicity it is desirable to
      use the minimum effective concentration of lidocaine needed to manage pain during a
      procedure. This study seeks to determine if a ¼ lower concentration of lidocaine in tumescent
      anesthesia will function as well as the standard dose for pain management in endovenous laser
      treatments. If we find that this is the case, we will be able to reduce the risk of lidocaine
      toxicity in patients undergoing endovenous laser treatment, while maintaining their comfort
      throughout the procedure. This will be achieved through a direct comparison of intra- and
      post-operative pain for patients randomized to receive either the ¼ tumescent lidocaine
      concentration or the standard lidocaine concentration.
