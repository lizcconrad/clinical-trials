      Enhancing endogenous insulin production in type 1 diabetic patients (T1DP) can improve
      glycemic control and decrease complications and rates of mortality. However, it can be
      succesfull even if sufficient β-cell function is present. We aimed to evaluate the extent of
      β-cell function by determining fasting levels of C-peptide and those after meal stimulus.

      Background and aims: Enhancing endogenous insulin production in type 1 diabetic patients
      (T1DP) can improve glycemic control and decrease complications and rates of mortality.
      However, it can be succesfull even if sufficient β-cell function is present. We aimed to
      evaluate the extent of β-cell function by determining fasting levels of C-peptide and those
      after meal stimulus.

      Materials and Methods: One hundred and thiryfive T1DP were planned to enrolı to the study.
      Ethics comittee of our hospital approved the study protocol, which was in accordance with the
      Helsinki Declaration. Fasting C-peptide levels of all participants and stimulated (at 90 th
      minute post mixed meal) C-peptide levels of 54 will be measured by using an
      electrochemiluminescence assay. Two categorizations will be done using fasting (the first
      categorization ) and at 90th minute post mixed meal test (the second categorization) of
      C-peptide levels. For the first categorization; the groups will be classified as follows:
      patients with undetectable ≤0.1 ng/mL (group 1); with minimal 0.1-0.8 ng/ml (group 2); and
      with sustained ≥0.8 ng/mL(group 3) C-peptide levels. For the second categorization, groups
      will be as follows: patients with undetectable ≤0.1 ng/mL (group 1); with minimal 0.1-0.8
      ng/ml (group 2); and with sustained ≥0.8 ng/mL (group 3) C-peptide levels which increased at
      the 90th minute after the meal ≥150% of fasting C-peptide level.
