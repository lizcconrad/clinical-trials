  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a community mobilization intervention
      on the uptake of HIV testing, linkage to and retention in HIV care using a community, cluster
      randomized trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eight of 16 intervention naïve communities in the Agincourt HDSS will be randomized to
      receive the CM intervention to activate TasP based on the investigators CM conceptual
      framework. The 16 villages will be randomized based on the &quot;restricted randomization&quot;
      approach, a stratification method to ensure overall balance between intervention and control
      communities.

      Intervention activities will map onto the investigators six mobilization domains identified
      in the investigators preliminary work as key components for communities to mobilize for
      change around HIV prevention. These activities will support communities to: 1) identify a
      shared concern around testing, linkage and retention in care; 2) enable communities to
      develop critical consciousness around TasP; 3) facilitate identification and development of
      structures and networks to disseminate information and activities around TasP; 4) identify
      and engage community leadership around TasP; 5) take collection action to support TasP; and
      6) build community cohesion to address the HIV epidemic and support access to care.

      The investigators will evaluate the impact of the intervention using a linked data set
      including electronic clinic records and the HDSS census data, which will allow us to
      determine whether people in the intervention communities test at higher proportions than
      those in control communities, whether individuals who test positive in the intervention
      communities are more likely to receive CD4 testing and initiate treatment within 3 months
      than the control communities, and whether those who are eligible and not eligible for
      treatment are still in care 12 months after diagnosis.

      The investigators will implement a representative cross-sectional survey in all 16 villages
      prior to and following the intervention in order to examine changes in CM domains across
      villages and the mechanisms through which the intervention affects HIV testing, linkage and
      retention.

      In addition, intervention progress and dosage will be carefully monitored through a tracking
      system to document all workshops and activities that are carried out in each village.
