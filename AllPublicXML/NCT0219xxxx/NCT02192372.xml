  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of contrast induced nephropathy after interventional cardiologic procedures
      deserves close interest because of its association with prolonged hospitalization, increased
      cost and increased in hospital and long term mortality rates. An observational prospective
      cohort study was designed to determine whether metabolic syndrome predicts the development of
      contrast induced nephropathy after elective percutaneous coronary intervention.
