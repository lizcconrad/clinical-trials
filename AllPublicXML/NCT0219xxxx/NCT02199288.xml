      This prospective, open-label, multicenter, observational study will investigate the
      effectiveness and safety of MabThera SC (rituximab, subcutaneous) induction therapy in
      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, following a first initial treatment of MabThera IV
      (rituximab, intraveneous). Induction treatment period in the study is estimated to be 8
