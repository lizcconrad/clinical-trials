  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the acceptance and efficacy of the online self-help
      program deprexis® for depressed patients in reducing the clinical symptoms of their
      depression. The patients of the experimental group use deprexis® for 90 days, the patients of
      the placebo group receive weekly online information about depression for 90 days as well.
      Both groups receive their treatment in addition to their regular inpatient psychosomatic
      treatment and as an aftercare intervention.The investigators hypothesize that the online
      self-help group achieves a greater reduction of depression compared to the control group.
