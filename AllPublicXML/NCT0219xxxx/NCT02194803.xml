    <textblock>
      A multicentre, open-label, non-interventional study to observe treatment patterns in patients
      with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), with visual impairment due to diabetic
      macular edema (DME), due to macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or due to
      chorioidal neovascularization following pathologic myopia (mCNV) with repeated intravitreal
      injections of Lucentis速 (Ranibizumab) including optional OCT monitoring over a 24 months
      observational period under real life conditions.
