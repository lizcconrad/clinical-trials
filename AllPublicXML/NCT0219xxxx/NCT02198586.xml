  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the APOE genotype on brain
      morphology, function and metabolism, related to other factors such as cognitive reserve,
      cognition and episodic memory, in subjects at greater risk of developing AD.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of age and the APOE genotype on
      brain morphology and function, in 700 cognitively healthy individuals, 45 to 75 years old,
      recruited from an ongoing longitudinal cognition study exploring memory and executive
      functions (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01835717).

      All subjects have been APOE genotyped and underwent a clinical and cognitive assessment.
      Within this study, the subjects will be submitted to an MRI scanning protocol including
      morphological and resting state acquisitions. An identical follow-up MRI session will be
      performed in 2 years' time. The analyses will be focused on detecting the effect of the APOE
      allelic variants on the change rate of the neuroimaging variables as well as its interaction
      with aging.
