      This is an observational, case-control study evaluating the quantitative level of Septin9 in
      plasma pre- and post-colectomy in hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome patients
      (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), Lynch syndrome (also known as HNPCC), and Multiple
      Adenomatous Polyposis (MAP, also known as MYK/MYH) cases) and genetically related FAP-family
      members as controls and references.

    <measure>Septin9 Monitoring in Individual Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the completion of Septin9 monitoring in the individual patient disease groups (or family controls) over a period of two years or in case of colectomy within 28 days after colectomy. The endpoint is defined as the documented receipt of blood draws at least every six months on the scheduled healthcare visit at the institute after enrollment over the two years participation period. If any patient needs to undergo colectomy within the two years of study participation, the endpoint is defined as documented receipt of both blood draws occured prior to any surgical bowel preparation and 28 days at the latest after surgery.</description>

The patients of the disease and control groups participating in the study are followed up clinically and with blood draws at least every 6 months for the duration of 2 years. These follow-ups might be more frequent, if warranted by the clinical course of the individual disease in the participating patients. Blood draws in FAP patients should always be accompanied by blood draws in their family member controls.
If colectomy is performed in a patient of any disease group within the study participation period, additional blood draws will occur prior to any surgical bowel preparation and within a 28-day window after surgery.</description>

    <description>Plasma specimens will be collected and processed according to the Instructions for Use of the Epi proColon investigational device.
For circulating colonic epithelial cell analysis, at least one ml whole blood will be required for analysis. Samples will be analyzed for circulating epithelial cells using the geometrically enhanced immunocapture device (GEDI; Gleghorn et al., 2009). Circulating epithelial cells will be captured using EpCAM antibodies and quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy as defined as cells that are DAPI+, CK+, CD45-. Captured cells will be fixed and stored at -20˚C.</description>

      Blood samples will be used as per the study protocol. Consented subjects will provide at
      least 10 ml but not more than 20 ml (for repeating testing) of blood at each time point for
      Epi proColon testing. An additional volume of up to 10 ml anticoagulated blood will be drawn
      for circulating colonic epithelial cell analysis at each time point. Blood samples will be
      stored and will only be used in future research with the express written permission of study
      subjects. Subjects may withdraw consent from the study or for future use of blood samples at
      any time.
