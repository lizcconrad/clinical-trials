  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This aim proposes that guanfacine would be a useful drug to reverse Opioid-Induced
      Hyperalgesia (OIH) when combined with opioids in chronic pain management.

             including, but are not limited to, valproic acid, macrolide antibiotics, antifungal
             drugs, St. John wort, ACE inhibitors, nefazodone (antidepressant), calcium channel
             blockers, H2-receptor antagonists, anti-HIV or AIDS drugs, and antiepileptic drugs

             (e.g. imipramine, mirtazapine, mianserin). Any medications taken by a subject at the
             enrollment will be reviewed regarding their compatibility with guanfacine as well as
             possible confounding side effects. Subjects will be allowed to take non-opioid pain
             medications except for gabapentinoids and amitriptyline/nortriptyline as far as such
             medications do not have incompatibility with guanfacine.
