  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II trial studies the overall tumor response of vaccine therapy in patientswith
      previously untreated Stage III or IV, asymptomatic, non-bulky follicular lymphoma. The
      vaccine contains an extract of the patient's own cancer cells and the immunostimulant
      protein, interleukin-2 (IL-2). It is hoped that when injected under the skin, the vaccine
      will enable the patient's immune system to recognize and destroy the cancer cells. The trial
      will also assess the safety of the vaccine, the time from vaccine treatment until the patient
      requires another type of anti-lymphoma treatment, progression-free survival, and the
      anti-tumor immune response.

      This is a single-arm open-label pilot Phase II study. Following informed consent, eligible
      subjects will undergo excisional biopsy of a lymphoma-containing lymph node for diagnosis and
      for generation of the Oncoquest-L vaccine. Patients will receive subcutaneous injections
      consisting of their autologous tumor-derived Oncoquest-L vaccine starting at approximately 4
      to 8 weeks after the biopsy. The first two doses will be given at a 2-week interval and the
      remaining 3 doses at monthly intervals. Patients will be monitored for response by performing
      imaging studies at baseline and 1 month after the fifth vaccination (Week 19). Additional
      imaging studies will be performed every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months during
      the second year until relapse or disease progression whichever occurs sooner.

    <description>Safety parameters (e.g., adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory test results) will be recorded from the time patient signs informed consent, at every clinic visit during study treatment, 4 weeks after the 5th vaccination, and thereafter every 3 months during the 1st year and then every 6 months during the 2nd year.</description>

    <description>Antibody production will be reported as increased titers of antibodies, B cells will be expressed as % B cell populations, T cell responses will be expressed as increases of tumor-specific T cells and changes in expression and quantity of cytokines (proteins that indicate changes in the immune response). Blood samples will be collected within 8 weeks prior to the 1st vaccination (baseline); within 7 days prior to the 5th vaccination; and 4 weeks after the 5th vaccination.</description>
