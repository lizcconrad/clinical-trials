  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CO2 removal is a mandatory part of modern anesthesia systems. Current chemical absorbers pose
      problems as the chemical granulate reacts not only with the CO2 but also the anesthetic
      drugs, producing organ toxic substances. The proposed CO2 absorber provides a solution to the
      problem of organ-toxin production in anesthetic circuits.

      CO2 removal is a mandatory part of modern anesthesia systems. Current chemical absorbers pose
      problems as the chemical granulate reacts not only with the CO2 but also the anesthetic
      drugs, producing organ toxic substances. The proposed CO2 absorber provides a solution to the
      problem of organ-toxin production in anesthetic circuits.

      This new absorber can be easily integrated into any anesthesia circuit, and can effectively
      remove CO2 without reacting with anesthetic drugs, thus eliminating organ-toxic by-products.

      It uses advanced membrane technology to separate gas flows within the circuit, separating the
      expensive anesthetic vapors from the CO2 (the main by-product of metabolism). Anesthetic
      vapors thus remain in the closed loop circuit, while CO2 is separated and exhausted to the
      atmosphere, rather than being absorbed through a chemical reaction.
