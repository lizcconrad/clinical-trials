      This pilot clinical trial studies gallium Ga 68-edotreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in finding brain tumors in younger patients.
      Diagnostic procedures, such as gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT imaging, may help find and
      diagnose brain tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if 68Ga-DOTATOC (gallium Ga 68-edotreotide) PET when combined with magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) will differentiate embryonal tumors such as medulloblastoma and
      supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) from the low and high grade gliomas.

      II. To determine if 68Ga-DOTATOC PET will aid in the identification of residual tumor post
      operatively in those patients who were 68Ga-DOTATOC PET positive prior to surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT at baseline and 1-30 days after surgery.
