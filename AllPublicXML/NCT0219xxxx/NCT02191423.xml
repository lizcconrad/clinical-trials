  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale and Hypotheses of the Current Research: the investigators speculate that mothers
      suffering from PPD exhibit high levels of depression and low levels of OXT, hence
      experiencing the interaction with their child as less rewarding, which in turn promote
      further depressive symptoms and interfere with child development. While dyadic psychotherapy
      has been studied in this context, it is unknown which depressed women will respond to this
      type of therapy, and whether such a response is mediated by the pro-bonding effect of
      oxytocin.

      The aim of this study is three-fold:

        1. To study the effect of the administration of a single dose (24IU) of oxytocin on
           cerebral circuit processing and connectivity of empathy and attachment.

        2. To examine whether the clinical response of mothers suffering from postpartum depression
           to short term dyadic psychotherapy (based on improved mother-child interactions) can be
           predicted by a unique brain response pattern to oxytocin.

        3. To assess the relationship between levels of oxytocin in mother and baby and the
           effectiveness of psychological dyadic treatment on mothers suffering from postpartum
           depression.

    <description>1. This paradigm assesses empathic responses to images of individuals experiencing sad, anxious and happy events. Images are preceded by social context (i.e. &quot;this person just won the lottery&quot;). Control condition presents participants with images of people performing everyday actions.
3.we generated 15 short screenplays containing triggers for both types of empathy. Each of the screenplays depicts a situation in which the characters pose a negatively-valenced bodily state (e.g. crying, itching, choking), which we expect to elicit embodied simulation in the viewer.
2. This paradigm examines maternal FMRI responses to infant related video vignettes. Stimuli include movies of mothers' own infant vs strange infant during solitary play and mother-infant interaction.</description>

    <description>The Coding Interactive Behavior Manual (CIB) (Feldman 1998), a well-validated system for coding dyadic interactions, by individuals blind to the study group that the participant is a member in.

    <description>Micro-analytic coding of synchrony- on a computerized system (Noldus, The Vaggenigen, Netherlands), coded on a computerized system that allows for .01-second exactness. Consistent with previous research on parent-infant synchrony (Feldman and Eidelman, 2004, 2007). Four non-verbal categories of parenting behavior and four non-verbal categories of infant behavior will be coded and each category will include a set of mutually exclusive codes.</description>

    <measure>Maternal depression symptoms measures- BDI</measure>
    <time_frame>mothers will complete the BDI once a week during the 8-week trial, as well as in the pre (baseline at week 1) and post (week 11) experimental trial assessments. Data will be presented up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory- BDI (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, and Erbaugh, 1961) is designed to assess the severity of depression while referring to affective, cognitive, physical and behavioral aspects.
The BDI consists of 21 items, divided in to 3 factors: sadness / negative self perception, psycho-motor deceleration and somatic depression. Every item consists of 4 sentences for self-esteem, in a scale of 0-3, according to the degree of depression. Scores of 9 or above indicate elevated depressive symptoms and a risk for MDD (Kendall, Hollon, Beck, et al 1987). The BDI is a widely used inventory which was found to be well validated and highly coefficient (for a meta analysis see: Beck, Steer, &amp; Garbin, 1988).</description>

    <description>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale- EPDS, (Cox, Holden, Sagovsky, 1987) is designed in order to screen for postnatal depression in the community. The EPDS is a brief (10-item) scale. The questions focus on the psychological rather than the somatic aspects of depression and explore 2 distinct domains of negative affect: depressive symptoms (7 items) and anxiety (3 items) (Kabir, Sheeder and Kelly, 2008). Subjects respond to items on a 4 point Likert scale (of 0-3), resulting in a total score range between 0 and 30. Scores of 10 or above indicate elevated depressive symptoms and a risk for PPD (Cox, Holden, Sagovsky, 1987). The EPDS is a widely used scale which was found to be well validated and highly coefficient (Cox, Holden, Sagovsky, 1987; Kabir, Sheeder and Kelly ,2008; Murray &amp; Carothers, 1990).</description>

    <measure>Maternal anxiety measures-STAI</measure>
    <time_frame>mothers will complete the STAI once a week during the 8-week trial, as well as in the pre (baseline at week 1) and post (week 11) experimental trial assessments. Data will be presented up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>State- Trait Anxiety Inventory- STAI (Spielberger, Gorsuch, and Lushene, 1970) assesses levels of situational and trait anxiety. The STAI contains 40 declarations, 20 of which refer to situational anxiety and 20 of which refer to trait anxiety. Subjects will indicate on a scale of 1-4 (1=not it all, 4=to a large extent) to what extent they think the declaration is accurate in their case. Trait anxiety scores of above 43 are considered a risk indicator for anxiety disorders (Spielberger, et al., 1970). The STAI is a widely used inventory which was found to be well validated and highly coefficient (Anastasi, 1988).</description>

    <description>Maternal thoughts and actions will be assessed with the Yale Inventory of Parental Thoughts and Actions (YIPTA) - a semi-structured interview which provides a validated measure of parental worries, comprising a range of anxious intrusive thoughts and harm avoidant behaviors (AITHAR; Feldman, Weller, Leckman, Kuint, &amp; Eidelman, 1999; Leckman et al., 2004; Leckman et al., 1999; Mayes, Swain, Feldman, &amp; Leckman, 2008). Such thoughts and behaviors include concerns about the baby's physical environment.</description>

    <description>Women suffering from postpartum depression, assessed by fMRI and then treated by dyadic psychotherapy
All participants will undergo two functional brain scans at the Tel Aviv Medical Center. The two scans will take place one week apart, one scan will include administration of oxytocin (24IU) and the other will include the use of placebo (the order in which the two different treatments is applied will be random).
All women in this group participate in 8-weeks of dyadic psychotherapy (DP) at the outpatient Psychiatric Department, Tel-Aviv Medical Center.
A final end-of-study clinical evaluation, will be conducted at the end of 8 weeks. The evaluation will include a psychiatric evaluation, the MADRS, and a physical examination, the mother-infant interaction will be videotaped, and the YIPTA, BDI, EPDS &amp; STAI will be administered. Salivary OXT samples will be collected from the mother and from the infant and infants will undergo a developmental assessment.</description>
