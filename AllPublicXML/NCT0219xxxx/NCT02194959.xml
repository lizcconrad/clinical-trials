  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer health disparities related to race and ethnicity are among the most serious problems
      facing the US health care system. A recent institute of medicine report stated that such
      disparities are seen at every level of health care, from prevention to treatment and
      follow-up. This problem is acutely evident in the figures for colorectal cancer (CRC) among
      African Americans. According to the American cancer society, African Americans have the
      highest CRC incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. Indeed, CRC incidence and
      mortality are 15% and 43% higher among African Americans than whites, respectively. These
      disparities could be effectively reduced through greater African American participation in
      CRC screening and early detection. More importantly, due to the preponderance of CRC in
      African Americans beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscopy (1), increased adherence to
      colonoscopy among African Americans will save lives. Although there is clear evidence that
      providing patients with someone to help them manage/navigate the health care system (i.e.,
      patient navigation (PN)) is effective in helping them to complete cancer screening, very few
      hospitals provide PN for colonoscopy. The vast majority of hospitals in NYC are unable to
      provide PN for patients for whom colonoscopy is recommended, in large part because of the
      costs associated with professional-led PN. This project seeks to address this serious public
      health problem by investigating the success of training African Americans who have undergone
      colonoscopy to serve as volunteer peer patient navigators to encourage others from their
      community to complete CRC screening via colonoscopy.

      The overall goal of the study was to reduce CRC morbidity and mortality by increasing African
      American participation in colonoscopy. This was done by development and implementation of a
      training program for Peer Patient Navigation (PPN) to increase participation of African
      Americans in colonoscopy.

      The primary care physician referred all participants and introduced the study to the patient.
      The physician will then introduced the patient to the Research Assistant/Recruiter
      immediately following the medical visit during which a CRC screening colonoscopy was
      recommended. The Research Assistant/Recruiter reviewed the study and asked potential
      participants if they were interested; if so, the candidate's eligibility was determined. If
      these criteria were met and the patient wanted to be in the study, informed consent and HIPAA
      was reviewed and obtained. If the patient wanted to think about his/her decision, informed
      consent was obtained at a later date.

      Patients were referred and scheduled for screening colonoscopy as part of standard of care.
      Both groups received 3 intervention phone calls from their assigned navigators, 1) to
      schedule the colonoscopy, 2) a call 2 weeks before the procedure and, 3) a third call three
      days before the procedure.

      For research purposes, participants were randomized to one of two kinds of patient
      navigation:

        1. Standard patient navigation receiving care that they would normally receive if they were
           not participating in the study with navigation from the GI staff, and three phone calls
           involved scheduling and reminding the participant about their colonoscopy appointment.

        2. Peer Patient Navigation (PPN): Participants were assisted by African American peers who
           have undergone colonoscopy, and were able to discuss, first-hand, their personal
           experience undergoing colonoscopy and describe how they coped effectively with the
           procedure.

      PPN's underwent three months of training supervised by study investigators. Multiple modes of
      training were used (didactic discussion, observation, role-playing, one-on-one sessions,
      ongoing feedback, rehearsal, supervision via review of audio-tape recording or PPNs and a
      take-home training manual).

      A medical chart review was completed after the colonoscopy for all patients to assess
      completion of the examination as well as prep quality and any findings where additional
      clinical follow-up was required. Colonoscopy results were also collected to assess quality of
      care and measure the effectiveness of PPN navigations compared to standard of care,
      particularly potential differences based on study group, i.e., compliance.

    <description>A scheduling phone call will be made to all patients within 14 days of their initial referral to the study. Following the scheduling of their appointment, each patient will be mailed an informational pamphlet with written instructions for the colonoscopy once they have scheduled the procedure. The first reminder PPN phone call will be made two weeks before a patient's scheduled colonoscopy. The second reminder PPN call will be made three days before the scheduled colonoscopy. For all calls, at least three attempts (at different times of the day and different days of the week) will be made to reach patients. All telephone calls will be audio-recorded to facilitate fidelity monitoring. All colonoscopy appointments will be made within the Division of Gastroenterology at each of the hospital sites. The Project Coordinator will be responsible for confirming completion (and no-shows) for all colonoscopy appointments.</description>
