    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of experimental sodium fluoride-silica dentifrice
      formulations, with and without zinc, on remineralization of enamel in situ. Following the
      remineralization phase, the acid resistance of the new mineral formed will be assessed.
      Fluoride uptake during the remineralization phase will also be measured.

    <measure>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (% SMHR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the mineral content of the four centrally-located enamel specimens were evaluated using the Surface Microhardness (SMH) Test. The SMH was measured using a Wilson 2100 Hardness Tester. The baseline SMH was determined prior to the in vitro acid challenge. SMH was determined again after the in vitro acid challenge, after the in situ remineralization test, and again after the second in vitro acid challenge. The extent of remineralization was calculated as the % recovery in SMH using the equation: % SMHR= [(D1-R)/(D1-B)]*100 Where B = indentation length (μm) of sound enamel at baseline; D1 = indentation length (μm) after first acid challenge; R = indentation length (μm) after in situ remineralization.</description>

    <measure>Enamel Fluoride Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The microdrill enamel biopsy technique was used to analyze the fluoride uptake by enamel. Each enamel specimen was mounted on the long axis of a drill attached to a microdrill and drilled to a depth of approximately 100 micrometer (μm) through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen). The enamel powder pooled from four drilling sample was then immediately analyzed for fluoride content using fluoride specific electrode and pH/ion meter. The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as microgram per square centimeter (μg/cm^2).</description>

          <description>Participants brushed the buccal surface of their teeth with 1.5 g (± 0.1 g) dentifrice for 25 seconds (sec) to create dentifrice slurry. Then swished the slurry around the palatal appliance for 1 minute (min) and 35 sec. Next, they expectorated the slurry, rinsed with 15 milliliter (mL) of tap water for 10 sec and expectorated. There was a 2 day washout period before each treatment period when participants used a non-fluoridated dentifrice.

        <title>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (% SMHR)</title>
        <description>Changes in the mineral content of the four centrally-located enamel specimens were evaluated using the Surface Microhardness (SMH) Test. The SMH was measured using a Wilson 2100 Hardness Tester. The baseline SMH was determined prior to the in vitro acid challenge. SMH was determined again after the in vitro acid challenge, after the in situ remineralization test, and again after the second in vitro acid challenge. The extent of remineralization was calculated as the % recovery in SMH using the equation: % SMHR= [(D1-R)/(D1-B)]*100 Where B = indentation length (μm) of sound enamel at baseline; D1 = indentation length (μm) after first acid challenge; R = indentation length (μm) after in situ remineralization.</description>

Participants brushed the buccal surface of their teeth with 1.5 g (± 0.1 g) dentifrice for 25 sec to create dentifrice slurry. Next, they swished the dentifrice slurry around the palatal appliance for 1 min and 35 sec. After that, participants expectorated the slurry, gently but thoroughly rinsed with 15 mL of tap water for 10 sec and expectorated again. There was a 2 day wash-out period before each treatment period when participants used a non-fluoridated dentifrice.</description>

        <title>Enamel Fluoride Uptake</title>
        <description>The microdrill enamel biopsy technique was used to analyze the fluoride uptake by enamel. Each enamel specimen was mounted on the long axis of a drill attached to a microdrill and drilled to a depth of approximately 100 micrometer (μm) through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen). The enamel powder pooled from four drilling sample was then immediately analyzed for fluoride content using fluoride specific electrode and pH/ion meter. The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as microgram per square centimeter (μg/cm^2).</description>

          <description>Non-zinc, 1426ppm fluoride as sodium fluoride in a silica base. Participants brushed the buccal surface of their teeth with 1.5 g (± 0.1 g) dentifrice for 25 sec to create dentifrice slurry. Next, they swished the dentifrice slurry around the palatal appliance for 1 min and 35 sec. After that, participants expectorated the slurry, gently but thoroughly rinsed with 15 mL of tap water for 10 sec and expectorated again. There was a 2 day wash-out period before each treatment period when participants used a non-fluoridated dentifrice.</description>
