  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to develop and validate non-invasive assessments of cardiac and respiratory
      muscles with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better predict the natural disease
      progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in affected individuals over time, as well
      as determine whether peripheral skeletal muscle dysfunction can predict cardiopulmonary
      dysfunction. The central hypothesis is that non-invasive MRI measures of the heart, muscle,
      and peripheral skeletal muscles can sensitively predict future cardiopulmonary decline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the heart and breathing muscles, special breathing tests
      (called pulmonary function testing), special exercise tests (using a stationary bike), and
      possibly an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart, commonly known as an &quot;echo&quot;) will be
      completed up to 4 times per year for up to 4 years. Most participants will complete testing
      once or twice each year; however, some participants will be asked to repeat some of the tests
      twice during each visit.

        As the focus of this study is on validating novel measures of cardiac and respiratory
        function in individuals with DMD, this study will utilize a single-group design with up to
        60 males with DMD between 5 and 15 years old upon entry to the study. The participant
        selection is limited to children since the detrimental effects of DMD begin in early
        childhood, and the life expectancy of these boys is shortened to the early- to mid-20s.
        Only males will be eligible to participate in the study because DMD is an X-linked
        recessive genetic disorder that only leads to the characteristic disease in males. Although
        females may be carriers, they do not exhibit the same phenotype as males.
