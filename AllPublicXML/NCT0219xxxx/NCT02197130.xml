    <textblock>
      This study is a 26 week, randomized, parallel group, double blind comparison of PF-02545920 5
      mg, PF-02545920 20 mg, and placebo dosed BID in the treatment of motor impairment of subjects
      with Huntington's Disease. A total of approximately 260 subjects are planned to be randomized
      in the study. Primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the Total Motor Score (TMS)
      assessment of the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) after 26 weeks of
      treatment. secondary endpoints will include change from baseline in the Total Maximum Chorea
      (TMC) score of the UHDRS after 13 and 26 weeks of treatment and Clinical Global
      Impression-Improvement score after 13 and 26 weeks of treatment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Motor Score (TMS) Assessment of the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) After 26 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The UHDRS was a clinical rating scale which has been developed by the Huntington Disease Study Group (HSG) to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of Huntington's Disease (HD). The components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behavior and functional abilities. The total motor score (TMS) assessed motor features of HD with standardized ratings of oculomotor function, dysarthria, chorea, dystonia, gait, and postural stability. Some items (such as chorea and dystonia) required grading each extremity (face, bucco-oral-lingual, and trunk) separately. Eye movements require both horizontal and vertical grades. The total motor impairment scores was the sum of all the individual 31 motor sub-items (each rated from 0 to 4), with higher scores indicating more severe motor impairment than lower scores. The range of TMS is 0-124.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The UHDRS was a clinical rating scale which has been developed by the Huntington Disease Study Group (HSG) to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. The components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behavior and functional abilities. The Total Maximum Chorea (TMC) was a subset of the TMS assessment. It was composed of the scoring of 7 chorea assessments (face, orobuccolingual, trunk, right and left upper extremities, right and left lower extremities). Each assessment was rated from 0 to 4 (absent to prolonged). TMC is obtained by adding up each of the separate scores, leading to max score of 28. The minimum score is 0. The higher the score, the worse the symptoms. n is the number of evaluable subjects in each visit.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS captured the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced following: completed suicide; suicide attempt; preparatory acts towards imminent suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent. The results presented are the number of participants with completed suicide or non-fatal suicide events or behaviors. Worsening of suicidal ideation was an increase in severity of suicidal ideation from baseline.</description>

    <description>CGI-I: 7-point clinician rated scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Clinician responded to a question: &quot;Compared to your subject's condition at the beginning of treatment, how much has your subject changed?&quot;. Improvement was compared to baseline and was defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved) on the scale. Higher score = more affected. n is the number of evaluable participants in each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Motor Score (TMS) Assessment of the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) After 26 Weeks of Treatment.</title>
        <description>The UHDRS was a clinical rating scale which has been developed by the Huntington Disease Study Group (HSG) to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of Huntington's Disease (HD). The components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behavior and functional abilities. The total motor score (TMS) assessed motor features of HD with standardized ratings of oculomotor function, dysarthria, chorea, dystonia, gait, and postural stability. Some items (such as chorea and dystonia) required grading each extremity (face, bucco-oral-lingual, and trunk) separately. Eye movements require both horizontal and vertical grades. The total motor impairment scores was the sum of all the individual 31 motor sub-items (each rated from 0 to 4), with higher scores indicating more severe motor impairment than lower scores. The range of TMS is 0-124.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Maximum Chorea (TMC) Score of the UHDRS After 13 and 26 Weeks of Treatment.</title>
        <description>The UHDRS was a clinical rating scale which has been developed by the Huntington Disease Study Group (HSG) to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. The components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behavior and functional abilities. The Total Maximum Chorea (TMC) was a subset of the TMS assessment. It was composed of the scoring of 7 chorea assessments (face, orobuccolingual, trunk, right and left upper extremities, right and left lower extremities). Each assessment was rated from 0 to 4 (absent to prolonged). TMC is obtained by adding up each of the separate scores, leading to max score of 28. The minimum score is 0. The higher the score, the worse the symptoms. n is the number of evaluable subjects in each visit.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS captured the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced following: completed suicide; suicide attempt; preparatory acts towards imminent suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent. The results presented are the number of participants with completed suicide or non-fatal suicide events or behaviors. Worsening of suicidal ideation was an increase in severity of suicidal ideation from baseline.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) Scale Score After 13 and 26 Weeks of Treatment.</title>
        <description>CGI-I: 7-point clinician rated scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Clinician responded to a question: “Compared to your subject’s condition at the beginning of treatment, how much has your subject changed?”. Improvement was compared to baseline and was defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved) on the scale. Higher score = more affected. n is the number of evaluable participants in each visit.</description>
