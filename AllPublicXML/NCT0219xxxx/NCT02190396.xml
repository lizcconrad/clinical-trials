  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to influence fetal and neonatal health. The
      role of placenta in vitamin D regulation is known but alteration of Vitamin D levels at
      placental pathologies is unknown. Placental calcification is usually thought to be a
      physiological aging process. Nevertheless, it can be a pathological change resulting from the
      effects of environmental factors on the placenta. The aim of the investigators study was to
      evaluate the relationship between placental calcification and maternal and cord blood
      25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 [25(OH)D] and calcium concentrations in low-risk obstetric population at
      term and their consequences.

      Vitamin D deficiency is a public health problem prevalent throughout the World. Low blood
      25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 25OHD ) level was found to be associated with preeclampsia,
      gestational diabetes, infectious diseases, decrease in fetal bone mineralization, and
      increase in fetal respiratory infections and infant wheezing [1].

      Requirement of vitamin D is primarily met by the exposure of skin to sun and secondarily by
      intake of food. The provision of vitamin D from the skin depends upon melanin pigment, the
      use of sun screens, age, dressing style and seasonal changes [1]. Placenta plays an important
      role in Vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy and some independent risk factors increasing
      the risk of placental dysfunction at fetomaternal interface also influence vitamin D
      metabolism [2,3]. Nevertheless, there can be a pathological change resulting from the effects
      of environmental factors on the placenta .
