  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, repeat-dose, study of sebelipase alfa in infants with rapidly
      progressive LAL Deficiency. Eligible subjects will receive once-weekly infusions of
      sebelipase alfa for up to 3 years.

    <textblock>
      Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder
      that is caused by a marked decrease or almost complete absence of the LAL enzyme, leading to
      the accumulation of these lipids, predominately cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, in
      various tissues and cell types. In the liver, accumulation of lipids leads to hepatomegaly,
      liver dysfunction, and hepatic failure. In the small intestine, lipid-laden macrophage
      accumulation in the lamina propria leads to profound malabsorption.

      LAL Deficiency presenting in infancy is extremely rare form of LAL Deficiency. It is
      characterized by profound malabsorption, growth failure, and hepatic failure, and is usually
      fatal in the first 6 months of life. There is currently no safe or effective therapy for the
      treatment of LAL Deficiency.

          1. Clinically important concurrent disease

          2. Subject will be &gt; 8 months of age at the time of first dosing.

          3. Subject has received an investigational medicinal product other than sebelipase alfa
             within 14 days prior to the first dose of sebelipase alfa in this study.
