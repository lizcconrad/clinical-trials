  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability of the novel plasma
      kallikrein inhibitor, KVD001 in subjects with diabetic macular edema. The study is the first
      step to investigate the hypothesis that plasma kallikrein plays an important role in the
      disease process behind diabetic macular edema in many patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plasma kallikrein-kinin system has long been recognized as a key player in inflammatory
      processes, capillary leakage and angiogenesis in various organs. Recent work suggests that
      plasma kallikrein is central to the pathogenesis of Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and that
      activation of the enzyme contributes to the excessive retinal vascular permeability leading
      to DME. Among different persons with DME, plasma kallikrein contributes both independently in
      some, and in association with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in others. However,
      the effect of plasma kallikrein appears to be independent of VEGF. Thus, growing scientific
      evidence points to plasma kallikrein inhibitors as an exciting potential new therapeutic
      opportunity directed at a novel VEGF-independent pathway that may reduce retinal vascular
      permeability and treat DME, in patients whose disease process is, at least in part, driven by
      the plasma kallikrein pathway.

      This is an open label, single ascending dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacodynamics of a novel plasma kallikrein inhibitor administered by intravitreal
      (IVT) injection in subjects with central involved diabetic macular edema and reduced vision.
