      There are many potential risks in operating room such as anesthetic gas exposure, chronic
      noise, fair, intensive working conditions, frequent guardians of the doctors and anesthesia
      staff. Those are effects the staff of anesthesia such as doctors, anesthesia assistants,
      anesthesia nurses. They usually suffer from hard working, fatigue and exposing anesthetic
      gases effects them as well. These reasons cause some undesirable adverse effects. The
      scientific dates are really limited in uour country. We aimed to ask questions the anesthesia
      staff and determine the environment conditions and the other risk in operating room that
      effects the staff. For t his purpose we prepared a questionaire and send to their e-mail
