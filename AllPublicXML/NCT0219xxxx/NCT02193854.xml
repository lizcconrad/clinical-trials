      Objective This study is aimed to estimate the distance, time and the cost of travel saved by
      patients who are seeking tele-dermatology (TD) service though smart mobile phones in the
      resource poor settings at the rural clinics of Mongolia.

      Methods A cluster-randomised trial was conducted for six months at the 20 rural health
      clinics selected from three districts in Mongolia. With a computer-generated sequence, health
      clinics were randomly allocated either to the intervention group, in which all general
      practitioners (GPs) received TD consultation through Sana system, or the control group, in
      which GPs referred patients to the dermatologist at district hospital whenever needed. The
      primary outcome was to estimate the distance traveled, times spend and the cost of travel
      required in receiving dermal care for patients in rural Mongolia. Analysis was done to
      estimate the difference between the aforementioned parameters among intervention and control
      groups.

      The investigators used Sana system, that is a mobile phone-based, open source software
      platform for telemedicine services. The Android-based system supports multimedia,
      location-based data, and text. In the village health clinic, a healthcare worker will
      interact with a patient and collects data through a step-by-step clinical questionnaire on a
      smart mobile phone. As patients' data is uploaded to an open source electronic medical record
      system (OpenMRS) with a diagnosis-specific information and images. The consultant can access
      the clinical information about the patient and make appropriate diagnoses and treatment
      recommendations from the secondary hospital.
