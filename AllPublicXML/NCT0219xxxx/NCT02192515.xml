  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of APD356 in healthy
      Japanese adult subjects. Regarding cohorts 1 to 3, this study is a single center,
      placebo-controlled, randomized,double-blind study. Regarding cohort 4, this study is a single
      center, randomized, open-label study that consists of two sequential two-way crossover
      studies. The study consists of 4 cohorts. In cohort 1, subjects will be randomized to 10 mg
      group (6 subjects) or placebo group (2 subjects) to receive single dose of study drug. In
      cohort 2, subjects will be randomized to 20 mg group (6 subjects) or placebo group (2
      subjects) to receive single dose of study drug. In cohort 3, subjects will be randomized to
      XR-20 mg group (6 subjects) or placebo group (2 subjects) to receive single dose of study
      drug on Day 1 and multiple doses of study drug on Day 8-14 once daily before breakfast. In
      cohort 4, subjects will be randomized to Sequence A (8 subjects) or Sequence B (8 subjects)
      to receive study drug in the sequence shown below.

      Sequence A: 10 mg tablet, 2 doses (12 hours apart) =&gt; XR-20 mg orange tablet, single dose =&gt;
      XR-20 mg orange tablet, q. d., multiple doses (fasted) =&gt; XR-20 mg orange tablet, q. d.,
      multiple dose (fed)

      Sequence B: XR-20 mg orange tablet, single dose =&gt; 10 mg tablet, 2 doses (12 hours apart) =&gt;
      XR-20 mg orange tablet, q. d., multiple dose (fed) =&gt; XR-20 mg orange tablet, q. d., multiple
      doses (fasted)
