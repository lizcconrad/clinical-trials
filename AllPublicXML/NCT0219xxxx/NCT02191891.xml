      Part A: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D)
      of Xentuzumab (BI 836845) in combination with afatinib in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer with progression following prior treatment (EGFR TKI or platinum-based chemotherapy).

      Part B: To evaluate the early anti-tumour activity of Xentuzumab (BI 836845) in combination
      with afatinib in patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer with progression
      following prior irreversible EGFR TKIs.

      Part A and B: To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of BI 836845 in combination with
      afatinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
