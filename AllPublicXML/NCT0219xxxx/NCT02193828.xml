      The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and effectiveness of AA4500 in treating
      palmar Dupuytren's disease nodules.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 13 sites in the United States and Australia, approximately 90 study subjects.

      After all pre-injection procedures are completed on day 1, eligible men and women will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to dose group and then in a 4:1 ratio to treatment group. Study
      drug will be administered into a palmar nodule located on the selected hand.

      AA4500 (collagenase clostridium histolyticum) 3 doses (low, medium, and high) after
      reconstitution with sterile diluent (0.3 mg/mL calcium chloride dihydrate in 0.9% sodium
      chloride). Each dose of study drug will be injected into the nodule. The injection will be
      administered in 3 different volumes according to randomization.

      Placebo after reconstitution with sterile diluent (0.3 mg/mL calcium chloride dihydrate in
      0.9% sodium chloride). Each dose of study drug will be injected into the nodule. The
      injection will be administered in 3 different volumes according to randomization.

      Follow up visits for the evaluation of safety and efficacy will be required for all subjects
      on days 8, 29, and 57.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Surface Area and Volume of the Treated Nodule at Day 57 Using Caliper Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from baseline in surface area and volume of the treated nodule was determined from hand-held caliper measurements of the length and width of the nodule. Percent change = 100*(Day 57 area [or volume] - baseline area [or volume])/baseline area [or volume]. A negative value represents the improvement from baseline (decreased size) while a positive value represents worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Surface Area and Volume of the Treated Nodule at Day 57 Using Ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from baseline in surface area and volume of the treated nodule was determined from ultrasound measurements of the length, width, and depth of the nodule. Percent change = 100*(Day 57 area [or volume] - baseline area [or volume])/baseline area [or volume]. A negative value represents the improvement from baseline (decreased size) while a positive value represents worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Consistency of the Treated Nodules at Day 57</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators determined the consistency of the nodule through palpitation using a 5-point scale: 5 = hard (solid), 4 = firm throughout, 3 = moderate firmness, 2 = soft, and 1 = non-palpable. The change scores could range from +4 (greatest worsening in consistency) to -4 (greatest improvement in consistency); a negative change from baseline value reflects improvement from baseline (softening) while a positive value reflects worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Hardness of the Treated Nodule at Day 57</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>A durometer was used to assess nodule hardness on a scale of 0 (soft) to 100 (hard). Percent change = 100*(Day 57 hardness - baseline hardness)/baseline hardness. A negative value represents the improvement from baseline (softening) while a positive value represents worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nodular Pain of the Treated Nodule at Day 57</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>After the nodule was squeezed using a dynamometer, subjects were asked to rate the amount of pain they felt on an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain or discomfort) to 10 (extreme pain or discomfort). A negative change from baseline value reflects improvement from baseline (less pain) while a positive value reflects worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator Global Assessment of Improvement With Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators were asked to determine the degree of improvement in the subject's treated nodule compared with screening on a 7-point scale: 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction With Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to rate their satisfaction with treatment on a 5-point scale: 1 = very satisfied, 2 = quite satisfied, 3 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4 = quite dissatisfied, and 5 = very dissatisfied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Responder Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>A composite responder is a subject who had an improved assessment [values of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved)] on the investigator global assessment and had a satisfied assessment [values of 1 (very satisfied) or 2 (quite satisfied)] on the subject assessment.</description>

        <description>Percent change from baseline in surface area and volume of the treated nodule was determined from hand-held caliper measurements of the length and width of the nodule. Percent change = 100*(Day 57 area [or volume] - baseline area [or volume])/baseline area [or volume]. A negative value represents the improvement from baseline (decreased size) while a positive value represents worsening.</description>
