  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to reduce tobacco-related disparities in maternal and
      infant health outcomes by improving smoking cessation and relapse prevention interventions
      for minority pregnant and postpartum women, who have been significantly underrepresented in
      smoking cessation research. This study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of a
      prize-based contingency management approach for increasing smoking cessation and preventing
      relapse among socioeconomically disadvantaged minority pregnant smokers. First, the
      intervention will be pretested with 10 pregnant low-income minority smokers and then refined
      based on acceptability survey and focus group data. Next, a pilot study will be conducted. 60
      highly disadvantaged minority women, recruited from the outpatient obstetric clinics at a
      large teaching hospital, who report daily smoking and who meet other eligibility criteria
      will be enrolled and randomized to one of two study conditions: 1) Standard Psychoeducational
      Intervention (6-week, individually-administered, pregnancy-specific Quit Smoking Now
      curriculum, as currently implemented in the clinic; QSN Only); 2) Standard Psychoeducational
      Intervention plus Contingency Management (provision of incentives contingent on
      biochemically-verified abstinence; QSN-CM). Abstinence monitoring via expired carbon monoxide
      and salivary cotinine levels will occur in both groups beginning on the first quit day and
      continuing through 3-months postpartum. Only participants in the QSN-CM group will be
      reinforced for biochemically-verified abstinence with chances to win prizes ranging in value
      from approximately $1 to $100 ('fishbowl' or 'prize bowl' method). Study outcomes will be
      assessed through follow-up research exams (delivery and 6-months postpartum) and hospital
      chart reviews. The primary hypothesis is that that women randomized to the QSN-CM condition
      will have higher rates of abstinence during pregnancy and postpartum compared to women
      receiving standard of care alone. Results should advance scientific knowledge regarding
      effective methods for promoting and maintaining smoking abstinence among pregnant
      disadvantaged women and provide preliminary feasibility and efficacy data needed to support a
      larger randomized controlled trial.

    <description>The Quit Smoking Now (QSN) program, offered by the Florida Area Health Education Center, was developed based on principles of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's &quot;Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control&quot;, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' &quot;Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Guidelines&quot; with an emphasis on reaching medically-underserved populations. The QSN curriculum will be delivered in 6 one-hour sessions . Pregnancy-specific session goals and content cover the effects of smoking on the developing fetus, secondhand smoke exposure, the importance of social support, and postpartum relapse.</description>
