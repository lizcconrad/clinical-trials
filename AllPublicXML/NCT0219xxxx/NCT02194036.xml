  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatients that suffer from different anxiety disorders may have physical ailments that
      negatively affect daily life functioning and quality of life. LOF is a physical therapy
      approach focusing on the link between bodily and mental balance and through defined, but
      simple movements, patients are expected to learn how to cope and reduce health complaints.

      This study aims to investigate the short- and longterm effect of LOF compared to other
      standardized psychiatric treatments given in the clinic on levels of anxiety and depression,
      health related function and quality of life.

    <description>Learning oriented physiotherapy is a treatment approach based on knowledge from neuroscience and particularly aimed to curb physical symptoms and ailments, but also to regain a sense of better physical balance and mental control. Therapy sessions are normally given every 2 weeks with individual homework lessons between. The therapy will last between 6 to 12 months depending on learning process and individual needs.</description>
