    <textblock>
      The study hypothesizes that Drug -eluting stents are more effective in preventing restenosis
      than Bare-metal stents after Vertebral Artery Ostium stenting
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vertebral artery ostium stenosis was one of the higher risk of the ischemia stroke in
      China. In the mean time ,more and more people accept revascularization. There are no
      prospective studies for comparison of prevention of restenosis after Drug -eluting stents and
      Bare-metal stents until now.

      The main aim of this study is to observe the following details:

        1. Late loss in lumen diameter in follow-up ≥50%

        2. Death, non -fatal stroke 30 days after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet
           drugs

        3. Death, non -fatal stroke 12 months after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet
           drugs

      Secondary endpoint:

      brain, gastrointestinal and urinary system bleeding in 12 months follow-up

        Symptomatic status: as evidenced by TIA or non-severe stroke within the past 12 months
        attributed to 70% to 99% stenosis of vertebral artery ostium are eligible. Degree of
        stenosis: &gt;70% and &lt;99%; stenosis may be diagnosed by TCD, MRA, or CTA to qualify for
        angiogram performed as part of the study protocol, but must be confirmed by catheter
        angiography for enrollment in the trial. All the patients should be performed with PTAS
        beyond a duration of 3 weeks from the latest ischemic symptom onset. No fresh infarctions
        identified on MRI (indicated as high signals on DWI series) upon enrollment.Patient is
        willing and able to return for all follow-up visits required by the protocol Patient
        understands the purpose and requirements of the study, can make him/herself understood, and
        has signed informed consent.
