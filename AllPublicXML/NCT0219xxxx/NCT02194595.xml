  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by progressive
      deterioration in the function of the pancreatic beta-cells, which are the cells that produce
      and secrete insulin (the hormone primarily responsible for the handling of glucose in the
      body). The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether combining
      basal insulin with a new medication called exenatide is a therapeutic strategy that can
      preserve beta-cell function early in the course of type 2 diabetes.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ISSI-2 is an established measure of beta-cell function. ISSI-2 is defined as the product of (i) insulin secretion measured by the ratio of the area-under-the-insulin-curve to the area-under-the-glucose curve and (ii) insulin sensitivity measured by the Matsuda index. The primary outcome comparison is between the glargine/exenatide and glargine only arms.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will undergo an 8-week course of treatment with exenatide and insulin glargine. Exenatide will be initiated at 5ug subcutaneous (sc) bid (before breakfast and before dinner) for the first 4 weeks, followed by 10ug bid for the next 4 weeks. Glargine sc injection at bedtime will be titrated to fasting glucose.</description>
