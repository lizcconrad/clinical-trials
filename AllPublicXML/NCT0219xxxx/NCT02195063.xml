      This is a survey study that will be given to patients who have been prescribed a topical
      compound for pain management, wound care or scar care or to patients who have been requested
      to do a urinary drug test (UDT) by their provider.

      The initial survey for pain management, wound care, scar care or UDT will be given to the
      patient by their providers during their office visit.

    <textblock>
      We have designed a survey study that will be given to patients who have been prescribed a
      topical compound for pain management, wound care or scar care or to patients who have been
      requested to do a urinary drug test (UDT) by their provider.

      The initial survey for pain management, wound care, scar care or UDT will be given to the
      patient by their providers during their office visit.

      Follow-up surveys will be given at 30, 60, and 90 days. These surveys will be collected by
      e-mail or follow-up calls from Datum Research, LLC, contract research organization.

      Data collection for this study will be derived through the 4 patient surveys (initial, 30
      day, 60 day, and 90 day) and the prescription written by the provider.

      The survey study will enroll patients until December 31, 2014, or until sufficient numbers
      have been achieved.

      Rahm Foundation will continue the study until:

        -  Sufficient information has accumulated to meet the scientific objectives of the Study
           (i.e. numeric targets or effect size)

        -  The feasibility of collecting sufficient information diminishes to unacceptable levels,
           poor enrollment, loss to follow-up and/or

        -  Other methods of gathering appropriate information become achievable or are deemed
           preferable.

      Datum Research will need to have access to the prescription to see what compound was
      prescribed.

        Patients who are given a prescription for topical compound for pain, scar care, or wound

        or

        Patients who are given a UDT and agree to complete the surveys.

        Patients will be recruited into the study if their providers prescribe a topical cream for
        pain, scar care or wound care or if the provider performs a UDT prior to treatment or
        surgery. The providers will follow their office procedure for UDT. If they perform a UDT
        and the patient agrees to participate in the survey study, they will have the patient
        complete the surveys.
