      This study consist of treatment phase (12 weeks) and extension phase (40 weeks). This study
      is a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to evaluate
      mainly the safety and tolerability of 12-week repeated subcutaneous administration of E6011
      in Japanese subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis. First 12 subjects will enroll as 100 mg
      group, next 12 subjects will enroll as 200 mg group, and last 9 subjects will enroll as 400
      mg group. A total of 33 subjects will receive repeated subcutaneous administration of E6011.
      Subjects who roll over onto the Extension phase will have continued monitoring until 52 weeks
      after the initial administration.
