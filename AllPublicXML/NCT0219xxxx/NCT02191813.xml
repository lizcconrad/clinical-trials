        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy female volunteers between 18 and 30 years

          -  With skin type I or skin type II

          -  Body Mass Index &gt; 25

          -  Non-smokers

          -  Volunteers who have given their written informed consent according to Good Clinical
             Practice (GCP) and local regulations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious disorder that may interfere with her participation to the trial and
             evaluation of the safety of the test drug (e.g. liver and/or renal disease,
             hypervitaminosis A, psychic disorder, etc.), and/or treatment with chronic medication

          -  Pre-treatment (less than 2 weeks prior to inclusion in this trial) and/or concomitant
             treatment with any drug that may influence the trial symptomatology and may interfere
             with evaluation of the safety of the test drug (e.g. vitamins and minerals
             supplementation)

          -  Relevant allergy or known hypersensitivity to the investigational drug or its
             excipients

          -  High performance sports people

          -  Alcohol and drug abuse according to Diagnostic and Statistics Manual (DSM-IV)

          -  Female volunteers in child-bearing age not using adequate means of birth control
             (contraceptive pills, intrauterine device (IUDs), sterilization)

          -  Pregnancy and/or lactation

          -  Known abnormal values of the lab tests (if detected after enrolment, subjects will
             continue the treatment provided there are no medical objections)

          -  Abnormal values of Aspartate Transferase (SGOT/ASAT), Alanine Transferase
             (SGPT/ALAT)-, Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, Low density Lipoproteins/Triglycerides
             (LDL/TGL) levels in blood

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last 4 weeks and concurrent
             participation in another clinical trial

          -  Specific dietary requirements that do not allow the volunteers to meet the dietary
             guidelines set out for this study
