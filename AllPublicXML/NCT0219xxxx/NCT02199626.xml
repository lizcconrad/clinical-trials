    <textblock>
      This prospective pilot study of 40 pediatric patients with Crohn's Disease, that are
      candidates for endoscopic and imaging re-evaluation, examines the Given Diagnostic System and
      the second generation of colon capsule in comparison second generation of colon capsule
      endoscopy (CCE-2) to magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), small intestine contrast
      ultrasonography (SICUS) and endoscopy (upper and lower).

      This study aims

        1. To evaluate and compare the accuracy of CCE-2 with MRE, SICUS and endoscopy in the
           evaluation of pediatric Crohn's disease.

        2. To evaluate the safety of CCE-2 in pediatric CD.

        Volunteers: No

        Inclusion criteria:

        Subjects must meet one the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into
        this proposed study:

          -  diagnosis of Crohn's Disease made at least 3 months before the enrolment;

          -  subject was referred for endoscopic and imaging follow-up in Crohn's Disease

          -  signed informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:

          -  Subject has dysphagia

          -  Subject has renal insufficiency

          -  Subject is known structuring Crohn's Disease identified by magnetic resonance
             enterography (MRE) or small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS).

          -  Subject has had prior abdominal surgery of the gastrointestinal tract other than
             uncomplicated procedures that would be unlikely to lead to bowel obstruction based on
             the magnetic resonance enterography findings and clinical judgment of the
             investigator.
