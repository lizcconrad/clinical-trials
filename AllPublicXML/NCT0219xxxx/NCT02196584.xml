      Hypothesis: The RAVI-Guide provides superior patient acceptability to the conventional lid
      speculum during intravitreal injections

      Aims: To compare patient acceptance and procedural complication rates of the RAVI-Guide with
      those of the conventional lid speculum and caliper approach

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients age 18 years or older who undergo intravitreal injection for clinical
             indications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the age of 18 years

          -  Patients unable to give informed consent

          -  Disorders that preclude the ability to judge pain or discomfort associated with
             intravitreal injection

          -  Disorders that preclude the ability to assess for complications of intravitreal
             injection

          -  Inability to assess the landmarks by which localization of intravitreal injection
             sites is determined, such as obscured corneal limbus

          -  Inability to communicate directly to the physician and immediately after the procedure
             the level of pain or discomfort
