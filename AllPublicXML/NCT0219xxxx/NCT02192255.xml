    <textblock>
      This multisite pragmatic clinical trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of a single
      scripted telephone call to diabetes patients who (a) were currently above recommended
      clinical goals for glucose, blood pressure, or lipids, and (b) had recently been prescribed a
      new medication for that specific clinical domain. The goals of the intervention were to
      improve primary adherence and persistence to the newly prescribed medication and to improve
      control of glucose, blood pressure, and lipids.

      This randomized trial tested the hypothesis that a telephone contact with a patient recently
      prescribed a new medication for uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (A1c), blood pressure, or
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol would improve (a) primary medication adherence, (b)
      medication persistence, (c) medication possession ratio, and (d) A1c, blood pressure or
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control. This study was part of the larger Agency for
      Healthcare Research and Quality funded SUPREME-DM study. The clinical trial reported here was
      coordinated and led by HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, while data
      collection was coordinated through Kaiser Permanente Northwest and analysis was conducted at
      Kaiser Permanente Colorado. The clinical intervention sites for this study included Kaiser
      Permanente Northern California, Group Health Cooperative, Marshfield Clinic, and Geisinger
      Clinic.

    <description>In a pragmatic randomized trial, we randomly assigned 2,378 adults with diabetes mellitus who were recently prescribed a new class of medication for elevated glycated hemoglobin (A1c) &gt;= 8%, blood pressure &gt;= 140/90 mm Hg, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol &gt;=100 mg/dL, to receive (a) one scripted telephone call from a diabetes educator or clinical pharmacist to identify and address nonadherence to the new medication or (b) usual care. Hierarchical linear and logistic regression models were used to assess impact on (a) first medication fill within 60 days of prescription,</description>

    <description>The intervention arm consisted of one protocol-structured telephone call from an interventionist who was a nurse health manager (1 site), diabetes educator or diabetes educator trainee (1 site), or pharmacist (2 sites). Interventionists followed the same structured telephone interview protocol to ascertain whether the subject had started taking the new prescription. Those taking the new medication as prescribed received positive reinforcement. Those who either had not filled the prescription or were not taking the medication as directed, were asked about reasons for nonadherence and assisted in identifying and resolving barriers. The median call lasted &lt; than 5 minutes, and up to 3 call attempts were made. Most intervention calls occurred within 2 to 6 weeks after the prescription date.</description>
