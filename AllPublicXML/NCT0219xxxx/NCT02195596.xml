  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A program that combines high intensity aerobic exercise (&lt;85% of Heart Rate Reserve) with
      resistance, progressive and moderate intensity intervals, carried out in primary care, is
      effective in terms of a smaller increase in respect to the baseline measurement in the total
      score of the ADAS cognitive section (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section),in
      the control group that receives an intervention similar to low intensity (30-40% of Heart
      rate reserve).

      We Expect a difference of at least 3 points between the means of the increments between the
      intervention and control group.

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an intervention that combines high intensity aerobic exercise with
      strength (AAAD) on general cognitive performance of patients affected by mild Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial in two parallel groups: SCOPE: 2 health
      center of Basque Health Service , in coordination with its reference neurology services.
      PARTICIPANTS: 80 patients with mild AD.

      INTERVENTION: Both groups receiving standard drug treatment. The intervention group also
      receive a supervised EEAA program, while the control group receive a similar intervention at
      low intensity. Patients are followed up over 1 year. Three blind measurements are made
      repeatedly : baseline, at 6 and 12 months. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure is
      change in cognitive performance that is measured in a blinded way with the cognitive section
      of the ADAS scale (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) at 0, 6 and 12.Secondary Outcomes:
      Global cognitive performance (Neuropsychological battery TBR-B),neuropsychiatric symptoms
      (NPI), ADL (Blessed),functional capacity (Test of 6-minute walk), cardiorespiratory Test,
      muscular strength (hand dynamometer and trunk); PREDICTORS AND CONFOUNDING VARIABLES:
      baseline cognitive performance, previous physical activity, medication, age, sex, APOE,
      schooling and cognitive reserve. ANALYSIS: We compared the two groups in terms of observed
      mean changes from baseline in ADAS measurement and other variables, intention to treat, using
      longitudinal mixed effects models for repeated measures at 6 and 12 months.

    <description>Cognitive performance is measured in a blinded way with the cognitive section of the ADAS scale (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) at 0, 6 and 12. ADAS is an instrument designed to assess the severity of cognitive disorders (ADAS-Cog) and noncognitive (ADAS-cog) in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD). The ADAS-Cog, that we use, consists of 11 items that assess mainly memory (3 items, 27 points), orientation (1 item, 8 points), language (5 items, 25 points) and praxis (2 items, 10 points). The maximum score is 70 points.The higher the score, the greater the cognitive impairment.This is the primary outcome measure most frequently used in clinical trials with drugs.</description>

    <description>Global cognitive performance is measured with Test Barcelona TBR-B neuropsychological battery (abreviated version).The ADAS-COG wich is focused on the most devastated areas by Alzheimer's disease, will be complemented by the TBA-B, which has been developed in our environment, makes possible a more global assessment, and also presents adequate psychometric properties.</description>

    <description>The program consist in a &quot;Continuous High aerobic exercise and moderate intensity intervals&quot; (ShoshanaB et al, 2012) combined with &quot;muscular strength exercises and joint mobility&quot;. Patients come three times a week for six months to the primary health center. A fitness expert nurse is responsible for monitoring the performance and adapt to the physical condition of the patient.Each exercise session consists of warming up time period, period of work and back to calm. Exercise intensity during the work period increases progressively as the program progresses. Aerobic exercise is performed on a cycle ergometer or treadmill.Muscle strength exercises and joint mobility are performed with dumbbells and ankle weights adapted to each patient.</description>
