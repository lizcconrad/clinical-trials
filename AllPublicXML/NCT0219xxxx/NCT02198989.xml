    <textblock>
      40 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who also have sleep disorders and mild depression
      in the community will be recruited and stochastically divided into the intervention group and
      the control group. Both groups will take the same group education courses including DSME
      (Diabetes Self-management Education), psychological support, improvement in sleep. Patients
      in the intervention group will receive peer support and yoga music therapy before bed. The
      observation period will last for 6 months so as to evaluate the benefits of peer support and
      yoga music therapy in sleep quality improvement and glycemic control of type 2 diabetic
      patients with sleep disorders and mild depression.

      Research Method:

      This study is an open- label controlled randomized cluster trial with the sample size
      estimated by the improvement of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index（PSQI） score. 40 eligible and
      voluntary Type 2 diabetic patients will be recruited among the patients with health records
      in the community. Baseline assessment such as demography, sleep quality, depression, physical
      exam and biochemical index will be performed on the patients who will have signed the
      informed consents.

      The study will use the method of randomized to classify the enrolled units into 2 groups,
      each group has 20 people. Both groups will receive regular diabetes medication and group
      education courses including Diabetes Self-management Education(DSME), psychological support,
      improvement in sleep. The intervention group will be under the guidance of two well-trained
      peer supporters to carry out group activities. Each supporter will be in charge of 10-15
      patients. Starting with peer support therapy in the first three months, the intervention
      group will then take Yoga music therapy before bed for another three months and be given
      support and guidance by the peer supporters.

      Compare the baselines and variations of two group's sleep, depression, blood sugar and
      related biochemical indicators, and self-management, life quality, medication and other
      aspects at the third month and sixth month. The final evaluation will show the effect and
      related influencing factors of peer support and yoga music therapy in helping Type 2 diabetic
      patients who have sleep disorders and mild depression to improve their sleep quality.
