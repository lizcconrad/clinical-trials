    <textblock>
      This research study is looking at a new DARPin based medication, called MP0250. There is
      evidence from preclinical studies that MP0250 may be effective in the treatment of cancer.
      This is the first study of MP0250 in humans and its main purpose is to test its safety and
      tolerability in patients with cancer. This study will also examine how the drug is changed by
      and removed from the body and look for indicators that the drug may be effective against
      cancer. This study will test several different dose levels of the study drug to determine the
      safety and tolerability profile of the drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 18 years

          2. Histologically confirmed and documented advanced or metastatic solid tumour refractory
             to at least 1 prior regimen of standard treatment or for which no curative therapy is
             available and for whom MP0250 is a reasonable option

          3. Progressive or stable disease documented radiologically in the 4 weeks prior to
             screening

          4. Presence of a measurable tumour or a tumour evaluable per RECIST v1.1
