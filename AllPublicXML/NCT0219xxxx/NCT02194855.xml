  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators investigated whether laparoscopic versus open surgical approaches affected
      the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic of a single bolus dose of rocuronium or
      cisatracurium.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the blood flow in the right and middle hepatic veins</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of the blood flow in the right and middle hepatic veins were performed at baseline and 1,5, 10, 20, 30min after insufflation of carbon dioxide or incise the skin as well as 1 and 5 min after deflation or close the wound.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the plasma Concentration of rocuronium and cisatracurium</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Venous blood samples (3 ml) were taken 2 min prior to and at 5,30, 60 min following administration of rocuronium/cisatracurium.The aim of the present was to study the blood concentration of rocuronium/cisatracurium in laparoscopic surgery compared with conventional open gynaecological surgery</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>pharmacodynamic comparison of rocuronium and cisatracurium</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This study was undertaken to investigate the duration of action of 0.9 mg.kg-1 rocuronium or cisatracurium 0.15 mg.kg-1 administered during laparoscopic surgery compared with conventional open gynaecological surgery.Adductor pollicis train-of-four responses following ulnar nerve stimulation were monitored with mechanomyography.We recorded the time from the end of injection of rocuronium or cisatracurium to time to recovery of T1, and to recovery to 5% and 25% of baseline height</description>
