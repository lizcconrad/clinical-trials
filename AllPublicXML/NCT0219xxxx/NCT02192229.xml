      Abstract:

      The main objective of the proposed study is to examine the Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of
      the Dose Regimen of Vitamin D 50,000 IU (Biodal) tablet supplementation in the treatment of
      population with vitamin D deficiency.

      A randomized, double-blind placebo, Parallel design comparing vitamin D with Placebo will be
      conducted on 60 Healthy males and females with vitamin D deficiency, age from 18 to 49 years
      who attend the rehabilitation clinics at Jordan University Hospital .Participants who met the
      inclusion criteria will be asked to sign an informed witnessed consent form. Results obtained
      are expected to assess the safety and efficacy of the dose regimen used in this study as per
      Biodal SmPC. This study will also contribute to the global body of knowledge in this field.
      The major findings generated from this study could open certain avenues for further research
      through the association of the status of vitamin D in serum .

      The study design will be a prospective randomized double blind parallel design comparing
      Vitamin D with Placebo. This study will be conducted in Jordan University Hospital (JUH). The
      participants will be Healthy males and females with vitamin D deficiency (18 to 49 years
      old). All eligible males and females who agree to participate in the study will sign an
      informed witnessed consent form at the beginning of the study. The expected duration of
      participants participation will be around 120 days and the number of visits for each
      participant will be 6 visits divided as follows; the first visit will be before 7 days of the
      initiation of the trial (screening period), the second on day zero of the treatment period,
      the third on day 30, the fourth on day 60, the fifth on day 90 and the sixth or the last
      visit will be on day 104 (after 14 days of the last treatment). Therefore the treatment
      period will be 90 days and the post treatment follow up period will be 14 days.
