  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are compelling medical and public health reasons to reduce unnecessary consumption of
      antimalarials and strong evidence to support the use of RDTs in malaria case management. The
      primary study hypothesis to be tested is that clients who know they will receive a subsidy
      conditional on a positive test are more likely to opt for testing before deciding which drug
      to buy. The primary endpoint is whether subjects choose to be tested for malaria with a rapid
      diagnostic test. The secondary endpoint is whether they purchased an artemisinin combination
      therapy (ACT) or not. The primary outcome of interest is to compare the proportion of
      participants who choose to receive a free malaria diagnostic test when they can receive a
      subsidy for a discounted drug conditional on a positive test (Group A compared to Group B)
      compared to those without the offer of a conditional subsidy. The investigators will use an
      experimental design that randomly assigns clients to one of four groups. Field workers will
      canvas households in the study area looking for individuals who have fever or history of
      fever or illness in the last 24 hours (current illness) who have not yet taken drugs or
      sought treatment outside the home. Clients who meet the inclusion criteria and give verbal
      consent to participate will be randomly assigned to one of the four groups. They will be
      given the location and contact information for their local community health worker who can
      provide a malaria rapid diagnostic test if they choose to be tested. They will also complete
      a survey tool. One week later, the field worker will return to interview the participant and
      determine whether they were tested, what action they took for their illness, what medicine
      they purchased and how much they paid. The investigators will summarize clients' choice by
      the four randomized study groups.
