      -  Study objectives

             1. To compare the safety and long-term efficacy of coronary stenting with biostable
                polymer drug-eluting stent (Promus PremierTM, Xience Alpine®, Resolute Onyx®) with
                biodegradable polymer drug-eluting stent (Biomatrix®, Biomatrix Flex®, Nobori®,
                Ultimaster®, Synergy ® and Orsiro®) in patients with acute coronary syndrome

             2. To compare the efficacy and safety of 5 mg prasugrel maintenance therapy compared
                with 10 mg prasugrel maintenance therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome
                undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention

        -  Study design :

      Prospective, open-label, 2-by-2 multifactorial, randomized, multicenter trial to test the
      following in CHD patients

        1. Non-inferiority of biostable polymer drug-eluting stent (Promus PremierTM, Xience
           Alpine®, Resolute Onyx®) compared with biodegradable polymer drug-eluting stent
           (Biomatrix®, Biomatrix Flex®, Nobori®, Ultimaster®, Synergy ® and Orsiro®) in terms of
           patient-oriented composite outcome

        2. Non-inferiority of 5 mg compared to 10 mg dose of prasugrel maintenance in terms of
           major adverse cardiovascular events

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 3400 patients derived from a population of Korean patients with acute coronary syndrome
      receiving percutaneous coronary intervention will be enrolled in the present trial.

      All patients will receive a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg bolus) will
      be administered. Sixty-mg-loading dose of prasugrel will be given regardless of pretreated
      antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or cilostazol). However, in patients who
      already loaded with other antiplatelet agents (clopidigrel, ticagrelor, or cilostazol),
      reduced dose (30mg) or omission of prasugrel loading is acceptable. Following angiography,
      patients with significant diameter stenosis &gt;50% of coronary artery or graft vessel by visual
      estimation that have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina, and have lesions
      that are eligible for coronary intervention without any exclusion criteria, will be
      randomized 1:1 to either receive either BS-DES or BD-DES group.

      At 1-month clinical follow-up, patients eligible for antiplatelet comparison will be
      additionally randomized 1:1 to either receive the reduce dose of prasugrel (5 mg daily) or
      conventional dose (10 mg daily). The exclusion criteria (age ≥75 years, body weight &lt;60 kg,
      or history of TIA or stroke) is classified as observational cohort. Post-PCI, dual
      antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 1 year. Follow-up data will be collected
      until 3-year after index procedure.
