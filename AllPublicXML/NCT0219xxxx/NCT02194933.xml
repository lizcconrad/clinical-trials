    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of brexpiprazole, via functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), on the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activated by
      impulsive behavior.

             only), with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical
             Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria and
             confirmed by both the M.I.N.I. for Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders Studies, and
             an adequate clinical psychiatric evaluation.

          -  Have a CGI-S score of ≤ 4 (moderately ill) at screening and baseline.

          -  Have a score of ≤ 4 (moderate) on PANSS item G8 (uncooperativeness) at screening and
             baseline.

          -  Have a BIS-11 score of ≥ 50 at screening and baseline.

          -  Willing to discontinue all prohibited psychotropic medications to meet
             protocol-required washouts prior to and during the trial period.

          -  Are stable on their current oral antipsychotic medication (no changes within the last

             medication.

          -  Have received previous outpatient antipsychotic treatment at an adequate dose (at
             least minimal recommended dose for the treatment of schizophrenia according to the
             manufacturer labeling) for an adequate duration (at least 6 weeks) and showed a
             previous good response to such antipsychotic treatment (other than clozapine) in the

             schizophrenia in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Experiencing acute onset of clinically significant depressive symptoms within the past
             30 days, according to the investigator's opinion.

             last 6 months, OR Answer &quot;Yes&quot; on the C-SSRS Suicidal Ideation Item 5 (Active Suicidal
             Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent) and whose most recent episode meeting criteria
             for this C-SSRS Item 5 occurred within the last 6 months OR Answer &quot;Yes&quot; on any of the
             5 C-SSRS Suicidal Behavior Items (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted
             attempt, preparatory acts, or behavior) and whose most recent episode meeting criteria
             for any of these 5 C-SSRS Suicidal Behavior Items occurred within the last 2 years, OR
             who, in the opinion of the investigator, present a serious risk of suicide.
