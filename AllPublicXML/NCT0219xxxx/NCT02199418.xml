    <textblock>
      The investigators hypotheses that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin in a weekly-based
      regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective and tolerable for locally advanced breast
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, all the patients will have weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin as neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy for 4 cycles. Patients with Her2 positive tumor will also receive the
      trastuzumab.
