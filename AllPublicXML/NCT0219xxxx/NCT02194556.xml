  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised, controlled, open-label, prospective trial is designed to assess the efficacy
      and safety of icotinib maintenance therapy after sequential Icotinib plus chemotherapy versus
      Icotinib maintenance therapy after chemotherapy in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer
      patients with EGFR mutation.

    <description>A duration from randomization date to disease progression(as defined by RECIST) or death. If a participant are known to have progressed, the time to progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progression. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known not to be progressed.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>

    <description>Overall Survival is assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant is known to have died, the time to death is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known to be alive.</description>
