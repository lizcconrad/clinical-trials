  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine if there are changes in heart function following
      completion of radiation therapy for breast cancer as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging (cardiac MRI) scans. Additional purposes of this study are to assess cardiac side
      effects from radiation treatment, evaluate cardiac MRI changes by radiation technique, and
      compare quality of life questionnaires.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of this study, participants will have a cardiac MRI at baseline and a follow-up
      cardiac MRI within 1 year after completion of standard radiation therapy for left-sided
      breast cancer. The cardiac MRI scans will be evaluated to determine if there are changes in
      cardiac function within 1 year after radiation treatment.

      Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire before and after treatment that asks about
      their health and any symptoms they may be having.

      Physical exams and any other standard of care service or treatment will be at the discretion
      of the treating physician.
