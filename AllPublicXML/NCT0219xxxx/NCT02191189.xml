             first study day. Diarrhoea will be defined as the passage of liquid faeces and/or a
             stool frequency of greater than three times per day. Constipation will be defined as a
             failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are considered by the investigator to
             be at risk of transmitting through blood and other body fluids the agents responsible
             for AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) or other sexually transmitted disease or
             hepatitis. This will be achieved by the use of a card (similar to that used by the
             National Blood Transfusion Service), which asks a potential subject if they have
             reason to believe that they may fall into any category included on the card. If the
             verbal answer is in the affirmative then they will be excluded from the study.

          -  Positive hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV test results

          -  Subjects receiving prohibited medication. Subjects must not stop taking a prescribed
             medication for the purpose of entering the study.

          -  Failure to satisfy the Principal Medical Investigator of fitness to participate for
             any other reason

        As a precaution, male subjects will be instructed to use appropriate barrier method
        contraception (e.g. condoms and spermicide) during the time interval between taking the
        first dose and three months following the last dose. Subjects will be advised to inform
        Pharmaceutical Profiles if their partner becomes pregnant within three months of them
        receiving the last dose of the study drug. Pharmaceutical Profiles will monitor the
        pregnancy to conclusion.
