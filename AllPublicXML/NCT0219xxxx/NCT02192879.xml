  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of three alternative methods of analgesia
      in patients undergoing complex liver resection surgery: 1) thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA),
      2) continuous paravertebral block (PVB) with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and 3)
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) alone. Regional anesthesia techniques such as TEA and PVB
      may improve recovery and decrease postoperative pain scores in addition to other benefits
      such earlier return of bowel function and shortened length of hospital stay, although some
      practitioners have voiced concerns about the safety and efficacy of these techniques in
      patients after liver resection who may develop postoperative coagulation abnormalities. The
      investigators plan to enroll a total of 150 patients (adults &gt;/= 18 years of age who meet
      study criteria) scheduled for complex liver resection surgery in this study, who will then be
      randomized into 50 patients per arm of the study (3 total arms). Postoperative pain scores
      will be collected in PACU and throughout the patient's hospital stay as well as routine blood
      tests including complete blood count, coagulation labs (PT/INR, aPTT) and serum creatinine to
      measure renal function. The study team will also collect additional data prospectively on all
      patients enrolled in the study; these parameters will include age, sex, type of operation
      performed, length of operation, volume of intraoperative blood loss, volume of intraoperative
      fluid administration including blood products, daily postoperative intravenous fluid
      administration, length of time to first feeding, day of epidural catheter removal, length of
      hospital stay and incidence of major postoperative complications (surgical, respiratory,
      cardiac, renal, etc.). Once primary and secondary data points are obtained, the data will
      undergo rigorous statistical analysis using the appropriate statistical techniques to
      determine the outcomes. The investigators propose that epidural and/or paravertebral
      analgesia may improve recovery times and decrease hospital length of stay, which would be
      beneficial for the patient as well as decrease hospital costs. In addition, if better
      postoperative pain management scores can be achieved with epidural or paravertebral
      analgesia, and no significant prolonged postoperative coagulopathy is associated with
      patients undergoing major hepatic resection surgical procedures, these regional analgesia
      strategies can be considered a safe option for pain management in this patient population.

    <description>Post-operative pain scores at rest, as assessed by Pain Assessment Scales (Wong-Baker Faces Scale and Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) will be the primary outcome measured. Pain scores will be collected per standard PACU protocol (every 60 minutes) and on the hospital ward at hours 2, 4, 6 and 12, and then daily until day 3 or when the epidural/paravertebral catheter is removed. Postoperative pain at rest will be defined as the highest VAS pain score reported by each patient at any time. Pain score is from 0 (no hurt) to 10 (hurts worst).</description>

At the end of surgery, infusion will be changed to 0.125% bupivacaine + 10mcg/ml hydromorphone at 4-6ml/hour. In PACU, a PCEA button will given to the patient for bolus dosing of 1-2ml and a lockout of 30 minutes.

        <description>Post-operative pain scores at rest, as assessed by Pain Assessment Scales (Wong-Baker Faces Scale and Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) will be the primary outcome measured. Pain scores will be collected per standard PACU protocol (every 60 minutes) and on the hospital ward at hours 2, 4, 6 and 12, and then daily until day 3 or when the epidural/paravertebral catheter is removed. Postoperative pain at rest will be defined as the highest VAS pain score reported by each patient at any time. Pain score is from 0 (no hurt) to 10 (hurts worst).</description>
