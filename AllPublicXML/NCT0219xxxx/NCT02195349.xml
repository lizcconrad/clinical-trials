  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, randomised, double blind (sponsor unblinded), placebo-controlled,
      single ascending dose study GSK2831781 administered by IV. GSK2831781 is a humanized Antibody
      Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced monoclonal afucosylated antibody that is specific
      to the Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3 (LAG-3) protein. This is the first administration of
      GSK2831781 in humans and will evaluate in two parts the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity of single IV doses of
      GSK2831781 administered to healthy subjects previously vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette
      Guérin (BCG) (Part A delayed type hypersensitivity [DTH] cohorts) and patients with plaque
      psoriasis (Part B). The inclusion of DTH and psoriasis subjects to explore the mechanism in
      biopsies and clinical response endpoints in these populations, as well as investigate
      systemic biomarkers will provide useful information prior to conducting studies in other
      immune-inflammatory disease which will involve more invasive tissue biopsies. Measuring the
      pharmacology of GSK2831781 using the depletion of LAG-3+ T-cells in skin biopsies from
      Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) skin challenge and lesional skin biopsies from
      patients with psoriasis, will be helpful in understanding of the dose response relationship,
      which will be important for designing future studies in immuno-inflammatory diseases,
      including psoriasis. Approximately 67 subjects will be enrolled to complete dosing and
      critical assessments. The subject numbers will be split to approximately 40 healthy subjects
      (Part A) and 27 patients with psoriasis (Part B).

Depending on the safety data obtained for 28 days post dose along with the available PK data, a dose escalation may be done to the next planned dose (0.0015 , 0.0075, 0.04, 0.15 mg/kg). In case safety findings are noted then the cohort may be expanded to a maximum cohort size of 6:3 (GSK2831781: placebo) or the escalation will be stopped.</description>
