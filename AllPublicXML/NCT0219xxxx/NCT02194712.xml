  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schistosomiasis is increasingly encountered among travellers returning from the tropics and
      is known for its focal endemicity, associated with the presence of the snail intermediate
      host in fresh water. Because schistosomiasis in travellers is often atypical or asymptomatic
      due to the low intensity of infection, many infections likely go undiagnosed and will develop
      into chronic schistosomiasis. Conventional treatment of schistosomiasis in travellers with
      praziquantel 40mg/kg daily dose is known for its modest success rate. Diagnosis of
      schistosomiasis relies on egg detection, which has a poor sensitivity in low burden
      infections, or serology, which is inadequate to monitor cure. The department of parasitology
      of the Leiden University Medical Center has developed a novel diagnostic test based on the
      up-converting phosphor technology (UCP) to detect circulating anodic antigen (CAA). This test
      can be performed on serum and urine to detect low intensity schistosomiasis infections and
      confirm cure after praziquantel treatment. This study will assess the performance of UCP-CAA
      in travellers with high-risk water contact.

    <description>The diagnostic performance of UCP-CAA will be assessed by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of UCP-CAA measurement in travellers 12 weeks after reported high-risk water contact. Routine diagnostics performed by the individual centers, such as serology, will be the standard against which sensitivity (number of cases positive in both tests / number of cases positive in routine diagnostics) and specificity (number of cases negative in both tests / number of cases negative in routine diagnostics) is calculated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Any self-reported high risk water contact, including wading, showering, surfing,
             walking along wet shore bare-footed or washing with water from a high-risk source,
             within 12 weeks prior to reporting to the outpatient department

          2. Agreement to perform routine diagnostic procedures to diagnose schistosomiasis
             infection

          3. Willing to provide a maximum of three additional blood samples in addition to routine
             diagnostic procedures

          4. Able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment for schistosomiasis

          2. Known positive schistosomiasis serology

          3. The use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs at presentation that compromise
             the interpretation of schistosomiasis serology
