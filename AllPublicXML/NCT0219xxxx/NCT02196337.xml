  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether universal salt iodization (USI) meets the
      iodine requirements of pregnant women, lactating women and infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because pregnant women, lactating women and infants are the groups most vulnerable to iodine
      deficiency and its irreversible consequences, programs should focus on these groups. But like
      other mass fortification strategies, it is uncertain whether USI can meet the increased
      dietary requirements of pregnant women, lactating women and infants. Objective of this study
      to test whether USI can meet the dietary requirements of iodine in women of reproductive age,
      pregnant women, lactating women and infants up to 2 years of age without causing excess
      iodine intake in school children and non-pregnant non-lactating women. The study hypothesis
      is that USI, when fortified at adequate levels and applied to all salt consumed, including
      both household salt and salt used for processed foods, provides adequate dietary iodine for
      all population groups, except for weaning infants; while not posing any risk of excessive
      iodine intakes in other age groups.
