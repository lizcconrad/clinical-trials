        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male volunteers who have Broca-Indices within +-20%

          -  Participants in the age range between 21 to 50 years

          -  In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation each volunteers
             are supposed to give their written informed consent prior to admission to the study.
             Subsequently each subject was to receive a complete medical examination (including
             blood pressure, pulse rate, medical history, documentation of demographics,
             inclusion/exclusion criteria and concomitant therapy) as well as a 12-lead
             Electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Haematopoietic, hepatic and renal function test will be carried out in the laboratory

          -  The subjects will fast for 12 hours before collection of specimens for all laboratory
             evaluations. The above mentioned examinations will be performed within 14 days before
             the first administration of the test substance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate or ECG)
             or laboratory tests deviating form normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant
             to the trial as judged by the investigator

          -  Intake of a drug with a long half-life (&gt;= 24 hours) within at least one month or less
             than ten half-lives of the respective drug before enrolment in the study

          -  Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial within seven days
             prior to administration or during the trial

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within the last two months
             prior to the start of the study

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on study days

          -  History of alcohol abuse and/or alcohol abuse

          -  Drug abuse

          -  Blood donation (&gt;100 ml) within four weeks prior to administration

          -  Other disease or abnormality of clinical relevance

          -  Excessive physical activities within two weeks prior to administration or during the
             trial
