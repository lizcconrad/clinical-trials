      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a habit reversal based
      treatment programme for children and adolescents with tic disorders. This habit reversal
      treatment programme was developed at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and
      Psychotherapy at the University of Cologne and has already been evaluated in a pilot-study
      (Woitecki &amp; Döpfner, 2011, 2012).
