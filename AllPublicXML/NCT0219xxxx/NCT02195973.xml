  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a new drug, LDE225, is safe and has beneficial
      effects when combined with paclitaxel in women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer.
      Platinum resistant ovarian cancer refers to recurrent ovarian cancer that has undergone
      chemotherapy inclusive of a platinum compound (e.g. carboplatin or cisplatin).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer remains the deadliest gynecologic cancer with a fairly low long-term cure
      rate. LDE225 is a new type of drug that inhibits or blocks a pathway responsible for cancer
      cell growth. LDE225 is an investigational drug that has been used either solely or in
      combination with chemotherapy in other types of cancer but not in ovarian cancer. Research
      evidence suggests that by combining LDE225 and paclitaxel together, ovarian cancer cells may
      become more responsive to treatment.

             discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting sonidegib treatment. If it is
             essential that the patient remain on a statin to control hyperlididemia, only
             pravastatin may be used with extra caution

          -  Patients who are planning on embarking on a new strenuous exercise regimen after
             initiation of study treatment. Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that
             can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided whilst on

                  history of prolonged QT-interval syndromes

               5. Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure,
                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor
                  compliance with an antihypertensive regimen)

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt;5 mIU/mL)

          -  Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study
             and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment

             a. Women of childbearing potential defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant. Must use highly effective contraception during the study and
             through 20 months after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective
             contraception is defined as either:

               1. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               2. Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman had
                  been confirmed by follow- up hormone level assessment

               3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female study patients, the
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient

               4. Use a combination of the following (both a + b):

                    1. Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non- hormonal
                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier method of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                       Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the
                       effectiveness of hormonal contraception.

                       Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential
                       if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt;40
                       mIU/mL and estradiol &lt;20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                       (with or without hysterectomy) at least six week ago. In the case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                       child bearing potential.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of the study

          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have
             narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment
             with sonidegib. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued
             at least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with sonidegib
