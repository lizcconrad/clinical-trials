  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this first pilot study, we will examine the effects of acetaminophen dosing in adult
      patients with NAFLD in comparison to the effects in a healthy control group. Both groups will
      receive 3 grams (g) of acetaminophen, the maximum recommended daily dose, daily for 14 days.
      We hypothesize that NAFLD patients are more prone to APAP toxicity than normal
      controls.Treatment will be stopped after two weeks or in the following conditions:

      Treatment with APAP will be stopped in healthy volunteers if ALT and/or AST reached three
      times the ULN. In patients with NAFLD, treatment will be stopped if: ALT or AST reach ≥ three
      times the upper limit of entry value or ≥ 5 times the ULN; or if there is ALT or AST &gt;3 times
      ULN and TBili &gt;2xULN or INR &gt;1.5; or if there is ALT or AST &gt;3 times ULN with the appearance
      of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or
      eosinophilia (&gt;5%). We follow a conservative approach derived from the FDA guidelines for
      stopping medications expected to cause drug induced liver injury (DILI). Indeed, the FDA
      allows continuation of the medication until ALT or AST are &gt;8x ULN in the absence of elevated
      Tbili or INR. Patients who have hepatotoxicity will have close monitoring of their liver
      enzymes until they normalize. Taking acetaminophen up to 3g daily has been shown to be safe
      and acceptable. We have followed very strict criteria for monitoring and stopping rules
      however in the usually cases of toxicity the patient will be admitted for monitoring.

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Liver injury in controls will be defined as an increase in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level and/or Aspartae aminotransferase (AST) ≥ three times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Liver Injury in NAFLD patients will be defined as rise of ALT and/or AST ≥3 times baseline levels (which are likely to be elevated) and reaching 5 times ULN. Acetaminophen will be immediately discontinued once the ALT and/or AST reache the defined liver injury level and patients will continue to be monitored. Comparison between the two groups will assess whether or not NAFLD patients are more prone to liver injury than controls.</description>

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>We plan to measure the serum and urine levels of APAP metabolites including serum levels of acetaminophen-glucuronide (APAP-G) and acetaminophen-sulfate (APAP-S) and the urine levels of cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates (APAP-C and APAP-M). We also plan to measure APAP protein adducts which are biomarkers of APAP metabolism, reflecting oxidation of APAP and generation of the reactive metabolite NAPQI. We will measure the serum glutathione level and serum markers of mitochondrial injury, including glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and acylcarnitine, as well as markers of necrosis such as miR-122, high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), full-length keratin 18 and apoptosis marker keratin 18 fragments. The activity of UGT will be estimated by the plasma ratio of APAP-G to APAP at 4 hours (when the first sample is drawn). Expression of CYP2E1 in the peripheral lymphocytes will be assessed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).</description>
