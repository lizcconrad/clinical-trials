  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide validation of patient-reported data in the VCRC
      Patient Contact Registry by comparing patient-reported data with data provided by the
      physician who is the primary provider caring for the patient's vasculitis. Patients enrolled
      in the Patient Contact Registry with Behcet's disease, eosinophilic granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss) (EGPA), giant cell arteritis (GCA), granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), polyarteritis nodosa (PAN),
      and Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) were invited via email to participate in this study.

  <detailed_description>

      Via email, consent was obtained from at least 20 randomly selected patients with the seven
      forms of vasculitis detailed above in the VCRC Patient Contact Registry who have completed
      the Diagnostic Questionnaire. The form was sent in PDF format to the patient, who either
      printed out or emailed the form to his or her primary vasculitis provider to complete. This
      form included the same questions in the patient questionnaire, with minor reformatting and a
      few expanded details to verify the patient-provided data (please see appendix B). If the 20
      questionnaires are not returned one month after the initial recruitment email to the Patient
      Contact Registry participants, 20 additional participants with the seven forms of vasculitis
      will be selected randomly and will be asked to participate in this study. The survey data is
      stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network's (RDCRN) Data Management and
      Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. The data is de-identified.
      Names or other personal health information were not collected. Upon conclusion of the study
      period, the data will be sent to Dr. Kathleen McKinnon. All data collected will be sent to
      the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) to be stored indefinitely.

        (or print copy, if they prefer), and request specific chart items from their office to
        further verify the data. The sensitivity and specificity for various combinations of the
        diagnostic questions to predict vasculitis and to confirm type of vasculitis will be
        calculated using physician diagnosis / chart review as the gold standard.
