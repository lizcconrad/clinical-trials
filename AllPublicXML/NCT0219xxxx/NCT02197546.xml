  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stimulation of acupoint LI4 has been shown to result in analgesic effects in patients
      experiencing acute pain. We aimed to determine whether LI4 acupuncture could reduce pain and
      distress in children receiving an injection of a local anaesthetic (LA). Children scheduled
      for dental treatment using local anesthesia as a standard treatment, received bilateral
      acupuncture at LI4 using indwelling fixed needles. During the treatment, the parents of the
      patients stimulated the needles by massage. Two different treatment regimes were compared: a
      standardized LA injection given 5 minutes after acupuncture, and an LA injection without
      acupuncture. The order of treatment was randomised, with the two treatments performed on
      different days. Pain intensity during LA injection, assessed by the patient with the Verbal
      Rating Scale or Faces Pain Scale (0-10), was used as the primary endpoint. Parent- and
      dentist-assessed pain intensity and agitation, heart rate, and the patients' satisfaction
      with the received therapy were also recorded.
