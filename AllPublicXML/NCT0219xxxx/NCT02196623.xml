  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is the primary risk factor for most chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Sarcopenia and muscular mitochondrial dysfunction with aging are crucial mechanisms
      leading to decreased exercise tolerance and worsened insulin sensitivity. Thus, metabolic
      disease and frailty, which limits physical mobility as well as quality of life, share common
      cellular mechanisms.

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that a combination of normobaric hypoxia and
      exercise training elicits a synergistic effect on age-associated metabolic skeletal muscle
      dysfunction and the investigators will address the molecular mechanisms. In a randomized
      clinical study, the investigators will compare normoxic and hypoxic training conditions in
      elderly subjects. Outcome measures will focus on whole body insulin sensitivity and
      mitochondrial responses in skeletal muscle before and after the 8-week training intervention.
