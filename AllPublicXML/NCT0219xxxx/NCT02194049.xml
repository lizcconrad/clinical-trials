    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 when
      given together with cisplatin and etoposide in treating patients with advanced solid tumors
      or small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing , or by stopping them from spreading. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving PI3K
      inhibitor BKM120 with cisplatin and etoposide may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of combining BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor BKM120) with
      cisplatin and etoposide in advanced solid tumors, with emphasis on small cell lung cancer
      (SCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the MTD (maximally tolerated dose) of BKM120 in combination with
      cisplatin/etoposide.

      II. To describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and toxicity profile associated with
      BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide.

      III. To determine the preliminary efficacy of BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide
      in an expanded cohort of patients with SCLC.

      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of BKM120 in this combination.

      V. To collect blood samples for future exploratory biomarker analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120.

      Patients receive PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
