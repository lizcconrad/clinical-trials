  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is an autoimmune cutaneous disorder that destroys melanocytes leading to depigmented
      areas of skin. In the United States, vitiligo affects 1% of patients, causing not only
      changes in the color of skin, but also significant cosmetic concerns and quality of life
      issues. Current treatment modalities, which include topical corticosteroids, intralesional
      corticosteroids, phototherapy, and systemic immunosuppression, are variably effective in
      inducing repigmentation. Unfortunately, some cases of vitiligo are refractory to treatment.
      There is a need for new, effective modalities to treat patients with otherwise refractory
      vitiligo.

      Needling is an office based procedure that theoretically transposes healthy, pigmented skin
      cells to depigmented areas using a needle in vitiligo patients. Two preliminary studies of
      needling as a novel treatment for vitiligo had promising results but were limited by small
      sample size and subjective results.

      The proposed randomized control trial (RCT) will further investigate the use of needling to
      treat vitiligo. It differs from the previous studies in that it seeks to identify the cause
      of clinical benefit by comparing needling alone to needling with corticosteroid, examines a
      larger number of patients, and quantifies improvement using confocal microscopy. Confocal
      microscopy (CFM) allows non-invasive visualization of the skin on a cellular level and has
      been used in the past to diagnose cutaneous pigmentary conditions. This study would be the
      first RCT of needling in vitiligo to use an objective measure to quantify results, thus has
      the potential to establish needling as a novel, effective treatment for vitiligo and to
      evaluate the utility of CFM for monitoring response to treatment.

    <description>Needling is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into normally pigmented skin on the rim of a vitiligo patch and then is pushed into the center of the patch, theoretically moving healthy, pigmented skin cells into the vitiligo patch. Saline, which doesn't affect repigmentation in vitiligo, will be injected into the patch at multiple sites spaced approximately 1 cm apart with 0.1-0.2 cc of saline injected at each site.</description>
