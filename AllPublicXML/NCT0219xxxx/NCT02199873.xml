  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to obtain information about the safety and tolerability
      of BIIX 1 XX, to determine the pharmacologically active dose (range) by performing a
      methacholine challenge test and to obtain preliminary pharmacokinetic data

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male volunteers who have Broca-Indices within +-20%

          -  Participants in the age range between 21 to 50 years

          -  Following the methacholine challenge the airway resistance (Raw) shows an increase of
             at least 130%

          -  In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation each volunteer
             is supposed to give his written informed consent prior to admission to the study

          -  As part of the screening (within 14 days before drug administration), each subject was
             to receive a complete medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate,
             medical history, documentation of demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria and
             concomitant therapy) as well as a 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Haematopoietic, hepatic and renal function test will be carried out in the laboratory

          -  The subjects will fast for 12 hours before collection of specimens for all laboratory
             evaluations. The above mentioned examinations will be performed within 14 days before
             the first administration of the test substance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers will be excluded from the study if the results of the medical examination
             or laboratory tests are judged by the clinical investigator to differ significantly
             from normal clinical values

          -  Volunteers with known gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,
             metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Volunteers with diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or with
             psychiatric disorders

          -  History of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant
             to the trial as judged by the investigator

          -  Intake of a drug with a long half-life (&gt;= 24 hours) within one month before enrolment
             in the study

          -  Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial the week previous to
             the start of the study

          -  Participation in another study with an investigational drug within the last two months
             preceding this study

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on study days

          -  Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60g/day)

          -  Drug abuse

          -  Blood donation within the last 4 weeks

          -  Excessive physical activities within the last week before the study
