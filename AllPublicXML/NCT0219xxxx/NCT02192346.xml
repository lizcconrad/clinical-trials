  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find the highest dose of α-TEA that can be given to patients
      safely, to identify potential side effects of α-TEA, and to measure the amount of α-TEA in
      patients' blood.

      Additional goals of this study are to monitor the effect on tumors, to check for specific
      immune cells circulating in the blood, and to see if there are certain features of tumors
      that make it possible to predict the response to α-TEA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study in which doses ranging from 2.4 mg/kg to 26.8 mg/kg of α-TEA
      will be tested.

      The main clinical objectives of this phase I two-stage dose-escalation trial will be to
      characterize α-TEA related toxicity, determine the maximum tolerated dose, and
      pharmacokinetics of α-TEA in humans. Tumor response and exploratory immunological monitoring
      will also be performed. Specifically, we will determine the frequency of circulating
      peripheral T cell subset populations including CD4+, CD8+ T cells and their activation status
      (central memory, effector cells) and regulatory T cells (CD4/CD25/Foxp3). Exploratory
      monitoring to assess tumor apoptosis and serum cytokine levels will also be performed to gain
      additional insight on the influence of α-TEA on the immune response and tumor. An assessment
      of the immunoscore in patients with tumor amenable to biopsy will also provide
      hypothesis-generating data on the influence of α-TEA on the tumor microenvironment.

    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are seen in clinic 7 times over a 28-day period. Patients will have 6 physical exams and meet with a research nurse 5 times for evaluation of any potential drug-related toxicities. In addition, blood will be drawn 7 times for complete blood counts and metabolic panel to check for hematological toxicities. After 28 days, a review of all safety data will determine whether the dose will be increased for subsequent patients.</description>

             steroids for management of CNS metastatic disease are not eligible.

          -  Surgery or severe trauma within 4 weeks of study entry (minimally invasive procedures
             acceptable).

          -  Active brain metastatic disease. Patients with brain metastases who have been treated
             with surgery, gamma-knife radiosurgery or radiation and no radiographic progression
             for at least 4 weeks and off steroids are eligible.

          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the PI would preclude
             compliance with study procedures.

          -  Vitamin E supplements

          -  QTc greater than 450 msec at baseline (calculated using Bazett's formula), sick-sinus
