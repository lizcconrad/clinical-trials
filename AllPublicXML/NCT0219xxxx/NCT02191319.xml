      Collecting data on maintaining anti-retroviral activity (quantitative HIV RNA determination)
      and immunological activity (CD4 cells) after switching from protease inhibitor or NNRTI to
      Nevirapine (Viramune®) and collecting of routinely observed laboratory data on lipids, and
      liver enzymes.
