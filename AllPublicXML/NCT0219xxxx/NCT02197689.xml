  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taiwan has attracted much attention for its National Health Insurance (NHI) and healthcare
      system around the world with many countries in Europe and the United States using it as a
      benchmark. However, increasing medication costs over the past two years account for more than
      25% of total expenditure, surpassing every OECD member and mounting increasing pressure on
      the NHI. Nevertheless, patient medication adherence is relatively low. Thus, the
      investigators assessed the effectiveness of a personalized medication management system for
      improving the medication adherence for patients, in order to save long term medication costs.

      Design, Setting and Patients: The investigators developed a mobile personalized medication
      management platform (PMMP) to reduce delayed and missed medications. The investigators
      conducted a randomized control trial in medical centers of northern Taiwan from January 2010
      to July 2012 using 1198 participants that missed or delayed their medications during past
      three days. They received a minimum 7-day to 14-day maximum medication prescription.

      Interventions: Patients were randomized into a control group which non-received any SMS
      reminder for medication using and an intervention group which received a SMS reminder
      everyday in mobile devices.

      Primary Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcomes were compared patient medication
      adherence among experimental and control groups.
