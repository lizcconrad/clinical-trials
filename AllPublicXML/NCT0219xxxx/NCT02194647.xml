      BACKGROUND:

      One-year adherence to oral anti-osteoporosis medication (AOMs) was only about 30%. In recent
      years, efforts have been made to change the delivery of these medications from oral form to
      injection form every, 3, 6 or 12 months to increase adherence. However, both patients and
      providers are sometimes confused about the multiple choices. Also, patients may receive extra
      medications if providers did not keep tract of their previous AOM uses or patients may
      changes providers. There were urgent needs to provide AOM monitoring and management services
      to improve cares.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To establish a anti-osteoporosis medication management service at National Taiwan University
      Hospital and its BeiHu Branch.

      METHODS:

      Participating physicians will select those eligible for services and refer to study
      coordinators. Study coordinators will conduct baseline assessments on osteoporosis/fracture
      risks, record medical conditions, AOMs, provide educations on osteoporosis, fracture,
      sarcopenia, fall, medications, nutrition, and exercise. They also arrange return clinic
      visit, telephone reminder and follow up for patients, and communicate with providers on
      regular bases. the investigators plan to enroll 500 patients with 18-month follow up for
      each.

    <description>Medication adherence will be assessed at 4, 8, 12, 18 months after enrollments. Final results will be reported at 18 month. If the patient changes medication, all AOMs adherence will be combined.
Specific formula is as below:
for oral medications, adherence is defined as # medication taken/ #medication prescribed within past 3 months for injection medications, adherence is defined as # of injection/ # of due injection since baseline or last follow up phone call.
Statistics: Simple counts of adherence % among all participants.</description>
