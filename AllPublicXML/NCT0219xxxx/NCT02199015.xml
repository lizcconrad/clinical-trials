      The aim of our work is to investigate whether electrical Lateral Cord Stimulation (LCS)
      causes an inhibitory and modulatory action by indirect cerebellar activation, so releasing
      spasticity and the spastic syndrome in selected cases of patients with cerebral palsy

      PROJECT Lateral Cord Stimulation was thought by the author to be employed in patients with
      spastic cerebral palsy with the aim to improve tonus, motor function and speech.

      Nevertheless, as it has been demonstrated as acting on the basic phenomena related with
      spasticity, it's to say the propagated spinal responses, its use could be extended to other
      forms of spastic disease, like spastic limbs post stroke, brain congenital malformations
      producing spasticity and motor disorders as the main signs, post anoxic encephalopathy, etc.

      In this preliminary clinical trial, classed as phase 3, our sample must be very limited to
      assure stable conditions for statistical significance, hence our group is going to be
      circumscribed to certain conditions and pathology.

      In the future, as long the method could spread its use, the extension on indications in other
      pathological conditions is advisable thus, its possibilities of marketing could be enlarged
      with its use in a broader spectrum of spastic patients.

      Calculated risks are similar to those related with the ancient surgical technique called
      &quot;Scoville&quot;technique, currently employed time ago for cervical discectomy (6) Investigational
      plan The purpose of this clinical trial is to release spasticity and by this means improve
      the condition of patients with spastic cerebral palsy by extradural lateral cord electrical
      stimulation, by using currently employed electrodes and neurostimulators Those devices are
      already FDA approved and currently used for Dorsal Column Stimulation with the objective to
      treat chronic Pain and spasticity (Spasmodic Torticollis).

    <measure>Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 baseline evaluation. One post operative evaluation every 30 day during six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Ashworth scale has 5 points, they are: 1) no increase in muscle tone; 2) slight increase giving a catch when part is moved in flexion or extension; 3) more marked increase in tone but only after part is easily flexed; 4) considerable increase in tone; and 5) passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 baseline evaluation. One post operative evaluation every 30 day during six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index consists of 10 items that measure a person's daily functioning specifically the activities of daily living and mobility of the patient. The items include feeding, moving from wheelchair,etc, and the whole evaluation is from 100 maximum what means total independence, to 0, absolute dependence</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)- for speech</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 baseline evaluation. One post operative evaluation every 30 day during six months</time_frame>
    <description>It is global independence assessment. In this case, we are going to take only those related to speech for disartria´s evaluation</description>

    <description>The procedure is based on the classic approaches to posterior cervical region for herniated discs, actually not longer employed for that aim A unilateral hemilaminectomy will be performed at C3-C4 level, starting from 4th cervical spinous process.
A multicontact electrode will be placed on the lateral surface of the spinal cord that will be subcutaneusly connected to an implanted pulse generator (IPG).</description>
