  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucopolysaccharidosis are lysosomal storage disorders such as Hunter, Hurler, and Sanfilippo
      syndromes. These patients have a genetic enzyme deficiency that results in the inability to
      degrade glycosaminoglycans. The glycosaminoglycans accumulate in lysosomes causing cell
      enlargement and subsequent dysfunction. The accumulation occurs in all tissues including
      cartilage, joint capsule, and tendons and can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger digits,
      and various other orthopaedic manifestations [Van Heest, White]. These children often suffer
      from severe cognitive impairment and are often unable to communicate pain or numbness. Carpal
      tunnel syndrome is almost always present, but may not become apparent until symptoms are
      severe and loss of function has occurred. The current gold standard for diagnosis consists of
      electromyographic (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies under sedation or general
      anesthetic [Khanna].

      Primary Objective: The investigators plan to correlate EMG findings and median nerve
      cross-sectional area in children with mucopolysaccharidosis. The investigators hypothesis is
      that ultrasonography of the carpal tunnel in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis will prove
      to be an effective, reliable, and safe method to evaluate the median nerve, thus avoiding the
      need for EMG studies and anesthesia.

      Secondary Objective: The investigators want to determine the cross-sectional area of the
      median nerve using ultrasonography in a cohort of healthy children, ages 3-12. The
      investigators plan to evaluate a cohort of healthy children to determine a normal
      cross-sectional area of the median nerve.

          -  Children with mucopolysaccharidosis presenting to the senior author's clinic with
             signs or symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome will be enrolled to receive both an EMG
             and carpal tunnel ultrasound of the upper extremities.

        For the second arm of the study (100 participants):

          -  Healthy children ages 3-12 with no acute upper extremity trauma or history of
             mucopolysaccharidosis.

          -  25 additional participants requested in case of inconclusive ultrasound results,
             patient removal, or other unusable results.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        First arm:

          -  Children with mucopolysaccharidosis who have undergone previous treatment for carpal
             tunnel syndrome.
