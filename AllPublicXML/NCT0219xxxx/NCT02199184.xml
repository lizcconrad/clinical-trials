      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding ofatumumab/rituximab to the
      standard combination of DA-EPOCH (dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, and
      cyclophosphamide) can help control the disease in patients with newly diagnosed or
      relapsed/refractory Burkitt leukemia or relapsed/refractory ALL. The safety of this drug
      combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. DA-EPOCH is commercially available and FDA-approved for the
      treatment of Burkitt leukemia and ALL. Ofatumumab and rituximab are commercially available
      and FDA-approved for the treatment of some types of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is
      considered investigational to add ofatumumab to DA-EPOCH to treat Burkitt leukemia and ALL.
      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Central Venous Catheter (CVC):

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive a CVC if you do
      not already have one. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein
      while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more
      detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle lasts 21-28 days.

      You will receive up to 8 cycles of EPOCH in combination with ofatumumab or rituximab
      (EPOCH-O/R) with 2 doses of ofatumumab or rituximab each cycle for the first 4 cycles, except
      for Cycle 1, where you will receive 1 extra dose of ofatumumab to help prevent side effects.
      You may receive rituximab instead of ofatumumab if your insurance provider does not cover the
      cost of ofatumumab.

      You will receive ofatumumab by vein (over about 2 hours) on Days 1, 2, and 11 of Cycle 1. You
      will also receive it on Days 1 and 8 of Cycles 2 and 4, and on Days 1 and 11 of Cycle 3. If
      you will receive rituximab instead of ofatumumab, you will receive it by vein (over about 2
      hours) on Days 1 and 11 of Cycles 1 and 3 and on Days 2 and 8 of Cycles 2 and 4.

      You will receive etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine by vein over about 24 hours each on
      Days 1-4 of each cycle.

      You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 1 to 2 hours on Day 5 of each cycle.

      You will take prednisone by mouth 2 times a day on Days 1-5 of each cycle.

      You will also receive pegfilgrastim by vein within 3 days after receiving the drugs above to
      help prevent side effects. You may also receive filgrastim if the study doctor thinks it is
      needed to also help prevent side effects.

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will receive methotrexate and cytarabine by
      spinal tap. The study doctor will tell you more about this.

      You may be able to receive the study drugs at a clinic near your home. Talk to the study
      doctor about this possible option.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 8 cycles of study drugs. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) time a week for the first cycle, then every 2 weeks during Cycles 2-8, blood (about 2
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 14, and then 1-2 weeks later, and then every 3 months for the first year, then every 6
      months for the next 2 years:

      °You will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      One (1) time every 3 months for the first year after you finish receiving the study drugs and
      every 6 months for the next 2 years, you will come to the clinic. The following tests and
      procedures will be performed:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      The study staff will call you every 3 months for 1 year after you finish receiving the study
      drugs. During the calls, you will be asked how are you feeling and about any side effects you
      may have, and any drugs you may have taken. These calls should last about 5 minutes each
      time.

    <description>Up to 30 newly diagnosed patients enrolled in this cohort. Proposed combination study expected to achieve a CR rate of 87%, an increase of 14% in CR rate over the standard therapy. If 22 (73%) patients observed have CR, then the 95% confidence interval for CR rate is (57.1%, 88.9%). If 26 (87%) patients observed have CR, the 95% confidence interval for the CR rate will be (75%, 99%). If at any time during study there is 95% or more chance that the CR rate is less likely to improve by 14% than that under the standard treatment, study terminated in this cohort. All patients who receive at least 1 dose of the combination treatment included in the intent-to-treat analysis for efficacy and safety.</description>
