  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic mesenchymal trophic factors (MTF) from human umbilical cord tissue-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) administered intra-nasally to 20 patients is a safe and
      useful procedure for inducing improvements in pulmonary function and quality of life in
      patients with asthma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess primary safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of allogeneic
      UC-MSC-derived MTF administered to patients with asthma. Each patient will receive
      intra-nasal MTF once per week for a period of 4 weeks.

             high doses of inhaled steroids.

          -  Nonsmokers (stopped smoking at least 1 year ago) and limited life-time history of
             smoking (less than a 3 pack year history).

          -  Body mass index 19-40

          -  On a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroid for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry
             or had to use a rescue dose during the last 4 weeks.

          -  FEV1 &gt;50% predicted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Current diagnosis of polyposis or sinusitis.

          -  Infection treated by antibiotics within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Immunization within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Lung pathology other than asthma

          -  Other significant non-pulmonary co-morbidities such as: coronary artery disease,
             peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure with an
             ejection fraction &lt;50%, liver disease or elevated liver enzymes at baseline,
             malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers), AIDS, renal failure with serum
             creatinine &gt;3.0, or disorders requiring steroid treatment such as vasculitis, lupus,
             rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Illicit drug use within the past year

          -  Current/active upper respiratory infection (URI) (if active URI, wait until
             asymptomatic for 1 week to enroll)

          -  Asthma exacerbation within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment (includes ER, urgent care,
             or hospital visits due to asthma resulting in an increase in asthma-related
             medications)

          -  Undergoing evaluation for sleep apnea, or plans to institute treatment for sleep apnea
             (patients on a stable treatment regimen for sleep apnea for the last 3 months prior to
             enrollment will be allowed to participate)

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities present on screening 12-lead electrocardiogram

          -  Women of childbearing potential using oral contraceptives who are not willing to use a
             second method of contraception during the study

          -  Participation in another clinical study within 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Subject does not sign informed consent
