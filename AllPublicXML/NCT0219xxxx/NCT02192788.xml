    <textblock>
      This study aims to probe the effect of SBRT as a treatment oligometastases of prostate
      cancer, regardless of basal treatment received, and I know the response, biochemical control,
      the progression-free survival as well as their impact on quality of life.

      Primary Objective: Local and symptomatic oligometastases Control of prostate cancer treated
      by SBRT.

      Secondary Objectives: Analyzing biochemical progression rates, progression-free survival,
      chemotherapy-free survival and overall survival. Analyze toxicities and quality of life of
      patients before and after treatment
