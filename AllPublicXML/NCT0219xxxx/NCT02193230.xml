  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease often occurring in childhood.

      The treatment consists in making daily local treatment with topical steroid on inflammatory
      lesions and emollient on the whole body. However, approximately 70% of patients do not adhere
      to therapy.

      Studies have shown that this treatment failure is caused by the complexity of the treatment,
      the time required for its implementation, the cost of treatment, the dosage of the products,
      fear of side effects or misunderstanding about the chronicity of these diseases inflammatory
      conditions of the skin.

      This study aims to evaluate the consideration of patient preference in the choice of
      excipient used for the topical treatment of eczema.

      Day 0 :

        -  Inclusion, collecting non-opposition

        -  Presentation of the samples: 4 products presented in the same packaging (pump bottle 200
           ml) and ranked in order of their fat content:

        -  Cold Cream: 88%

        -  Modified Cerat Galen (national formulary): 66%

        -  Cold Cream Fluid: 32%

        -  Ointment: 21% The 4 products are all equally effective and suited in the treatment of
           atopic dermatitis.

      The patient choose the cream it will apply from 4 presented. A total of two bottles will be
      given to the patient. A bottle containing only the emollient applied to dry areas and another
      bottle in which 30% will be added Diprosone (topical steroid) to be applied on areas of
      eczema).

        -  Remitting the questionnaires

        -  Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD)

      Day 30:

        -  Remitting the questionnaires

        -  Treatments delivery for 2 months

        -  SCORAD / PO SCORAD

        -  Treatment weighing

      Day 90:
