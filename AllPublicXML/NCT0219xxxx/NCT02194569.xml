    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      A higher citrate dose during continuous venovenous hemofiltration provides better
      anticoagulation but possibly a higher risk of citrate accumulation in case of metabolic
      limitations. A higher citrate dose also increases magnesium loss in ultrafiltrate, while a
      negative magnesium balance is unwanted.

      Objective:

      Aim of this study is to determine the magnesium balance of citrate-based continuous
      veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and to determine whether and to which extent the magnesium
      balance depends on citrate dose.

      Study design and methods:

      A prospective randomized study conducted in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury
      (AKI), treated with CVVH, with either low dose citrate (2.5 mmol/L blood flow in the filter)
      or high dose citrate (4.5 mmol/L blood flow in the filter) as anti-coagulant, targeting a
      postfilter ionized Calcium (iCa) of resp. 1.3-1.6 mg/dL (0.325-0.4 mmol/L) and 0.8-1.1 mg/dL
      (0.2-0.275 mmol/L). Post-filter blood as well as effluent aliquots and bloodconcentrations in
      the patient are tested for the following variables:

      (0 , 2 , 4, 6, 12 and 24 hrs): Total Magnesium (tMg) and total Calcium (tCa), ionized Ca
      (iCa)(bloodgas analyzer). In addition, hematocrit, albumin, total protein, ureum and
      creatinine and parathormone (PTH) are determined in arterial blood at 0 and 24 hrs or at the
      time of protocol exit and citrate concentrations in postfilter and arterial blood at 1 and 24
      hrs or at protocol exit.

      Sample sites: arterial line, postfilter port (after postdilution and calcium compensation),
      effluent sample. All flow rates to be noted.

      Study population:

      Twenty patients admitted to intensive care, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy
      (CRRT) for AKI.

      Intervention:

      Anti-coagulation with either low dose citraat (2.5 mmol/L blood flow) or high dose citraat
      (4.5 mmol/L blood flow) targeting postfilter iCa of resp. 1.3-1.6 and 0.8-1.1 mg/dL. Both
      regimens are within standard protocolled CVVH treatment in the intensive care department.

    <description>Blood flow according to weight.Target citrate concentration is 4,5 mmol/L blood flow delivered as prismocitrate 18/0 pre-filter. After correction for filtration fraction, the required further amount of substitution fluid is given post filter to achieve a hemofiltration rate of 30 ml/kg/hr. Blood citrate concentrations are tailored to achieve an iCa of 0.8-1.1 mg/dL.</description>
