  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of a phone-based weight loss program
      that has stress management techniques integrated throughout (Weight Talk-Mindfulness). The
      program is targeted at employees of certain companies who meet a cut-off score on a measure
      of stress-related eating. The control group will receive a standard phone-based program with
      no additional stress management information (Weight Talk-Standard).

        -  Hypothesis 1: Participants in Weight Talk-Mindfulness (WT-M; n=50) will experience
           decreases in their stress-related &amp; emotion-related eating compared to the Weight
           Talk-Standard (WT-S; n=25) group.

        -  Hypothesis 2: The WT-M group will lose more weight compared to the WT-S control group.

        -  Hypothesis 3: Participants in WT-M will experience decreased perceived stress, increased
           eating self-efficacy, increased acceptance of weight-related thoughts &amp; feelings and
           increased mindfulness compared to those in the WT-S control arm.

        -  Hypothesis 4: Participants in WT-M will be equally as satisfied with their weight loss
           program as those in WT-S.
