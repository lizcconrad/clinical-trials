    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about how patients with vasculitis think about their
      illness and to assess to what extent patient perceptions of illness are associated with
      physical, mental, and social functioning

      All patients enrolled in the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium's Contact Registry were
      invited via email to participate in this study. The Contract Registry includes people who
      self-identify as having one of the following types of vasculitis: granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, polyarteritis
      nodosa, Takayasu's arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet's disease, Henoch-Schöenlein
      purpura, or CNS vasculitis. People voluntarily enroll in this Registry with the understanding
      that they will receive information about clinical studies for which they might be eligible.
      The introductory email included basic information about the study and all of the required
      elements for informed consent in a brief format. Once participants agreed to participate in
      the study, then they were directed to the online questionnaire.

      When completing the questionnaire, patients were asked a series of questions. Some of the
      follow-up questions depended on initial answers. The questionnaire content was included as an
      appendix. The online questionnaire version was thoroughly tested for usability.

      It was expected that most participants would require approximately 20-30 minutes to complete
      the questionnaire.

      The survey data is stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network Data Management and
      Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. The data is de-identified.
      Names or other personal health information are not be collected.

        Patients will be recruited from within the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC)
        Patient Contact Registry to participate in an online questionnaire. More than 2000
        patients, representing all the different types of idiopathic vasculitis, are currently
        enrolled into the on-line registry. The different types of vasculitis available for study
        include: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic
        polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis,
        Takayasu's arteritis, Henoch-Schöenlein purpura, Behçets disease, and CNS vasculitis.
