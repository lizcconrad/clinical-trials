  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if human RB1-deficient induced pluripotent stem cells
      (iPSCs) can produce retina, and, furthermore, can give rise to retinoblastoma in culture.
      This unique opportunity to study the initiation of retinoblastoma in the developing retina
      will shed light on the cell of origin for retinoblastoma and allow the investigators to study
      the earliest molecular and cellular events in retinoblastoma tumorigenesis.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To establish the feasibility of producing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from
           retinoblastoma patients with germline RB1 mutations (RB1-deficient iPSCs).

        -  To validate human RB1-deficient iPSCs by confirming karyotype, pluripotency and RB1
           mutation.

        -  To differentiate the RB1-deficient iPSCs into retina as a model of the initiation of
           retinoblastoma in the developing retina.

      This is an observational study where a small skin cell sample or peripheral blood sample will
      be used to produce iPSCs. After RB1-deficient iPSCs are produced, their karyotype and RB1
      mutation will be confirmed and their pluripotency will be tested by studying the expression
      of pluripotent genes and proteins according to standardized guidelines established for human
      iPSCs. After validation of the RB1-deficient iPSCs, they will be differentiated in the
      laboratory into retina following established protocols.
