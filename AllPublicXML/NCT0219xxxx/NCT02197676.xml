      Treatment of patients with WHO defined IPSS int 2 and high risk MDS , AML with 20-30% marrow
      blasts and CMML type 2, after failure of azacitidine or decitabine exposure for at least 6
      courses, or relapse after initial response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible patients will be treated with SGI-110 for 9 cycles of 28 days.

      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be administered subcutaneous SGI-110 at 60mg/m²/d
      one time daily for 5 days. Each cycle will last 28 days with SGI-110 starting on day 1 of
      each cycle. Patients will receive at least 9 cycles unless overt progression is documented.
      (Overt progression will be defined by the presence of more than 30% marrow blasts and
      doubling of marrow blast percentage from onset of SGI-110). Dose reduction to 45 and even 30
      mg/m²/d will be made in case of toxicity.

      Patients with Complete Remission (CR), Partial Remission (PR), marrow CR, Hematological
      Improvement (HI) or stable disease (SD) after 6 Cycles of therapy (IWG 2006 criteria) may
      receive 3 additional cycles. Response will be re-evaluated after 9 cycles. Patients with no
      response (NR) to treatment after 9 cycles will be withdrawn from the protocol. Patients with
      progression at any time will be withdrawn from the protocol after the last treatment Cycle.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Myelodysplastic syndrome including the following categories of the WHO classification:
             refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic
             leukemia (CMML) (leukocytes &lt; 13 G/L but &gt; 10% marrow blasts), AML with 20-30% marrow
             blasts (RAEB-T according to the FAB classification), at screening time.

          -  Prior treatment with azacitidine or decitabine for at least 6 courses without
             response(CR, PR, marrow CR or stable disease with HI according to IWG 2006 criteria)
             or relapsing after a response. Non responders will be eligible only in the absence of
             overt progression, ie AML progression (if patients had no AML at onset of
             azacitidine/decitabine) or doubling of marrow blast percentage between onset of
             azacitidine/decitabine and screening

          -  IPSS score &gt;1 (IPSS: Int-2 or High).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Normal liver function, defined by total bilirubin and transaminases less than 1.5
             times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Normal renal function, defined by creatinine less than 1.5 times the upper limit of
             normal, creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min.

          -  Patient is known not to be refractory to platelet transfusions.

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Patient must understand and voluntarily sign consent form.

                  or in the 3 days prior to the study visit once the subject has been on effective
                  contraception for at least 4 weeks. This requirement also applies to women of
                  childbearing potential who practice complete and continued abstinence. The test
                  should ensure the subject is not pregnant when she starts treatment.

               3. Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 2
