        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants should be healthy males and females

          -  Age range from 21 to 50 years

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) is to be within 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m² (BMI calculation: weight in
             kilograms divided by the square of height in meters)

          -  In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation each volunteers
             are supposed to give their written informed consent prior to admission to the study

          -  As part of the screening (within 14 days before drug administration), each subject was
             to receive a complete medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate,
             medical history, documentation of demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria and
             concomitant therapy) as well as a 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) and a rhinomanometry
             (in order to familiarize the subject with this method; screening rhinomanometric
             values were not to be reported). Moreover laboratory parameters (including drug
             screening, HBs- antigen (HBs-Ag), anti Hepatitis B core (HBc) - antibodies, anti
             Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) - antibodies and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test as
             well as pregnancy test for female subjects are to be determined.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant
             to the trial as judged by the investigator

          -  Intake of a drug with a long half-life (&gt; 24 hours) within at least 1 month or less
             than ten half-lives of the respective drug before enrolment in the study (except
             substitution therapy regarding thyroid gland/or ovaries)

          -  Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial within 1 week prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Participation in another study with an investigational drug within two months prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on study days

          -  Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60g/day)

          -  Drug abuse

          -  Blood donation (&gt;= 100 ml) within four weeks prior to administration or during the
             trial

          -  Excessive physical activities within the last week before the study

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range of clinical relevance

        For female subjects:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Positive pregnancy test

          -  No adequate contraception e.g. oral contraceptives, sterilization, intrauterine
             pessary (IUP)

          -  Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period
