  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has extensively allowed pregnancy for infertile
      couples. However, the long-term effect of ART exposure on cardiovascular development and
      potential association with ART procedure and parental factors is confused. The aim is to shed
      more light on the pattern and extent of cardiovascular developmental alteration among ART
      children and its association with potential confounders.

    <textblock>
      A historic cohort study was designed with prospective follow-up of ART children conceived in
      the Clinical Centre of Reproductive Medicine (CCRM) and born in Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit
      (MFMU) of First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (FAHNMU) from 1 January
      2002 to 31 December 2012.

      The present design is a prospective single-center study in FAHNMU. ART group will be
      recruited by a non-random, consecutive sample on the basis of the unique personal
      identification number assigned to ART children conceived in CCRM and born in MFMU.

      The controls will be recruited by a non-random, consecutive sample on the basis of the
      spontaneous conception population attending the MFMU of FAHNMU during the same period as ART
      group for prenatal screening and subsequent delivery considering their age.

    <description>Left ventricular end-diastolic diameters (LVDD) and end-systolic diameters (LVSD) will be measured by M-mode echocardiography at the para-sternal long-axis views. LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume(LVESV) will be calculated by 2D echocardiography from the apical four-chamber view using the modiﬁed Simpson's rule. Aorta diameters (AOD) and left atrial diameters (LAD) will be measured by 2D echocardiography at the para-sternal long-axis views. Left and right coronary artery will be measured by 2D echocardiography at the short-axis views. The interventricular septum thickness (IVST) and the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) will be measured by M mode from a para-sternal long-axis view. Left ventricular relative wall thickness (LVRWT) will be calculated the following equation: (IVST+PWT)/ LVDD.</description>

    <measure>cardiac function between controls and ART children</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>LV shortening fraction will be calculated from internal ventricular diameters obtained from a para-sternal long-axis view by M mode using the following equation: (end-diastolic diameter−end-systolic diameter)/end-diastolic diameter. LV stroke volumes will be calculated as follows: π/4×(aortic valve diameter)2×(aortic artery systolic flow velocity-time integral). Left ejection fraction will be calculated as follows: (end-diastolic volume−end-systolic volume)/end-diastolic volume. Left cardiac outputs will be calculated as stroke volume times heart rate. Left cardiac index will be normalized as cardiac outputs/ BSA.</description>

        ART group will be ART children conceived in Clinical Centre of Reproductive Medicine and
        born in Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit (MFMU). The controls will be the spontaneous
        conception children born in the MFMU during the same period as ART group for prenatal
        screening and subsequent delivery.
