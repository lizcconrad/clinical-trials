      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a food supplement consisting of vitamins,
      minerals and fish oil taken during and after pregnancy can decrease the need for additional
      iron supplementation due to anemia during pregnancy, and optimize levels of nutritional
      markers such as vitamin D and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, an omega 3 fatty acid) in maternal
      blood and breast milk, compared to placebo.

      200 healthy, pregnant women will be randomized to receive either active or placebo at their
      first visit to the pre-natal centres. They will be monitored at regular intervals, blood
      samples will be taken and they will be asked about compliance and any adverse reactions.

      Approx 8 weeks after delivery, the women will come to the pre-natal centres for a check-up.
      During this visit, a blood sample will be drawn and a breast milk sample will be collected.

      The blood samples will be analysed for haemoglobin, serum ferritin, vitamin D and DHA. The
      breast milk samples will be analysed for vitamin D and DHA.
