  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of quercetin glucuronide and kaempferol
      glucuronide after the administration of a single peroral dose of 1,800mg Red Vine Leaf
      Extract (Antistax®). Additionally, the trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of this
      dose in healthy subjects.

             to be healthy

          -  subjects who were willing and capable to confirm written consent to enrolment after
             ample information has been provided

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  if female: positive pregnancy test upon recruitment

          -  subjects with any relevant clinical abnormality (as based on extensive medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs)

          -  subjects with chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  subjects with therapy-requiring allergies (including drug allergies)

          -  subjects with suspicion of hypersensitivity to the investigational medication

          -  subjects with any clinically relevant laboratory abnormality (including positive
             results for hepatitis and HIV serology)

          -  subjects who had received any medication within 1 week prior to trial start or during
             the trial, except for hormonal contraceptives (females) or thyroid hormone replacement
             after thyroidectomy

          -  subjects who had taken a drug with a long half-life (≥ 24 hours) within one month
             before enrolment in the trial

          -  subjects who participated in a trial with a novel investigational medication within
             the last 8 weeks before the start of the present trial

          -  subjects who participated in a trial with a registered compound within the last 4
             weeks before the start of the present trial

          -  subjects who donated blood or plasma within the last 4 weeks before the start of the
             present trial

          -  subjects who smoked more than 15 cigarettes per day and subjects who were not willing
             or able to abstain from smoking from 12:00 hours before and during the profiling days

          -  subjects known or suspected to be (social) drug dependent, incl. those drinking more
             than 60 g alcohol per day and who were not willing to abstain from alcohol during the
             active trial phase

          -  subjects adhering to a diet (i.e. vegetarian) or lifestyle (including extreme physical
             activities such as competitive sports and weight lifting) that might interfere with
             the investigation

          -  subjects known or suspected not to comply with the trial directives and/or known or
             suspected not to be reliable or trustworthy

          -  subjects known or suspected not to be capable of understanding and evaluating the
             information that is given to them as part of the formal information policy (informed
