  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the safety with special emphasis
      on ECG effects, and tolerability of dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate (2mg/mL syrup)
      in healthy male and female subjects following oral administration of 30 mg q.i.d. and 90 mg
      q.i.d. for 2 days followed by a single morning dose (extensive metabolisers of CYP 2D6) and
      for 10 days followed by a single morning dose (poor metabolisers of CYP 2D6).

      Additionally pharmacokinetic properties of dextromethorphan and its main metabolites
      dextrorphan, 3-hydroxymorphinan, and 3-methoxymorphinan will be investigated
