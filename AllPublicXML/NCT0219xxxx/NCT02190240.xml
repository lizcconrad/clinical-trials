  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study has 3 aims: 1) quantitatively describe a model for delivering
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies to understand the selection of
      patients and CAM therapies used for pain management, 2) examine the effects of selected CAM
      therapies on immediate change in pain, and 3) examine the effects of selected CAM therapies
      on duration of pain change.

      Positive results from this study will assist hospitals in the integration of usual care and
      CAM therapy for pain reduction. Findings may also drive future research on the cost
      effectiveness of these therapies for pain management, as well as the impact on patient
      outcomes such as length of stay and use of narcotics.
