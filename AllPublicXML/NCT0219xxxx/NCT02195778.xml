      to make good decisions about health and medical care. Health informatin can overwhelm even
      people with advanced literacy skills. About one third of the adult population in the United
      States has limited health literacy.

      Health literacy is the ability to understand health information and to use that information
      to make good decisions about health and medical care. Health information can overwhelm even
      people with advanced literacy skills.

      About one third of the adult population in the United States has limited health literacy
      (Berkman ND, Davis TC, McCormack L. Health literacy:what is it? J Health Commun. 2010; 15
      Suppl 2: 9-19). Initial assessment of regulatory compliance in research studies in the UAE
      indicated poor understanding of medical information by patients/subjects (AAMDHREC 12/55).

      Health Literacy Survey (HLS) will be conducted on adults visiting the participating UAE
      hospitals/clinics. The survey will be conducted by a trained bilingual healthcare
      professional such as a team of medical residents.

      The investigators study attempts to identify the population that are unable to understand
      health information or are impaired in their understanding of health information.
