  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National guidelines about post-operative fasting after general anesthesia are missing.

      Current clinical practices are highly variable and no study has ever evaluated on a large
      scale the real risk of an early drinks recovery in postoperative period.

      The aim of this study is to state the impact of early drinks recovery after general
      anesthesia with laryngeal mask or endotracheal intubation on the risk of aspiration.

    <measure>To determine if early oral fluid recovery after an elective surgery under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask increasethe incidence of cough during swallowing, ie aspiration.</measure>

    <description>During first swallowing, patients will be observed to establish if cough occurs during this first swallowing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine if early oral fluid recovery (i.e patient discharged of PACU) after general anaesthesia increases post-operative vomiting during first hour and patient comfort rated on a 10 points scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>During a one-hour period after first swallowing, patients will be looked after for any vomiting.
At the end of day, patients will be asked to rate their postoperative comfort on a 10 points scale.</description>
