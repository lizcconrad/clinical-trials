  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MOTION study was a prospective, Phase IV study for patients with Pulmonary Arterial
      Hypertension (PAH). The study was designed to further explore patient-reported outcomes in
      PAH subjects who were not on active treatment and living in the United States. In addition,
      the study explored the use of new telemetric technology (Accelerator band) to evaluate if
      this technology correlates with improvements in 6 Minute Walking Distance 6MWD in patients
      with PAH.

    <description>Functional class was determined by the WHO classification:
I: Patients with PH (pulmonary hypertension) but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
II: Patients with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
III: Patients with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
IV: Patients with PH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right-heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.

The dose of riociguat was increased every 2 weeks in 0.5 mg increments to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg until patients reached their individual optimal dose based on their systolic blood pressure and well-being. After reaching their optimal dose, patients then entered a maintenance phase and remained on this dose for an additional 14 weeks. End of treatment was reached at Visit 10 after 24 weeks of treatment with riociguat.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 97 patients signed informed consent; 22 patients did not complete screening (20 patients were screen failures and 2 patients withdrew from the study). Of 75 patients who received therapy with riociguat, 65 patients completed study treatment and entered follow-up, and 60 patients completed the study.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Riociguat (Adempas, BAY63-2521)</title>
          <description>Participants received therapy with riociguat during a 10-week titration phase. The starting dose for riociguat for all patients was 0.5 milligram (mg) three times a day (TID). The dose of riociguat was increased every 2 weeks in 0.5 mg increments to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg until patients reached their individual optimal dose based on their systolic blood pressure and well-being. After reaching their optimal dose, patients then entered a maintenance phase and remained on this dose for an additional 14 weeks. End of treatment was reached at Visit 10 after 24 weeks of treatment with riociguat.</description>

The dose of riociguat was increased every 2 weeks in 0.5 mg increments to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg until patients reached their individual optimal dose based on their systolic blood pressure and well-being. After reaching their optimal dose, patients then entered a maintenance phase and remained on this dose for an additional 14 weeks. End of treatment was reached at Visit 10 after 24 weeks of treatment with riociguat.</description>

A total score ranging from 0 to 105 is calculated by summing the responses to all 21 questions. A physical dimension score (range 0-40, 8 items) and an emotional dimension score (range 0-25, 5 items) can also be calculated. For all LPH scores, a higher score indicates that patients are more affected by their medical condition.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 16 to Week 24 in the LPH Emotional Dimension Score (Completers Analysis Set Only)</title>
        <description>The LPH derived from the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire comprises 21 items, responded to on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 'No’ to 5 ’Very much’. A total score ranging from 0 to 105 is calculated by summing the responses to all 21 questions. A physical dimension score (range 0-40, 8 items) and an emotional dimension score (range 0-25, 5 items) can also be calculated. For all LPH scores, a higher score indicates that patients are more affected by their medical condition.</description>

        <description>The Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) is an 8-item questionnaire that measures the degree to which employed individuals are experiencing limitations on-the-job due to their health problems, and health-related productivity loss (Presenteeism). The WLQ's terms are aggregated into four scales (i.e. Time Management, Physical demands, Mental-interpersonal demands, Output demands). Scale score range from 0 (limited none of the time) to 100 (limited all of the time) and represent the reported amount of time in the prior two weeks respondents were limited on-the-job.

          <description>The Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) is an 8-item questionnaire that measures the degree to which employed individuals are experiencing limitations on-the-job due to their health problems, and health-related productivity loss (Presenteeism). The WLQ's terms are aggregated into four scales (i.e. Time Management, Physical demands, Mental-interpersonal demands, Output demands). Scale score range from 0 (limited none of the time) to 100 (limited all of the time) and represent the reported amount of time in the prior two weeks respondents were limited on-the-job.</description>
          <population>The Completers analysis set included patients valid for Safety/ITT analysis sets who had an LPH score at baseline (Visit 1), Week 4, Week 16, and Week 24. 40 patients in Completer analysis set were evaluable for WLQ at Week 24.</population>

        <description>Functional class was determined by the WHO classification:
I: Patients with PH (pulmonary hypertension) but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
II: Patients with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
III: Patients with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
IV: Patients with PH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right-heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 16 to Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>The Completers analysis set included patients valid for Safety/ITT analysis sets who had an LPH score at baseline (Visit 1), Week 4, Week 16, and Week 24. 57 patients in Completer analysis set were evaluable for WHO Function Class at Week 24.</population>

            <description>Participants received therapy with riociguat during a 10-week titration phase. The starting dose for riociguat for all patients was 0.5 milligram (mg) three times a day (TID). The dose of riociguat was increased every 2 weeks in 0.5 mg increments to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg until patients reached their individual optimal dose based on their systolic blood pressure and well-being. After reaching their optimal dose, patients then entered a maintenance phase and remained on this dose for an additional 14 weeks. End of treatment was reached at Visit 10 after 24 weeks of treatment with riociguat.</description>

The starting dose for riociguat for all patients was 0.5 milligram (mg) three times a day (TID). The dose of riociguat was increased every 2 weeks in 0.5 mg increments to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg until patients reached their individual optimal dose based on their systolic blood pressure and well-being. After reaching their optimal dose, patients then entered a maintenance phase and remained on this dose for an additional 14 weeks. End of treatment was reached at Visit 10 after 24 weeks of treatment with riociguat.</description>
