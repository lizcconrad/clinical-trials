  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergies are now a major problem. These experiments involve getting blood from people
      with food allergies and from people without food allergies. The blood collected will be used
      to answer questions and find information about peanut and other food allergies.

      Samples will come from:

        -  People signed up by the investigators at the University of Colorado Denver

        -  University of North Carolina and Massachusetts General Hospital where people have been
           treated for peanut allergies

        -  University of North Carolina, Massachusetts General Hospital, National Jewish Health and
           The Children's Hospital in Denver where people have taken part or will take part in
           clinically indicated oral food challenges.

      Blood and health histories from the University of North Carolina, Massachusetts General
      Hospital, National Jewish Health, and The Children's Hospital will not have personal
      information linked.

      The specific aims of this experiment are:

        1. Come up with a lab test that will predict how bad an allergic reaction will be to
           peanuts.

        2. Find out what part of a peanut causes allergic reactions.

        3. Come up with preventions that can block peanut allergies.

        4. Find the strongest proteins in walnuts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        This protocol is to draw blood for a variety of related studies of food allergy. For this
        reason, we will list each group of subjects and the inclusion criteria for that group.

          1. De-identified sera or plasma from patients who have undergone Oral ImmunoTherapy (OIT)
             for peanut allergy. These samples already exist.

               -  Inclusion criteria:

                    1. patients have been enrolled in a controlled trial of OIT for peanuts, and
                       had at least one oral challenge.

                    2. Age 1-75.

          2. De-identified samples from patients who are undergoing clinically indicated food
             challenges for peanut allergy.

               -  Inclusion criteria:

                    1. concern regarding possible allergy to peanuts,

                    2. age 1-75,

                    3. plan to undergo a clinically indicated challenge with peanuts.

          3. Patients with peanut allergy.

               -  Inclusion criteria:

                    1. excellent history of a systemic reaction to peanuts,

                    2. age 6-75.

          4. Patients with other food allergies (especially tree nuts).

               -  Inclusion criteria:

                    1. excellent history of a systemic reaction to tree nuts or other foods,

                    2. age 6-75.

          5. Normal controls.

               -  Inclusion criteria:

                    1. no known food allergies,

                    2. recent ingestion of peanuts without difficulty, and

                    3. age 6-75.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any known significant medical or psychiatric diagnosis

          2. Use of an investigational drug within 30 days

          3. Use of omalizumab (anti-IgE; Xolair) within 6 months
