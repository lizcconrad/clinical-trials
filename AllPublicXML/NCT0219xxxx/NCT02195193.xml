    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop, pilot test, implement, and evaluate a
      nurse-coordinated depression care model integrated into the care of Acute Coronary Syndromes
      (ACS) patients with rigorous assessment of feasibility, effectiveness, acceptability and cost
      in rural China. This study is a large multi-center, randomized clinical trial among 4,000 ACS
      patients from 20 rural county hospitals selected from a well-established research network
      across China.

    <description>an integrated care model for ACS and depression delivered by a collaborative team composed of cardiologists/internists and nurses in the same rural county hospital. The collaborative team will be able to provide medical services for the diagnosis and treatment at acute phase of ACS during hospitalization, ACS secondary prevention therapies at and after discharge, and screening and treatment of depression depressive symptom during hospitalization and after discharge. The core of the interventions includes: depressidepressive symptomon screening and classification, individual counseling and medical treatment of depression, group counseling and health education, and follow-up for ACS and depression treatments compliance, IT- system- assisting theassisted management and necessary referral.</description>
