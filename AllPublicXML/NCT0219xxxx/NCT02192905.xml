    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research was to develop and test the feasibility of Habit, a weight loss
      mobile application that was designed to coach patients through their weight loss challenges.
      In a pilot trial in 43 obese participants, investigators tested the feasibility of the Smart
      Coach mobile application when paired with a shortened online-delivered (8-week) behavioral
      weight loss intervention. Feasibility outcomes included frequency and duration of usage of
      the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. Post-intervention focus groups
      discussed the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The investigators also
      performed exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss
      at 8 and 16 weeks, which will inform a subsequent randomized controlled efficacy trial.

      The investigators developed and tested the feasibility of Habit, a weight loss mobile app
      that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network,
      but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that
      processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss
      problems. In a pilot trial in 43 obese participants, investigators tested the feasibility of
      the Habit mobile application when paired with a shortened (8 week) behavioral weight loss
      intervention. Feasibility outcomes included frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app
      and each feature, recruitment, and retention. The investigators also performed analyses on
      problem solving skills and weight loss at 8 and 16 weeks, which will inform a subsequent
      randomized controlled efficacy trial. Data will support an efficacy trial of a Habit-assisted
      brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss
      intervention alone with 1 year follow-up. The investigators overarching goal is to develop
      mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible
      while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden reach.

    <description>The social problem solving inventory measures strengths and weaknesses in ability to solve problems in all areas of life. The measure includes sub scales (positive problem orientation, rational problem-solving, negative problem orientation, impulsivity/carelessness style, and avoidance style). The means of the subscales are summed and then matched against an age chart to achieve the total score for the age being studied. This is done for each participant. The scoring range is 28 to 140. The higher the score the higher the problem solving ability.The change from baseline to 8-weeks is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 8 week score and then doing a 1-sample t-test of whether or not the change was different than 0.</description>

        <title>Problem Solving Inventory</title>
        <description>The social problem solving inventory measures strengths and weaknesses in ability to solve problems in all areas of life. The measure includes sub scales (positive problem orientation, rational problem-solving, negative problem orientation, impulsivity/carelessness style, and avoidance style). The means of the subscales are summed and then matched against an age chart to achieve the total score for the age being studied. This is done for each participant. The scoring range is 28 to 140. The higher the score the higher the problem solving ability.The change from baseline to 8-weeks is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 8 week score and then doing a 1-sample t-test of whether or not the change was different than 0.</description>

        <title>Social Problem Solving Inventory</title>
        <description>The social problem solving inventory measures strengths and weaknesses in ability to solve problems in all areas of life. The measure includes sub scales (positive problem orientation, rational problem-solving, negative problem orientation, impulsivity/carelessness style, and avoidance style). The means of the subscales are summed and then matched against an age chart to achieve the total score for the age being studied. This is done for each participant. The scoring range is 28 to 140. The higher the score the higher the problem solving ability. The change from baseline to 16-weeks is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 16 week score and then doing a 1-sample t-test of whether or not the change was different than 0.</description>
