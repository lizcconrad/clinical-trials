    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor and carfilzomib when
      given together with dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has
      returned or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as selinexor and
      dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Carfilzomib
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving selinexor, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone may be a better treatment for multiple
      myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the
      combination of selinexor, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone in relapsed and relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety and tolerability.

      II. Determine the efficacy, as measured by the rates of stable disease or better (including
      minimal response, partial response, very good partial response, complete response, and
      stringent complete response).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selinexor and carfilzomib.

      Patients receive selinexor orally (PO), carfilzomib intravenously (IV), and dexamethasone PO
      QD or IV. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
