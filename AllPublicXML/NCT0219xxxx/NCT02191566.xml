    <textblock>
      After curative resection, patients with stage IIIB-IV (M0) gastric cancer were given
      chemotherapy as follows: S-1 orally at 80 mg/m2 divided in two daily doses for 14 days and
      oxaliplatin at 130 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 h every 21 days as one cycle. S1 was
      administered for 16 cycles (12 months) and oxaliplatin for 8 cycles (6 months).
