    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Men at least 18 years of age and life expectancy of greater than or equal to 6 months.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.

          -  Metastatic disease as evidenced by both lymphadenopathy and bony metastases or just
             bony metastases on baseline bone scan and/or computed tomography (CT) scan or MRI of
             the abdomen and pelvis within 28 days of registration. Chest imaging is only required
             if clinically indicated or if there is known disease in the chest.

          -  Castration resistant prostatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects must have castrate levels of
             serum testosterone (less than 50 ng/dL) achieved by orchiectomy or LHRH agonist or
             antagonist therapy.

          -  Previously received docetaxel or are not healthy enough per clinical judgment or
             declined to receive it

          -  Evidence of disease progression on or after the most recent systemic treatment defined
             by the following criteria:

               -  PSA: Increasing serum PSA levels as defined by the PCWG2, determined by 2
                  consecutive measurements (compared to a baseline or nadir value). If the third
                  measurement is below the second, then a fourth measurement must be greater than
                  the second. The confirming third or fourth measurement must be greater or equal
                  to 2 ng/mL. PSA progression must have occurred within 15 months of registration
                  (with at least 7 days between each PSA measurement). Additionally, the PSA
                  progression as described above should have occurred during or after the most
                  recent systemic treatment for prostate cancer.

               -  Measurable disease: greater than or equal to 20% increase in the sum of the short
                  axis diameter of all measurable lymph nodes or the development of any new
                  measurable lymphadenopathy by RECIST 1.1 and PCGWG2 criteria.

               -  Non-measurable disease:

          -  Lymph node disease: The appearance of 1 or more new lymphadenopathy, and/or
             unequivocal worsening of non-measurable disease when compared to imaging studies
             acquired during castration therapy or against the pre-castration studies if there was
             no response.

          -  Bone disease: Appearance of 2 or more new areas of abnormal uptake on bone scan when
             compared to imaging studies acquired during castration therapy or against the
             pre-castration studies if there was no response. Increased uptake of pre-existing
             lesions on bone scan does not constitute progression.

          -  Symptomatic bone metastases

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function as evidenced by laboratory test
             results. (Transfusion of blood products are not allowed to normalize blood parameters
             within 4 weeks of the first radium treatment.)

          -  Subjects who have previously received docetaxel or are ineligible for docetaxel and
             who are candidates for treatment with enzalutamide alone or enzalutamide in
             combination with Radium-223

          -  Men must agree to use adequate contraception beginning at the signing of the Informed
             Consent Form until at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Because of the
             potential side effect on spermatogenesis associated with radiation, men who are
             sexually active must agree to use condoms and their female partners of reproductive
             potential must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during and for 6
             months after completing treatment.

          -  Able to provide informed consent and have signed an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines to ensure compliance with HIPAA
             regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of known brain metastases, malignant pleural effusions, or malignant
             ascites. Brain MRI is required at screening only if clinically indicated.

          -  Visceral metastases as assessed by chest, abdominal or pelvic computed tomography (CT)
             (or other imaging modality)

          -  Received systemic therapy with radionuclides (e.g., strontium-89, samarium-153,
             rhenium-186, or rhenium-188, or Radium Ra 223 dichloride) for the treatment of bony
             metastases

             therapies like biphosponates or denosumab are allowed.

          -  Prior cytoxic chemotherapy with the exception of docetaxel or cabazitaxel. Treatment
             with docetaxel or cabazitaxel must be discontinued greater than 4 weeks from the time
             of enrollment, and recovery of AEs to grade 1 or baseline (however, ongoing neuropathy
