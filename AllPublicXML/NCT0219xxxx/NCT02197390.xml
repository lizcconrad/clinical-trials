  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our Choice is one of three CORD (Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration) studies funded by
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011 to test multi-sector, multi-level
      approaches to prevent and control childhood obesity. Our Choice is translating evidence-based
      approaches for modifying behaviors, policies, systems, and environments to promote fruit and
      vegetable consumption, physical activity, water consumption, and quality sleep. The ultimate
      goal is to assist Children's Health Insurance Program-eligible children between 2-12 years
      old attain a healthy weight. In addition to site-specific intervention and evaluation
      activities, Our Choice is working with the University of Houston Evaluation Center to conduct
      a cross-site evaluation on a set of shared measures.

      Our Choice is a partnership between a university-affiliated research institute, a federally
      qualified health center, and a county public health department. We used formative research,
      advisory committee members' recommendations, and previous research to inform the development
      of the Our Choice project. Our theory-informed multi-sector, multi-level intervention targets
      improvements in four health behaviors: fruit, vegetable, and water consumption, physical
      activity, and sleep. Intervention partners include 1200 families, a federally qualified
      health center (including three clinics), 26 early care and education centers, two elementary
      school districts (and 20 elementary schools), three community recreation centers, and three
      restaurants. Intervention components in all sectors target changes in behaviors, policies,
      systems, and the social and physical environment. Evaluation activities include assessment of
      the primary outcome, BMI z-score, at baseline, 12- and 18-months post-baseline, and sector
      evaluations at baseline, 12, and 24-months.
