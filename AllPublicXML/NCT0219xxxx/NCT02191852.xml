  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to evaluate the total antioxidant capacity of Seresis® (with Thiobarbituric acid
      reactive substances (TBARS) assays)) in the skin; as well as in buccal mucosa cells (BMCs)
      and in plasma, compared to baseline values; furthermore to detect the quantitative enrichment
      of individual antioxidant compounds contained in the product and to investigate whether or
      not some of them accumulate in target tissues such as skin, BMCs and plasma

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy female volunteers between 18 and 30 years

          -  With skin type II or skin type III

          -  BMI &lt; 25

          -  Non-smokers

          -  Volunteers who have given their written informed consent according to Good Clinical
             Practice (GCP) and local regulations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious disorder that may interfere with her participation to the trial and
             evaluation of the safety of the test drug (e.g. liver and/or renal disease,
             hypervitaminosis A, psychic disorder, etc.), and/or treatment with chronic medication

          -  Pre-treatment (less than 2 weeks prior to inclusion in this trial) and/or concomitant
             treatment with any drug that may influence the trial symptomatology and may interfere
             with evaluation of the safety of the test drug (e.g. vitamins and minerals
             supplementation)

          -  Relevant allergy or known hypersensitivity to the investigational drug or its
             excipients

          -  High performance sports

             (DSM-IV)

          -  Female volunteers in child-bearing age not using adequate means of birth control
             (contraceptive pills, Intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilisation)

          -  Pregnancy and/or lactation

          -  Known abnormal values of the lab tests (if detected after enrolment, subjects will
             continue the treatment provided there are no medical objections)

          -  Abnormal values of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides (TGL) levels in
             blood

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last 4 weeks and concurrent
             participation in another clinical trial

          -  Specific dietary requirements that do not allow the volunteers to meet the dietary
             guidelines set out for this study
