  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group
      study in male and female subjects conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of flutiform in
      the treatment of COPD. Subjects will be randomised to one of three treatment groups in a
      1:1:1 ratio. Throughout the study subjects will be assessed on a mixture of symptom based and
      lung function measurements to monitor their progress in the study.
