    <textblock>
      Aim of this trial is to investigate feasibility of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI)
      in patients with long term implanted coradial leads upgraded to an MRI conditional pacemaker
      system, to assess MR-image quality and to prove the safety of MRI in this specific population
      in the short term as well as during long term follow-up.

      The trial is designed

        1. To investigate the cardiac MRI related adverse event-free rate in patients with long
           term implanted coradial pacing leads (Fineline-II) after implantable pulse generator
           (IPG) exchange to a MRI conditional system (short term and long term): Safety.

        2. To assess the technical performance of MRI conditional pacemaker systems with long term
           implanted coradial pacing leads, for cardiac MRI (short term and long term):
           Effectiveness pacemaker.

        3. To assess the image quality (IQ) and the diagnostic value (DV) of the cardiac MRI scans
           in patients with implanted MRI conditional systems: Effectiveness cardiac MRI.

           2) To evaluate the clinical incidence of MRI procedures in the population of long term
           implanted pacemaker patients (long term-follow up)
