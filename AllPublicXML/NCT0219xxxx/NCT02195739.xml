      The aim of this study is to compare the cardiovascular disease event rate in smokers
      undertaking pharmacologically unaided smoking cessation attempts (the non-exposed group) with
      the event rate in smokers attempting smoking cessation assisted by pharmacological
      interventions - by nicotine replacement therapy (as any, or a combination, of: nasal spray,
      transdermal patches, inhaler or gum and tablets) or other pharmacological smoking cessation
      aids (e.g. bupropion [Zyban®] and varenicline [Champix®]) - in a representative UK primary
      care population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary study data have indicated a possible increased cardiovascular disease risk in
      patients exposed to nicotine replacement therapy compared with controls (i.e. non-nicotine
      replacement therapy exposed patients) of a magnitude that could not reasonably be accounted
      for by differences in the cardiovascular risk profile of the two patient groups. Further
      in-depth studies in this area are warranted.

      This retrospective study will compare the cardiovascular disease event risk in a group of
      smokers undertaking pharmacologically unaided smoking cessation attempts with the event rate
      in a group of smokers attempting smoking cessation assisted by pharmacological interventions
      (any of nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion or varenicline) in a representative UK
      primary care population.

      There are three main types of pharmacological interventions currently available for smoking
      cessation, each of which has demonstrated efficacy when used in conjunction with behavioural
      support: nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline. Other medications,
      especially nortryptiline and clonidine, are considered to be effective adjunct therapy in
      smoking cessation, but they remain second-line options at this time.

      Nicotine replacement therapy has been available since the 1980s and bupropion since 2000.
      Either approach to cessation doubles the chance of achieving abstinence when compared with
      unsupported quit attempts. After being granted its European licence in 2006, varenicline
      joined the pharmacological smoking cessation armamentarium. It is the first drug developed
      specifically for the treatment of tobacco dependence that contains no nicotine, and it
      triples smokers' chances of quitting compared with unsupported quit attempts.

      As the fore-runner, nicotine replacement therapy is the longest-standing of the existing
      pharmacological smoking cessation interventions currently available. It aims to alleviate
      nicotine withdrawal symptoms by substituting the nicotine attained through tobacco smoking
      via alternative means (e.g. nasal sprays, inhalers, gum and tablets, transdermal patches).
      The various nicotine replacement therapy products available have differing durations of
      action and allow patients to tailor their nicotine intake according to their particular
      needs.For example, patches can be used to substitute for background nicotine and gums or
      tablets can be used to help satisfy urges.

        EXPOSED PATIENTS: include smokers with no recorded smoking cessation attempts using
        pharmacological aids in the prior year, whose index smoking cessation attempt was assisted
        by one of the following pharmacological interventions:

        (i) nicotine replacement therapy as any, or a combination, of transdermal patches, nasal
        spray, gum and tablets, inhaler.

        (ii) Other (e.g. bupropion, varenicline).

        NON-EXPOSED PATIENTS: include smokers with no recorded smoking cessation attempts using
        pharmacological aids in the prior year, whose index smoking cessation attempt involved
        receipt of smoking cessation advice that resulted in a quit attempt unaided by
        pharmacological therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The analysis will include an exposure group comprising smokers with no recorded
             smoking cessation attempts using pharmacological aids in the prior year, whose first
             recorded smoking cessation intervention was a cessation attempt assisted by either
             nicotine replacement therapy (using any of, or a combination of products) or another
             pharmacological smoking cessation intervention (e.g. bupropion, varenicline) at the
             index date.

        Patients must also meet the following inclusion criteria:

          -  Aged: 18-75 years.

          -  Have at least one year of up-to-standard baseline data as defined by Clinical Practice
             Research Datalink (prior to the index smoking cessation attempt) and at least one year
             of up-to-standard outcome data (following the index smoking cessation attempt) or
             up-to-standard data up to the time of death if death occurred within the outcome
             period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the analysis if they:

          -  Have had exposure to any nicotine replacement therapy or other pharmacological smoking
             cessation interventions in the baseline period (year prior to the index smoking
             cessation attempt), and/or

          -  Switched between types of smoking cessation interventions (i.e. nicotine replacement
             therapy to other pharmacological smoking cessation interventions or vice versa) during
             the outcome period(s). Switching between different nicotine replacement therapy
             products, or use of multiple nicotine replacement therapy products, will be
             permissible and analysis may involve a comparison of outcomes relative to nicotine
             exposure over the various outcome periods.
