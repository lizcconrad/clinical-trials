    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor of dementia. Apathy, a profound loss of
      motivation, is a common behavioral problem in MCI. Presence of apathy may increase the chance
      of MCI patients converting to Alzheimer's Dementia. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive tool, has been recently approved for treatment of
      refractory depression. Since dysfunction in the frontal lobe of the brain is seen in patients
      with apathy, rTMS to the frontal lobe might be helpful in treating the same. Study hypotheses
      include that rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) will improve apathy and
      executive function better than sham treatment in those with MCI

      Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor of dementia. Apathy, a profound
      loss of motivation, is a common behavioral problem in MCI. Presence of apathy may increase
      the chance of MCI patients converting to Alzheimer's Dementia. Repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive tool, has been recently approved for treatment of
      refractory depression. Since dysfunction in the frontal lobe of the brain is seen in patients
      with apathy, rTMS to the frontal lobe might be helpful in treating the same.

      Specific Aims:

        -  To determine the efficacy of rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in
           treating apathy in MCI in comparison to sham treatment.

        -  To compare the efficacy of rTMS to the DLPFC on executive function in MCI in comparison
           to sham treatment.

      Research Plan: Current study is a randomized sham controlled cross-over study of daily rTMS.

      Methods: 20 subjects with MCI and apathy will be enrolled to randomize 8 to a total of 20
      sessions of treatment (2 weeks sham, 2 weeks rTMS, with 4 weeks of washout period). Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to rTMS or sham treatment after consent. After 2 weeks of treatment
      there will be a 4 week period with no treatment. At the end of the 4-week wash out period,
      subjects will be crossed over to the next treatment arm (i.e. those who received rTMS in the
      beginning will receive sham treatment and vice versa). Subjects will be followed for four
      additional weeks after treatment. Apathy will be assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale.
      Memory, executive function, functional status and caregiver burden will be assessed.
