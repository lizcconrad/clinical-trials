  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NanoMaxx Ultrasound System (SonoSite) in connection with the RP-Xpress (InTouch
      Technologies) provides a means of transmitting ultrasound images, video, and audio to a
      remote location in real-time. It has been envisioned that this system be used to diagnose
      trauma patients with suspected pleural effusion, hemothorax, pneumothorax, or abdominal
      blockage during prehospital care; under the guidance of in-hospital physicians, paramedics
      would perform an Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination while
      trauma patients are transported to hospital via ambulance. The investigators hypothesize that
      in-hospital physicians interpreting ultrasound images obtained by paramedics during trauma
      patients' transportation to hospital will reduce time to diagnosis; thus, preparations by
      emergency physicians, surgeons, and operating room teams to receive critically injured
      patients may begin earlier, reducing time to intervention during a critical period in patient
      care. Data will also be collected regarding quality of images obtained in-ambulance and the
      interaction between paramedics and physicians using the remote-presence system.

        Adult patients, presenting with blunt or penetrating trauma to the thorax or abdomen, that
        are being transported by MD Ambulance to Royal University Hospital where the hospital trip
        is expected to take longer than 10 minutes.

        Inclusion Criteria for FAST cohort:

          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older

          -  Patient presenting with blunt or penetrating trauma to the thorax or abdomen

          -  Patient transported by MD Ambulance to Royal University Hospital

          -  Patient being transported by a paramedic who has received training in the above
             ultrasound system and who has with them a NanoMaxx Ultrasound System (SonoSite) to be
             used in connection with the RP-Xpress (InTouch Technologies)

          -  Patient will take longer than 10 minutes to transport to hospital

          -  Patient's care will not be compromised in completing a FAST exam - opinion of
             paramedic

          -  Patient's care will not be compromised in completing a FAST exam - opinion of ER
             physician

        Inclusion Criteria for Controls:

          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older

          -  Patient presenting with blunt or penetrating trauma to the thorax or abdomen

          -  Patient transported by MD Ambulance to Royal University Hospital

          -  Patient will take longer than 10 minutes to transport to hospital

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the age of 18

          -  Patients whose care would be compromised if other procedures of higher priority (as
             determined by paramedics and/or remotely-present physicians) were not be able to be
             executed due to time involved in completing a FAST exam

          -  Patients who are not being transported to Royal University Hospital

          -  Patients whose expected transport time from scene to hospital is less than 10 minutes
