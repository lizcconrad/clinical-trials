      The aim of this study is to explore the requirements and conditions of medical
      teleconsultation and remote diagnostics (telemonitoring) of older people in the residential
      environment with an emphasis on the need for adaptation, feasibility and acceptance of
      telemedicine services to a web based documentation and communication platform (Ambient
      Assisted Living Wizard).

      The technical development of the so-called &quot;AAL Wizard&quot; is basis for the study. The
      AAL-Wizard is an IHE(Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise)-compliant, web based
      documentation and communication platform with an integrated electronic patient record, which
      can be used by the study participants during the study. Vital parameters are collected with
      the help of certified medical products according to the guidelines &quot;93/42/EEC(European
      Economic Community) on medical devices&quot; (e.g. blood pressure devices, scales, pedometers),
      transmitted electronically, documented and archived directly in the system. Vital parameters
      out of range will be prioritized displayed in the AAL Wizard (e.g. traffic light system,
      short message notification, pop-up function, etc.) and the study participant will be
      contacted by the tele doctor (teleconsultation) . The decision on the necessary intervention
      (e.g. contact of the in-house home care, therapeutic and diagnostic recommendations or
      recommendation of a primary care consultation /hospital submission) are in the responsibility
      of the tele doctor based on the communication with the patient and the family doctor`s
      recommendations for the treatment of his patient.

      At the beginning of the study, the tele doctors of the Clinical Telemedicine at the
      University Hospital Zurich (USZ) perform an appointment with the respective study
      participants. The electronic patient record will be set up and the process of the
      telemonitoring will be defined.

    <description>The interventions of this study are supported by a so-called Ambient Assisted Living Wizard (AAL Wizard). This is an IHE-compliant documentation and communication platform with an integrated electronic health record, which enables the study participants (elderly) to manage and store their relevant health data. It includes personal master data and the documentation of telemonitoring data. Additionally, the AAL-Wizard provides the communication modules such as telephone -, video- and time- and online consultation. The tele doctor assess the data (eg, vital signs and content of the medical teleconsultation) and collaborates in this way with the older person, family physicians and other health care providers based on an innovative and flexible telemedical home care service.</description>
