  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to create and validate two patient reported outcome
      (PRO) questionnaires. PRO questionnaires ask questions that help to measure disability in
      patients with inherited neuropathies. These questionnaires ask questions about what
      participants think disability is for themselves or others with inherited neuropathies. These
      questionnaires are a useful tool when evaluating whether treatments are working in the day to
      day life of an individual, although there are currently no questionnaires available
      specifically for people who have Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT) is a group of disorders that cause a peripheral neuropathy,
      impairing the long nerves that go to the feet and hands. Due to the problems with the
      peripheral nerves, people with CMT have muscle weakness and sensory loss that impairs their
      physical abilities. CMT affects approximately 1 in 2500 people and is caused my mutations in
      over 70 different genes. Models exist for many sub-types of CMT that have led to an increased
      understanding of the biological basis for these disorders. These advances have also made
      rational therapies for CMT a realistic possibility. However, clinical trials have been
      limited in CMT by a combination of lack of natural history data for many subtypes, a lack of
      outcome measures that can detect change in a short period for slowly progressive forms of
      CMT, and a lack of outcome measures for young children with CMT.

      In order to develop treatments based on the biological advances in the inherited
      neuropathies, it is necessary to have measured the natural history of the various disorders.
      It is only by knowing the natural history that one understands the onset of clinical
      symptoms, the rate of progression, and the ultimate prognosis of these diseases. For these
      reasons, the INC has dedicated much of its effort to develop sensitive outcome instruments,
      including PRO tools, to measure the natural history of CMT. It is the investigators goal to
      establish such an instrument for overall impairment for use in both natural history analysis
      and clinical trials. To develop and validate this instrument, the investigators will be
      asking people who have CMT to complete two questionnaires, the DSI and the HMSN-R-ODS. These
      relate to overall symptom impairment due to CMT. These instruments may be used to help us
      understand the overall progression of CMT and will ultimately help with clinical trials when
      they are available for the various forms of CMT.

    <time_frame>Approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The DSI asks the subject to provide information about how disability is reflected in general by equipment required for mobility. Therefore, the DSI asks the subject if a person in general was wearing AFOs (braces) for mobility, what level of disability would that reflect using both a quantitative measurement of score and a verbal method of scoring (none, mild, moderate, severe). These questions do not apply to the participant themselves, just in general how disabled they believe a person to be based on the mobility assistive devices that that person requires. Then a research team member will complete the last page which specifically asks about what that subject is using for mobility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy Overall Disability Scale (HMSN-R-ODS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The HMSN-R-ODS is a functional score about the subject asking about their daily activities and overall health. Questions are grouped in various sections and include: Changing and holding body positions; walking and movement; movement by transport; carrying, moving, or handling objects; self-care; household activities and duties; taking care (daily tasks) - general; meeting other people; work, study, and hobbies. These questions relate specifically to the subject and ask how they can perform these various activities with little to severe difficulty.</description>

        Participants enrolled in INC protocol 6601 and being seen at a participating site for an
        evaluation of CMT will be asked if they would like to participate in this protocol. The
        individuals being recruited will have already signed consent forms and be enrolled in 6601.
        They will be informed that it is completely voluntary to participate in this protocol, and
        they can still be enrolled in INC 6601 without participating in this project.

        Alternative participants who are registered with our INC Patient Registry will be alerted
        to the form through an email and asked to participate due to their diagnosis of suspected
        diagnosis of CMT.
