      The muscle strength of involved wrist muscles may be gradually reduced as aging, and impair
      their operating skills and even life quality of the elderly. This study has proposed an
      evaluation system of wrist muscle strength to grip or twist. This system consists of a torque
      meter (FUTEK TDF400) and three plugs/sockets for simulation of common grip or twist in daily
      living. This study has completed to evaluate the wrist muscle strength of men and women. In
      addition to the effects of age and gender, this study analyzes the influence of applied force
      and its plug/socket diameter on the wrist muscle strength. Simultaneously, this study
      measured the effect of proper forearm supporter to alleviate pain and improve the wrist and
      grip strength in the subjects with tennis elbow. And quantitative surface EMG was used to
      analyze the relationship between different forearm muscles involved. In order to achieve the
      user-friendly effect, this system intergraded with Cloud service and Bluetooth technology,
      and developed a portable and intelligent evaluation system of wrist muscle strength. It can
      help medical personnel to assess and analysis of real-time data. The traditional training of
      wrist muscle is using grip or grasp a soft tennis ball. In this study a portable grip ball
      training system is developed. It consists of a pressure sensor and LabVIEW program. It's
      expected to reduce the risk of injury of the elderly in their daily lives.
