    <textblock>
      Study to determine the pharmacokinetic properties of 200 mg nevirapine (NVP) administered as
      4 x 50 mg extended release (XR) tablets in a single dose and to establish the bioequivalence
      of this formulation compared to 200 mg NVP administered as 2 x 100 mg XR tablets in a single
      dose
