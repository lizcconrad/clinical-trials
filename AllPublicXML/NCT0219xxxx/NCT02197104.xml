      The objective of this study is to determine if citocoline is effective for balance
      abnormalities and to stabilize cognitive decline in patients with fragile X-associated tremor
      ataxia syndrome. The study will test 1000mg twice daily of citocoline for 12 months in an
      open label pilot study, with study visits at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.
