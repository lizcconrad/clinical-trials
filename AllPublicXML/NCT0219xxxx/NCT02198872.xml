  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the pathophysiological process of coronary artery disease (CAD), are present, autonomic
      dysfunction and reduced functional capacity. Studies showed that physical training (PT) is
      critical in the treatment of CAD by promoting beneficial effects. Although water based
      exercises program have been documented in patients with various cardiovascular diseases, the
      most of studies among patients with CAD used land based exercises programs. OBJECTIVE: To
      evaluate and compare the effects of aerobic water (WPT) and land (LPT) based PT on autonomic
      modulation of heart rate (HR), body composition and cardiorespiratory and metabolic variables
      in patients with CAD. METHODS : 40 men between 50 and 70 years old with CAD diagnosed by
      coronary angiography showing obstruction greater than 50% and underwent angioplasty will be
      evaluated in 4 stages; 1) immediately after angioplasty, clinical assessment, body
      composition analysis and recording of HR and NN intervals during rest. 2) The components of
      step 1) will be repeated after three month, adding the record of HR and NN before, during and
      after the Valsalva maneuver, spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. 3) Volunteers
      will be randomly divided into two groups, WPT and LPT for 48 sessions. 4) The components of
      step 2) are repeated after each period of 12 sessions. Thus, it is expected that WPT promote
      beneficial physiological adaptations in CAD patients with obstruction greater than 50%.

      1. Immediately after angioplasty, the volunteers will be subject to an assessment
           (Assessment 0), which will consist of:

             -  History: personal data, lifestyle and food, family history, current and previous
                history of disease.

             -  Physical examination: cardiac and lung auscultation,measurement of heart rate (HR),
                blood pressure (BP), body weight and height.

             -  Analysis of body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis.

             -  Registration of HR and NN intervals (NN) during rest, in the supine and sitting
                positions.

             -  biochemical blood tests: complete blood count, blood glucose, total cholesterol,
                LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein ultrasensitive.

             -  Recording of HR and NN during rest in the supine position, sitting, standing and
                during respiratory sinus arrhythmia maneuver.

        2. Three months after the &quot;Assessment 0&quot;, the volunteers will be subject to an assessment
           (initial Assessment) prior to physical training program. Will be repeated all
           assessments performed in the &quot;Assessment 0&quot; plus the record of HR and R-Ri before,
           during and after the Valsalva maneuver, spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise test
           (CPET). This is a submaximal CPET performed on a treadmill, in order to verify and
           identify possible changes in hemodynamic, electrocardiographic induced to physical
           exertion, their aerobic functional capacity as well as to prescribe physical training
           protocol.

        3. After this assessment, the volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups,
           aerobic water (WPT) or land (LPT) based physical training.

        4. Components of &quot;Initial Assessment&quot; will be repeated at the end of each month of physical
           training (Revaluation 1, 2 and 3) and the end (Final Assessment).
