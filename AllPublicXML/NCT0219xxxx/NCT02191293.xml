      Collecting data on maintaining anti-retroviral activity (quantitative HIV RNA determination)
      and immunological activity (CD4 cells) after switching from protease inhibitor or NNRTI to
      Nevirapine (Viramune®) and collecting of routinely observed laboratory data on lipids, and
      liver enzymes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male and female out-patients with HIV type 1 infection who have achieved a viral
             load below detection limit (50 copies/ml) for more than 6 months under a previous
             combination therapy with protease-inhibitors (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse
             transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)

          -  Women can only be included, if a test has excluded pregnancy

          -  Only women can be included, who use a reliable means of contraception during the
             observational study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known sensitivity to Viramune or one of its excipients

          -  Clinically relevant changes in lab findings (e.g. increase in aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by more than five-fold of
             upper limit normal)

          -  Patient is not able to abstain from treatment with ketoconazole, oral contraceptives,
             and other medication CYP3A metabolism

          -  For females:

               -  Pregnancy

               -  Breast-feeding
