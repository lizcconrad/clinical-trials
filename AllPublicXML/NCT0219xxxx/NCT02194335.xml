  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study was to obtain information about safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of BIBN 4096 BS after oral administration of increasing doses in healthy
      male and female volunteers. With respect to pharmacokinetics, it was of particular importance
      to investigate whether therapeutic plasma levels (for treatment of migraine) could have been
      achieved by oral administration of a BIBN 4096 BS formulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants should be healthy males and females

          -  Age range from 21 to 50 years

          -  Broca Index: within +- 20% of their normal weight

          -  Subsequently each subject will have his medical history taken and will receive a
             complete medical examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as
             well as a 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG). Hematopoietic, hepatic and renal function
             test will be carried out in the laboratory. The subjects will fast for 12 hours before
             collection of specimens for all laboratory evaluations. The above mentioned
             examinations will be performed within 14 days before the first administration of the
             test substance. In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation
             all volunteers will have given their written informed consent prior to admission to
             the study

             substitution therapy regarding thyroid gland and/or ovaries)

          -  Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial (within one week prior
             to administration or during the trial)

          -  Participation in another study with an investigational drug within two months prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on study days

          -  Drug abuse

          -  Blood donation (&gt;= 100 ml) within four weeks prior to administration or during the
             trial

          -  Excessive physical activities (within the last week before the study)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range of clinical relevance

        For female subjects:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Positive pregnancy test

          -  No adequate contraception e.g. oral contraceptives, sterilization, intrauterine
             pessary (IUP)

          -  Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period

          -  Lactation period
