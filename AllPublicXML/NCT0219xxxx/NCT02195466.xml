             days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) that, in the opinion of the investigator in consultation
             with the Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) Ltd./Ltée clinical monitor, might interfere
             with either the absorption, distribution or metabolism of the test substances

          -  Known hypersensitivity to TPV, RTV, FCZ, or sulphonamide class of drugs
