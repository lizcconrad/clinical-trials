  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will assess the effects of bioactive peptide rich wheat products on blood
      pressure and estimated cardiovascular disease risk. This will be a pilot, explorative,
      cross-over, randomized double-blind 2 groups x 2-arms controlled, clinical trial. The
      intervention will be based on commercially-packaged pasta, which will appear and taste the
      same; (i) low dose bioactive peptides vs. (ii) high dose bioactive peptides. Inclusion
      Criteria will be: Male and female non-diabetic adult volunteers at increased estimated CV
      risk (ESC/EAS SCORE) with SBP 130-139 mmHg and/or DBP 85-90 mmHg); Age included between 40
      and 70 years old; Primary prevention for CVD but otherwise in good general health and have
      had no major illness in the previous 6-months; Volunteer providing their signed and dated
      informed consent form. Exclusion Criteria will be: Severe medical illness/chronic
      disease/gastrointestinal pathology (e.g. coeliac disease); Secondary prevention for CVD;
      Treatment with drugs potentially affecting BP (including antihypertensive drugs) or other
      related CV risk factors; Consumption of nutraceuticals, botanical extracts or other vitamin
      supplements; Volunteer diagnosed as being hypertensive A total of 60 participants will be
      recruited and following adherence to a standardized diet for a 4-week period, will be
      randomly assigned to complete one of 2 treatment sequences by consuming a prescribed quantity
      of pasta products for a 4-week period followed by a 4-week washout before random assignment
      to the 2nd treatment.

      The Primary Outcome will be the modification of office blood pressure (assessed by systolic
      and diastolic BP, pulse and mean pressure (mean of 3 standing &amp; sitting measures) and 24-hour
      blood pressure.

      Additional outcomes include: Anthropometric parameters (Weight, WC, HC, WC/HC, ICO, BMI),
      Glucose and Lipid profile (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, non-HDL cholesterol, risk ratios), Estimated
      CVD risk changes (EAS/ESC SCORE Charts), Measures of vascular health (FMD, PWA, PWV, Aix),
      Liver and renal functionality biomarkers, 24-h urine collection at baseline of treatment
      phase 1 and endpoint of the final phase will be analysed to account for potential confounding
      of urinary sodium excretion (intake) As required by the GCPs and GLPs, all the SOPs have
      already been established and all the personnel to be involved in the study is continuously
      trained in trials with similar outcomes

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) will be performed using a non-invasive automatic monitor (Space Labs, model 90207). For ABPM, patients will be instructed to act and work as normal between 6:00 AM and 10:00 PM and rest or sleep between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM. Readings were obtained automatically at 15-min intervals throughout a 24-h study period. Separate averages will be obtained for the 24-h, daytime (6:00 AM-10:00 PM) and night-time (10:00 PM-6:00 AM) values. The accuracy of the automatic blood pressure readings will be checked against manual readings taken using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer, twice for each ABPM. Blood pressure were was measured with the patient sitting, before the beginning of the ABPM, and after a 5-min rest period. The accuracy test will be repeated after the end of each 24-h ABPM.</description>
