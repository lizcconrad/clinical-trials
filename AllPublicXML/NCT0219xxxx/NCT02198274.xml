             lesions on CT or MRI scan or within 3 months of treatment (i.e., surgery or
             radiotherapy) for brain metastases

          -  Exposure to an investigation agent within 30 days prior to the first BIBH 1 infusion

          -  Patients who are not fully recovered from surgery (incomplete healing)

          -  Chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 30 days prior to the first BIBH 1 infusion

          -  Radiation therapy to the symptomatic sites included for tumour measurements within 30
             days prior to study entry

          -  Previous administration of a murine, chimeric or humanised measurement and/or antibody
             fragment (e.g. BIBH 1, Panorex)
