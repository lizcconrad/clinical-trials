  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test a new way of measuring the severity of tinnitus
      using a tool called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of Tinnitus. We will compare the
      relationship with this tool with another widely used questionnaire. Previous studies we have
      done suggest there are different patterns of tinnitus bother; we plan to explore how often
      these patterns occur, and how many patterns of tinnitus bother there are. And lastly we want
      to test how reliable this type of testing is for measuring the amount of bother people
      experience from their tinnitus.

      Hypothesis 1: We will be able to identify 6 or more distinctive patterns of tinnitus.

      Hypothesis 2: EMA will provide a reliable method for more accurately capturing the amount of
      bother individuals have from tinnitus.

      You to need to complete this brief survey to determine if you meet the criteria for
      participation in the study. You are free to skip any questions that you prefer not to answer.
      We will only use the information you provide in this survey to determine if you qualify for
      the EMA-Defined Tinnitus Subgroups study.

      To be in this study, you will be required to have a smart phone that can receive text
      messages, is connected to the internet, and will allow you to connect via the internet to a
      Washington University secure server. It is necessary to connect to the Washington University
      server in order to complete a short survey four times a day for two separate two-week
      periods.

      The study involves us sending you text messages at 4 random times during the day, between the
      hours of 8: 00 am - 9: 00 pm. The texts prompt you to click on a link and respond to a short
      EMA survey regarding what you are doing, what your environment is, and how your tinnitus is
      at that moment. These text messages will be sent daily for two weeks. Then you will have two
      weeks off. Finally you will again receive the text messages asking for you to respond to the
      survey for two more weeks. You will receive a total of 112 text messages over four weeks. In
      addition we will send you four emails or texts asking you to complete a survey at the
      following times: before you complete your first set of EMA surveys, at the end of the first
      set EMA surveys, prior to starting the second set of EMA surveys, and a final time after you
      have completed the final EMA survey. This study requires no visits to Washington University.

      In order to participate you must complete this short prescreening survey to see if you
      qualify.
