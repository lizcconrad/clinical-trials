  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-lung ventilation during thoracic surgery may affect systemic oxygenation and peripheral
      microcirculation by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Both intravenous and inhalational
      anesthetics can be used during one-lung ventilation. However, there is still a controversy
      which anesthetic would be more appropriate during one-lung ventilation in the perspective of
      oxygenation and microcirculation. The investigators hypothesized that intravenous and
      inhalational anesthetics may affect oxygenation and microcirculation differently during
      one-lung ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing thoracic surgery including one-lung ventilation will be randomized to
      receive intravenous (propofol) or inhalational (desflurane) anesthetic.

      Systemic oxygenation can be evaluated by measuring partial pressure of oxygen in arterial
      blood analysis. Microcirculatory parameters can be obtained from vascular occlusion test.
      Among those parameters, recovery slope during vascular occlusion test is known to reflect
      recruitment of microvasculature in response to hypoxic or ischemic insult. In this study, we
      will compare arterial partial pressure of oxygen and recovery slope during one-lung
      ventilation between propofol and desflurane group.
