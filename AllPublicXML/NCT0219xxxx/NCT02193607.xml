      1. To evaluate whether a standardized tension-free vaginal tape-obturator(TVT-O) procedure,
           when added to a planned improved reconstruction pelvic surgery, improves the rate of
           urinary stress continence in subjects with occult stress incontinence.

        2. Observe the immediate and short-term complications, overall urinary tract function, and
           other aspects of pelvic health between subjects with and without a TVT-O procedure.

      The primary aim of this randomized study is evaluate whether a standardized TVT-O procedure,
      when added to a planned improved reconstruction pelvic surgery for the treatment of pelvic
      organ prolapse, improves the rate of urinary stress continence in subjects with occult stress
      incontinence. Secondary aims include comparison of immediate and short-term complications,
      overall urinary tract function, and other aspects of pelvic health between subjects with and
      without a TVT-O procedure. The value of preoperative urodynamic testing with prolapse
      reduction and 1 hour pad test will also be compared between subjects with and without a
      concomitant TVT-O procedure.
