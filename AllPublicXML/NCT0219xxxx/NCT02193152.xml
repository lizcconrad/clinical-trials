  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how participants with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) that have certain abnormalities in the pazopanib target genes respond to
      pazopanib treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a limited benefit from anti-angiogenesis drugs in patients with NSCLC.
      Bevacizumab provides a modest survival improvement when added to chemotherapy and VEGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with minimal efficacy as single agents and
      increased toxicity when combined with chemotherapy. We postulate that the response rates and
      survival may be improved with a better selection of patients based on abnormalities of the
      targets for the drugs. According to the preliminary data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA),
      the targets of pazopanib are altered in 28% of patients with adenocarcinoma and 24% of
      patients with squamous cell lung cancer. Since, despite the molecular selection prior to
      treatment, only a small percentage of patients will benefit from the treatment, we plan to
      further investigate those patients with whole exome sequencing in both the pre-treatment
      samples to identify the predictors for response and at the time of progression, with repeated
      biopsy, in an attempt to identify the predictors for secondary resistance. By identifying
      more reliable predictors for response to pazopanib, our study may help to establish its role
      in the treatment of NSCLC.

    <description>Participants should be re-evaluated for response 8 weeks after initiation of pazopanib and then every 8 weeks thereafter. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009].
Best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>

             that is touching but not infiltrating (abutting) the vessels is acceptable (CT with
             contrast is strongly recommended to evaluate such lesions). Large protruding
             endobronchial lesions in the mail or lobar bronchi are excluded; however,
             endobronchial lesions in the segmented bronchi are allowed. Lesions extensively
             infiltrating the main or lobar bronchi are excluded; however, minor infiltrations in
             the wall of thee bronchi are allowed.

          -  Recent hemoptysis (≥ ½ teaspoon of red blood within 8 weeks before first dose of
             pazopanib).

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 14 days of study entry.
