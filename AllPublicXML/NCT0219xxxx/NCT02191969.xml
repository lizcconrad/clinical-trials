  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see if patient who undergo a physical activity intervention called Walk With
      Ease report experiencing less fatigue and a higher quality of life during chemotherapy for
      colorectal cancer than those who do not participate in this intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this multicenter, randomized controlled study is to evaluate the
      impact of a physical activity program on fatigue in older patients (≥60 years) undergoing
      adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. The investigators also plan to evaluate physical
      function and quality of life as secondary objectives. The investigators' hypotheses are that
      people who undergo the physical activity intervention compared to those who do not, will: 1)
      report less fatigue, 2) report higher health related quality of life, and 3) have less
      decline in physical function. Additionally, The investigators will characterize ≥grade 3
      adjuvant chemotherapy associated toxicities in this older population, and describe the
      changes reported in fatigue, physical function, and HRQOL over the course of chemotherapy.

    <description>This group will be receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. They will participate in the Walk With Ease (WWE) program during the course of their chemotherapy treatment. They will be requested to initiate the WWE starting on Day 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants are asked to walk at a safe and comfortable pace, increasing their minutes per day at a rate they can sustain, with the ultimate goal of 30 minutes/day for at least 5 days/week. They are asked to maintain a daily walking log that is provided to them, entering total minutes per day.
Participants will be asked to do the walking program independently (self-directed, not in a formal group with an instructor) throughout chemotherapy.</description>
