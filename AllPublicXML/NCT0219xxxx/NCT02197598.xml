        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has alcohol dependence, diagnosed at screening according to DSM-IV-TR™

          -  The patient has had an average alcohol consumption at, at least, a high drinking risk
             level (that is &gt;60 g of alcohol/day for men and &gt;40 g of alcohol/day for women) in the
             4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit and in the period between the Screening and
             Inclusion Visits (that is, in the Screening Period)

          -  The patient has liver impairment defined by elevated liver stiffness and elevated
             liver enzymes at the Screening Visit (both criteria have to be fulfilled): liver
             stiffness (LS) as measured by Fibroscan &gt;6 kPa, elevated transaminases (AST or ALT).
             Transaminase levels up to 5 times the upper limit of the reference range and γGT
             levels up to 10 times the upper limit of the reference range are allowed. At the
             discretion of the investigator, transaminase levels &gt;5 times the upper limit of the
             reference range and γGT &gt;10 times the upper limit of the reference range can be
             allowed if considered habitual for the patient, either confirmed by patient records or
             a repeat measurement during the Screening Period

          -  The patient has a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) &lt;0.02% at the Screening Visit.

          -  The patient provides a stable address and telephone number

          -  The patient is a man or woman, aged ≥ 18 years

          -  The patient has BMI≤30 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has any psychiatric disorder or Axis I disorder (DSM-IV-TR™ criteria),
             established as the primary diagnosis, other than alcohol dependence assessed using the
             Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) or another diagnostic interview ,
             that in any way will interfere with the ability of the patient to take part in the
             study

          -  The patient has reported current use of, or has been tested positive for, drugs of
             abuse (opiates, methadone, cocaine, amphetamines [including ecstasy], barbiturates)

          -  The patient has severe liver impairment classified with a Child-Pugh Score C

          -  The patient has one or more clinical laboratory test values outside the reference
             range, based on the blood and urine samples taken at the Screening Visit, that are of
             potential risk to the patient's safety, or the patient has: Severe renal impairment
             (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min per 1.73 m2), and/or Hypercholesterolemia with serum cholesterol
             levels &gt; 300 mg/dL, (&gt;7,758 mmol/L), and/or bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL (50 μmol/L)

          -  The patient has had &lt;6 heavy drinking days (HDDs, defined by the European Medicines
             Agency as a day with an alcohol consumption &gt;60 g for men or &gt;40 g for women) in the 4
             weeks preceding the Screening Visit

          -  The patient has &gt;5 consecutive abstinence days in the 4 weeks preceding the Screening
             Visit

          -  The patient has a recent history of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (including
             hallucinations, seizures, or delirium tremens)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.
