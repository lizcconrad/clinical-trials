  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alliance to Control Diabetes was a 2.5-year study funded by the American Academy of Family
      Physicians Foundation. The study was designed to help patients better manage their diabetes,
      and was a partnership between the Institute for Behavioral and Community Health and Clínicas
      de Salud del Pueblo, Inc (CDSDP), a private, non-profit corporation providing comprehensive
      primary care services to residents throughout Imperial and Riverside Counties, California.
      The investigators identified 336 patients with uncontrolled diabetes from three CDSDP
      clinics. Patients were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. The 12-month
      intervention consisted of individual diabetes management support delivered by a trained
      volunteer peer supporter. The primary aim was determine if peer support can help patients
      better manage their diabetes and improve the quality of their lives. Intervention
      effectiveness was evaluated through volunteer and patient surveys at baseline, 6 months and
      12 months. This study was part of the global Peers for Progress network which has been
      testing peer support programs in 13 countries.
