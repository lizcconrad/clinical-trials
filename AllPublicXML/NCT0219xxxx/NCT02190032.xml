  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to compare the individually modified-angled tube and the
      conventional-angled tube in ease of double lumen endotracheal tube insertion and the
      incidence of related postoperative complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inserting a double lumen endotracheal tube is somewhat more difficult than a single lumen
      tube intubation because of its larger outer diameter and the more rigid feature. Moreover,
      the airway axes (oral-,pharyngeal-, and laryngotracheal axis) are not always straight under
      sniffing condition. Therefore, to make easy to insert a double-lumen tube and reduce the
      tube-related complications, we are trying to compare the individually angle-modified tube and
      the manufacturer-provided-angled tube.
