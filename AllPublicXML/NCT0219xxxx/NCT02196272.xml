  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of strategies have been evaluated to improve clinical outcomes in diabetics
      patients, however no studies explored the efficacy of a nurse-led reminder program through
      email (NRP-e) to improve medication adherence, even if it is fundamental in the management of
      diabetics. The study aims at evaluating for the first time the efficacy of a nurse-led
      reminder program through email (NRP-e) to improve medication adherence in diabetic patients.
