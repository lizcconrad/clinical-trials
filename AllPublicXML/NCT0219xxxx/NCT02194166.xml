  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study in participants with HER2-positive eBC will investigate participants'
      pain and discomfort of SC trastuzumab (Herceptin) administered either via a single-use
      injection device (SID) or via vial for manual administration using a hand-held syringe (SC
      vial). In total, participants will obtain at least 18 cycles/1 year of trastuzumab (4 cycles
      of intravenous [IV] and 14 cycles of SC trastuzumab).

    <description>Trastuzumab IV will be given during the first 4 cycles for all participants before randomization for SC administration. A dose of 6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) will be given every 3 weeks. All the participants will require a loading dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1, so they will receive 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg, 3 weeks later and then 3-weekly. Concurrent administration during the first 4 cycles of trastuzumab IV with paclitaxel/docetaxel will have to be performed in accordance with local hospital practice.</description>
