      Efficacy of omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria had been demonstrated in phase II and
      phase III studies. Clinical symptoms and signs had been significantly reduced with omalizumab
      as doses of 150 mg and 300 mg at 4-week intervals in patients with chronic spontaneous
      urticaria who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine treatment. Omalizumab had an onset
      of effect within a week after initiation. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that omalizumab
      will be effective in the treatment of severe acute urticaria as add on therapy with a fast
      onset of action. Objective:To investigate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in the
      treatment of severe acute urticaria Study design: This prospective, interventional,
      single-arm open label study will recruit patients with severe acute urticaria from emergency
      departments, hospitalized and outpatient departments. The included patients will receive a
      single subcutaneous dose of 300mg omalizumab therapy. The efficacy of omalizumab will be
      evaluated by physical examination and assessed by Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) at baseline,
      1 hour, Day 1, Day3, Day 7, and 6 weeks after omalizumab therapy. The frequency and severity
      of treatment-emergent adverse events will also be evaluated

      Acute urticaria is defined as hives that persist less than 6 weeks. Some patients with acute
      urticaria may progressed and need urgent management at urgent care clinics and emergency
      rooms. Nonsedating H1-antihistamines represent the mainstay and corticosteroids and various
      immunosuppressive therapies are being used in severely affected patients, or for those
      patients who experience a poor response to antihistamines. However, even though already
      treated by antihistamines, the symptoms still last longer than 3 days in more than 34% of the
      patients. Efficacy of omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria had been demonstrated in
      phase II and phase III studies. Clinical symptoms and signs had been significantly reduced
      with omalizumab as doses of 150 mg and 300 mg at 4-week intervals in patients with chronic
      spontaneous urticaria who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine treatment. Omalizumab
      had an onset of effect within a week after initiation. Thus, the investigators hypothesize
      that omalizumab will be effective in the treatment of severe acute urticaria as add on
      therapy with a fast onset of action. Objective:To investigate the efficacy and safety of
      omalizumab in the treatment of severe acute urticaria Study design: This prospective,
      interventional, single-arm open label study will recruit patients with severe acute urticaria
      from emergency departments, hospitalized and outpatient departments. The included patients
      will receive a single subcutaneous dose of 300mg omalizumab therapy. The efficacy of
      omalizumab will be evaluated by physical examination and assessed by Urticaria Activity Score
      (UAS) at baseline, 1 hour, Day 1, Day3, Day 7, and 6 weeks after omalizumab therapy. The
      frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events will also be evaluated.
