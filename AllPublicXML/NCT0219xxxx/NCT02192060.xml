  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of a suspension containing Triclosan in dynamic
      of the subgingival biofilm formation versus a Placebo suspension. The initial subgingival
      biofilm formation will be evaluated by means of Plaque Free Zone (PFZ).

      This is a double blind, cross over, randomized clinical trial. 28 volunteers will stop
      mechanical supragingiva biofilm removal measures for 96h following a complete scaling and
      polishing of the tooth surfaces. During this period they will be asked to rinse for one
      minute with a slurry of either a triclosan containing dentifice or a control without
      triclosan. Every 24h the presence of deposits will be registered with special atention to the
      presence of a plaque free zone between the apical border of the deposits and the gingival
      margin. Absence of deposits is scored 0, presence of deposits and plaque free zone =1 and
      presence of deposits and absence of plaque free zone =2 (MALISKA, A. N. et al. Measuring
      early plaque formation clinically. Oral health preventive dentistry, v. 4, p. 273-278, 2006).
      The prevalence of scores and the rate of changes from scores 0 and 1 into 2 will be evaluated
      for significance. Sample size was calculated taking the results from the study o MALISKA, AN
      (2006) as reference.
