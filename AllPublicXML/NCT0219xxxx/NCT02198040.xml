    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of two treatments of Physiotherapy: one
      with joint traction, passive muscles stretching and Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation
      (PNF), and the other with education sessions and home exercises, for the improvement of the
      ROM, biceps strength, perimeter of arm and the perception of pain in PwH and arthropathy of
      the elbow.

      The intervention was carried out during twelve weeks, performing evaluations before and after
      treatment, and six months of finalizing this. The treatment of MT group consisted of two
      sessions per week, one hour each, and the treatment of group E consisted in a session for 90
      minutes every two weeks, with daily home exercises. The control group (group C) did not
      receive any intervention.

    <description>Measurement the changes of flexion and extension of elbow (in degrees) using a universal goniometer. We were taken as anatomical references, those specified by Querol et al, using the zero-method-reference for the mobile arm goniometer as indicated Norkin et al.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit (pretreatment assessment), postreatment evaluation (12 week) and follow up assessment (6 months after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the arm circumference (in cm) at baseline as a result of hemophilic arthropathy and after treatment and follow-up. The measurement in the upper third of the arm, in the middle of the triceps muscle belly, with a tape measure. We use this outcome to measure circumference of the arm, it is the most clinical measurement used by physiotherapists.</description>

    <description>Pettersson scale is an additive scale that assesses the radiological joint damage in patients with hemophilic arthropathy. It is scored as a range of 0-13 points (0: no joint damage; 13: maximum joint damage). This scale assesses: osteoporosis, widened epiphyseal, irregularity of the chondral surface, joint space narrowing, subchondral cyst formation, joint margins erosion, joint incongruence and joint deformity (angulation and displacement)</description>

        <title>Assessment of Radiological Joint Deterioration</title>
        <description>Pettersson scale is an additive scale that assesses the radiological joint damage in patients with hemophilic arthropathy. It is scored as a range of 0-13 points (0: no joint damage; 13: maximum joint damage). This scale assesses: osteoporosis, widened epiphyseal, irregularity of the chondral surface, joint space narrowing, subchondral cyst formation, joint margins erosion, joint incongruence and joint deformity (angulation and displacement)</description>
