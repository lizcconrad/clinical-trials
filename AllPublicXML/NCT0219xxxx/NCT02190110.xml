    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) should be suspected in patients with dyspnea, chest pain, syncope,
      shock/hypotension, or cardiac arrest. Discriminating patients in different categories of
      pre-test probability of PE has become a key step in all diagnostic algorithms for PE. The
      most frequently used clinical prediction rule is the Wells score (&quot;PE likely&quot; &gt; 4 points and
      &quot;PE unlikely&quot; ≤ 4 points). PE can be safely ruled out in patients with a &quot;PE unlikely&quot;
      associated with a negative d-dimer test result. Conversely, patients with &quot;PE likely&quot; or
      positive d-dimer level should undergo further diagnostic testing, like multidetector computed
      tomography pulmonary angiography (MCTPA).

      Wells score accuracy is not optimal. Vein and lung US can be rapidly performed at bedside as
      an extension of physical examination and have a high specificity. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate if the combination of clinical data reported in the Wells score and US data obtained
      from vein and lung US (US Wells score) has a better diagnostic accuracy compared to
      traditional Wells score.

      In adult patients suspected of PE traditional Wells score will be calculated and vein and
      lung US (multiorgan US) will be performed in all patients and and US Wells score calculated.
      The US Wells score differs from the traditional Wells score in the following items: &quot;signs
      and symptoms of DVT&quot;, replaced by &quot;vein US showing DVT&quot;, and &quot;alternative diagnosis less
      likely than PE&quot; replaced by &quot;alternative diagnosis less likely than PE after multiorgan US&quot;.
      This latter item is considered positive if at least one subpleural infarct is detected at
      lung US, and negative if no subpleural infarcts are detected and an alternative diagnosis
      like pneumonia, pleural effusion or diffuse interstitial syndrome may explain the symptoms of
      presentation. If no findings are detected at lung US, the points for the item remain the same
      assigned by traditional Wells score. Final diagnosis of PE will be preferentially established
      by MCTPA and in patients discharged without a second level imaging test because of negative
      Wells or d-dimer, and patients with not conclusive second level diagnostic test, will enter
      the 3 months follow-up protocol.

      The diagnostic performance of traditional and US Wells scores will be assessed by calculating
      sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value, and likelihood ratios.
      Failure rate and efficacy of d-dimer in patients stratified as &quot;PE likely&quot; and &quot;PE unlikely&quot;
      will also be calculated.

    <description>Failure rate and efficacy of d-dimer in patients stratified as &quot;PE likely&quot; and &quot;PE unlikely&quot; will also be calculated. Failure rate (false negative proportion) will be calculated as the number of patients with negative d-dimer and confirmed PE diagnosis, divided for all patients with negative d-dimer in the same risk group. The efficiency will be calculated as the number of patients with negative d-dimer in one risk group divided for all patients included in the study.</description>
