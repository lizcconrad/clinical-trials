  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and efficacy of a drug called
      Plerixafor. Plerixafor is approved by the US FDA for use in increasing blood stem cell counts
      before collection in cancer patients. It is not yet approved for patients with sickle cell
      disease. The investigators want to find out if Plerixafor can be used to increase cell counts
      in patients with sickle cell disease.

    <description>Safety is assessed using a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) endpoint. Definition of a DLT is the occurrence of any of the below events that meets the following criteria: The occurrence of a vasoocclusive crisis requiring hospitalization, acute chest syndrome, CNS acute event, or any other disease related ischemic-based adverse event (AE) should be considered as a DLT, if occurring in the 48 hours DLT observation period.</description>

    <time_frame>≥ 30/ul at either 6-12 hours or 24-48 hours post plerixafor.</time_frame>

    <description>Patients will receive a single dose of subcutaneous plerixafor with peripheral blood studies at approximately 0-2 hours before, approximately 6-12 hours after, and approximately 20-48 hours after plerixafor administration, with leukapheresis in the last 3 patients on the protocol. Collected HPCs will be transferred to the MSKCC CTCEF to determine if the HPCs are amenable to transduction with a lentiviral vector encoding the normal ß- globin gene.</description>

             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

             informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are:

               -  Receiving or received treatment with an investigational agent within 4 weeks
                  prior to entering the study OR

               -  have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4
                  weeks earlier as determined by the treating physician.

          -  Patients with ALT(SGPT) &gt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal

               -  Emergency room admission or hospitalization in the past 14 days

               -  Major surgery in the past 30 days

               -  Medical/psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
                  study requirements as determined by the treating physician.

          -  Patients with poor cardiac function as defined by an ejection fraction &lt; 40% are
             excluded due to potential poor tolerance of the fluid shifts with leukapheresis (only
             for patients enrolled on second phase of protocol for Leukapheresis).
