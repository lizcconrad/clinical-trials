  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to validate ease-of-use for the CoVa Monitoring System, along with
      simple statistical parameters such as reproducibility and inter-subject agreement between
      test and reference devices.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has the following objectives:

      Objective 1: investigate ease-of-use associated with the CoVa Monitoring System: determine if
      subjects could use the test device on a daily basis, and if the components of this system
      (Sensor, Gateway, Web-based System) were indeed operational

      Objective 2: determine if daily application of the Sensor's adhesive Electrodes resulted in
      any skin irritation

      Objective 3: determine that the long-term reproducibility of measurements made by the test
      device is as good or better than the long-term reproducibility of the reference device
