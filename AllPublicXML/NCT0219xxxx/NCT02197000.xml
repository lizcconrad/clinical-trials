      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding DIM supplement will decrease breast
      density among female BRCA mutation carriers in two years.

      The Research Question: In female BRCA mutation carriers, will adding DIM (100mg*1/d, a
      nutritional supplement), decrease breast density in two years?

      Study design: A single center single arm prospective interventional study of the use of DIM
      to decrease risk of breast cancer among female BRCA carriers.

      Study population: Subjects will be female carriers of a BRCA mutation and have more than 10%
      mammographic breast density at baseline.

      Intervention: DIM supplement (100mg*1/d).

      Study Time line: This will be a 2 years study. At initiation a breast mammography will be
      performed and eligibility assessed. Follow-up visits will occur every 4 months and quality of
      life questionnaires as well as adherence to DIM supplementation will be assessed. At the
      initiation and every 4 months blood and urine samples will be collected for Estrogen profile.
      At 12 and 24 months a mammography will be performed to verify changes in breast density.

      Primary Endpoint: A decrease of more than 10% in breast density compared to baseline,
      following DIM supplementation intervention among female BRCA carriers.

      Study impact: Decrease in mammographic breast density was shown to be a good marker for lower
      risk of breast cancer. This study has the potential to dramatically impact the management of
      female BRCA carriers. If we prove that by adding a food supplement breast density is
      decreased, we will change standard of care in these woman. In addition, the urine and blood
      samples collected during the study will be used for future translational research on the
      pathogenesis of breast cancer.
