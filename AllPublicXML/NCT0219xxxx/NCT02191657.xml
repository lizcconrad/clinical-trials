    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of
      different dosages of deferiprone in subjects with or without HIV infection.

    <textblock>
      Three cohorts were enrolled: two of individuals who were asymptomatically infected with HIV
      and one of healthy volunteers. Dosages were as follows:

        -  Cohort 1 (asymptomatic HIV infected subjects): 33 mg/kg deferiprone three times daily
           for a total of 99 mg/kg/day

        -  Cohort 2 (healthy volunteers): 50 mg/kg deferiprone three times daily for a total of 150
           mg/kg/day

        -  Cohort 3 (asymptomatic HIV infected subjects): 50 mg/kg deferiprone three times daily
           for a total of 150 mg/kg/day
