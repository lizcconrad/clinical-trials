  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy can induce muscle loss in colorectal, breast and advanced renal cell carcinoma
      patients. The Danish nation-wide training and rehabilitation offer 'Body &amp; Cancer' offers
      intensive resistance and endurance training to all Danish cancer patients receiving
      chemotherapy with the aim of reducing treatment-related fatigue and physical impairments, but
      the potential of the training to preserve or improve muscle mass is uninvestigated.

      Furthermore, the underlying biological mechanisms of treatment and/or exercise induced
      changes in muscle mass in cancer patients remains uninvestigated.

      Thus, the primary purpose of the present study is to investigate changes in body composition
      during chemotherapy and after resistance and aerobic training combined with protein
      supplementation during ongoing chemotherapy in cancer patients. Secondly, we aim to
      investigate the underlying biological mechanisms of muscle mass regulation in biopsies
      obtained before and after a control period as well as after 10 weeks of exercise, both during
      chemotherapy.

      We hypothesize that 10 weeks exercise will improve muscle mass and body composition in cancer
      patients during chemotherapy as compared to a control period during chemotherapy alone.
