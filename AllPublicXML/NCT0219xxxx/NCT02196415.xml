      -  The measurement of hindfoot alignment is a technical challenge.

        -  Today, hindfoot alignment is typically measured on hindfoot alignment view radiographs
           or long axial view radiographs. Measurements on both types of radiographs are hampered
           by technical shortcomings such as minimal rotational misplacement of the foot at the
           time of image acquisition. In previous publications our study groups demonstrated
           substantial measurement errors due to these shortcomings as well as bad interreader
           agreement.

        -  Hindfoot alignment measurement is feasible on MR images but hampered by the
           non-weight-bearing position of the patient and therefore not suited for pre-treatment
           evaluation.

        -  In an ex vivo study using plastic phantoms of a foot our research group could
           demonstrate superior interreader agreement and complete correction for foot misplacement
           at the time of image acquisition using a 3D secondary measurement technique based on
           biplanar low dose radiographs.

        -  Image acquisition using biplanar low dose radiographs is associated with a substantial
           reduction (about 1/7) of radiation dose applied to the patient compared to standard
           radiographs.

        -  Therefore the question arises if these excellent ex vivo results can be confirmed in a
           prospective clinical study.

      Objectives:

        1. Evaluation of technical feasibility of 3D hindfoot alignment measurements based on
           biplanar radiographs.

        2. Reproduction of superior interreader agreement of measurements based on biplanar
           radiographs compared to measurements on conventional radiographs.

      Additional information to the brief summary:

      Outcome(s): Hindfoot alignment measurement on standard radiographs and biplanar radiographs.
      The hindfoot angle is measured between the tibial axis and the calcaneal axis in degrees.
      Measurement results on plain films and based on 3D reconstructions will be compared.

      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:

        -  Inclusion: All patients referred for hindfoot alignment radiographs. These are all
           adults having suffered severe trauma or suffering from osteoarthrosis of the ankle
           joint. No inclusion of vulnerable participants.

        -  Exclusion criteria: Prior surgery, prior fracture, children and adolescents younger than
           the age of 20 years, known pregnancy.

      Measurements and Procedures: Measurement of hindfoot alignment based on conventional
      radiographs and based on biplanar radiographs by two independent radiologists. Comparison of
      measurement results (paired-t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and calculation of interreader
      agreement (Intraclass correlation coefficient).

      Study Product / Intervention: EOS low-dose biplanar x-ray scanner, EOS imaging, Paris, France
      One scan of the ankle joint to obtain an antero-posterior and lateral view.

      Control Intervention: Conventional x-rays of the ankle joint (a.p., lateral, long axial or
      hindfoot alignment view) as referred from the clinician for treatment planning.

      Number of Participants: 50 adults Based on a power analysis we think that this number of
      patients will enable reliable results. Because we do not know how big the differences between
      the measurements on standard radiographs and measurements on biplanar radiographs will be it
      is very difficult to perform a reasonable power analysis. In prior studies comparing torsion
      measurements on biplanar radiographs with CT measurements we were able to produce reliable
      results with the same number of patients.
