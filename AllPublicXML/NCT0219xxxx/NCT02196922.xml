    <textblock>
      In the US, racial and ethnic disparities persist, even when income, health insurance and care
      access are addressed. For example, there is a greater prevalence of chronic heart failure
      (CHF), higher rates of hospital use and higher death rates in blacks as compared to whites.
      This is due to many factors including: reduced healthcare access, higher prevalence of
      hypertension,coronary artery disease, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and
      obesity. Given the magnitude of this chronic health issue, the growth of the elderly
      population, and increases in ethnic diversity, providers need to develop new ways of caring
      for those with chronic conditions living in health disparity communities.

      The investigators propose to implement a randomized study with health disparity
      community-dwelling patients. A bilingual clinician will follow patients for 3 months after
      hospitalization for CHF to test this approach for the proposed health disparity population.
      The investigators will obtain patient/caregiver input at multiple points during the research
      to make necessary adjustments to the intervention to ensure that disparity patients
      accept/use the system, and are satisfied. To ensure that proposed outcomes have relevance for
      patients, a Community Advisory Board (CAB) of stakeholders will advise the study team
      throughout the study process. The investigators believe that studying patient use of TSM over
      a 3 month period will: 1) identify cost-effective care approaches for patients living with
      chronic disease; 2) involve the patient in identifying and testing approaches that work for
      them; 3) enhance provider-patient communication; 4) teach the patient how to self-monitor and
      explore his/her role in self-care; 5) improve patient education about treatment options and
      6) explore how &quot;usable&quot; the patients feel the program is. If our goals are achieved, these
      strategies will result in patient-led improvements in health, satisfaction and quality of
      life. Knowledge gained will further understanding of the use of telehealth programs as
      effective self-management tools.

    <textblock>
      Disparities in cardiovascular disease have received particular focus, as cardiovascular
      disease is a major contributor to differences in morbidity and mortality between blacks and
      whites. African Americans, for example, are hospitalized for chronic heart failure (CHF) at a
      higher rate than whites and are 30% more likely to die from CHF than white individuals.
      Community-dwelling patients with CHF typically receive exacerbation-focused care, leading to
      high rates of emergency department (ED) and hospital utilization. The lack of comprehensive
      chronic disease management leads to poor patient outcomes, and increased health care costs.
      Given the larger burden of CHF and the unfavorable disease outcomes in disparity communities,
      a tailored and more focused management of this clinical condition is warranted.

      We propose to:

        1. Assess telehealth self management (TSM) usability, utilizing a mixed-methods approach,
           focusing on patient and stakeholder input, with the goal of adapting the intervention to
           facilitate acceptability and feasibility in a population of low-income ethnic minority
           patients. Prior to intervention implementation, we will determine characteristics of the
           intervention requiring adaptation to maximize usability through focus groups, with key
           community stakeholders, patients and caregivers. We will continue the qualitative
           usability assessment during the intervention with patients enrolled in the study to
           identify barriers/challenges to usability, to further adapt the intervention. Finally,
           we will use quantitative methods to assess usability. These quantitative indicators will
           also be used to make adjustments and inform future wide-scale interventions that will be
           conducted in this community.

        2. Compare hospital utilization of low income ethnic minority patients receiving telehealth
           technology vs. demographically matched patients receiving standard of care. A randomized
           controlled clinical trial will be conducted to test the primary hypothesis that health
           care utilization will be lower in the in the TSM group than the usual-care group. We
           will specifically compare acute care and ED utilization and quality of life (Minnesota
           QoL Questionnaire) between groups. We will adjust for potential confounders
           (demographic, clinical, educational and functional/support variables). The target
           population is community-dwelling CHF patients discharged home from the Nassau University
           Medical Center.

      This research will further our understanding of the use of TSM in the management of CHF for
      low income, ethnic minority seniors. The proposed research will improve patient outcomes
      while reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and ED burden. Chronic disease self-management
      programs have the potential to reduce health care costs while improving patient health
      status, particularly for medically underserved communities.
