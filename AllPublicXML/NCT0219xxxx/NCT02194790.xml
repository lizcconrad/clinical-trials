  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health problem in Thailand. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that integrated pre-dialysis care may slow the decline in renal function
      (Nephrol Dial Transplant.2009 Nov;24(11):3426-33). It is interesting to know whether early
      intervention especially in high risk groups like Diabetic may also improve outcome of these
      patients in primary health care setting resulting in delay of CKD progression.

    <textblock>
      We conducted a 12-month longitudinal study at district A (control) and B (intervention) at
      Kamphaeng Phet Province, Thailand. Diabetic patients with eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were
      recruited from both districts. Patients in district A (control group) received standard CKD
      care according to NKF-K/DOQI guidelines1 whereas those in district B (intervention) received,
      in addition to the standard care, educational activities provided by nutritionist, pharmacist
      and physiotherapist, and quarterly home visits. Our home visits team consisted of nurse,
      health care officers and village health volunteers. During each hospital visit of both groups
      clinical data were assessed. All laboratory parameters were collected every 3 months, and LDL
      and HbA1C every 6 months. The primary end point was rate of eGFR decline. Secondary outcomes
      were random urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR), blood pressure, waist circumference,
      HbA1C and LDL .
