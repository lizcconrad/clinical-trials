  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies that are either very small or very big have increased perinatal morbidity and
      mortality. Predicting which babies will fall into these groups is traditionally done with
      risk assessment and third trimester manual palpation, however neither of these techniques are
      sensitive and a considerable number of affected pregnancies are missed. This results in
      stillbirth for small babies or birth trauma for larger ones. Serial scanning in the third
      trimester can improve detection rates but this is expensive and cannot currently be provided
      to all NHS patients.

      A more sensitive test that can be performed earlier in pregnancy would allow identification
      of at risk pregnancies allowing for increased monitoring. New three dimensional ultrasound
      techniques that measure volume and volumetric flow have become available that may allow this
      to happen. This study proposes to trial newer ultrasound techniques on a cohort of pregnant
      women. The findings from these scans will then be correlated with actual birth weights at the
      end of pregnancy to determine the ability of these parameters to act as screening tools for
      babies at the extremes of size.
