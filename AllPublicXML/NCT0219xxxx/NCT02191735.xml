    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is designed to demonstrate the performance characteristics of the
      RAMP® cardiac tests analyzed on the RAMP® 200 by non-laboratorial Operators at the
      point-of-care when compared to the results for the same samples analyzed on the RAMP® Reader.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Substantial Equivalence of the RAMP® Reader and the RAMP® 200 when running the RAMP® Cardiac tests.</measure>
    <time_frame>method comparison - subjects will be followed for the duration of 1 blood draw, with a total study enrollment over 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to achieve substantial equivalence of the RAMP® cardiac tests on the RAMP® Reader and the RAMP® 200 in a point-of-care (POC) setting by evaluating the following analytical performance specifications:
precision on the RAMP® 200, when used at maximum complexity, utilizing frozen control materials;
precision on the RAMP® 200, when used at maximum complexity, utilizing whole blood specimens; and,
performance via method comparison across the reportable ranges of the RAMP® cardiac tests.</description>

    <description>The RAMP® Reader is a general use fluorometer that analyzes results produced by immunoassays that use a fluorophore having an excitation wavelength at 560 nm and an emission wavelength of 610 nm. The RAMP® 200 is Response Biomedical's second generation reader. The RAMP® 200 is designed to process more tests with a smaller footprint.</description>

        Approximately 600 total subjects, 18 years of age and older will be enrolled into this
        study at a minimum of 3 sites in the United States of America (USA).

        Each site will screen for a minimum of approximately 200 clinical surplus whole blood
        samples derived from subjects presenting with symptoms and signs indicative of
        cardiovascular heart disease (i.e. acute myocardial infarction and/or heart failure). It is
        expected that the population will be divided approximately equally between males and
        females. Clinical site enrollment will be monitored throughout the trial to verify
        population distribution.
