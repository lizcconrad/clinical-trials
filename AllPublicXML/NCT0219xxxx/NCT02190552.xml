  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A.R.I.S.E. is a post approval observational study using standard care. The purpose of this
      study is to collect information about the ability of the EmboTrap device to remove blood
      clots from the brain, and the associated performance characteristics and clinical outcomes.
      No formal hypothesis testing is needed as no comparisons are planned within the study.
      Instead, estimates of each population parameter of interest for all primary and secondary
      endpoints will be provided using appropriate confidence intervals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient or the patient's legally authorized representative has signed and dated an
             Informed Consent Form.

          -  Aged between 18 years and 80 years (inclusive).

          -  A new focal disabling neurologic deficit consistent with acute cerebral ischemia.

          -  NIHSS score ≥8 and ≤25.

          -  Pre-ictal mRS score of 0 or 1.

          -  Angiographic confirmation of an occlusion of an ICA (including T and L occlusions), M1
             or M2, MCA, or BA with TICI flow of 0-1.

          -  Confirmation by the interventionalist, after screening CT or MRI, that the treatment
             site can be accessed with the Neuravi device.

          -  The interventionalist estimates that at least one deployment of the Neuravi device can
             be completed within 5 hours from the onset of symptoms, or if time of onset of
             symptoms is unknown or &gt; 5 hours, patients can be included using imaging with the
             following criteria:

               1. MRI criterion: ASPECTS 8 to 10, or,volume of diffusion restriction ≤30 mL and
                  mismatch between perfusion reduction and diffusion restriction present.

               2. CT criterion: ASPECTS 8 to 10 on baseline CT or CTA-source images, or, volume of
                  significantly lowered CBV ≤30 mL and mismatch between perfusion reduction and low
                  CBV present.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy of less than 6 months.

          -  History of severe allergy to contrast medium.

          -  Has suffered a stroke in the past three months.

          -  The patient presents with an NIHSS score &lt;8 or &gt;25 or is physician assessed as being
             in a clinically relevant uninterrupted coma.

          -  Use of warfarin anticoagulation with International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 3.0.

          -  Platelet count &lt; 50,000.

          -  Glucose &lt; 50 mg/dL.

          -  Heparin use in previous 24 hours with PTT or ACT &gt; 2X normal.

          -  Any known hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency.

          -  Computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidence of recent/ fresh
             hemorrhage on presentation.

             pc-ASPECTS ≤ 7 on baseline CT or CTA-source images, or extensive DWI lesions in the
             midbrain or pons regions on pre-treatment MRI.

          -  Baseline CT or MRI showing mass effect or intracranial tumor (except small
             meningioma).

          -  Excessive arterial tortuosity that precludes the study device from reaching the target
             vessel.

          -  A proximal stenosis or complete occlusion that cannot, as judged by the responsible
             interventionalist, be treated safely or which prevents access to the occluded vessel
             with the Neuravi device.
