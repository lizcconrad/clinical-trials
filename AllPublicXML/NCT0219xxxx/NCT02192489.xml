      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy
      of oral CC-220 in adult subjects with chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential,
      dose-ascending, safety and tolerability study in subjects with chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis.

      Two dose cohorts of CC-220 (Cohort 1: 0.3 mg by mouth (PO) every day (QD) or matching placebo
      and Cohort 2: 0.6 mg PO QD or matching placebo) will be evaluated using a sequential,
      dose-ascending design
