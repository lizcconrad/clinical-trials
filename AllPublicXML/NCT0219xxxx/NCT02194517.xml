  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ELKa system is an advanced toolset which helps performing calculation of carbohydrate (CHO)
      and fat/protein (FP) exchanges. It consists of ELKa software including database of various
      meals and nutrients and ELKaPlus digital kitchen scale transmitting weight of products in a
      real-time to a computer via universal serial bus (USB) port. After choosing the name of
      particular product from the list, the program gives precise information about the amount of
      CHO and FP exchanges in serving.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the benefit of using ELKa toolset in comparison with
      standard method of CHO and FP counting on metabolic control in type 1 diabetic children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, parallel, open-label 26-week clinical trial will be conducted in
      106 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients will be randomly assigned
      into two groups: the group A (n=53) using ELKa system for food exchange counting and the
      group B (n= 53) using standard method.

      The glycated hemoglobin levels will be measured in both groups at the beginning, after 3 and
      6 months of observation. The group A also will be asked about the frequency of using the
      toolset. We will also assess secondary endpoints (mentioned below).
