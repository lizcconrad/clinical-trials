  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the physiologic effects of these (PEP/ HFOO) resources
      may have positive effects in this population of children with acute respiratory illness.

      Thinking about this physical and physiological issue and due to the absence of a study that
      has evaluated the effectiveness of these instruments in patients with pneumonia, the
      objective of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects OOAF and mask of EPAP in
      children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pneumonia is characterized by an acute infectious and inflammatory process, usually
      compromises the alveoli, bronchioles and interstitial space difficulting hematosis and may be
      in some or all of the cells filled with liquid and blood cells. The accumulation of secretion
      occurs as a consequence of this infectious and inflammatory process and contributes to
      clinical worsening by increasing airway resistance.

      Respiratory physiotherapy has been questioned in patients with pneumonia and recent clinical
      studies have shown that there is no benefit to these patients. Respiratory physical therapy
      in addition to manual techniques has in his repertoire instrumental resources such as
      therapeutic high-frequency oral oscillator (HFOO) and the mask of expiratory positive
      pressure (PEP). The hypothesis of this study is that physical and physiological effects of
      these resources may have positive effects in this population of children with acute
      respiratory illness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects HFOO and
      mask of PEP in children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.
