      Background:

      - Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. A chemical
      called a radiotracer helps doctors get images of this type of cancer. Researchers want to
      test a radiotracer called 18F-DCFBC.

      Objective:

      - To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFBC can identify sites of prostate cancer in the body.

      Eligibility:

      - Men ages 18 and over with prostate cancer. The cancer must be newly diagnosed, have
      relapsed, or has spread outside the prostate.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with physical exam and medical history. They will give a
           blood sample.

        -  Participants will be divided into three groups.

      Group 1: people with cancer only in the prostate scheduled for surgical prostate removal or
      biopsy at NIH.

      Group 2: people who had their prostate removed or had radiation therapy and now have a rising
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without other signs of disease.

      Group 3: people whose cancer has spread to other areas of the body.

        -  Participants will have 18F-DCFBC injected into a vein then imaged in a PET/CT camera.
           During the scans, they will lie on their back on the scanner table.

        -  Group 1 will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A tube will be placed in the
           rectum. Coils may be wrapped around the outside of the pelvis. Participants will have a
           contrast agent injected through an intravenous line.

        -  Group 3 will have another PET/CT scan with a different radiotracer, 18F NaF, within 21
           days of the 18F-DCFBC scan to look for prostate cancer in the bone.

        -  Group 3 will repeat the two PET/CT scans 4-6 months after the initial scans.

        -  A few days after each scan, participants will be contacted for follow-up.

      Background

        -  Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men.

        -  Current methods of imaging advanced prostate cancer (CT and bone scan) are non specific
           and new, more specific molecular imaging probes are sought.

        -  Many prostate cancers express the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) a
           transmembrane protein with NAALADase enzymatic activity. PSMA is also expressed in
           angiogenesis but otherwise has limited expression in normal tissue.

        -  18F-DCFBC is a radiolabeled PET agent which binds with high affinity to PSMA and through
           whole-body non-invasive functional imaging, may provide new information on the
           expression of PSMA.

      Primary Objective

      - To assess the ability of 18F-DCFBC to differentiate between tumorous and nontumorous
      tissues in localized, recurrent (based on rising PSA post treatment) and metastatic prostate
      cancer

      Eligibility

        -  Subject is greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  ECOG 0-2 with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and fits criteria for one of the following:

        -  ARM 1

           -- Patients with known localized prostate cancer with a soft tissue lesion at least 6mm
           or greater.

           ---A multiparametric MRI (standard of care at the NIH Clinical Center) must be performed
           within 4 months of18F-DCFBC injection with findings suggestive for prostate cancer and
           confirmed with histopathology.

        -  ARM 2

             -  Patients with biochemical prostate cancer relapse after definitive treatment

                  -  For patients status post radiation therapy for prostate cancer, a PSA increase
                     from post radiation therapy nadir

                  -  OR

                  -  For patients status post prostatectomy, any PSA &gt;/=0.2 ng/ml

             -  Nonspecific or no evidence for disease on standard imaging modality

        -  ARM 3

             -  Patients with identifiable metastatic disease on a conventional imaging modality.
                If only soft tissue metastasis, one lesion must measure 6mm or greater. Patients
                must have confirmation of prostate cancer prior to 18F-DCFBCimaging.

      Design

      This is a single site 3-arm study enrolling a total of 110 evaluable patients: Arm 1 will
      include 12 patients with presumed localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo
      prostatectomy or biopsy within 4 months of enrollment; Arm 2 will include 78 patients with
      biochemical recurrence without evidence of metastasis on conventional imaging; and Arm 3 will
      include 20 patients with known metastatic disease who may or may not be on or/scheduled to
      begin therapeutic intervention. Patients with presumed localized disease will undergo a
      standard of care, clinical multiparametric endorectal coil MRI in the NCI Molecular Imaging
      Clinic within 4 months of screening. Patients in Arm 3 will undergo 2 imaging sessions:
      baseline and 4-6 month follow-up. Clinical records (including PSA) and treatment (if any)
      that occurred in the imaging interval must be available. All patients in Arm 3 will also
      undergo Na18F PET/CT for evaluation of bone metastases as part of this protocol. In order to
      allow for a small number of nonevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 125.
