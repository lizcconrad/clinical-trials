  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different antiplatelet drugs played various role in coronary artery disease. The mechanisms
      were unclear. Platelet reactivation maybe was one of major causes. Compared with clopidogrel,
      Ticagrelor is more powerful antiplatelet drug. However, because of increased bleeding and
      dyspnea risk, both loading double dose and following second dose time had potential risk and
      inconvenient in routine clinical work, especially in elective PCI of comparable stable
      patients in Chinese. The benefit and risk should be balanced in such patients. The
      investigators supposed loading single dose and followed by second routine time dose was
      superior to clopidogrel and safer than ticagrelor previously prescribed.

      All admission patients were divided into two groups, the first group were prescribed loading
      dose (180 mg) ticagrelor, the second group were prescribed with 90 mg ticagrelor. We measured
      both platelet activity and platelet reactivity using the LTA at baseline, pre-operation and
      post-operation. All bleeding or dyspnea events were recorded in hospital period.

      Primary endpoints: platelet activity, platelet reactivity using the LTA and safety events
      were recorded in hospital period.
