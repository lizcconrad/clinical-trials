    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common and important clinical problem in childhood.Upper
      urinary tract infections (ie, acute pyelonephritis) may lead to renal scarring, hypertension,
      and end-stage renal disease.Pathogenesis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) is associated with
      urinary tract anatomy and function, bacterial virulence factors, the host innate immune
      system and production of free radicals. Oxygen-free radicals and oxidative stress play a role
      in renal scar formation after an APN. Oxygen-free radical scavengers and antioxidants can
      reduce tissue damage and renal scaring during acute pyelonephritis.we want to publish a study
      that indicates that antioxidant therapy with omega-3 given to children with pyelonephritis
      may indeed lower the risk for renal scarring.

      Several studies show that omega-3 alleviated oxidative stress and inflammation.This study is
      a simple randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of omega-3 in addition to
      antibiotic on preventing renal scaring after acute pyelonephritis in children. This
      randomized clinical trial on 60 patients in 2 groups (intervention &amp; control) is
      conducted.Children aged 1 month to 10 years with positive urine culture, clinical findings,
      and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy-based evidence in favor of acute
      pyelonephritis were enrolled into a clinical trial. Patients with neurogenic bladder,
      systemic hypertension, obstructive uropathy and high grade vesicouretera are
      excluded.Patients in Intervention group are administered omega-3 based on body weight in
      divided doses in addition to antibiotic regimens and patients in control group received
      antibiotic regimens without omega-3. Primary outcome is the development of renal scar by
      doing DMSA renal scan on the 7th day of admission and four to six months after the
      intervention and compared between groups.Also,measurement of urinary biomarker of acute
      kidney injury (NGAL) three days after antibiotic or omega-3 administration for assessing of
      subsequent scarring in both groups will be done . Secondary outcome is the incidence and
      severity of renal scarring after pyelonephritis and response to treatment between two groups.
