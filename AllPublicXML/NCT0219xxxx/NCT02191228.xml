  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of normal and impaired renal
      function on the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of linagliptin following oral
      administration of 5 mg daily for 7 days (Groups 1 to 3), 5 mg daily for 10 days (Groups 6 and
      7), or as a single dose (Groups 4 and 5)

             contraception along with a barrier method)

          -  Lactation period

        Subjects with normal renal function (Group 1) and subjects with T2DM and normal renal

             hepatorenal syndrome)

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than renal impairment were excluded. A
             significant disease was defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator
             put the patient at risk during participation in the study, could influence the results
             of the study, could influence the patient's ability to participate in the study, or
             was an unstable condition. Patients with diabetes (for Groups 1 to 5) or hypertension
             could be included in the trial if the disease was not significant according to these
             criteria.
