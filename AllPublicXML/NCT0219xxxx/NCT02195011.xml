    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of regorafenib, an antiangiogenic drug,
      when combined with radioembolization using SIR-Spheres® microspheres in the treatment of
      colorectal cancer (CRC) that has spread to the liver.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent targeted therapies and treatment strategies have shown promise in colorectal cancer;
      however, elimination of disease remains a challenge once spread to the liver.
      Radioembolization using SIR-Spheres® microspheres (SIR-Spheres) to treat liver-only or
      liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been successful in this refractory
      setting. In this open-label study we will compare the safety of two treatment cohorts in
      which radioembolization will be administered using the device SIR-Spheres microspheres (90Y
      resin microspheres) in combination with regorafenib to patients with mCRC with liver
      metastases. The two treatment cohorts will be evaluated for safety, overall response rate
      (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

    <description>Cohort 1: Regorafenib (one cycle) followed by SIR-Spheres followed by re-initiation of regorafenib 2-4 weeks after SIR-Spheres.
Twenty-five patients will be treated in Cohort 1. Patients will take regorafenib 160 mg orally once daily on Days 1-21 of each 28-day treatment cycle. SIR-Spheres microspheres will then be administered to the patient by injection through a trans-femoral catheter into the hepatic artery. Treatment with regorafenib will be re-started 2-4 weeks after administration of SIR-Spheres.</description>
