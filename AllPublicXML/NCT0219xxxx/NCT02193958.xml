      A Phase 1/2a Dose Escalation Study of FF-10501-01 in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory
      Hematological Malignancies to determine the safety and tolerability. A total of 6 cohorts
      will be enrolled in Phase 1 to establish the MTD. A total of 20 subjects with MDS/CMML
      treated at the RP2D are planned, including MDS/CMML subjects treated at the RP2D in Phase 1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive FF-10501-01 orally on a twice daily schedule for 14, 21 or 28 days
      repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle). Disease assessments, including analysis of blood and bone
      marrow aspirates, will be performed at the end of Cycle 1 and every 2 cycles thereafter.
      Subjects who demonstrate objective response or stable disease will be allowed to continue
      therapy with FF-10501-01 until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse
      events, intercurrent illness or changes in condition that prevent further study
      participation.

          -  Known family history of hereditary heart disease

          -  QT interval corrected for rate (QTc) &gt; 450 msec on the electrocardiogram (ECG)
             obtained at Screening

          -  Concomitant medication(s) that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de
             Pointes, with the exception of anti-microbials that are used as standard of care to
             prevent or treat infections and other such drugs that are considered by the
             Investigator to be essential for the care of the patient.

          -  Presence of active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. Subjects adequately treated
             for CNS leukemia documented by 2 consecutive cerebrospinal fluid samples negative for
             leukemia cells are eligible. Subjects with no history of CNS leukemia will not be
             required to undergo cerebrospinal fluid sampling for eligibility.

          -  Known positive for HIV, hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C
             virus (HCV).

          -  Active infection requiring IV anti-infective usage within the last 7 days prior to
             study treatment.

          -  Any other medical intervention or condition which could compromise adherence to study
             requirements or confound the interpretation of study results.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Treatment with any investigational product within 28 days prior to Screening.
