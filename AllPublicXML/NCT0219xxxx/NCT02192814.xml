    <textblock>
      EP0024 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      intravenous (iv) lacosamide (LCM). Adjunctive iv LCM therapy (200 mg/day to 400 mg/day) will
      be administered for 5 days as replacement for oral LCM tablets in Japanese adults with
      partial-onset seizures.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.

    <description>On Day - 1, LCM oral tablets were administered in accordance with each subject's LCM dosage regimen in EP0009 (NCT01832038). The oral tablets were taken from EP0009 supply.
During the Treatment Period, subjects received a 30-minute infusion of intravenous (iv) LCM twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, for 5 days.
The daily dose of iv LCM was the same as the subject's daily dose of oral LCM in EP0009 (200 - 400 mg/day).</description>
