  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two standard methods of pain control management used
      at Spectrum Health for patients undergoing major surgery. The two methods being compared are
      the thoracic epidural and the TAP block. The thoracic epidural method involves medication
      being given through a patient's back and the TAP block involves medication being given
      through a patient's abdomen (belly). The investigators will compare side effects experienced
      by the patients that take part in this study, including a change in blood pressure, as well
      as the patients' opinions about their pain management experience after surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical profiles of two currently acceptable
      analgesia techniques in terms of incidence of hypotension with subsequent fluid
      administration and pain control by evaluation of both objective and subjective data. The
      investigators will also compare any additional hospital costs associated with side effect
      management related to either analgesia method.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, open-label trial. Patients who agree to participate
      and satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized at the time of enrollment
      into one of two groups (thoracic epidural or TAP block) using a randomization tool created
      for the study.

      Patients will undergo their scheduled surgery and receive the analgesic method to which they
      have been randomized. Both methods (thoracic epidural or TAP block) are performed routinely
      at Spectrum Health and are considered routine care.

      Data collected will include medical history and demographics from the patient's medical
      record. Intraoperative data will include length of surgery, estimated surgical blood loss,
      complications, blood pressure and medication requirements. Postoperative data will include
      episodes of hypotension (defined as a systolic BP &lt; 90), fluid requirement in first 24 hours
      and first 72 hours, pain scores, narcotic usage, return to bowel function (as defined by
      flatus), time to tolerating a soft or regular diet, and complications. Data will also be
      collected via a survey each study patient will complete for study purposes only.
