      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the treatment with Ivacaftor remains
      effective and safe in the patients with cystic fibrosis (and at least one G551D CFTR
      mutation) in the real life setting, after the drug has been approved by the Health
      authorities.

      The aims of our study are:

        1. to describe the treated population at initiation of treatment,

        2. to evaluate clinical parameters during the year before Ivacaftor was started, at
           initiation of treatment and during at least one year of treatment, until June 2014.

        3. to evaluate the tolerance and safety of this treatment.
