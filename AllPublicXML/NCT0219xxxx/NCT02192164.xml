    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Assessment and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Body divided into 4 sections (head and neck [h], arms [u], trunk [t], legs [l]); each area scored by itself and scores combined for final PASI score. For each section, percent body surface area (A) of skin involved was estimated: 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100 percent involvement), severity estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), scaling (S); 5 point scale: 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked involvement). Final PASI score = 0.1Ah (Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2Au (Eu + Iu + Su) + 0.3At (Et + It + St) + 0.4Al (El + Il + Sl), where head: 0.1; upper limbs: 0.2; trunk: 0.3; lower limbs: 0.4.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Assessment and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Body divided into 4 sections (head and neck [h], arms [u], trunk [t], legs [l]); each area scored by itself and scores combined for final PASI score. For each section, percent body surface area (A) of skin involved was estimated: 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90–100 percent involvement), severity estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), scaling (S); 5 point scale: 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked involvement). Final PASI score = 0.1Ah (Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2Au (Eu + Iu + Su) + 0.3At (Et + It + St) + 0.4Al (El + Il + Sl), where head: 0.1; upper limbs: 0.2; trunk: 0.3; lower limbs: 0.4.</description>

          <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Body divided into 4 sections (head and neck [h], arms [u], trunk [t], legs [l]); each area scored by itself and scores combined for final PASI score. For each section, percent body surface area (A) of skin involved was estimated: 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90–100 percent involvement), severity estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), scaling (S); 5 point scale: 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked involvement). Final PASI score = 0.1Ah (Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2Au (Eu + Iu + Su) + 0.3At (Et + It + St) + 0.4Al (El + Il + Sl), where head: 0.1; upper limbs: 0.2; trunk: 0.3; lower limbs: 0.4.</description>
