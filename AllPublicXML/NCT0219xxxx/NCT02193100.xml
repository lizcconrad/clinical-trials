        Inclusion Criteria for Leukemia Subjects:

          -  Each of the criteria in the following section must be met in order for a patient to be
             eligible for enrollment.

          -  Only patients with clinically diagnosed or histologically diagnosed leukemia will be
             eligible to participate in this non-therapeutic study.

          -  All patients must have measurable quantities of leukemic blasts on peripheral blood
             detected with a CBC.

          -  No history of diabetes for the experimental group or the control group.

          -  Patients with known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS) are excluded.

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign and
             give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Inclusion Criteria forHealthy Subjects:

          -  Subjects must have no known prior history of cancer or malignant blood disorders.
             -Where possible, follow up will be carried out to verify that no cancer has developed
             since the blood collection. This will be done by a phone call performed one month from
             sample to ask if new medical conditions have arisen.

          -  Subjects must have WBC, RBC, and platelet counts within normal range on CBC.

          -  Subjects with known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS) are excluded.

          -  No history of Diabetes

          -  At least 30 years of age

          -  Preferably be fasting for 12 hours (minimum 8 hours) prior to enrollment

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign and
             give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  None listed in protocol
