      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability and efficacy of a
      two month technology-based weight loss program for overweight and obese college students.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial design will be employed to investigate the effectiveness,
      feasibility, and acceptability of a technology-based weight loss pilot intervention for the
      reduction of overweight and obesity in college students. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two conditions: (1) 8-week intervention group, or (2) 8-week attention
      control group. Both conditions include 8 weekly lessons over 8 weeks. Undergraduate students
      (n=100) age 18-22 years who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) will be recruited from
      the University of Tennessee Knoxville. Measurements will be taken at baseline and 8 weeks.
      Since the study is a technology-based intervention, research staff will collect height and
      weight measures for BMI through a novel approach, utilizing Skype video conferencing.

    <description>A mixed methods approach, including online surveys and focus groups, was employed to assess the feasibility of the pilot study. Feasibility was assessed through recruitment and retention data and self-reported records of participant engagement.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in both groups completed an online post-intervention survey. Data were collected and compiled through SurveyMonkey. Surveys were comprised of a combination of closed-ended and open-ended questions. Participants completed text-based focus group using Skype group messaging. Participants were asked to provide feedback on each technology tool in the program, the website, methods of delivery, the duration of the program, and the overall program. A benefit was that the online tools allowed students to maintain anonymity, which could have encouraged participation and sharing.</description>

    <description>The intervention condition will contain multiple components: nutrition education, physical activity, social support, social media (Pinterest and Facebook), and smartphone applications for self-monitoring. Students in this condition will have access to the private study website, which will be the central platform for delivery of the program materials and social support. The website, developed using Wordpress.com, will include nutrition materials, exercise videos, a forum, and links to the study's Facebook and Pinterest pages</description>

    <description>Students randomized to the attention control condition will receive educational emails three times per week. Nutrition materials will be sent once a week, and links to the YouTube exercise videos will be sent twice a week. At the start of the program, students will be emailed a link to the Pandora workout station. The materials sent to the control group will be the same materials posted on the website for the intervention group. Participants will access the emailed lessons and videos each week at their own convenience. Individuals in the attention control condition will not have access to the study website or social media pages.</description>
