  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study are (1) to determine the effectiveness of different dry needling
      dosages in the treatment of myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle in
      patients with myofascial neck pain, (2) to assess postneedling soreness and tenderness and
      (3) evaluate the influence of psychological factors on the perception of postneedling
      soreness.
