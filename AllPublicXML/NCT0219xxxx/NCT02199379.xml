  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, single-dose, sequential-cohort trial in
      subjects with renal impairment and healthy subjects. The study consists of two phases: A
      Pretreatment Phase and a Treatment Phase. The two periods in the Pretreatment Phase are: (1)
      the Screening Period (lasting up to 29 days), and (2) the Baseline Period (one day). The
      Treatment Period of the Treatment Phase lasts 8 days. The study will enroll a sufficient
      number of subjects so that 24 to 26 subjects complete the study. This will include six
      subjects with mild renal impairment (Group 1), six subjects with moderate renal impairment
      (Group 2), four to six subjects with severe renal impairment (Group 3) and eight subjects
      with normal renal function (Group 4). Subjects determined to be eligible for the protocol
      will receive a single 24-mg oral dose of E7080 on Day 1. Subjects will be discharged from
      clinical site on Day 8.

        Inclusion Criteria

        All subjects should meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:

          1. Male or female subjects, ages 18 to 79, inclusive, at the time of informed consent

          2. BMI, 18 to 40 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening

          3. Nonsmokers and smokers who smoke no more than 10 cigarettes per day

          4. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25
             IU/L or equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] at the Screening
             Visit or within 72 hours before the first dose of study drug). Females of
             child-bearing potential, if not practicing total abstinence or having a vasectomised
             partner with confirmed azoospermia, must agree to use two highly effective methods of
             contraception: e.g., 1) an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); 2)
             a barrier method such as a condom or occlusive cup (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)
             plus spermicide (foam, gel, cream, etc.); 3) oral, injected, or implanted hormonal
             contraceptives throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Use of a double-barrier method (i.e., use at the same time of a
             condom plus occlusive cup [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] plus spermicide [foam,
             gel, cream, etc.]) is accepted as two highly effective methods of contraception. The
             only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement are postmenopausal women
             (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the
             appropriate age group, without other known or suspected primary cause) or subjects who
             have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (i.e., bilateral
             tubal ligation with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing, total hysterectomy, or
             bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing). All women who
             are of reproductive potential and who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been
             on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior
             to dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation.

          5. Male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use a condom
             plus spermicide and their female partners if of childbearing potential must use a
             highly effective method of contraception (see methods described in Inclusion Criterion
             No. 4) beginning at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug, throughout
             the entire study period, and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, unless the
             male subjects are totally sexually abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy
             with confirmed azoospermia or unless the female partners have been sterilized
             surgically or are otherwise proven sterile (see Inclusion Criterion No.4).

          6. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and
             ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

        For healthy subjects with normal renal function the following key inclusion criterion will
        also apply:

        1. Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 90 mL/min.

        For subjects with renal impairment, the following key inclusion criteria will also apply:

          1. Subjects must have a diagnosis of renal impairment that has been stable, without any
             change in disease status, for 60 days prior to study screening, as determined by the
             investigator.

          2. Mild (creatinine clearance, 60-89 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance, 30-59
             mL/min), or severe (creatinine clearance, 15-29 mL/min) renal impairment

          3. Other than renal impairment, subjects must have no history of clinically relevant
             disease or condition (e.g., significant cardiac or hepatic dysfunction, diseases of
             the gastrointestinal tract or conditions which may impact drug absorption), as
             determined by the investigator.

          4. Subjects with a history of Type I or Type II diabetes are permissible, providing that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, they have stable disease. Subjects receiving
             insulin therapy are permissible provided that they have been on a stable treatment for
             at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment and continuing through the study.

          5. QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) calculated by Fridericia's formula (QTcF)
             interval lesser than or equal to 500 msec at Screening and Baseline.

          6. Subjects may be enrolled with joint approval of the principal investigator (PI) and
             medical monitor based on subject history and stability of the renal impairment.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

        All Subjects:
