  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo parallel-controlled, multi-center clinical trial.
      Patients with psoriasis vulgaris were randomly divided into the experiment group （treated
      with TGP combined with acitretin capsules) and control group （treated with placebo combined
      with acitretin capsules）.The treatment lasted 12 weeks. The efficacy and safety were
      evaluated at the baseline, as well as 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the beginning of
      treatment.The investigator's hypothesis TGP combined with Acitretin Capsulesin is more safe
      and effective than Acitretin Capsulesin to treat Psoriasis Vulgaris.
