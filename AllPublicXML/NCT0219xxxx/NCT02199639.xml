  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidisciplinary evaluation of patients with hemophilia Spain, El Salvador and Bolivia. It
      aims to analyze and evaluate the skeletal muscle of patients affected with hemophilia Spain,
      El Salvador and Bolivia; describe deficit mobility and muscular strength, depending on the
      degree of injury, age, presence of inhibitors and the development of physical activity;
      identify the relationship between the functional deficit by clinical assessment performed
      with the use of validated measurement scales, the assessment of the degree of injury to
      specific scales of hemophilia; detect biomechanical alterations of the lower limbs and their
      impact on gait in patients with hemophilia; and evaluate the factors that influence the
      perception of illness and quality of life of patients with hemophilia.

      Descriptive study of joint involvement in patients with hemophilia Spain, El Salvador and
      Bolivia.

      Descriptive study of abnormal joint mobility and muscle strength as a result of acute
      conditions or the development of chronic articular sequelae.

      Descriptive study of biomechanical changes in lower limb joints and their impact on gait in
      patients with hemophilia.

      Descriptive study of the overall articular involvement (crepitus, pain, biomechanical and
      functional changes) in patients with hemophilia.

      Descriptive study of the relationship between skeletal muscle pathology in patients with
      hemophilia and their perception of it, and their quality of life.
