  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with circular external fixation will have better outcomes (as measured by
      range of motion (ROM), alignment, outcome surveys) than those treated with open reduction and
      internal fixation (ORIF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare patients who undergo ORIF versus circular external
      fixation for supracondylar humerus fractures in children ages 12-18. We are asking parental
      permission to collect information about their child's injury, x-rays, obtain ROM measures,
      collect input from questionnaires, and review other medical information relating to the
      injury.

      The study is NOT about randomizing subjects to treatment, rather we are asking permission to
      keep track of the decisions that are made about our population's treatment and how it impacts
      their recovery.

      The eligibility criteria is subject's between 12 and 18 years, if supracondylar/periarticular
      humerus fracture needed operative fixation, and the fracture is unable to be treated with
      percutaneous skeletal fixation. Patients will be excluded if they have had a previous elbow
      injury, Osteogenesis imperfecta or another fragile bone disease, elbow stiffness from another
      cause, or any pre-existing arm weakness.

      The outcome measures all enrolled subjects will complete are the QuickDASH and the Pediatric
      and Adolescent Outcomes Instruments (PODCI). The QuickDASH is a shortened version of the DASH
      (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Outcome Measure which is intended to measure
      symptoms and functions in people with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The
      QuickDASH is valid and reliable and is used for clinical and research purposes. The PODCI is
      designed to assess patients overall health, pain and ability to participate in normal daily
      activities in patients under 19 years of age. We will only distribute both questionnaires to
      the subjects and we are not collecting parent perception.

    <description>Assessing ROM (elbow flexion/extension) in the initial post-operative period and long-term follow-up is an important outcome measure since it correlated with the ability to perform certain tasks with the arm (e.g. reaching head to shampoo/brush hair, reaching mouth to eat, etc.) The visit time frame as outlined above reflects the visits a child would typically return to clinic after surgery for a supracondylar fracture. Every visit will have a threshold of a few weeks to allow the family to return to clinic. These visits are all after the surgery has been performed. For example, the first or initial visit is the first time the patient will return to the hospital after surgery. At this visit the potential participant will be presented with the study materials and given the opportunity to participate. Should the participant participate the visits in the time frame will occur at the give interval.</description>

        Patients at Texas Children Hospital will undergo either an open reduction with internal
        fixation or a closed reduction and circular ring external fixation based on the operating
        surgeon's preference. We do not plan on randomizing or assigning patients that present to
        Texas Children's Hospital with a supracondylar humerus fracture. Children that consent to
        participate will strictly continue their follow-up with the physician that performed the
        surgery. Post-operative course will be noted, physical exam and x-rays followed and outcome
        surveys obtained and measured intervals.
