  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal time to use the Tumor RNA Disruption
      Assay (RDA) as a predictor of pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with breast
      cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      This is important because the earlier non-responders are identified, the greater is the
      impact of reducing side effects of ineffective treatments.

      The study hypothesis is that the RDA score will accurately predict for tumor response after
      one cycle of chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective clinical trial will determine if the tumor RDA score can predict for pCR
      after the first, second, and third cycles of chemotherapy in women with breast cancer treated
      with neoadjuvant therapy. Tumor RDA score will also be measured after the first dose of any
      new chemotherapy agent if residual palpable disease is present.

      Data will be collected until accrual target of 30 patients is met. All patients will undergo
      core needle biopsy of the breast tumor and analysis of ER, PR, and HER-2-Neu receptors.
      Patients will receive neoadjuvant therapy as recommended by their treating physicians. All
      chemotherapy regimens will be acceptable for participation in this study. Usually, these
      regimens are between 6 to 8 cycles, often with a switch of chemotherapy regimens after 3 to 4
      cycles.

      Evaluation of tumor size will be determined by 2 axis tumor measurement performed prior to,
      and after each chemotherapy treatment. The Tumor RDA score will be evaluated by performing
      fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies under local anesthetic, if the tumor is clinically
      palpable, after the first, second, and third cycles of chemotherapy. Tumor RDA score will
      also be determined if palpable tumor is present after the first cycle of any second
      chemotherapy agent.
