  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) on adolescents (12 to 17
      years) with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is studied. Participants are randomized to either
      ICBT or a no-treatment condition. We expect ICBT to be superior over the no-treatment
      condition.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of Internet-delivered cognitive
      behavior therapy (ICBT) for adolescents (12 - 17 years) with OCD. We aim to conduct a
      randomized controlled study with N = 66 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to ICBT or a wait list condition, either lasting 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the
      Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). Study participants will be
      followed up 3 and 12 months after treatment. ICBT is expected to yield significantly better
      symptom reduction than the wait list condition.
