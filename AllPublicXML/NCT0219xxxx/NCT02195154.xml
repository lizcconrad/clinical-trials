    <textblock>
      Forty patients with clinically diagnosed VP and 20 healthy subjects will be enrolled in the
      study. Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and each subject will have 3 visits in the study, as one screening visit,
      one imaging visit, and one safety evaluation visit.

      Study duration is expected to be completed in a period of 3 year. The study will enroll 40
      patients with VP and 20 healthy subjects.

      This neuroimaging study includes the 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET, MRI structure images, diffusion
      tensor imaging, susceptibility weighted imaging, resting state and gait-related imagery task
      functional MRI. Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria according the subject group, each subject will have 3 visits in this
      study. Safety measurement for 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ will be evaluated by medical history, vital
      signs, physical examinations, laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.

    <description>During this study, subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of approximately 10 mCi 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ immediately prior to imaging. The compound is labeled with fluorine 18F that decays by positron (Î²+) emission and has a half life of 109.7 min. The principal photons useful for diagnostic imaging are the 511 keV gamma photons, resulting from the interaction of the emitted positron with an electron.
The proposed dose for this study is based on the phase I study. At the proposed human dose of 10 mCi, the whole body effective dose (ED) will be approximately 680 mrem. The estimated human ED is expected to be comparable to or below the range of other approved brain imaging agents, such as 18F-FDG.</description>
