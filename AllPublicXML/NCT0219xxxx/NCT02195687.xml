    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of the subject's CFLs at maximum smile using the 4-point FWS-A where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe. The percentage of subjects with a score of none or mild at Day 30 is reported.</description>

    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of the subject's CFLs at rest using the 4-point Facial Wrinkle Scale where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe among subjects rated as at least mild at baseline by the Investigator. The percentages of subjects with at least a 1-grade improvement are noted.</description>

    <description>Subjects assessed their global change in appearance using the 7-point SGA-CFL scale where 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse. The percentage of subjects reporting very much improved or much improved are noted.</description>

    <description>Subjects assessed their age-related appearance according to the following on the SPA questionnaire: look my current age, look younger, and look older when compared to their baseline assessment. The percentages of subjects who reported looking younger amongst subjects who rated themselves as looking their current age or older at baseline are noted.</description>
