  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish the relative bioavailability (BA) of two
      different ranitidine hydrochloride 150 mg ODT formulation in comparison to the current, over
      the counter (OTC) ranitidine hydrochloride (Maximum Strength ZANTAC 150®) formulation
      following oral single dose administration in fasting healthy male volunteers
