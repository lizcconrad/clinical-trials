    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a single dose of dexamethasone vs.
      two doses of dexamethasone in mild and moderate asthma exacerbations pediatric patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergency department (ED) physician will follow the standard asthma care path to manage a
      pediatric asthma patient whether the patient meets study criteria or not. Patients' legal
      guardian will be approached for consent if patient meets the study criteria. Once the consent
      is obtained, the patient will be randomized into one of the two study groups according to a
      randomization table generated by a statistician. The first group will receive a single dose
      of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection (0.6 mg/kg with max of 16 mg) mixed with
      equivalent volume of cherry syrup given orally in the ED. The second group will receive a
      first dose of dexamethasone with cherry syrup (also 0.6 mg/kg with max of 16 mg) in the ED,
      and a second dose will be prescribed to the patient at home on the day following the ED
      visit. This dose will be the same dosage of dexamethasone, but may be a pill or liquid form.
      Patients will continue their previously prescribed asthma regimen and albuterol as needed.
      Children who vomit the steroids in the ED will be re-dosed. Children who vomit the steroid a
      second time will be excluded from the study.

      2. Data collection. Demographic information such as age, race, duration of asthma symptoms,
      number of previous hospitalizations, and current medication will be collected on an ED data
      collection form. Pertinent exam findings such as patient's vital signs, pulse oximetry, peak
      flow, Pediatric asthma severity score (PAS), patient asthma severity self-assessment sheets
      (PSAS), and ED treatment will also be collected on an ED data collection form.

      After discharge from the ED, patients will be instructed to complete the PSAS and measure
      peak flows on a daily basis for 5 days. These data will be documented on a home patient
      self-assessment sheet by the legal guardian. The investigators will train the legal guardians
      on how to complete the PSAS and measure peak flows in the ED. The peak flow meters are
      offered to the patients as part of the asthma care path.

      3. Phone follow-up All patients will be contacted by phone by a research assistant 5 days
      after the ED visit. Information collected during the phone interview will include PSAS, peak
      flows, unexpected visits to medical providers (ED, primary care or urgent care) for asthma
      symptoms, school days missed due to asthma exacerbation, length of time symptoms persisted,
      compliance with the recommended steroid regimen, vomiting, other side effects or medication
      administration problems caused by the steroids.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged 2 to 20 years, from all race and ethnicity groups, with a known history
             of asthma who present to the Emergency Department of Women and Children's Hospital of
             Buffalo with an acute exacerbation of mild or moderate asthma are potentially eligible
             for the study. Patients with severe asthma exacerbations will require intravenous
             steroid therapy, therefore, they will not be enrolled in the study. The investigators
             plan to enroll patients from winter of 2014 to fall 2016.

        History of asthma is defined by physician diagnosis of at least 1 prior episode of wheezing
        which responded to beta agonist medication.

        Mild asthma is defined as: Pediatric Asthma Score (PAS) of 5 to 7; Moderate asthma is
        defined as: PAS of 8 to 11; Severe asthma is defined as: PAS of 12 or more.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who have one of the following conditions will be excluded from the study: are
