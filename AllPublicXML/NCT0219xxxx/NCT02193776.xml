    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the mycobactericidal activity of combinations of
      bedaquiline (J), moxifloxacin (M), PA-824 (Pa) and pyrazinamide (Z) regimens during 8 weeks
      of treatment.

    <textblock>
      The trial design is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label, partially randomized clinical trial
      in four parallel treatment groups. Subjects with drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) will be
      randomized to receive either J(loading dose/three times a week)PaZ; or J(200mg)PaZ; or HRZE.
      Subjects with multi drug-resistant tuberculosis will receive J(200mg)MPaZ. The HRZE treatment
      arm is included as a control for the drug-sensitive treatments and as a control for the
      quantitative laboratory mycobacteriology testing.

      A total of approximately 240 male and female, newly diagnosed subjects with drug-sensitive or
      multi drug-resistant, smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis aged 18 to 75 years (inclusive)
      will be included in the study. A total of 180 subjects with drug-sensitive tuberculosis (60
      per treatment arm) will be randomized. Up to 60 subjects with multi-drug resistant
      tuberculosis will be assigned.

      All subjects will have up to a maximum of 9 days screening, receive 8 weeks of treatment, and
      have follow-up visits at 2 and 12 weeks after study treatment completion or last dose of
      investigational medicinal product in the case of early withdrawal. Subjects who withdraw from
      the study after receiving &lt; 14 days of investigational medicinal product, will only attend a
      follow-up visit at 2 weeks after last dose of investigational medicinal product.

      Upon treatment completion, the subjects with drug-sensitive tuberculosis will be provided
      with sufficient doses of standard of care tuberculosis treatment, as appropriate, to cover
      the time period from attending their last visit at the study clinic until their scheduled
      visit at the TB clinic. All subjects with drug sensitive and multi-drug resistant
      tuberculosis will be referred to the local community tuberculosis clinics for standard
      anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy according to National Tuberculosis Guidelines.

             prior to randomization. It should be confirmed that the MDR-TB treatment can be safely
             stopped and the screening period is long enough to allow for a washout period of 5
             times the longest half-life of the drugs.

         18. Any diseases or conditions in which the use of the standard TB drugs or any of their
             components is contra-indicated, including but not limited to acute gout, allergy to
             any TB drug, their component or to the IMP.

         19. Use of any drug within 30 days prior to dosing known to prolong QTc interval
             (including but not limited to amiodarone, bepridil, chloroquine, chlorpromazine,
             cisapride, cyclobenzaprine, clarithromycin, disopyramide dofetilide, domperidone,
             droperidol, erythromycin, halofantrine, haloperidol, ibutilide, levomethadyl,
             mesoridazine, methadone, pentamidine, pimozide, procainamide, quinidine, sotalol,
             sparfloxacin, thioridazine). Exceptions may be made for Subjects that have received 3
             days or less of one of these drugs or substances, if there has been a wash-out period
             before administration of IMP equivalent to at least 5 half-lives of that drug or
             substance. Subjects who have taken drugs with long elimination half-lives such as
             amiodarone should be discussed with the Sponsor.

         20. Use of any drugs or substances within 30 days prior to dosing known to be strong
             inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes (including but not limited to
             quinidine, tyramine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, testosterone, quinine, gestodene,
             metyrapone, phenelzine, doxorubicin, troleandomycin, cyclobenzaprine, erythromycin,
             cocaine, furafylline, cimetidine, dextromethorphan). Exceptions may be made for
             Subjects that have received 3 days or less of one of these drugs or substances, if
             there has been a wash-out period before administration of IMP equivalent to at least 5
             half-lives of that drug or substance.

         21. Any ARVs other than allowable ARVs detailed in exclusion criteria no. 7 above.

             Based on Laboratory Abnormalities:

         22. Subjects with the following toxicities at screening as defined by the enhanced
             Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease (DMID) adult toxicity table:

               1. serum magnesium and calcium (corrected for albumin) levels outside of the
                  laboratory's reference range

               2. lipase grade 3 or greater (&gt;2.0 x ULN);

               3. creatinine grade 2 or greater (&gt;1.5 x ULN);

               4. hemoglobin grade 4 (&lt;6.5 g/dL);

               5. platelets &gt; grade 2 (under 50x10(9) cells/L);

               6. serum potassium less than the lower limit of normal for the laboratory;

               7. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) grade 3 or greater (≥3.0 x ULN) to be excluded;

               8. alanine aminotransferase (ALT) grade 3 or greater (≥3.0 x ULN) to be excluded;

               9. alkaline phosphatase (ALP) grade 4 (&gt;8.0 x ULN) to be excluded, grade 3 (≥3.0 -
                  8.0 x ULN) must be discussed with and approved by the Sponsor Medical Monitor;

              10. total bilirubin grade 3 or greater (≥2.0 x ULN, or ≥1.50 x ULN when accompanied
                  by any increase in other liver function test) to be excluded, grade 2 (≥1.50 x
                  ULN, or ≥1.25 x ULN when accompanied by any increase in other liver function
                  test) must be discussed with and approved by the Sponsor Medical Monitor
