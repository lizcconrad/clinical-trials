  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Mesalamine and Amitriptyline drugs on the
      Quality of Life and Symptom Severity Scale in patients with Diarrhea- Predominant Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D).

      All patients will fill three validated questionnaires (IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) ,
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS ) and IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) ) at the
      beginning of trial and at weeks 2,4,6 and 8 of treatment.

      Serum Immune Bio markers will be measured at 0,4, and 8 weeks of treatment. This study is a
      clinical trial upon 90 patients with Diarrhea- Predominant IBS (IBS-D) who are referred for
      the first time to our private gastrointestinal clinic from 2014 until 2016.

      All patients who meet the inclusion criteria enrolled for a 2-week period screening phase. In
      order to exclude patients with Lactose intolerance, all patients take a lactose-free diet for
      14 days before inclusion and patients whose symptoms improve by this regimen will be
      excluded.

      This trial is a double-blind study and all patients will be assigned randomly to three
      groups:

        1. Mesalazine group: Patients receive Asacol (800 mg/TDS) and a placebo agent similar to
           Amitriptyline (10 mg/HS) for 8 weeks

        2. Amitriptyline group: Patients receive Amitriptyline (10 mg/HS) and a placebo like Asacol
           (800 mg/ TDS) for 8 weeks

        3. Control group (placebo group): Patients receive placebo like Asacol (800 mg/TDS) and
           placebo similar to Amitriptyline (10 mg/HS) for 8 weeks

      Ethical considerations:

        1. All patients will fulfill an informed consent

        2. Drugs are available without any charge

        3. Observation of Helsinki ethical statement
