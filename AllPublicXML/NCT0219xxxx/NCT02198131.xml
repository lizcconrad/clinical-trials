      This pilot trial studies pulsed dye laser in treating patients with post radiation dysphonia.
      Dysphonia, or vocal cord scarring, can include trouble with the voice when trying to talk,
      such as hoarseness, change in voice pitch, and poor voice quality, and it commonly happens
      after radiation therapy for laryngeal cancer. Pulsed dye laser may improve post radiation
      dysphonia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the use of pulsed dye laser in treatment of the dysphonia that commonly
      results after radiation therapy for laryngeal carcinoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo pulsed dye laser monthly for three months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.
