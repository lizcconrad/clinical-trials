  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clarify whether the matching acupoints is more effective than
      a single point by electroacupuncture in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and
      vomiting .

    <description>choose single point:Zhongwan(CV12).Zhongwan(CV12):On the upper abdomen, 4 B-cun superior to the centre of the umbilicus, on the anterior median line.Manipulating until achieving a &quot;de Qi&quot; sensation,then the needle is connected through a electro-acupuncture apparatus,the positive pole is linked to the needle, and the reference pole is located near the acupoint about 1cm with a paster. Frequency 10Hz,the intensity of stimulation is adjusted according to the patient's tolerance, and the electric current is less than 10mA.The operation lasts for 30 min. The treatmeat is scheduled to occur within 30min-60min before chemotherapy infusion for 4 days.</description>

    <description>Choose both Zusanli(ST36) and Zhongwan（CV12）.Manipulating until achieving a &quot;de Qi&quot; sensation, then the needle is connected through a electro-acupuncture apparatus,the positive pole is linked to the needle, and the reference pole is located near the acupoint about 1cm with a paster.

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group will receive standard antiemetics alone. Standard antiemetics for all groups are based on American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline. 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonist (Ramosetron , Tropisetron)and dexamethasone are supplied from the first day of chemtherapy,and lasting for 3-5days. If nausea and/or vomiting is persistent and failed to respond to the antiemetic treatment , based on the experience of each clinician, the other advanced 5-HT3 antagonist or a neurokinin 1 antagonist(NK-1) will be chosen.</description>
