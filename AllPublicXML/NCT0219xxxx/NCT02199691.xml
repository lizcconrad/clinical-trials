    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of MenACYW conjugate
      vaccine compared to those of a licensed product, MENVEO vaccine and also evaluate MenACYW
      conjugate vaccine when given alone compared to when given with Tdap vaccine and HPV vaccine.

      Primary objective:

        -  To evaluate the antibody responses to the antigens present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine
           when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given alone compared to those when MENVEO vaccine is
           given alone.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To evaluate the antibody responses to the antigens present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine,
           when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given concomitantly with Tdap and HPV vaccines,
           compared to those when it is given alone

        -  To evaluate the antibody responses to the antigens present in Tdap vaccine, when Tdap
           vaccine is given concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine and HPV vaccine, compared
           to those when Tdap vaccine is given with HPV vaccine only

      Observational objective:

        -  To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine, compared to that of the
           licensed vaccine MENVEO®, and when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given with Tdap and HPV
           vaccines.
