      Patients are being asked to participate in a research study because the patients are being
      treated for low back pain and the patients have decided to have an epidural steroid
      injection.

      Low back pain has a tremendous impact on the individual and society. It not only affects the
      individuals quality of life, it also contributes to lost productivity and increased health
      care costs.

      Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are a common treatment option for many forms of low back
      pain. They have been used for low back problems since 1952 and are still being used as a
      non-surgical form of treatment for low back pain. The goal of the injections is reduction of
      pain, increased quality of life and improved function.

      This study is being conducted to determine the outcomes of injections given at the &quot;level of
      MRI Pathology&quot; versus at the &quot;level of clinical symptoms&quot; to see if one is more effective
      than the other and to learn more about the characteristics of the two different injections.
