      1. The number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are inversely
           associated with coronary risk factors and atherosclerotic diseases.

        2. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of
           cilostazol on human early EPCs and endothelial function as well as the potential
           mechanisms of action in patients with high risk for cardiovascular disease.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (one million cells in each) are suspended in 100 µL phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with monoclonal antibodies against human peridinin chlorophyll protein-conjugated cluster of differentiation antigen-45, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human cluster of differentiation antigen-34 antibody and anti-human kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 647. Cells are washed and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with 100,000 events in the lymphocyte gate. EPCs, which are defined as negative for cluster of differentiation antigen-45 and positive for cluster of differentiation antigen-34 and KDR. Based on the peripheral blood mononuclear cell counts, the absolute number of circulating EPCs/µL is calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>250,000 cells are seeded in each well of a 96-well plate and the cells are added with 200 μl of the culture medium and incubated at 37°C. Medium change is performed 3 days later. On 7th day, the plate is then re-incubated with 100 μl fresh medium and additional 50 μl of 2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2 Hydrogen-Tetrazolium-5-Carboxanilide reagent, and further incubated in dark at 37°C for 4 h. After incubation, the orange colored complex formed is read at 450 nm using a microplate reader with a 450 nm reference filter.</description>

    <measure>FMD of the Brachial Artery</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>FMD in response to reactive hyperemia is measured in the left brachial artery in a quiet, temperature-controlled room after 10 min of bed rest. A high-resolution ultrasound machine equipped with a 7.5 mega Hertz linear array probe is used for the study. Arterial diameters are measured at the baseline and during reactive hyperemia. FMD is calculated as the percentage change in diameter compared with the baseline.</description>
