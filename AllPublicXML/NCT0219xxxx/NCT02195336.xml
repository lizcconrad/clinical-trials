  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no methods to reliably select which patients with non-squamous non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that benefit most from treatment with bevacizumab. Data have shown
      that high levels of plasma VEGF are prognostic and correlates with a worse disease outcome in
      some tumour types, including advanced NSCLC.

      Recent data are suggestive of a predictive value of imaging techniques for early detection of
      antiangiogenic treatment efficacy in different cancers. To our knowledge there are no
      presented data available on correlation between changes in diffusion-weighted MR and response
      to bevacizumab treatment in lung cancer. The current study is designed as a pilot study to
      prospectively investigate changes in MR variables during treatment with bevacizumab and to
      detect signals of prognostic and/or predictive value of MR changes during treatment.

      A Non Interventional, open-label, single arm, single institution pilot study. Eligible
      patients will be monitored by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance tomography (dMRT) during
      treatment with bevacizumab + chemotherapy for up to four cycles followed by bevacizumab
      maintenance therapy until disease progression.

             suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational
             drug or puts the patient at high risk for treatment-related complications
