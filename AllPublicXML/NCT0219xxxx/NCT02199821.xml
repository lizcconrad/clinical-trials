      Background and Aims: Nutritional support is considered an integral part of the supportive
      care of bone marrow transplantation patients. Parenteral nutrition emulsions enriched with
      omega-3 fatty acids can modify the inflammatory response. The aim of this study is to compare
      plasma cytokines levels in children after bone marrow transplantation using a lipid formula
      enriched in n-3 FA and other classic soybean oil formula in parenteral nutrition.

      Methods: A randomized double blinded controlled study including 14 children with BMT and
      requiring PN for at least 10 days was conducted using a lipid emulsion with fish oil, or
      soybean oil. Blood samples at baseline, at 10 days and at the end of the PN were taken to
      analyze plasma interleukins 1 beta, 2, 6, 8, 10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-α).
