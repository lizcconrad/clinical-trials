      Corticomedullary differentiation (CMD) abnormality (absent/reversed) is a parameter that can
      indicate possible nephropathy. The evolution of CMD across gestation had not been well
      established. Devrendt et al demonstrated the presence of CMD in all fetuses older then 20
      weeks. In our study we would like to determine the exact timing of it's sonographic
      visualisation. This is a prospective study recruiting women between 14-24 week gestation
      during routine ultrasound screening. A midsagittal image of each kidney will be taken by a
      single sonographer and examined for the presence of the CMD by two other sonographers blinded
      to gestational age.
