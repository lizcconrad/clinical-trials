  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to learn more about the cause of kidney diseases such as Focal
      Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Nephrotic syndrome by studying genetics. The
      investigators are interested in discovering which genes play a role in causing a
      predisposition to FSGS/NS. The investigators also want to learn why FSGS/NS can run in
      families. Participation in our study involves a saliva sample and a urine sample that you can
      give from home. There is no cost to participate. All information is kept private and
      confidential. The investigators also like to include healthy volunteers (parents, spouses) if
      interested/available but of course this is completely optional.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators welcome anyone (with or without a family history) with unexplained, non
      syndromic FSGS, nephrotic syndrome, or proteinuria to join the study. Participation involves
      a saliva (or blood if it is preferable) sample and urine sample (if applicable). There is no
      cost to participate and the study can be done from home in most cases.
