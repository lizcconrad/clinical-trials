      Primary: To support the Regulatory Approval process of Metalyse® in Russian Federation.
      Secondary: To assess the efficacy and safety of single bolus of Metalyse® TNK-tissue
      plasminogen activator (TNK-tPA, Tenecteplase ) in patients with acute myocardial infarction
      in usual routine treatment after market launch

          -  on a twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), ST-segment elevation ≥ 0.1 millivolt (mV) in
             two or more limb leads, or &gt; 0.2 mV in two or more contiguous precordial leads
             indicative of AMI, or left bundle-branch block

          -  age ≥ 18

        Exclusion Criteria:

             hemorrhagic diathesis

          -  patients with current concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy with International
             Normalised Ratio (INR) &gt; 1.3

          -  any history of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or
             spinal surgery)

          -  severe uncontrolled arterial hypertension (hypertension defined as blood pressure
             180/110 mm Hg (systolic BP &gt; 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mm Hg) on one single
             reliable measurement during current admission prior to study enrolment

          -  major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within the past 2
             months (this includes any trauma associated with the current AMI), recent trauma to
             the head or cranium

          -  prolonged or traumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&gt; 2 minutes) within the past 2
             weeks

          -  severe hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension
             (esophageal varices) and active hepatitis

          -  diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy or other hemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions

          -  active peptic ulceration

          -  arterial aneurysm and known arterial/venous malformation
