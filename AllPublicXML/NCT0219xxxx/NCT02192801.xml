    <textblock>
      Patients with classical bladder exstrophy undergo many surgical interventions with secondary
      urinary tract infections complicating their course. lately primary definitive surgical
      correction of this congenital anomaly has been implemented with satisfactory results.
      Although bladder exstrophy patients are born with normal kidneys, infectious and mechanical
      surgical complications can potentially damage their kidneys in the long-term. therefore we
      decided to evaluate renal function in the long-term in these patients.
