    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies communication effectiveness in cancer treatment. Studying
      how well patients and their doctors communicate about the treatment being given for cancer
      may help improve the decisions that patients and physicians make together.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of measuring discrepancies between patient and physician
      perceptions about the intent of therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore possible correlation between various patient satisfaction indicators and
      discrepant patient perceptions about their care.

      II. To gather exploratory data on patient characteristics that might correlate with
      discrepant patient perceptions about their care.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires, including the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Treatment Satisfaction (FACIT-TS-G), the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Spiritual Well Being (FACIT-Sp12), the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey
      (MOS-SSS), and the Distress Thermometer (DT). Doctors also complete a questionnaire.
      Patients' medical records may be reviewed, if necessary.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The precision of agreement between patient's and doctor's responses about the intent of therapy will be assessed. The level of agreement between the questions as answered by the patient on the Prognosis Instrument and by the doctor on the Doctor Questionnaire will be assessed. Agreement will be measured as either &quot;yes&quot; (meaning the doctor and patient responses match exactly) or &quot;no&quot; (any other combination, if both doctor and patient responded). The primary measure of agreement will be the Kappa statistic; the Kappa and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility, as assessed by accrual rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Accrual will be estimated as the number of patients accrued divided by the months of accrual. A 95% confidence interval for the monthly accrual will be calculated based on the Poisson distribution.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility, as assessed by participation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The participation rate will be estimated as the number of patients who are participants divided by the number eligible. This estimate will be calculated separately by cancer type to see what cancer types are more or less likely to participate. An exact 95% CI will be calculated for this estimate of each cancer type.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of discrepancies between patient perceptions and the clinical record</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-TS-G, FACIT-Sp12, MOS-SSS, and DT instruments will be used to see if there might be a relationship between the observed scores and discrepancies in the answers provided by patients and the clinical record. Patient characteristics will be assessed for differences between the two records. Means, standard deviations, and medians will be calculated for each of the scores, stratified by discrepancy type for those who do not match and those who match perfectly. These data will be analyzed by analysis of variance.</description>
