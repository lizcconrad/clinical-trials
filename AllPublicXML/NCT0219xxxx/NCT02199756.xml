  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out whether indomethacin encapsulated within a nanovector
      can stop contractions in pregnant human uterine tissue. Preterm delivery is a major
      contributor to newborn deaths. The treatment of preterm labor includes medications that stop
      contractions within the uterus, or womb. Indomethacin is effective in stopping uterine
      contractions, but crosses the placenta to the unborn baby causing problems for the baby.
      Nanovectors are used to direct the delivery of medications. If indomethacin can be delivered
      directly to the uterus using a nanovector, it may be an ideal medication to treat preterm
      labor. We hypothesize that nanovectors loaded with indomethacin will reduce uterine
      contractions.

      This is a prospective observational study.

      Subjects will undergo a biopsy from the middle of the upper margin of the uterine incision
      measuring 4 x 2 x 2 cm. This will be performed by the managing doctor at the time of cesarean
      section after delivery of the baby. Once the tissue is obtained, the site will be closed
      using sutures similar to the usual closure of the uterus at cesarean section. This biopsy
      will be taken to the laboratory to test whether the nanovector will increase or decrease
      contractions in the uterus. Once this test is finished, the tissue will be frozen and test
      for the absence or presence of the nanovector within the tissue.
