    <textblock>
      To assess the effectiveness of the Stimulation of Activities of Daily Living (SADL)
      Occupational Therapy programme on the independence of ADL by persons with dementia who are
      institutionalized. This programme is based on the recovery of the cognitive functions.

      This study is a longitudinal and prospective clinical trial approved by the bioethics
      Commission of the University of Extremadura. 58 senior citizens institutionalized with
      dementia in residential homes in Extremadura (Spain) received a treatment focusing on
      activities of daily living with the SADL programme and with conventional occupational therapy
      during 5 weeks. The studied variables were the cognitive level and the independence level
      performing ADL. The variables were measured by an occupational therapist independent to the
      study at baseline, after 5 weeks of experimental treatment and 6 weeks after the treatment
      was completed. The standardized tests used were Barthel Index, Lobo's Cognoscitive mini test,
      Lawton and Brody Scale and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS).

    <description>In order to assess the basic activities of daily living (BADL), Barthel Index published in 1.965 by Mahoney y Barthel was applied. This scale provides information at a global level with the general scores (dependence level) and at a specific level with each item's score. A score of less than 20 means total dependence, 20-35 scores mean severe dependence, 40-55 scores mean moderate dependence, equal or over 60 means mild dependency and 100 means independence. This allows the assessment of any changes in each basic activity area evaluated with this scale</description>

    <description>To assess the cognitive level and guarantee the homogeneity of the sample, the adapted and validated Spanish version of the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) test by Lobo et al was used. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) designed by Reisberg et al was also used to determine the deterioration level.</description>

    <description>The experimental group received the Stimulation of Activities of Daily Living (SADL) programme which is a new treatment approach created by the authors of this study for the training of activities of daily living (ADL) through cognitive intervention. The programme is based on the reestablishment of the cognitive functions implied in the performance of basic activities of daily living.
The sequence of the sessions was always the same, varying the activities, subject, cognitive functions and BADL to work on. Each session started with an activity of temporal and space orientation, continued with the performance of the specific activity of the session and finished with a reminiscence activity.
The treatment was applied twice a week (Tuesday and Thursday) for 45 minutes during 5 weeks.</description>

    <description>The control group treatment was based on a conventional occupational therapy intervention for the management of ADL deficits. The compensation approach was used and environment modifications and simplification of activities were applied as the intervention method.
