      This study was designed to provide confirmation of safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
      therapy in chronic kidney disease (CKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will assess the 18-month safety and potential efficacy of autologous MSCs as a therapy for
      CKD. A total of 10 patients with CKD IV injection of high doses 2Ã—106/kg of autologous MSCs
      t, which will be derived from biopsies of their bone marrow. Assessments will be performed at
      1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after cell injection. Changes in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
      were evaluated by scan isotope.
