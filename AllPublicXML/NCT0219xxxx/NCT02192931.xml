    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine (MA) addiction is a public health concern that causes substantial harm to
      individual users, and imposes an economic burden in the U.S. totaling up to $48.3 billion
      annually. This study proposes to address a critical aspect of this problem: the lack of any
      proven, FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for MA users. The proposal combines an
      intervention designed to improve energy metabolism in the brain, and a neuroimaging technique
      capable of measuring the neurochemicals that represent cerebral bioenergetic function. The
      study will replicate and extend a key neuroimaging finding from the investigators recent MA
      studies: that MA users have decreased phosphocreatine (PCr) levels in the brain, compared to
      healthy volunteers. Phosphocreatine is the substrate reservoir for the creatine kinase
      reaction, which reversibly converts PCr into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the brain's major
      energy supply, and creatine. Neuronal energy demands are met through a shift in reaction
      equilibrium, which is designed to maintain the concentration of ATP constant. Research
      results from the investigators recent study also showed that female MA users have lower brain
      PCr levels compared to male users. These findings join the converging lines of evidence that
      MA use is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, i.e. deficient energy metabolism, in the
      brain. Frequently, MA users also experience depression, as well as cognitive deficits.
      Interestingly, both of these entities are also linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in the
      brain.

      The long-term goal of this research program is to define the alterations in brain chemistry
      that underlie MA use disorders, and to utilize translational magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (MRS) neuroimaging to identify rational brain-based treatment targets. Once a
      hypothesis-driven intervention is identified, MRS can then be further employed in treatment
      studies, to verify that &quot;target engagement&quot; is achieved. The specific aims of this proposal
      are an example of this stepwise scientific process: the nutritional supplement creatine will
      be tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of women with MA use disorders, to
      investigate creatine's effect on cerebral PCr levels, depressive symptoms, and MA usage.
