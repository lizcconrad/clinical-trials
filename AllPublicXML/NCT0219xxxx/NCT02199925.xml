  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If autism is the consequence of a chronic inflammatory process preventing the infant brain
      from forming the proper neural connections, then treatment that reduces inflammation might
      have a positive impact on autism. IGIV treatment has been known to suppress inflammation and
      has been used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have come to believe that an immature immune system with abnormal signaling and altered
      apoptotic pathways may result in a process of neuroinflammation with a clinical presentation
      of Autism Spectrum Disorder. If Autism Spectrum Disorders are the consequence of a chronic
      inflammatory process that prevents the infant brain from forming the proper neural
      connections, then treatment that reduces inflammation might have a positive impact on autism.
      We believe that there is a correlation between immunological abnormalities and the
      development of the autism.

    <measure>The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of Gammaplex as an immunomodulatory therapy in autistic children with evidence of immune dysfunction.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is disease improvement, as evidenced by standardized test measures across 3 intervals: screening for baseline measurements, visit 5, and end of study visit measurements. Primary efficacy variables will be measured using the following standardized tests
Caregiver Scales (SRS, CCC-2, ABC)
CGI-S and CGI - I
PPVT
ADOS</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The modulatory effect of IVIG on neuroinflammation will be assessed by laboratory measurements which we believe are indicative of immune dysregulation.</measure>
