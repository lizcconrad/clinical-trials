  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation (KT) requires a life-long immune suppression (IS). It has been
      well-known that long-term IS inevitably causes various complication e.g. infection, toxicity,
      diabetes, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis of hip joint, cataract, acne, and malignancies and
      so on. Tolerance induction showing graft function without maintenance IS has been considered
      as a final solution in the transplantation recipients. Tolerance induction can be achieved in
      KT recipients with donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      In this study, adult patients (18 and more years of age) with a human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA)-haplotype match donor are enrolled. Patients receive preconditioning treatment for HSCT
      1week prior to KT. Bone marrow is harvested from donor under general anesthesia at the time
      of nephrectomy for transplantation in donor. Donor BM is infused immediate
      post-transplantation at intensive care unit (ICU). Immunologic measurements including
      microchimerism study and protocol biopsy will be followed at several time points. IS will be
      tapered slowly and withdrawn over a period of several months.
