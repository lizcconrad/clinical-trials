    <textblock>
      Removing a tumor from a patients brain is hard to do because, very often, brain tumors do not
      have boundaries that are easy for the patients surgeon to find. In many cases, the surgeon
      can't tell exactly where the tumor begins or ends. The surgeon usually can remove most of the
      patients tumor by looking at the MRI images that were taken of the patients brain before
      surgery. However, the surgeon does not have any good way to tell if the entire tumor has been
      removed or not. Removing the entire tumor is very important because leaving tumor behind may
      allow it to grow back which could decrease the chances of survival.
