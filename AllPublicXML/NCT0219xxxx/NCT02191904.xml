      To ensure minimal cervical motion during the intubation of trauma patients is important for
      the prevention of cervical spine injury (CSI) or further deterioration of existing CSI.

      Intubation is required to secure the airway in patient during an anesthesia management or a
      mechanical ventilation at intensive care units. Laryngoscopes are the assisting tools for
      intubations. The most widely used laryngoscope type is one with a Macintosh blade. However,
      various types of laryngoscopes have been developed to be used for in case of difficult
      intubations, the intubation of the patients with head and neck trauma, or the intubation
      attempts carried out by inexperienced individuals. Truview EVO2® and Airtraq® are newly
      developed laryngoscopes, integrated with an optical view system.

      The Truphatek TruView EVO2® (Truphatek International Ltd, Netanya, Israel) is a recently
      introduced, easy viewing type of laryngoscope, modified from the blades of Macintosh type
      laryngoscopes, having an angle of 46° at the end of blade and including a camera system that
      magnifies the image.

      The Airtraq® laryngoscope (ATQ; King Medical Systems, Newark, DE) is also a newly developed
      type of laryngoscope, including optical imaging system. There is a channel on the device for
      the placement of the endotracheal tube. Endotracheal tube is inserted into the channel before
      the laryngoscopy. It has been reported that Airtraq is a novel single use laryngoscope which
      provides glottis display without any deviation in the normal position of the oral, pharyngeal
      or the tracheal axes.

      In the literature, there are many studies comparing the effects of these newly developed
      laryngoscopes on cervical motions in different scenarios with cadavers and normal patients.
      However, in these studies, individual vertebral motion was reported during the placement of
      the tube, while the angulation of the head and neck and the difficulty of the intubations
      were not clear.

      In this study our first hypothesis was cervical motion during endotracheal intubation in
      Truview EVO2® and Airtraq® types of laryngoscopes is lesser than Macintosh. The second one
      was the endotracheal intubation time is similar to the Macintosh that is used more often.

    <description>While the ventilation with face mask, different manupulations could be performed to the head. Therefore, neutral position was applied to the head before the laryngsocpy. In this procedure, the head was stabilized as the infraorbital edge and tragus is perpendicular to the ground. An inclinometer (A 360 degree angle gauge) was placed on the forehead of the patients, so that the tip of the inclinometer fits to glabellar line (figure 2,3). Inner diameter of the intubation tubes used for females and males were 7 to 7.5 mm and 8 to 8.5 mm, respectively. The maximum angulation were measured by an inclinometer and recorded from beginning of the laryngoscopy to the placement of the intubation tube into the trachea.</description>
