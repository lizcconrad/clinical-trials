      Industrial centrally produced 3- or 4-unit bridges of shaded yttrium-oxide
      partially-stabilized (Y-TZP) zirconia (NobelProceraTM Shaded Zirconia) in combination with a
      veneering ceramic material will show sufficient CDA ratings and a sufficient survival rate
      after 5 years

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be at least 18 (or age of consent), and less than 70 at the time of
             inclusion.

          -  The subject is healthy and compliant with good oral hygiene

          -  The subject is in need of a posterior fixed partial denture restoration 3 or 4 units
             distal of the canines in the maxilla or mandible.

          -  The subject shall have a stable occlusal relationship with a fully restored, fixed
             opposing dentition.

          -  Obtained informed consent from the subject prior to the study.

          -  No apical disorder or inflammation of abutment teeth, adjacent and opposing teeth.

          -  Good gingival / periodontal / periapical status of restoring, opposing and adjacent
             teeth. Healed situation of soft tissue augmentation is allowed.

          -  The subject should be available for the 5-year term of the investigation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is not able to give her/his informed consent to participate.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse as noted in patient records or in patient history.

          -  Reason to believe that the treatment might have a negative effect on the patient's
             total situation (psychiatric problems), as noted in patient records or in patient
             history.

          -  An existing condition where acceptable retention of the restoration is impossible to
             attain

          -  Mobility greater than grade 1 of the tooth to be restored.

          -  Pathologic pocket formation of 4 mm or greater around the tooth to be restored

          -  Severe bruxism or other destructive habits

          -  Amount of attached soft tissue is insufficient (attached gingiva less than 2 mm or
             attachment loss greater than half of the root length).

          -  Health conditions, which do not permit the restorative procedure
