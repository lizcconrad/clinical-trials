      The purpose of this study is to learn about patient, caregiver and healthcare worker
      perspectives on educating patients with newly-diagnosed Nephrotic Syndrome. All patients
      enrolled in the Contact Registry with Nephrotic Syndrome will be invited via email to
      participate in this study.

      The survey included questions addressing the following areas: 1.) Information that is
      important to know when learning to manage Nephrotic Syndrome. 2.) Preferred resources for the
      education of patients and caregivers with newly-diagnosed Nephrotic Syndrome. 3.) The time
      frame required to acquire confidence in the management of Nephrotic Syndrome. 4.)
      Disease-specific information such as diagnosis, length of disease duration, medications used,
      need for kidney biopsy, dialysis and/or transplant. 5.) Demographic data such as
      race/ethnicity and educational background.

      The survey data is stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network's Data Management
      and Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. The data is de-identified.
      Names or other personal health information were not collected. Upon conclusion of the study
      period, the data will be sent to the NEPTUNE consortium lead at the University of Michigan.

        Patients and caregivers were recruited from the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE)
        Patient Contact Registry. Over 1000 patients and caregivers are members of the registry and
        have already provided permission to be contacted for future research studies. The Contact
        Registry was created to inform patients and/or parents of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome
        of clinical research studies.

        Health professionals, including pediatric and internal medicine nephrologists and
        nephrology nurses will be recruited from the 18 NEPTUNE study network sites.
