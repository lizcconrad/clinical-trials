  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      california tri-pull taping (CTPT) method might be effective in reducing shoulder subluxation,
      pain, and improving active flexion range (AFLXN) range of motion, and functional recovery
      after stroke.

    <textblock>
      All the experimental group participants will receive conventional neuro rehabilitation for 45
      minutes along with California tri-pull taping on the subluxed extremity. Lead researcher
      applied the CTPT method. The tape was applied as following manner.

      Before the first intervention day, participants with hair on their shoulder or upper arm were
      asked to shave the area. Two types of tape was used, a self-adhesive 1.5ʺ cotton undercover
      tape and a 1ʺ rigid strapping tape. Participants placed their affected arm on a supporting
      surface to better approximate the humeral head back into the glenoid fossa. The three pieces
      of rigid tape were applied to the patient's shoulder on top of the already applied
      self-adhesive cotton tape. The first piece (medial) was applied from 1.5ʺ below the deltoid
      tuberosity running straight up the middle of the arm to 2ʺ above the top of the glenoid fossa
      between the clavicle and the spine of the scapula. The second piece (posterior) was located
      from 1.5ʺ below the deltoid tuberosity to 1.5ʺ above the middle of the spine of the scapula.
      The medial border of this second piece ran along the acromial process. Last, the third piece
      (anterior) was located from 1.5ʺ below the deltoid tuberosity to run around the front of the
      humeral head and over the coracoid process, up to 1.5ʺ above the clavicle. The tape will
      removed and new tape applied every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and remained on the patient
      for 6 consecutive weeks.

      Following the 6 weeks, each patients of both group was individually re-assessed and evaluated
      the effect of intervention and parameters were recorded. The recording and measurement
      obtained before and after intervention was subjected to statistical analysis and the result
      of that interpreted to obtain the significance of study.

The conventional neuro rehabilitation treatment includes, active, and passive range of motion exercise, bilateral activation of pectoralis major, activation of latissimus dorsa, activation of the retractors, weight bearing exercise of upper extremity, activation of supraspinatus, reaching activities, grasping, holding and release, and activity of daily living (ADL) activities. Every participant was received conventional neuro rehabilitation for 45 minutes and 5 days a week.</description>
