      Background:

      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to investigate brain function. Researchers want to
      use MRI to better understand the function patterns and connections between brain regions in
      healthy people. This might help people with brain diseases in the future.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate MRI methods performed twice on the same day.

        -  To evaluate brain function using positron emission tomography (PET).

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years old.

      Design:

        -  Visit 1:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and interview about
           drug and alcohol use and psychiatric history.

        -  They will give blood and urine samples. Their breath will be tested for alcohol and
           smoking.

        -  Visit 2:

        -  Participants will have urine collected. They will have MRI scans, some while resting,
           some while doing tasks on a computer.

        -  The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on
           a table that slides in and out of the cylinder, with a coil over their head.
           Participants will get earplugs for loud noises.

        -  Visit 3:

        -  Participants will have urine collected.

        -  A needle will guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into each arm. The needle will be
           removed, leaving the catheter in the vein.

        -  Participants will then have a PET scan. They will get the chemical 18FDG in the
           catheter. They will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the PET scanner, with a cap
           on their head.

        -  Participants may have tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking. They may
           complete interviews, questionnaires, tests on paper or computer, and simple actions.

        -  Participants will wear a device for 1 week between visits to measure activity and sleep.

      Objectives: The overarching goal of this study is to quantify the reproducibility of multiple
      measures of brain functional connectivity (FC) during resting conditions and during task
      performance. Secondary objectives are to assess the dynamic properties and energy
      requirements of the human brain connectome as well as the effects of physiologic noise,
      gender and aging on measures of brain functional connectivity at rest and during task
      performance.

      Study population: 60 healthy males and 60 healthy females 18 years or older will be included.

      Design: Participants will undergo two MRI/MRS sessions to evaluate test-retest reliability of
      FC at rest as well as during task performance, and one 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET
      session to assess the association between FC and glucose metabolism in the human brain.

      Outcome parameters: The variability of the gender and aging effects on FC measures (lFCD, L,
      C, and S) collected in RS and TS conditions , which will be quantified using volxelwise ICC.
      The variability of brain metabolite concentrations in precuneus.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All Participants:

          1. Older than 18 years of age.

          2. Ability to provide written informed consent as determined by physical examination and
             verbal communication. Capacity to consent will be determined by those obtaining the
             informed consent

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Pregnant or breast feeding. Females of childbearing potential must have negative urine
             pregnancy test and not be currently breastfeeding. Post-menopausal or surgically
             sterile (tubal ligation or hysterectomy) females satisfy these criteria.

          2. Use, in the past two weeks, of psychoactive medications (four weeks for fluoxetine) or
             medication that can affect brain function (including but not limited to meperidine,
             tricyclic antidpressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or
             serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as determined by history and
             clinical exam.

          3. Current or past DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder as determined by
             history and clinical exam including substance use disorder (except for
             nicotine/caffeine), alcoholism and alcohol dependence. Those with a binge drinking
             history in the last 10 years will also be excluded. Past history of a mental disorder
             as defined by DSM-IV or DSM-5 will be excluded only if it required hospitalization
             (any length), or chronic medication management (more than 4 weeks), and that could
             impact brain function at the time of the study. Binge drinkers are those who being
             female consume 4 or more drinks and males 5 or more drinks in one occasion at least
             once a month.

          4. Major medical problems that can impact brain function at the time of the scan
             (including but not limited to HIV; central nervous system including seizures and
             psychosis; cardiovascular including hypertension and arrhythmias; metabolic,
             autoimmune, endocrine) as determined by history and clinical exam.

          5. Any clinically significant laboratory finding as determined during the screening
             procedures.

          6. Have had previous radiation exposure (from X-rays, PET scans, or other exposure) that,
             with the exposure from this study, would exceed NIH annual research limits.

          7. Head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes.

          8. Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI/MRS of
             the head (pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some
             types of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner,
             implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments), fear of enclosed spaces, or other
             standard contraindication to MRI/MRS (self-report checklist).

          9. Cannot lie comfortably flat on back for up to 2 hours in the PET and MRI/MRS scanners.

         10. Body weight &gt; 250 kg. This is the upper limit that the bed of the MR scanner can
             accommodate.

         11. NIH employees who are study investigators, as well as their superiors, subordinates
             and immediate family members (adult children, spouses, parents, siblings).

               -  Subjects will not be excluded from enrollment onto this study if their urine test
                  is positive for drugs. However, if they test positive on scheduled study
                  procedure days involving study imaging (MRI/MRS and PET) and Neuropsychological
                  testing, the procedures will be postponed and rescheduled. We will allow for up
                  to 3 rescheduled study days that were the result of positive urine drug screens.
                  If the drug test is positive on the third rescheduled visit, the participant will
                  be withdrawn from the study.
