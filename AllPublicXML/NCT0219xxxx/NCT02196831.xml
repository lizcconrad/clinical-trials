  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver disease is one of the leading co-morbidities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      infection, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present in approximately 30-40% of
      patients with HIV infection. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe form of
      NAFLD in which increased liver fat is also accompanied by inflammation, cellular damage, and
      fibrosis.

      NAFLD is most prevalent in patients who also have increased visceral adiposity, and our group
      has previously shown that HIV-infected individuals with increased visceral adiposity
      generally have decreased growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is a growth hormone releasing
      hormone (GHRH) analogue that increases endogenous growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is
      FDA-approved for the reduction of visceral fat in HIV-infected individuals. In a previous
      study, treatment with tesamorelin in HIV-infected individuals selected for abdominal
      adiposity reduced liver fat. The current study is designed to test the effect of tesamorelin
      on liver fat and steatohepatitis in HIV-infected individuals who have NAFLD. The
      investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin will reduce liver fat and will also ameliorate the
      inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular damage seen in conjunction with NASH.
