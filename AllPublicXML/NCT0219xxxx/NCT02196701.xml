    <time_frame>Weeks 8, 16, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the evaluation. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0 (Cleared): No evidence of scaling, erythema, or plaque elevation;
1 (Minimal): Occasional fine scale over &lt;5% of lesions, faint erythema, minimal plaque elevation;
2 (Mild): Fine scale dominates, light red coloration, mild plaque elevation;
3 (Moderate): Course scale dominates, moderate red coloration, moderate plaque elevation;
4 (Marked): Thick non-tenacious scale dominates, bright red coloration, marked plaque elevation;
5 (Severe): Very thick tenacious scale predominates, dusky to deep red coloration, severe plaque elevation.
The percentage of participants achieving a score of clear (0) or minimal (1) is reported.</description>

    <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This single-arm, open-label longitudinal study was conducted at 12 sites in Canada from 5 August 2014 to 17 March 2017. The study entailed a screening period up to 35 days, a 24-week treatment period, and a 70-day safety follow-up period. Participants continued to receive adalimumab (ADA) and had oral methotrexate (MTX) added to their treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study enrolled participants who in the opinion of the Investigator were not responding optimally to adalimumab monotherapy at least 16 weeks after initiating treatment (primary sub-optimal responders) or who after an initial positive response to ADA monotherapy failed to maintain an optimal level of response (secondary sub-optimal responders).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The PASI score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). A PASI 50 response is defined as at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score.</description>

        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The PASI score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). A PASI 75 response is defined as at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score.</description>

        <description>The PGA is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the evaluation. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0 (Cleared): No evidence of scaling, erythema, or plaque elevation;
1 (Minimal): Occasional fine scale over &lt;5% of lesions, faint erythema, minimal plaque elevation;
2 (Mild): Fine scale dominates, light red coloration, mild plaque elevation;
3 (Moderate): Course scale dominates, moderate red coloration, moderate plaque elevation;
4 (Marked): Thick non-tenacious scale dominates, bright red coloration, marked plaque elevation;
5 (Severe): Very thick tenacious scale predominates, dusky to deep red coloration, severe plaque elevation.
The percentage of participants achieving a score of clear (0) or minimal (1) is reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score Over Time</title>
        <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score Over Time</title>
        <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
