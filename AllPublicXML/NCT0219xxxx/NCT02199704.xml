        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Parents/caregivers (mothers or fathers) with a Schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis who
             are:

             2. Aged 18 years or more

             3. Have at least one child aged 3-10 years old

             4. Have a least 10 hours contact time per week with the child.

             5. Identify difficulties in parenting during assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Parents/caregivers and family members who do not have good working knowledge of
             English. They should have enough practical experience to be able to adequately use the
             English language to understand and respond to questions, to read and complete
             questionnaires

             2. Families who do not have at least one adult who has basic literacy skills

             3. Families where there is known intention for their children to be taken into care or
             where the parent(s) have no regular contact with the index child

             4. Parents with a clinical schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis who have recently been
             discharged from acute in-patient care for their condition and have less than four
             weeks of stabilisation of psychotic experiences (operationally defined as no
             significant change to management or severity of symptoms in a four-week period since
             discharge as assessed from case notes). This is because if a potential parent with
             schizophrenia had recently required an inpatient stay, it is important to give them
             sufficient time to readjust to living in the community and ensure sufficient time is
             provided for symptom stabilisation before taking part

             5. Families seeking support from services regarding child management issues

             6. Families actively involved in another current cognitive behavioural therapy based
             intervention
