    <textblock>
      People with kidney failure have a higher chance of getting disease in the blood vessels and
      this result in a decreased elasticity of the arteries of their body which make them very
      stiff or hard. It appears that stiffer arteries with a decreased elasticity increase the risk
      of stroke and heart disease. A novel way to know the stiffness of blood vessels is by a
      method called &quot;applanation tonometry&quot;, which measures the &quot;pulse wave velocity&quot; of major
      blood vessels such as the aorta, carotid and femoral arteries. The purpose of our study is to
      determine if we can measure arterial stiffness reliably and accurately using this method in
      healthy people and in people with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis treatments at our
      centre. Also, we would like to know how stiff these arteries in healthy people are. If we
      demonstrate that the method is reliable and accurate in these 2 groups of participants at our
      centre, a future larger study is planned to determine if we can use measures of arterial
      stiffness to evaluate the risk of stroke and heart disease in people with kidney failure
      receiving hemodialysis. The research study will take place at the Ottawa Hospital-Riverside
      Campus.

      Background:

      Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Arterial stiffness measured by pulse-wave velocity (PWV) has
      been identified as an independent predictor of fatal CV events in these patients. Our
      long-term goal is to study the impact of interventions that decrease progressive arterial
      stiffness on CV mortality in ESRD patients. Thus, we postulate that measurements of PWV
      during these interventions will predict CV outcome. Before studying this relationship,
      establishing the feasibility of PWV measurements at our centre is necessary.

      Objectives:

      i) To demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of arterial PWV measurements in healthy
      subjects and patients with ESRD at our centre, ii) To assess subject satisfaction and level
      of discomfort associated with the testing procedure, iii) To characterize normative values
      for the PWV in our two subject groups, and iv) To determine the feasibility of recruitment of
      patients with ESRD, as a pre-requisite for a larger trial focused on CV outcomes.

      Methods:

      PWV will be measured consecutively by 2 research assistants in: a) a group of 20 healthy
      subjects; and b) a group of 20 patients with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis at The Ottawa
      Hospital. Two consecutive sets of PWV measurements with a time-interval of 1 week (± 2 days)
      will be obtained in the healthy and ESRD groups (pre-hemodialysis, between 2 consecutive
      mid-week hemodialysis sessions). To determine the impact of hemodialysis on PWV measures, in
      a sub-group of 10 ESRD subjects measurements will be taken before and after hemodialysis. The
      order of testing by the 2 assistants will be randomized.

    <description>A group of 20 healthy staff volunteers identified from the Division of Nephrology, Dept. of Medicine and the Kidney Research Centre at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute will be invited to participate. Measurements of arterial stiffness will be performed by Applanation tonometry. Healthy status will be defined by a self-reporting questionnaire obtained over the phone prior to enrolment and 2 subsequent non-invasive measurements of arterial blood pressure (BP) prior to testing. Subjects will be included if diastolic BP is ≤ 90 mm Hg and systolic BP ≤ 140 mm Hg on 2 consecutive measurements.</description>
