      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of interferon alfa 2b and
      topical mitomycin C in patients with diagnosis of conjunctival-corneal intraepithelial
      neoplasia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The corneal and conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia is the most common malignant tumor of
      the ocular surface. Classic treatment is complete excision with safety margins, however,
      usually the edges are not sharp and difficult clinical differentiation between healthy areas
      that are not; to this treatment has joined him carrying out cryotherapy bedding and borders .
      Despite this treatment the recurrence rate ranges from 9-52 %. Antineoplastic drugs have been
      used either as adjuvant or primary treatment . Among the drugs used the investigators have
      mitomycin C (MMC) and interferon alpha 2b (INFα 2b).

      Controlled clinical trial , single-blind , randomized . Non-probability sampling of
      consecutive cases. Patients will be assigned to treatment with MMC or INFα2b Periodic
      clinical evaluations and photos will be made. Time of resolution, resistance and adverse
      effects will be determined.

      Patients treated with mitomycin will be handled by cycles until resolution of the lesion,
      which according to previous studies is expected between 3 and 6 cycles (between half months
      and 3 months).

      Patients managed with interferon will be treated for a period ranging from one month to 12
      months according to clinical resolution of the lesion. Both groups will be evaluated by at
      least one year after the resolution of the lesion to determine the presence of recurrences.
