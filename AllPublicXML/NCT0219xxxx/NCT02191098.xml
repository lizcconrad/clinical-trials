      To assess the safety and tolerability of ALT-803, as well as, the potential efficacy of
      ALT-803 in HIV
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm intra-patient dose escalating pilot study of ALT-803, a
      recombinant human super agonist interleukin-15 (IL-15) complex with an expansion cohort at
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The primary aim is to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of ALT-803 in HIV-infected people receiving potent and optimized antiretroviral
      therapy. All infusions will occur on a Monday. Subjects will be monitored for 24 hours after
      the first infusion and then for 6 hours after each subsequent infusion, provided no
      unacceptable toxicity.
