    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the therapeutic equivalence of Mylan's estradiol
      vaginal cream to Estrace® cream and superiority of both products to placebo. The protocol
      describes a randomized, double-blind, multi-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel study of a 7
      day treatment.

          <population>The Intent-to-treat (ITT) population was used for the comparison of active treatments versus placebo analysis which consisted of all randomized subjects that used at least one dose of Test, Reference or Placebo and returned for at least one post-baseline visit.</population>
