  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-part study will assess the safety and tolerability of single ascending oral doses of
      RO6806127 in a group of healthy male participants and investigate the effect of high fat and
      high caloric food on the relative bioavailability of a single oral dose of RO6806127 in a
      separate group of healthy male participants. The relationship between drug exposure and
      tolerability will be explored.
