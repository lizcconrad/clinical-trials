      The primary objective of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of
      mesalamine-sodium hyaluronate 200 mg-28.75 mg delayed-release capsule (IBD98-M, Test) versus
      Delzicol 400 mg delayed-release capsule (mesalamine Reference), administered as a single oral
      dose of 2 x 200 mg-28.75 mg delayed-release capsule (total dose of 400 mg-57.50 mg) or 1 x
      400 mg delayed-release capsule under fasting conditions.

      Safety population The safety population is defined as all subjects who received at least one
      dose of the study medication.

      Pharmacokinetic Population The pharmacokinetic population will include all subjects
      completing at least 2 periods and for whom the pharmacokinetic profile can be adequately
      characterised.

      Any subject with pre-dose concentrations for mesalamine will be excluded from the
      pharmacokinetic population for this analyte if the pre-dose concentration is greater than 5%
      of the Cmax value of that period for this subject.

      Data from subjects who experienced emesis during the sampling interval and who were not
      withdrawn as per criterion established under section 9.10 may be evaluated after completion
      of the pharmacokinetic analysis. Any subject who experienced emesis within 2 times median
      Tmax of the current study (based on the Reference product) will be excluded from the
      statistical analysis. Data (concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters) from subjects
      excluded due to a pre dose concentration greater than 5% of their Cmax or from subjects
      withdrawn due to adverse events or vomiting episodes will be presented but excluded from
      descriptive statistics.
