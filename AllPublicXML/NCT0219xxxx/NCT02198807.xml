    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to explore the role of fosmidomycin and piperaquine as
      non-artemisinin-based combination therapy for acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum when
      administered over three days.

      Together, fosmidomycin and piperaquine fulfil the WHO criteria for combination therapy by
      meeting the three key parameters of having different modes of action and different
      biochemical targets while exhibiting independent blood schizonticidal activity. Like the
      artemisinins, fosmidomycin is fast-acting, has an excellent safety record and is active
      against existing drug-resistant parasites. Piperaquine has a long half life protecting
      fosmidomycin as a much shorter lived molecule against selection of resistant parasites and
      will provide post-treatment prophylaxis.
