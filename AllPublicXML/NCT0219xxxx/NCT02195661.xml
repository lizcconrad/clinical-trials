    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the safety and effectiveness of oral melatonin as natural
      inducer of sleep to acquire useful EEGs in South African children following its introduction
      as the main agent used in the Neurophysiology department at Red Cross Children's Hospital.
      This is an observational retrospective study.

    <description>All children who were referred to the neurophysiology department who were either unable to keep still for their EEG, or required a sleep EEG as part of their epilepsy &quot;work-up&quot; and whose caregivers agreed to the administering of sedation with melatonin. Melatonin by mouth (3mg for children &lt; 15kg, 6mg for those &gt; 15kg) 1 hour before the scheduled EEG by the unit nurse. Children who can swallow the capsules directly, those who cannot are given the contents of the powder in the capsule mixed in a few millilitres of water. If the child fails to fall asleep within one hour of administration of the melatonin then a second dose 3mg is given) .</description>

    <description>Since the choral hydrate had been withdrawn a direct comparison group was not possible. However a study performed the previous year in the department measured a several parallel useful outcomes. This study had addressed the usefulness of electroencephalograms in a South African population. A proportion of this group screened in 2012 in our unit underwent sleep studies, sedated with chloral (n=22). These patients were drawn from the same regional pool, with the same disease demographics, and the same sleep deprivation and procedural techniques to the current group. This group was screened for several common denominators to the current study themes, and comparison will be made between these, namely the proportion of patients with successful attainment of sleep studies, the proportion of studies with excessive artifact (precluding interpretation) and the usefulness of the data attained detailing whether the studies were able to assist or alter patient management.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All children who were referred to the neurophysiology department who were either
             unable to keep still for their EEG, or required a sleep EEG as part of their epilepsy
             &quot;work-up&quot; and whose caregivers agreed to the administering of sedation with melatonin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those children undergoing prolonged EEG monitoring (telemetry) or within 24 hours of
             status epilepticus (prolonged or cluster of seizures).

          -  Those children are not sedated as natural sleep is always attained with the prolonged
             monitoring studies, and for those with status epilepticus, there is usually evidence
             on the EEG of alteration secondary to the effects of status, and the medications
             administered to control the presenting event.

          -  Any child deemed to unwell to undergo a non-emergency procedure.

          -  Any child already receiving anticoagulant medications.

          -  Any caregiver who deferred sedation for their child was also excluded from the study
             and in the unit the procedure attempted without sedation.
