      This study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II study designed to
      evaluate safety and efficacy of KP-100IT, code of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) formulation
      for intrathecal injection, as a treatment for acute spinal cord injury. The study is
      conducted at two clinical sites in Japan.
