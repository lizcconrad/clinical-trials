  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile at steady state of two
      different nevirapine (NVP) extended release (XR) formulations at 300 mg or 400 mg daily (QD)
      under fasted and fed conditions in comparison with the commercially available NVP immediate
      release (IR) tablet at 200 mg BID (400 mg/day).

             200mg tablets once daily (prescribed off label), the subject is allowed to participate
             if he/she agrees to switch to Viramune® 200mg twice daily, 14 days before the start of
             Nevirapine Extended Release.
