  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of heated carboplatin given into
      the abdomen at the time of surgery in treating patients with stage II-IV ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or peritoneal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Heating oxaliplatin and infusing it
      directly into the area around the tumor during surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carboplatin given as HIPEC for primary
      treatment of women with advanced ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the dose limiting toxicities of HIPEC carboplatin.

        2. To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of HIPEC carboplatin.

        3. To quantify changes in tissue temperature during HIPEC and compare to conventional
           temperature measures (esophageal and bladder).

        4. To describe the extent of thermal damage and DNA platinum adduct formation in tissues
           resulting from HIPEC carboplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive hyperthermic carboplatin intraperitoneally over 60 minutes during the
      planned surgical cytoreductive procedure.

          -  Patients who are receiving other investigational therapeutic agents

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
