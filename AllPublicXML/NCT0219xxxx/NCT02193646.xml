  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are retrospectively comparing detection rates of adenomatous polyps,
      advanced adenomas, and size assessment of the polyps among Rush University Medical Center
      endoscopists. The investigators plan to review whether the size assessment of adenomatous
      polyps affected the surveillance protocols and if the location of polyps detected affected
      the detection rates.
