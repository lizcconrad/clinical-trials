      Objectives: This parallel RCT investigated the effect of a new nursing intervention (Mobility
      Enhancing Nursing Intervention - MFP) designed to improve the rehabilitation programs'
      outcomes and patients' quality of life.

      Intervention: The IG combined standard care with the 30-day mobility-enhancing-nursing
      intervention (MFP). MFP placed patients on a mattress on the floor and used constant
      tactile-kinaesthetic stimulation in everyday tasks to increase spatial orientation, to teach
      patients to get up safely and to move independently.

      Primary and secondary outcome measures: Outcomes were defined as functionality (Extended
      Barthel Index, EBI), quality of life (WHOQoL), and fall-related self-efficacy (FES-I).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Switzerland 100`000 people live with the consequences of neurological events and
      illnesses. Most events are caused by cerebral vascular events, accidents, tumors and
      illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

      Despite the fact that symptoms and disabilities vary based on underlying causes and
      individual manifestations, common in all those patients is a significant impairment in
      sensory function, orientation, and mobility that present a great challenge for the affected
      persons, their families and the health care providers.

      Over the years nurses in addition to other health care providers in the rehabilitation Center
      Valens, SG, have developed and refined interventions to specifically enhance patients'
      safety, body perception, kinesthetic competence, mobility and functionality, and to reduce
      burdens of care. The approach that has shown great promise is the mobility enhancing nursing
      intervention referred to as &quot;Mobilitätsfördernde Pflegeintervention (MfP)&quot;.

      In a first retrospective descriptive study Suter-Riederer et al (2008)) showed a significant
      improvement in functional status of daily activities in agitated patients due to MfP.

      Method A randomized-control trial will be conducted utilizing a mixed-method design in the
      Neurological Clinic at the Rehabilitation Center Valens and 165 patient with stroke, MS and
      brain injuries will be enrolled.Demographic, medical, and functional data as well as quality
      of life measure will be obtained. Patients' experiences and perspectives will be explored
      with narrative interviews.

      Descriptive and inferential statistics, with p value set to .05, will be deployed to analyze
      quantitative data. Constant comparative analysis will be used for qualitative data.

      Expected results We hypothesize that the group with MfP has better score increase on the
      Extended Barthel Index, has less fear of falling on the Fall Efficacy Scale after 30 days and
      higher quality of life than the usual care group after 30 days and one months after
      discharge. Additionally we hypothesize that the MfP group has less falls and longer time to
      first fall than the usual care group. Secondary outcomes will be enhanced movement patterns
      and kinaesthetic competence in the intervention group compared with the control.

    <description>The Extended Barthel Index (EBI) is a validated and common instrument in rehabilitation settings to measure functionality. The EBI includes 16 items that are rated on a 4 and 5-point Likert scale (not possible, with support of a person, with low support, with facilities, independent). A score of 64 points indicates maximum independence.</description>

    <time_frame>Data were collected before randomisation (T0), after 15 days (T1) and at discharge (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life, was measured using the German version of the WHOQoL-Bref. The instrument includes 26 items that are rated on five 5-point Likert scale (very poor to very good, very dissatisfied to very satisfied, not at all to an extreme amount, not at all to extremely, never to always). The WHOQoL-Bref yields a score for general quality of life in each of four domains - physical, psychological, social, and environmental -with a score of 100 indicating maximum quality of life. Internal consistency for the subscales ranges between an alpha of 0•70 and 0•86.</description>

    <time_frame>Data were collected before randomisation (T0), after 15 days (T1) and at discharge (T2).</time_frame>
    <description>To measure fall-related self efficacy and fear of falls, the seven-item short version of the Fall Efficacy Scale (FES-I) was used. The FES-I is a well established instrument with a 4-point Likert scale. Scores range from 7 to 28. A higher score is synonymous with more fear of falls and less self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will receive usual care, which is based on the principles of rehabilitation nursing. Based on patients functional ability (EBI data) the nursing process is used to determine objectives and interventions. The main focus is on providing a therapeutic environment and supporting and advancing abilities to perform the Activities of Daily Living, support mobility and kinesthetic perception.</description>

    <description>Patients' mattresses are placed on the floor, which enables the patients to explore their environment safely without the risk of falling. Additionally, the patients' environment is arranged in accordance with a nursing assessment pertaining to the patients' impairment and abilities, their goals in terms of improved mobility, and the mobility they would require in order to live at home as independently as possible. Initially, most patients favour a specific side to get up. The goal of the intervention is to teach the patients to get up step by step and to move independently over both sides.</description>
