      LUXSOL Topical Cream is a copper containing topical cream indicated for the treatment of
      bacterial vaginosis (BV). The study is an open-label, randomized, controlled study comparing
      LUXSOL Cream to Metrogel in patients with a diagnosis of BV. The investigational product or
      the comparator product will be self-administered by the patient for 10 consecutive nights. A
      successful patient outcome is cured BV at 30 days.
