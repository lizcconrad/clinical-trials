    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men and the second leading cause of
      cancer death in men. Currently, MRI is the best imaging modality for both detecting prostate
      cancer and determining the presence of extra-prostatic extension. Multiparametric Magnetic
      Resonance, combining T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging
      (DCE-MRI) is recommended as the minimum acceptable standard for prostate MRI examination.
      However, MPMRI still lacks diagnostic accuracy in the transition zone, where distinguishing
      cancer from proliferative nodules has proven difficult. DCE-MRI techniques evaluate the time
      course of signal intensities after administration of a contrast medium and have been used to
      successfully differentiate benign from malignant tumours, particularly in breast and prostate
      cancer. Unfortunately, current DCE approaches have high false-positive rates and are limited
      in distinguishing prostatitis and vascularized BPH nodules from cancer in active surveillance
      studies. Future studies that employ spectroscopic MR imaging of the prostate after
      administration of Hyperpolarized (13C) Pyruvate Injection, are expected to provide a robust,
      non-invasive method to assist in detecting and characterizing prostate cancer. The objective
      of this study is to determine the functionality of an eight-channel paddle coil system which
      is to be used in future Hyperpolarized (13C) Pyruvate Injection studies.
