  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though the utility of NVM5 neuromonitoring by stimulating within the surgical site during
      XLIF has been demonstrated, it is hypothesized that more information may be gathered if a
      greater section of the motor neural pathway was monitored (i.e., stimulation above the
      surgical site and recording the subsequent muscle response in the lower limbs). Currently,
      there has not been demonstrated a practical method of stimulating the lumbosacral nerve roots
      locally, but well-above the surgical site in this fashion.

      This protocol is intended to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of using surface
      stimulation and return (anode) electrodes to stimulate the lumbosacral nerve roots, and
      record responses from the relevant innervated muscle groups of the lower limbs.

        At least 20 subjects will be consecutively enrolled in this prospective pilot study from up
        to three (3) participating centers. Patients who, in the surgeon investigator's opinion,
        require lateral approach spinal fusion surgery at spinal level L4-5 (though may include any
        number of levels from L2 through L5), and have consented to XLIF surgery for their
        condition will be included. The following eligibility criteria are designed to identify
        existing clinic patients for whom study under this protocol is considered appropriate. All
        subjects must meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria below in order to be considered for
        enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female spine surgery patients who are at least 18 years of age

          2. Surgical candidates for lateral approach lumbar spine surgery at spinal levels L2 to
             L5, inclusive of L4-5

          3. Patients who understand the conditions of enrollment and are willing to sign an
             informed consent to participate in the evaluation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently undergoing surgical treatment at any spinal level other than L2 to L5,
             including S1

          2. Pregnant women

          3. Implanted pacemaker, defibrillator, or other electronic devices

          4. Involved in active litigation relating to the spine (worker's compensation claim is
             allowed if it is not contested)

          5. Underlying neurological disease or neurological deficit that is not associated with
             the condition for which he/she is seeking surgical intervention (e.g., diabetic
             peripheral neuropathy)
