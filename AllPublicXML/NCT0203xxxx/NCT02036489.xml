      Induction therapy is administered. Patients experiencing slow response (&gt; 10 % blasts in the
      15th mo of treatment) were included in the LAL -AR -03 protocol, on the arm of intensified
      induction. Those who do not reach the RC will be excluded from the study and will be treated
      according to the protocol LAL-AR/03 , which will be incorporated receiving blocks
      consolidation. All patients in CR consolidation treatment (1 and 2 ) followed reinducciones
      maintenance (maintenance -1 ) to complete the first year of treatment and maintenance without
      reinducciones (maintenance -2 ) to complete two years from the RC will be administered . If
      after union persistent high levels of ER ( &gt; 0.05 %) and this reappears later during
      maintenance therapy the patient will be excluded from the study and will be treated according
      to the protocol of high risk ( PETHEMA LAL-AR/03 ) . In case of persistent high levels of ER
      patients after consolidation will consolidate blocks PETHEMA LAL-AR/03 protocol followed by
      allogeneic HSCT . If the ER reappears during maintenance treatment the patient will receive
      an allogeneic HSCT , Standby thereof, may be administered one or two blocks consolidation of
      LAL -AR -03 protocol.

      To allow time to better characterize the LLA and thus ensure proper inclusion of patients in
      the study recommends administering a prephase with :

      - Prednisone ( PDN) 60 mg/m2 po or iv through characterization of LAL with a maximum of 7
      days.

      intrathecal chemotherapy

        -  Methotrexate (MTX ) : 12 mg

        -  ARA - C: 30 mg

        -  Hydrocortisone 20 mg

      The LAL meeting the inclusion criteria, the study may continue

        -  Patients without RC : excluded. Step PETHEMA LAL-AR/2003 protocol .

      Study of the ER at the end of induction. Molecular response was considered if the ER is &lt;
      0.01 %. Although a molecular response is not achieved , the patient will remain in the
      protocol if you have standard response at day 14 and is in CR at day 28 .

      Consolidation treatment -1 These cycles include known cytostatics LAL activity against at
      intermediate or high doses. This phase of treatment as possible to begin two weeks of the
      administration of the last dose of cytostatic induction phase . The patient should have a WBC
      count &gt; 3x109 / L (granulocytes &gt; 1.5 x 109 / L ) and platelets &gt; 100x109 / L.

      Treatment consolidation-2/reinduction It consists of a cycle similar to the induction
      chemotherapy . It will start if possible within one week of completion of the last dose of
      mercaptopurine in the previous cycle (thus, from the 18th week of the start of treatment) .

      Dexamethasone (DXM ) :

      or 10 mg/m2 per day, p.o or i.v 1-14 days to 5 mg/m2 night , p.o or i.v., day 15 to 21 VCR
      1.5 mg/m2 , i.v. , days 1, 8 and 15 DNR : 30 mg/m2 , i.v. , 1, 2 , 8 and 9 CFM and 600 mg/m2
      day , i.v. , days 1 and 15 L -ASA E. coli ( Kidrolase ® ) : 10,000 IU/m2 i.m. or i.v., on

      and 15 or Hydrocortisone 20 mg days 1 and 15

      Evaluation of ER at the end of the consolidation A cytofluorometric study fee is mo If the ER
      is &gt; 0.05 % (tested on two separate occasions 15 days ) the patient will go to high-risk
      protocol ( PETHEMA LAL-AR/2003 ) .

      If ER &lt; 0.05 % the patient continue the protocol.

      Maintenance treatment with 1 reinducciones It will consist of continuous administration of
      chemotherapy ( mercaptopurine and methotrexate ) with reinducciones up to a year from the
      start of treatment. It lasts therefore between approximately 22 and 52 weeks of treatment.

      Continuous Chemotherapy

        -  MP 50 mg/m2 per day, p.o

        -  MTX 20 mg/m2 per week , i.m. Reinducciones

           20 mg Day 1

      During the week of administration of each cycle of chemotherapy reinduction continuous
      suspended.

      Evaluation after the fourth reinduction . Immunophenotypic study of a new bone marrow will be
      made

        -  If ER is &lt; 0.01 % , subsequent reinducciones are suspended and continues only with
           continuous chemotherapy until week 52 , at which point it switches to maintenance -2.

        -  If ER between 0.05% and 0.01% , the reinducciones 5 was administered to 8

        -  If ER &gt; 0.05 % (tested on two separate occasions 15 days ) the patient will go to
           high-risk protocol ( PETHEMA LAL-AR/2003 ) .

      Treatment Support 2 It consisitirá in continuous administration of chemotherapy (
      mercaptopurine, and methotrexate ) to complete two years in continuous complete remission .

        -  MP 50 mg/m2 per day, p.o

        -  MTX 20 mg/m2 per week , i.m. Throughout the maintenance treatment should seek to retain
           WBC counts between 2.5 and 5x109 / L and platelet counts above 120x109 / L. If these
           lower limits should be reduced is decreased by 20 % doses of MP and MTX. If the numbers
           of leukocytes exceed 5x109 / L will increase by 20 % the dose of MP (50 to 60 mg/m2 )
