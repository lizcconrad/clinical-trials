  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcutaneous electrical stimulation
      applied to the abdominal wall muscles synchronous with voluntary exhalation can be used to
      reduce hyperinflation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

    <description>Patients breathing will be compared across a series of 9 trials in which unassisted breathing is compared to abdominal stimulation (SecondBreath) assisted breathing at various intensities. Each breathing trial will last for 2 minutes and will be conducted while the patient is seated. The following abdominal stimulation trials were included:
Abdominal Stimulation - low / early Abdominal stimulation - low/late Abdominal Stimulation - low/full Abdominal stimulation - med/early Abdominal stimulation - med/late Abdominal Stimulation - med/full Abdominal Stimulation - high/early Abdominal Stimulation - high/late Abdominal Stimulation - high/full</description>
