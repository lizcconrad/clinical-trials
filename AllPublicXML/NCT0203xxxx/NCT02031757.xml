  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait dysfunction often occurs following stroke, neurological or musculoskeletal disease,
      injury and surgery. One of the consequences of such deficit is an increased risk of fall and
      injury. A gait training regime that incorporates controlled perturbation has been found to
      reduce falls in elderly population but the effectiveness of such training has yet to be
      studied.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of specific controlled dynamic
      perturbation training, during gait, on gait rehabilitation, fear of falling and falling with
      gait impaired individuals. Perturbation will be performed using a specifically designed
      system that provides small, controlled and unpredictable perturbations during treadmill
      walking.

      A total of 100 adults with gait dysfunction will be enrolled, evaluated and trained. They
      will be randomly assigned to two groups: perturbation training group and balance exercises
      group. Both groups will receive standard physiotherapy treatments. No gender based
      differences are expected so we will be able to pool male and female individuals for this
      analysis. Each subject of the experimental and of the control groups will be trained on 12
      occasions over a period of 10-12 weeks (15 minutes, 2-3 times/week) in addition to standard
      care physiotherapy. Gait, balance function and fear of falling will be tested in both groups
      before, immediately after, 3 and 6 months after completion of the training period to explore
      the benefit of training.
