    <textblock>
      GALATIR is a double blind randomized clinical trial comparing efficacy and safety of BCD-021
      (bevacizumab) and Lucentis® (ranibizumab) in patients with neovascular wet age-related
      macular degeneration. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of
      efficacy and safety of BCD-021 compared to Lucentis®.
