    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 (Follow-up period)</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA less than the lower limit of quantitation ie. 25 IU/mL, target detected or target not detected at follow-up Week 12. Cirrhosis was considered a negative predictor of SVR in participants treated with an interferon formulation or ribavirin. Presence or absence of cirrhosis was determined at baseline and follow-up Week 12 in the participants to evaluate the post-treatment relapse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With CC or Non-CC Genotype at the IL28B rs12979860 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Who Achieved Sustained Virologic Response After 12 Weeks of Follow-up (SVR12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 (Follow-up period)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants categorized into 2 genotypes (CC and non-CC) based on SNPs in the IL28B gene were assessed for SVR12, defined as response in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels below lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) below target detected or target not detected at follow-up Week 12 (LLOQ: 25 IU/mL). HCV RNA levels were measured by the Roche COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test version 2.0 from the central laboratory.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 first dose to last dose plus 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE was defined as a medical event that at any dose resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; was life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or required or prolonged hospitalization.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Or Without Cirrhosis at Baseline Who Achieved Sustained Virologic Response at Follow-up Week 12 (SVR12)</title>
        <description>SVR12 was defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA less than the lower limit of quantitation ie. 25 IU/mL, target detected or target not detected at follow-up Week 12. Cirrhosis was considered a negative predictor of SVR in participants treated with an interferon formulation or ribavirin. Presence or absence of cirrhosis was determined at baseline and follow-up Week 12 in the participants to evaluate the post-treatment relapse.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 (Follow-up period)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed in all treated participants who received at least 1 dose of active study therapy. The 'n' signifies the number of evaluable participants with or without cirrhosis in the reporting arm and time point, respectively.</population>
