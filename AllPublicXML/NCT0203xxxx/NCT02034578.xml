    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioavailability of Apixaban solution administered
      through NGT and washed with Dextrose 5% in water (D5W) or infant formula relative to Apixaban
      solution administered orally in healthy subjects

          <description>After a 10 hour fast, participants were randomized to one of six treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB or CBA) administered over 3 periods. Fasted participants received a single dose of apixaban 5 mg on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3. Treatment A was administered via oral syringe, Treatment B was administered via an NGT followed by 60 mL of D5W via an NGT, and Treatment C was administered via an NGT, followed by 60 mL of infant formula via an NGT. There was at least a 4 day washout before receiving the next scheduled treatment in the next period.</description>

        <description>Participants were required to fast for at least 10 hours prior to the collection of specimens for clinical laboratory tests. Tests were performed at Screening, Day -1, and Day 4 of each period 1 - 3. Leukocyte criteria: Lower limits of normal (LLN), upper limits of normal (ULN), pre-treatment (preRX). Low Leukocytes: if value &lt; 0.9*LLN, or if preRX &lt; LLN then use &lt; 0.85* preRX. High lymphocytes: if value &gt; 7.500 10^3 cells/ µL. Low neutrophils plus bands: if value &lt;= 1.500 10^3 cells/µL. High creatine kinase: if value &gt; 1.5* ULN. Blood in urine: if value &gt;= 2 plus, or if preRX &gt;= 1 plus then use &gt;= 2*preRX.</description>
