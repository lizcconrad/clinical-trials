  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to understand if using birth control causes changes in the immune
      cells within the reproductive tract of healthy women. Immune cells are important because they
      help prevent infections from starting and help fight infections that have started. Immune
      cells are also the type of cells that HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infects so
      understanding more about them will help to better understand how to prevent the spread of
      HIV.

      Immune cells will be studied from the reproductive tract of women who want to start using one
      of the following contraceptives: Depo-Provera (DMPA), NET-EN, MPA/E2 (Cyclofem速), the
      levonorgestrel subdermal implant (Jadelle速 ), the etonogestrel subdermal implant (Implanon速
      or Nexplanon速 ) and the copper IUD.
