  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a common injury in combat, terrorist attacks and sports such
      as football and hockey. Unnecessary delays in the diagnosis and treatment of brain damage in
      patients who can benefit from evacuation procedures can lead to worse brain injury, worse
      outcome and, sometimes, unnecessary death. However, there is no reliable and sensitive method
      for diagnosis of TBI severity in the field. In this study we will examine the feasibility of
      using this a multifocal chromatic pupillometer for monitoring TBI, by examining the pupillary
      response to multifocal chromatic stimuli in intracranial pressure (ICP)-monitored severe TBI
      patients. As control, normal subjects will be tested for pupillary responses using this
      device.

      To examine the feasibility of using the multifocal chromatic pupillometer for monitoring TBI,
      the pupillary response to multifocal chromatic stimuli will be assessed in 20 healthy
      subjects and 20 ICP-monitored severe TBI patients.

      The portable pupillometer will be tested in 20 healthy volunteers. Their pupillary responses
      will be measured 3 times/day for 1 week.

      Pupillary response of 20 severe TBI patients will be evaluated as detailed below at the
      following time points:

        1. At admittance to ICU, prior to insertion of ICP and CT scan

        2. Prior to CT scans that are routinely performed at day 3 and 7 post injury

        3. Routinely at the beginning of every medical personnel shift for 7 days (3 times a day).

        4. With every change in ICP(more than 5 mmHg for more then 15 min) Data will be recorded
           and analyzed.
