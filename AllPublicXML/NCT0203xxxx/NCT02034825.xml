  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospectively designed retrospective clinical utility study will evaluate urologists'
      treatment recommendations before and after reviewing Decipher results for selected patient
      cases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical utility of Decipher will be evaluated at two time-points:

        1. Post RP - within 6 months after surgery

        2. PSA rise - defined as PSA detectable and rising on 2 or more subsequent determinations

      Patient cases will be retrospectively selected from at least 5 sites. Participating
      urologists at each site will be asked to each identify a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 50
      suitable cases retrospectively. The resulting cases will then be de-identified, aggregated
      and evenly randomly distributed among the participating urologists via a secure on-line
      survey platform . All study participants (ie: urologists) will be masked to the original
      actual treatment decision and patient outcome.

      The design of this study is such that any participating urologist may or may not review a
      patient originating from their own clinical practice, but will not review a case they
      themselves identified. Patient cases will be de-identified and randomized amongst
      participating urologists . By the retrospective nature of this study, cases may be several
      years post-RP. It is not expected that that participation in this study will have any impact
      on actual clinical management of patients.

      Participants will be asked to complete two web-based electronic Case Report Questionnaires
      (eCRQ):

        1. Pre-Decipher: will collect information on their recommended treatment decision and their
           decision confidence based on the de-identified clinical and pathological information
           provided for each patient case.

        2. Post-Decipher: will collect their treatment recommendation and decision confidence for
           each de-identified patient case in the presence of the Decipher test results.
