  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multicenter project, we will introduce AWARE (electronic interface) Using a
      cloud-based technology . The goal of this project is to improve compliance with best practice
      through the use of a new acute care interface with built-in tools for error prevention,
      practice surveillance and reporting (ProCCESs AWARE - Patient Centered Cloud-based Electronic
      System: Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation).The goal of this project is to develop and
      test a novel acute care interface with built-in tools for error prevention, practice
      surveillance, decision support and reporting (ProCCESs AWARE - Patient Centered Cloud-based
      Electronic System: Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation). In preliminary studies, these
      novel informatics supports built on an advanced understanding of cognitive and organizational
      ergonomics, have significantly decreased the cognitive load of bedside providers and reduced
      medical errors. Using a cloud-based technology, AWARE will be uniformly available on either
      mobile or fixed computing devices and applied in a standardized manner in medical and
      surgical ICUs of five geographically diverse acute care hospitals predominantly serving
      Medicare and Medicaid patients. The impact of ProCCESs AWARE on processes of care and
      outcomes in study ICUs; expected to enroll more than 10,000 critically ill patients during
      the study period.
