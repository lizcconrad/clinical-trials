      The investigators will leverage e-technologies to provide an online version of the Question
      Prompt LIst (QPL-CT), that patients access via available iPads, enabling both the real-time
      prioritizing of patient questions as well as the seamless delivery of these questions to
      their treating physician (and other members of their clinical team) via the VCU Health System
      (VCUHS) patient portal, and the electronic medical record (EMR) prior to a consultation to
      discuss a clinical trial

      The investigators propose to conduct pilot work to inform our knowledge of optimal methods of
      utilizing QPLs and will use the QPL-CT as an example. The investigators will leverage
      e-technologies to provide an online version of the QPL-CT, that patients access via available
      iPads, enabling both the real-time prioritizing of patient questions as well as the seamless
      delivery of these questions to their treating physician (and other members of their clinical
      team) via the VCU Health System (VCUHS) patient portal, and the EMR prior to a consultation
      to discuss a clinical trial. The investigators will use a pilot randomized clinical trial
      design to demonstrate the efficacy of the online QPL-CT versus a paper and pencil QPL-CT to
      increase question asking, patient understanding of trial information and reduce patients
      conflict over their upcoming decision to join a trial

    <description>Use online QPL-CT to prioritize their questions and the prioritized list will be conveyed to their oncologist. Investigators will evaluate the efficacy of the online QPL-CT to increase question asking, patient understanding of trial information and reduce patients conflict over their upcoming decision to join a trial.</description>

    <measure>Test the feasibility of using the online QPL-CT for patients and physicians</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete an exit interview at the completion of patient's consultation asking about the patient's impressions of the online QPL-CT including its ease of use and the patient's perceptions of its influence on consultation communication. Physicians will complete a brief interview on one occasion at the completion of patient recruitment asking about the impact of the prioritized QPL-CT on consultation communication.</description>
