  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been reports suggesting that anti-epidermal growth factor antibody nimotuzumab is
      advantageous for advanced esophageal cancer patients in combination with chemotherapy or
      radiotherapy.And,albumin-bound paclitaxel was characterized with high tolerated doses with
      greater efficacy,and with greater concentration in tumor tissue compared with normal
      tissues.So,The objective of this single-arm phase II trial was to evaluate the benefit of
      nimotuzumab plus nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      In the past decade, clinical trials have evaluated the role of chemotherapy, radiation, or
      both, for patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma, but have all failed to demonstrate a
      consistent survival benefit. In Eastern countries, Chemotherapy became one of the treatment
      strategies for advanced esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy of systemic
      chemotherapy, the investigators conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of
      Nimotuzumab plus Nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin for patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.
