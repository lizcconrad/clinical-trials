  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if a monoclonal antibody VAY736 can reduce disease
      activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as compared to placebo. The study
      will also provide the first safety and tolerability information for VAY736 in RRMS patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        18 Years to 55 Years Male and Female

          -  Diagnosis of MS as defined by the 2010 revised McDonald criteria (Polman, et. al2011).

               -  A relapsing-remitting course of disease with:

               -  at least 1 documented relapse during the previous 12 months (but not within 30
                  days prior to randomization), or

               -  a positive Gd-enhancing lesion on brain MRI scan at screening.

               -  An Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-5.0 inclusive at screening.

               -  No evidence of a relapse within 30 days prior to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ A manifestation of another type of MS other than RRMS.

               -  Findings on screening or baseline brain MRI inconsistent with the diagnosis of
                  MS.

               -  History of chronic disease of the immune system other than MS, or a known
                  immunodeficiency syndrome

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of
                  contraception during dosing and for 4 months following completion of the study.

               -  Unable to undergo MRI scans due to inter-alia, claustrophobia, incompatible
                  cardiac pacemakers, ferromagnetic intracranial aneurysm clips, certain cochlear
                  implants, and certain other ferromagnetic foreign bodies (e.g. tattoos containing
                  metal) or electronic devices, or metallic implants incompatible with MRI.

               -  Unable to receive gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents due to a history of
                  hypersensitivity to gadolinium-based contrast agents, renal insufficiency or
                  impairment.
