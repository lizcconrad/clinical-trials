  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Regenexx SD compared to
      Exercise Therapy at three months. Historical comparison will be made to Total Knee
      Arthroplasty for treatment of knee osteoarthritis at 1 and 2 years.

      The study is single center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial to include 50 subjects,
      25 treated with Regenexx SD and 25 treated with Exercise Therapy for treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis. Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to Regenexx-SD injection or
      initiation of Exercise Therapy and take part in follow-up visits for two years following
      treatment. A preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment; follow-up visits will
      occur at the clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post
      injection.

      Subjects in the control, exercise therapy arm, will have the opportunity to cross-over to the
      study treatment arm at or after the 3 month visit and then continue to be followed through 24
      months.

      Subjects will complete the study following the 2 year follow-up visit. They will be withdrawn
      from the study prematurely if a revision occurs.

      The study subjects will be compared to a historical total knee arthroplasty group. Data of
      the TKA group subjects will be reviewed retrospectively after it is retrieved from the
      clinical database. The TKA group will consist of patients who underwent TKA for knee
      osteoarthritis. The inclusion criteria of age and BMI will be applied to these subjects.
