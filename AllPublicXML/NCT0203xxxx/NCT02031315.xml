      Background The burden of sudden death (SD) in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. The aim is to
      assess the incidence, etiology and patient characteristics of SD in a sub-Saharan country.
      Methods The Douala-SD study is a prospective, multicenter, community-based registry
      monitoring all cases of SD occurring in index areas of Douala city. Investigators will use
      the definition of SD as natural death occurring within 24h at the onset of symptoms.
      Demographic, clinical, electrocardiographic and biological variables (when available) of
      victims will be recorded. All deaths occurring in residents of health areas of interest will
      be checked for past medical history, circumstances of death, and autopsy (if possible).
      Conclusion This maiden Douala-SD study will provide comprehensive, contemporary data on the
      epidemiology of SD in a sub-Saharan African country and will help in the development of
      strategies to prevent and manage SD in Africa.

      Two health areas were excluded for inaccurate data collection, and 2 other were randomly
      disqualified as investigators previously decided to conduct the survey in ≤ 4 areas. The mode
      of randomization aimed at includes no more than 1 health area per district. Finally,
      investigators retained 4 health areas representing 4 out of 6 districts of Douala. Thus, the
      sampling of 240,384 inhabitants will be monitored prospectively. All administrative staff and
      community-healthcare committee, the so-called &quot; comité de santé&quot; (COSA) of each health area
      will be a key component of the research team, helping identify every case of death in the
      area of concern. Every case of death will be reported by the staff of COSA in a specific
      questionnaire form. In addition to the deaths noted by members of each COSA, investigators
      will pay attention with all notices of deaths in local newspapers, radio, interrogation of
      health area residents, and death certificates from local medical centers.
