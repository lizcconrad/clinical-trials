  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating free cell DNA (cfDNA) is extracellular fragmentation of nucleic acids that occurs
      both in plasma and serum. This kind of DNA which derived from the apoptotic/necrotic cells or
      the lysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be detectedin the patients with a variety of
      diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that cfDNA from patients exhibits characteristicchanges
      of tumors, suchas mutations, insertions/deletions, methylations,microsatellite aberrations,
      and copy number variations, etc. All of these reveal a visible difference between the benign
      conditions, and thus may be useful in the diagnosis of cancer, identification of targeted
      therapy, monitor responses to treatments, and early detection of relapse. The purpose for
      this study is to explore these characteristic changes in the patients withhepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) and expect to guide targeted therapy and identify non-invasive biomarkers of
      cancer diagnosis and prognosis which can be easily isolated from the circulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In cancer, cfDNA can be detected a higher concentration in the circulation because of the
      necrosis of neoplasm cells with the rapid enlargement and relatively shortage of blood
      supply. So, identifying tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic changes in cfDNA on this
      status, such as gene mutations, deletions, methylation alterations and microsatellite
      alterations, may be more specific for us to diagnose the neoplasms in early phase. This
      phenomenon also appears in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have
      shown that cfDNA level is associated with intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis in HCC
      patients and examined some cfDNAcharacteristic changes, such as p161NK4A, RTL, RASSF1A,
      LINE-1 and GSTP1. Thus is useful for us to explore the specific cfDNA in HCC. For a high
      sensitivity and specificity detection, we will use technologiesdeveloped at Stanford Genome
      Technology Centerto find more characteristic gene mutations, methylation alterations or other
      changes (3). In this study, we willinvestigate thesecharacteristic changesin cfDNA and
      primary tumor lesions.

      Study arrangement:

      Collect the DNA samples from the plasma, blood cells and solid tumor tissues in the patients
      with HCC.

      Detect the DNA sequence from the samples of plasma, blood cells and solid tumor tissues.

      Identify cancer specific variations in cfDNA and primary tumor lesions. Date analysis and
      investigate these characteristic changes. Evaluate the application in early diagnosis,
      treatment monitoring and prognosis for HCC.

    <description>In the first three months in this study, we will collect 5 samples from the plasma, blood cells and primary tumor lesions in the patients with HCC in three stages including preoperative, postoperative (2 weeks) and postoperative (1 month). It is better for us to find the characteristic changes when we make a detailed comparison between the samples in these period. These samples include 5ml plasma, 2ml blood cells without plasma and at least 10mg solid tumor tissues.</description>

    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>We will prepare the DNA samples from the plasma, blood cells and primary tumor lesions in the patients with HCC in Stanford Genome Technology Center. And then, we will finish DNA sequence in both of them. The DNA sequence which detect from the blood cells will be a normal standard, and thus will be compared with the DNA sequence detect in the samples of plasma and tumor tissues. In this way, we expect to find the common mutations in cfDNA and primary tumor lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>two months</time_frame>
    <description>Date analysis will help us to find the changes which have the highest probability in DNA sequence. After that, we will screen these characteristic changes and confirm the sensitive and special mutations which can help us to diagnose the HCC in early phase.</description>

    <time_frame>four months</time_frame>
    <description>After we find these valuable characteristic changes in HCC, 50 samples will be detected within these changes. On the basis of the deepen date analysis, we will evaluate the sensitivity and specificity with these changes in HCC.</description>

    <description>After we complete the evaluation and determine which genetic changes can be used, we will choose 100 patients with HCC and 50 patients who have accepted the surgery treatment in this trial phase. The first 100 patients will be detected these changes before the operation. After that, we expect to establish an evaluation system for early diagnosis in HCC. The postoperative patients will accept the cfDNA detection in the same way with the purpose of estimating the recurrence of the tumor</description>
