      This is a single arm, open-label, single center study evaluating the safety, feasibility,
      clinical efficacy and immunogenicity of GLA-SE administration to patients with Merkel cell
      carcinoma. Ten patients will be treated. The goal is for GLA-SE to assist the patient's own
      immune system in attacking the cancer cells.

          -  Patients must have at least one injectable lesion, defined as an easily palpable
             superficial lesion (cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph nodal metastasis) that can be
             accurately localized, stabilized by palpation, and is superficial enough to enable IT
             injection.
