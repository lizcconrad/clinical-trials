      The purpose of the study is to assess the relationship between IOP pattern as recorded over
      24 hours by using Triggerfish and quantified by acrophase scored dichotomously, and
      conversion to glaucoma in OHT patients (conversion status). Elevation of IOP above normal
      range is called &quot;ocular hypertension&quot; (OHT). In a previous study, it has been shown that OHT
      patients who progress to glaucoma (converters) have at baseline and prior to any conversion,
      IOP patterns that more closely resemble those of established early primary open-angle
      glaucoma (POAG) patients, while stable OHT patients (non-converters) have IOP patterns closer
      to those of healthy control subjects. The study has been planned to recruit at least 48
      eligible patients (24 converters and 24 non-converters).
