  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficiency of SenseCam® in patients with schizophrenia
      by comparing two cognitive remediation methods of autobiographical memory.Patients and
      control participants will be invited to carry SenseCam® during 7 hours per day minimum and
      for 4 successive days. Each ending day when carry SenseCam®, they will be asked to go to the
      laboratory where 4 types of interventions will be successively done according to the
      randomization: 1) a simple visual retrospective procedure (SVR), 2) a visual retrospective
      procedure coupled with a specific cueing intervention (VR-SC), 3) a verbal retrospective
      (VbR) and 4) no intervention (control condition).The testing phase will take place 14 days
      after the last day of data collection and will consist in a cued recall task and a
      recognition task using the pictures obtained by the SenseCam® of the participants.According
      to our hypotheses, the vividness of memories will be higher in events subjected to the VR-SC
      procedure than in events subjected to the SVR and VbR procedures. This effect is expected for
      both patients with schizophrenia and controls participants. Since strategies to enrich memory
      details will be explicitly given to the patients when using the VR-SC procedure, we assume
      that patients will be able to normalize their scores.
