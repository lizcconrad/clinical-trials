  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study identifies social and behavioral factors likely to influence PrEP acceptability
      and adherence among men who have sex with men (MSM), and collaborates with a community health
      center to evaluate a two-stage intervention to improve PrEP decision-making, as well as
      persistence and adherence for those who chose to take PrEP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to daily or intermittent oral administration of
      antiretroviral drugs designed to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection.
      In order for PrEP to become an effective prevention tool, three critical factors must be
      addressed: a) acceptability, i.e., individuals who would benefit from PrEP must know about it
      and be willing to take it; b) adherence, i.e., individuals who choose to PrEP as a prevention
      strategy must take the pills as prescribed; and c) implementation, i.e., processes and
      protocols must be developed to allow for the integration of PrEP delivery and programs into
      real world settings in a way that is feasible, scalable, and realistic. This project has
      three specific aims: 1) Identifying social and behavioral factors that are likely to
      influence PrEP implementation, acceptance, and use/adherence by men who have sex with men
      (MSM) in NYC, including factors at individual-, community-, and organizational-levels; 2)
      Examining social and behavioral factors associated with disparities in access to prevention
      and care services among MSM in NYC that might directly impact PrEP implementation programs
      and policies; and 3) Evaluating an intervention in which PrEP is introduced, provided, and
      supported as part of a prevention package delivered in an community health center. The
      project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence not only on the
      effectiveness of PrEP interventions for MSM, but also on dissemination and scalability of a
      targeted intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces
      disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and acceptability.
