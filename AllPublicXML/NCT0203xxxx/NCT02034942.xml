  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill, ventilator-treated patients rapidly loose much of their muscle mass and
      strength. This can attribute to prolonged admission, prolonged mechanical ventilation,
      increased mortality and might have a negative impact on the physical function, degree of
      independence and quality of life. The pathophysiological background for the loss of muscle
      mass as well as possible effective treatment is still not well established. In the
      NONSEDA-trial we randomise critically ill patients to non-sedation or sedation with a daily
      wake-up trial during mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). It has never
      been assessed whether non-sedation reduces the loss of muscle mass and strength.

      Aim: To assess the effects of non-sedation versus sedation with a daily wake-up trial on
      physical function after discharge from ICU.

      Hypothesis: that non-sedation during ventilator-treatment will improve the physical function
      after ICU-discharge, compared with standard treatment of sedation with a daily wake-up.

    <description>The experimental group will not receive sedatives. Patients are thoroughly and repeatedly informed by the staff of where they are, what have happened, and what type of treatment they are going to receive.
Participants will be awake and have a natural sleep rhythm. In case these patients develop and outward delirium, it is necessary to have a nurse or other caregiver at the bedside in order to calm the patient. Patients with delirium will be treated with haloperidol.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group will be sedated to Ramsay score 3-4. The first 48 hours the patients will be sedated with propofol, after 48 hours midazolam will be used. During daytime, the patient will be awakened as the intravenous infusion of sedatives will be discontinued. The patient will be considered to be awake when he/she can perform at least three of the following four tasks:
Open the eyes to verbal commands.
Follow the examiner's instructions with the eyes.
Squeeze hands on request.
Stick out the tongue on request.
After a successful wake-up, the infusion of sedative will be resumed, starting on half of the pre-wake-up dose and adjusted to Ramsey score 3-4.</description>
