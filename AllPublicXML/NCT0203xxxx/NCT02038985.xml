      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of fluorescence imaging + Indocyanine Green
      (ICG) dye (&quot;Firefly&quot;), compared to standard white light imaging in 2D and 3D, for accurate
      visual diagnosis of endometriosis during a da Vinci robotically guided endometriosis
      resection procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluorescence imaging has been used for visualization of tissue perfusion in colorectal
      surgery, detection of pathologic primary and metastatic tumors, and measurement of graft
      patency in cardiovascular surgery. The da VinciÂ® Firefly Imaging System, through the use of
      fluorescence imaging, allows surgeons to view high-resolution near infrared images of blood
      flow and tissue perfusion in real-time during robotic-assisted surgical procedures, such as
      during a robotic-assisted endometriosis resection.

      Using standard white light imaging, endometriotic lesions can appear red and vascular, white
      and scarred, black, brown, yellow, or almost any color; atypical implants are clear and can
      seem like normal tissue. However, there are some published reports demonstrating that the
      lesions of endometriosis are hypervascular and may be visualized radiographically on the
      basis of this pathologic feature. Because the individual lesions of endometriosis can vary
      significantly in their appearance under standard white light, using the hypervascular
      characteristic of this disease along with the Firefly technology may provide consistency in
      intraoperative visual diagnosis, and thus may aid the detection and resection of
      endometriosis.

      The ability to accurately visualize all the lesions of endometriosis, typical and atypical in
      appearance, and thus facilitate complete resection of the disease, may have a significant
      impact on symptomatic relief and disease recurrence. The Firefly Imaging System of
      fluorescence imaging + ICG dye may allow for more accurate visual diagnosis of endometriosis
      during a robotic-assisted endometriosis resection procedure, and therefore may have a
      positive impact for patients with this disease.

      This is a prospective, comparison, single-center, observational study to evaluate
      fluorescence imaging + ICG dye (Firefly), compared to standard white light imaging in 2D and
      3D, for accurate visual diagnosis of endometriosis during a da Vinci endometriosis resection
      procedure.

    <description>Quality is defined by the investigators perception of accuracy of visual diagnosis and how clear are the the resultant images used for visualization and mapping of lesions. The quality of the fluorescence imaging + ICG dye (Firefly) will be compared to standard white light imaging in 2D and 3D for accurate visual diagnosis of endometriosis during a da Vinci endometriosis resection procedure</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life (QOL) will be captured by utilizing the validated questionnaire SF-36 short form, administered at three time-points: pre-operative, at 3-months post-operative, and at 6-months post-operative. The QOL aspects examined with the SF-36 include vitality, mental health physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, as well as physical, emotional, and social role functioning.</description>
