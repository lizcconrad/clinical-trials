  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of Night Shift in the detection of supine
      sleep and efficacy of vibro-tactile feedback in restricting supine sleep.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol is designed to first evaluate the accuracy of supine vs. non-supine detection in
      15 subjects (hereafter referred to as study 1). In study 2, patients who had completed a
      baseline polysomnography (PSG) with a minimum of four hours of sleep time were to wear the
      Night Shift for two nights without feedback to confirm their willingness to continue with the
      study, followed by 28 nights of vibro-tactile position therapy. A follow-up PSG was to be
      conducted as soon as possible to the completion of the 28-nights of treatment. During
      enrollment subjects were to complete pre-treatment questionnaires designed to measure daytime
      sleepiness, insomnia severity, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. The same instruments
      were completed post-treatment on the morning after the 28th night of treatment. Subjects
      completed daily logs to confirm device utilization and identify potential non-device related
      factors that could influence study completion.
