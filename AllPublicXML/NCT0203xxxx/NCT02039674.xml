    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy in participants
      with unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

    <measure>Part 2 Cohort G: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).</description>

    <measure>Part 2 Cohort H: ORR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a CR (Disappearance of all target lesions) or a PR (At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>All Cohorts: Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Up to 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs were assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. A DLT was defined as any of the following events: Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity (not laboratory); Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days; Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (not laboratory, specifically nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) lasting &gt;3 days despite optimal supportive care; Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic laboratory value requiring treatment or hospitalization, or persisting for &gt;1 week; Febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or Grade 4; Qualifying thrombocytopenia &lt;25,000/mm^3; Prolonged delay (&gt;2 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity; Missing &gt;10% of erlotinib or gefitinib doses as a result of adverse events (AEs) during the DLT window of observation; or Grade 5 toxicity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2 Cohort G: Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. PFS was assessed by BICR.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2 Cohort G: Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2 Cohort G: Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed response (CR or PR) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. DOR was assessed by BICR.</description>

        <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Up to 21 days)</time_frame>

          <description>DLTs were assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. A DLT was defined as any of the following events: Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity (not laboratory); Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days; Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (not laboratory, specifically nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) lasting &gt;3 days despite optimal supportive care; Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic laboratory value requiring treatment or hospitalization, or persisting for &gt;1 week; Febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or Grade 4; Qualifying thrombocytopenia &lt;25,000/mm^3; Prolonged delay (&gt;2 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity; Missing &gt;10% of erlotinib or gefitinib doses as a result of adverse events (AEs) during the DLT window of observation; or Grade 5 toxicity.</description>
          <population>The DLT evaluable population consisted of all participants who completed the first cycle of study treatment or who discontinued from the study due to a drug-related AE.</population>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. PFS was assessed by BICR.</description>
