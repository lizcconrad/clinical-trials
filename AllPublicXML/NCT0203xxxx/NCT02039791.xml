    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR). Clinical trials are ongoing globally to evaluate Nimotuzumab in different
      indications. Nimotuzumab has been approved to treat squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck
      (SCCHN), glioma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in different countries. The clinical phaseⅡtrial
      is designed to assess the resection rate and pathological complete response of nimotuzumab
      plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with cervical cancer.
