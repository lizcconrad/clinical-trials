      This study will evaluate whether bile acids are able to increase insulin sensitivity and
      enhance glycemic control in T2DM patients, as well as exploring the mechanisms that enhance
      glycemic control. These observations will provide the preliminary data for proposing future
      therapeutic as well as further mechanistic studies of the role of bile acids in the control
      of glycemia in T2DM.

      Background: Intra-jejunal administration of bile acids improves insulin sensitivity.

      Hypothesis: The bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in delayed (ileocolonic)-release
      formulation, stimulates TGR-5 and FXR receptors in the ileum and colon, increasing the
      secretion of FGF-19, GLP-1, oxyntomodulin (OXM), and PYY3-36, improving insulin sensitivity
      and inducing weight loss.

      Aim: To study the effect of an ileocolonic formulation of UDCA on insulin sensitivity,
      postprandial plasma glycemia and incretin levels, gastric emptying and body weight in
      overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects on monotherapy with metformin.

      Study design: This is a single center, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single dose
      randomized controlled trial to study the effect of delayed (ileocolonic)-release UDCA 600 mg
      twice daily on insulin sensitivity, gastric emptying of liquids and solids (measured by
      scintigraphy)and weight loss in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects. Participants
      will be receiving monotherapy with metformin. Blood samples will be collected at defined
      times to measure glycemia and the incretin (GLP-1, OXM, PYY3-36) fasting levels and responses
      to the meal.

      Anticipated Results: In comparison with placebo, UDCA will increase insulin sensitivity,
      enhance glycemic control, increase postprandial incretins, and delay GE of liquids.

      Significance: This study will prove that ileocolonic-release UDCA enhances glycemic control
      in T2DM patients.
