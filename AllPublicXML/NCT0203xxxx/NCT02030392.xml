  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to compare two training programs for children suffering functional abdominal
      pain. These two programs are comparable in number of sessions and group sizes, but show
      differences in content (very focused on pain management vs. more general information and
      support). Focus of the trial is the evaluation of &quot;Stop the pain&quot;, which has shown high
      effectiveness in one first trial. This time, five clinics, experienced in diagnosis and
      treatment of childhood chronic abdominal pain, will take part. Children aged 7-12 years are
      eligible. The programs imply six weekly group sessions for the children and 2 parent
      evenings. The study group assumes that participation in &quot;Stop the pain&quot; will reduce pain
      experience and will improve the children's quality of life and coping strategies - up to 12
      months after training.

      The trial aims to assess the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral self-management program
      (intervention group, IG) compared to an equally extensive information-only control group
      (CG). The interventions contain 6 weekly group sessions and 2 parent meetings according to
      the cognitive-behavioral, manualized program &quot;Stop the pain with Happy Pingu&quot;. Follow up per
      patient: 3- and 12 months. Children aged 7-12 years suffering functional abdominal pain
      (according to Rome III criteria H2a, H2b, H2d, H2d1) are eligible. Our primary hypothesis is
      that for patients in the IG the frequency and intensity of pain will be reduced more
      successfully and more sustainable than for children in the CG. Secondary hypotheses state
      that the IG will experience a higher increase in quality of life and psychosocial well-being
      compared to the active CG.

    <description>Primary efficacy endpoint is the frequency and intensity of pain (composite score) over the course of treatment and follow-up (pre, post, 3 and 12 months follow-up). This primary outcome will be assessed by pain diary in children's self-report (over 2 weeks).Statistically, the primary endpoint of the study is defined as the change of the logarithm of the area under the pain-intensity curve over one week from start of treatment to 12 month follow-up. The area under the pain intensity curve (auc) is a measure that reflects pain intensity as well as pain duration and pain frequency and thus can be understood as a composite measure of pain.</description>

The measure is one scale score and covers the level of impairment in everyday activitites due to abdominal pain by 12 items, e.g. reading, meeting friends, family life.
