  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leucoencephalopathy
      (CADASIL) is an archetypal small vessel disease of the brain caused by dominant mutations in
      the NOTCH3 receptor. Cardinal vascular lesions include deposition of granular osmiophilic
      material (GOM) within the basal lamina of smooth muscle cells, progressive smooth muscle cell
      loss, and fibrosis of the media. Pathogenic mutations alter the number of cysteine residues
      in the extracellular domain of NOTCH3 (Notch3 ECD), leading to its abnormal accumulation in
      the GOM deposits. Vascular smooth muscle cell has been identified as the primary target cell
      in this disease. Pathophysiological processes leading from NOTCH3 mutations to smooth muscle
      cell loss remain poorly understood.

      The investigators propose to study these mechanisms by reprogramming skin cells to become
      stem cells and then differentiating them to vascular smooth muscle cells.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the differentiated smooth muscle cells will display the
      characteristic features of CADASIL, ie, Notch3 ECD accumulation and GOM deposits.

      Skin biopsies will be collected to derive fibroblasts. These will be retained and
      reprogrammed to iPS cells (also to be retained). iPS cells will be differentiated in vascular
      smooth muscle cells.
