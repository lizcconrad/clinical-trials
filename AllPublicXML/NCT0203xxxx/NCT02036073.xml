      EPO has been safely used for prevent preterm anemia and recent studies have shown the
      neuroprotective effect. Our hypothesis is that EPO could prevent preterm brain injury. The
      aims of this study include: to investigate the safety and efficacy of EPO by using 500u/kg
      higher than the dose of anemia treatment (250u/kg); to evaluate the effect of EPO on
      neurodevelopment in preterm infants; to detect biological indicators and explore the
      neuroprotective mechanism of EPO.

      Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is one of the most common brain injuries that occur in
      preterm infants, which is related with the development of cerebral palsy. The current therapy
      is only supportive to maintain the live sign stable. There is no effective therapeutic
      strategy for preterm brain injury. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to be protective
      against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries in animal models of brain injury, and
      clinical trials of neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury. Furthermore, recombinant human Epo
      (rhEpo) has been widely used in preterm infants to prevent or treat the anemia of prematurity
      during the past decade. It has been considered to be safe and well tolerated in preterm
      infants. However, there is no conclusion yet if the EPO has the effect to prevent preterm
      brain injury. The purpose of the study was whether the rhEpo (500 U/kg) given to very preterm
      infants (gestation age &lt; 32 weeks) within 24h after birth and subsequently each other day
      for2 week possesses neuroprotective properties. Very preterm infants with gestational age of
      &lt; 32 weeks and admit to our NICU are eligible for enrollment. After informed consent is
      obtained, infants will be randomly assigned to either EPO group or vehicle group. The primary
      short-term outcome measures are brain injury (intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and
      periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)) and ROP. The long term outcomes are whether rhEpo in very
      preterm infants finally improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months corrected age.

    <description>In EPO group, the EPO was given by 500IU/kg every other day intravenously for 2 weeks. Recombinant human erythropoietin was configured by the hospital pharmacy intravenous Center Configuration, melted configured with saline to 1ml/kg solution. For severe patients, they were started to treat with EPO when their vital signs, blood pressure were stable.</description>
