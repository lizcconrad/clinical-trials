      Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer among Chinese in Hong
      Kong and the second leading cause of cancer death in this population. Several screening
      strategies has been associated with improved survival and may affect patients' health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL). HRQOL impact should be used to adjust for survival in terms of
      quality adjusted life years (QALY) in the evaluation of cost-effectiveness of any
      intervention including screening.

      Objectives: to determine the HRQOL and health preference of patients with different stages of
      colorectal neoplasm, and to determine the most cost-effective CRC screening strategy for
      increasing QALYs.

      Design and Subjects: A longitudinal survey to collect data on HRQOL associated with
      colorectal neoplasm for Markov modeling on cost-effectiveness of CRC screening. A stratified
      sample of 420 patients with colorectal polyps and different stages of CRC will be recruited
      from colorectal clinics of Queen Mary Hospital for health preference and HRQOL assessment.
      The HRQOL over time will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months later. Health preference
      data will be integrated with cost and effectiveness data obtained from the literature to
      determine the cost-effectiveness of currently recommended CRC screening strategies by Markov
      modeling.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the SF-6D health preference value and
      QALYs. Secondary outcomes are the SF-12v2 and FACT-C scores. The outcomes will be compared
      between patients with different stages of colorectal neoplasm. Markov modeling study will
      estimate the expected QALYs gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each CRC
      screening strategy.

      Results: The study will provide information on HRQOL of patients with colorectal neoplasm to
      guide health services. The Markov Model will identify the most cost-effective CRC screening
      strategy for Hong Kong Chinese, which can inform policy makers and the public for the
      prevention of CRC of the population.

      The aims are to determine the HRQOL and health preference (utility) of different stages of
      colorectal neoplasm in order to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different CRC screening
      strategies for the Chinese population in Hong Kong.

      The specific objectives are:

        1. To determine the HRQOL preference values of patients in different stage of colorectal
           neoplasm in order to estimate the quality of life adjustment applicable to each stage of
           colorectal neoplasm.

        2. To evaluate the HRQOL of patients with colorectal neoplasm in order to find out their
           concerns and needs.

        3. To find out whether HRQOL preference of people with colorectal neoplasm changes with
           time.

        4. To determine the expected life years gained from the reduction in the incidence and
           mortality rates of CRC for each CRC screening strategy base on literature review.

        5. To determine the QALY gained from each CRC strategy by combining the preference value
           with life years gained.

        6. To identify the most cost-effective CRC screening strategy and to determine the
           incremental cost per additional QALY gained compared to no screening, by Markov
           modelling.

      The study hypotheses are:

        1. Patients with colorectal neoplasm including those with polyps have lower HRQOL than the
           general population.

        2. There is a gradient reduction in HRQOL preference among patients with different stages
           colorectal neoplasm from polyp to metastatic cancer.

        3. HRQOL preference of patients with colorectal neoplasm is stable if there is no change in
           the disease stage.

        4. Annual I-FOBT is the most cost-effective CRC screening strategy for the Chinese
           population in Hong Kong.
