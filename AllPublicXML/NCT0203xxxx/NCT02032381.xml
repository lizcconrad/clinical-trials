  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used to treat an expanding array of
      malignant and non-malignant disorders. This is a prospective multicenter study, in pediatric
      allo-BMT recipients to analyze the spectrum of noninfectious pulmonary complications (PC), to
      evaluate the prevalence and course of PFT abnormalities before and after transplant, and to
      detect risk factor for PC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's a multicenter prospective study in France. All children under 18 years are included,
      just before the HSCT. The functional test before the HSCT at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months
      will be collected and a cardiopulmonary exercise test is done one and three years after the
      HSCT. Thoracic tomodensitometry is done before the HCT and after at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months.

      All data will be collected upon the HSCT, the infections before and after the HSCT, the
      respiratory symptoms, and the treatment. Bronchia alveolar lavage and serum will be collected
      and frozen during the study.

      The inclusion will be done during two years and children will be following during three
      years.

      The purpose is to evaluate the prevalence, the course of PFT abnormalities before and after
      transplant, and to detect risk factor for PC.
