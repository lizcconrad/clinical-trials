  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose-dependent impact of 6 month freeze-dried
      blueberry powder intake on insulin sensitivity and resistance, cardiovascular disease risk
      factors, and lung and cognitive function in overweight and obese participants with metabolic
      syndrome. We will also examine acute post-prandial effects of blueberry intake (at baseline
      and at 6-months).
