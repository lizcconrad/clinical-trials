  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, cataract surgery is the most frequent surgical procedure, performed with local
      anesthesia and most often very light techniques using eye-drops. Technical improvements of
      surgical and anesthesic procedures have led many countries to implement alternative
      surveillance procedures. In France, it is mandatory that the persons in charge of anesthetic
      surveillance (doctors or nurses) should be qualified in anesthesia.

      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility and safety of a centralised
      monitoring station outside of the operating rooms, as an alternative to the presence of 1
      anesthetic nurse in each operating room.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In their hospital, the investigators will study the following alternatives for the anesthetic
      surveillance of the 3 operating rooms where surgery of the ocular anterior segment is
      performed: 1) the usual procedure, with the presence of 3 anesthetic nurses (1 in each
      operating room) and 2) a new organization with an anesthetic nurse checking a centralised
      monitoring station and a back-up anesthetic nurse ready to intervene inside the 3 operating
      rooms whenever needed.

      The 2 procedures will be successively implemented during 3 to 4 sequences, until the number
      of surgical procedures statistically required have been studied.

      The investigators aim to demonstrate that the centralised monitored surveillance does not put
      the patients at risk more often than the current surveillance procedure.
