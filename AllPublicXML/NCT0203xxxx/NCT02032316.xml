  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, single-arm, trial to demonstrate safety and device performance
      of the ADVA-Tec Uriprene™ Degradable Temporary Ureteral Stent. This is a first-in-man
      clinical study in a small human population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: To assess the safety and feasibility of the Uriprene® Stent by assessing
      the time to complete degradation or the passage of stent fragments from the bladder by
      radiological assessment.

      Subject Population: Patients with clinical symptoms consistent with unilateral ureteral or
      renal stone fragments ≤ 2mm, post-uncomplicated ureteroscopy (UURS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are &gt; 18, &lt; 80 years of age; inclusive of males and females.

          2. Patients with unilateral ureteral or renal stone fragments &lt; 2mm, post-uncomplicated
             ureteroscopy (UURS).

          3. Patients with a height and body size able to accommodate a 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30
             mm long ureteral stent, as judged by the Investigator.

          4. Patients with the ability to understand the requirements of the study, who have
             provided written informed consent, and who have agreed to return for the required
             follow-up assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a known contraindication for treatment with the Uriprene® Stent.

          2. Patients with a history of an anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract.

          3. Patients with a known upper or lower urinary tract infection at the time of stent
             insertion.

          4. Patients with known renal insufficiency or chronic impairment.

          5. Any condition, in the opinion of the investigator, in whom patients would not be
             eligible for treatment with the Uriprene® Stent.

          6. Pregnant or lactating women, or women of childbearing potential who do not employ a
             reliable method of contraception as judged by the Investigator.

          7. Patients who consume more than 14 drinks of alcohol per week (as this may affect
             degradation of the stent).

          8. Presence of ureteral blockage or stricture

          9. After failed guide wire placement or failed ureteroscopic access

         10. Impacted ureteral stones still in place

         11. Patients predisposed to urinary stasis e.g. neurogenic bladder, bladder outlet
             obstruction, known pregnancy

         12. Patients with a solitary kidney

         13. Presence of ureteral fistula

         14. Presence of ureteral tumor

         15. Presence of extrinsic compression of the ureter

         16. Urinary tract infection

         17. Staghorn calculi
