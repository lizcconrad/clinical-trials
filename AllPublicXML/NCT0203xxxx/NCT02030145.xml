    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this line of research is to see if realistic manipulative protocols can
      be developed to produce sustained reductions in residual volume and improve pulmonary
      function parameters in people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

      This study is a prospective randomized crossover study to evaluate the effects of two
      different manipulation techniques on pulmonary function parameters in persons with COPD.
      Thirty-six (36) subjects will be enrolled in the study in order to complete the study with at
      least 30 subjects. Pulmonary function measures will include spirometry and lung volume. The
      pulmonary function testing will be done baseline, 30 minutes post-treatment, and 3 hours
      post-treatment. The study protocol treatment consists of a five-minute treatment session of
      one of the two studied treatment techniques given in a random order. After a washout period
      of at least four weeks, the subject will return for a second treatment session using the
      other technique.

    <description>This technique is a modification of the Classic Thoracic Lymphatic Pump where some pressure is maintained on the chest wall at the end of each exhalation and at the end of the third or fourth breathing cycle, during the inhalation phase, the hands are slowly removed from the chest wall, gradually releasing pressure on the chest without causing a sudden change in intrathoracic pressures.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:All subjects must be age 50 or older, have a history consistent with the
        diagnosis of COPD, and have documented airflow obstruction and an increased residual volume
        on pulmonary function testing. Airflow obstruction is defined as an FEV1/FVC ratio of 70
        percent or less of the predicted value and a RV of 120 percent or greater of the predicted
        value.

        Exclusion Criteria:Subjects will be excluded if they have received any form of manipulative
        treatment in the 3 months prior to enrolling in the study. Subjects with acute respiratory
        illness, such as an exacerbation of COPD, acute bronchitis, or pneumonia will be excluded
        from the study. Persons unable to cooperate and follow instructions to complete pulmonary
        function testing due to dementia or other cognitive disorders will be excluded as will
        persons with spinal scoliosis greater than 25 degrees, significant chest wall deformity,
        and acute rib or compression fracture of the vertebra, unstable angina, or unstable
        congestive heart failure.
