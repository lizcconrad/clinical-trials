  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that delivering short messages (SMS) to pregnant women can improve
      maternal and newborn health outcomes. This pilot offers mothers-to-be in rural China free
      daily short messages (SMS) via cell phone. The aim is to advise them on (a) good household
      prenatal practices (GHPP) and (b) care seeking (CS) in order to improve the quality of life
      for mothers and newborns.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Factorial quasi-randomization is utilized to compare two groups of interventions (i.e., GHPP
      and CS) as well as to compare these individual interventions with a combination of the
      interventions. It is also possible that distinct treatments have interaction effects, and we
      plan to test for this. Policymakers are interested in using different strategies to enhance
      neonatal health. For example, the bank of SMS developed by our team is a combination of
      several components: reminders for regular checkups, information on GHPP, and information on
      CS. From a policy perspective, the evaluation of the full bank of SMS may be sufficient for
      the government to decide whether or not to scale up the full bank of SMS. However, to
      understand maternal behavior and, for policy purposes, to understand which components in the
      bank of SMS should be scaled up, it is important to disentangle which component contributes
      most to final neonatal health. Taken together, are all the components of the bank of SMS
      effective in changing maternal behavior and enhancing neonatal health? Which mechanisms are
      at play, good household prenatal care, care seeking in pregnancy, or both?
