  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have indicated that determining prevalence and number of circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) at various time points during treatment may be an effective tool for assessing
      treatment efficacy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, even if the prognostic value
      of CTCs in MBC is well understood, the role of both CTC prevalence and CTC phenotype in
      predicting treatment response needs further investigation. DETECT IV is a prospective,
      multicenter, open-label, phase II study in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer and persisting HER2-negative circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Additional research on
      CTC dynamics and characteristics will provide a better understanding of the prognostic and
      predictive value of CTCs and is one step into a more personalized therapy for MBC.

             primary tumor and/or biopsies must have be confirmed as cancer by histolopathology.

          2. HER2 status (as investigated on all primary tumor tissue and/or biopsies from
             metastatic sites or loco regional recur-rences) must be negative. HER2-negativity is
             defined as (i.e.: immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 0-1+ or 2+ and flu-orescent in situ
             hybridization (FISH) negative or just FISH negative, whichever was performed) in all

             cervix or non-melanoma skin cancer)

          7. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric or social condition which would
             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or which might interfere
             with the patient's adherence to the protocol.

             disease, ulcerative colitis) and any other diseases significantly affecting
             gas-trointestinal function as well as inability to swallow and retain oral medication
             for any other reason.

        For Eribulin only:
