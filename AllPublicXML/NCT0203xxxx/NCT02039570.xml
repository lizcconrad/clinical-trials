    <textblock>
      This case series aims to find out in a group of female patients suffering from haemorrhoids,
      how many of them have pelvic vein reflux that feeds into their haemorrhoids.

      This will be done by examining their ovarian and internal iliac veins for reflux, using a
      transvaginal scan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on previous research, we believe that haemorrhoids could be caused by faulty valves in
      the veins running from deep within the pelvic region to the lower part of the abdomen
      (internal iliac veins)resulting in reflux in the tributaries.

      We have already presented research showing that patients with severe pelvic vein reflux,
      particularly of the internal iliac veins and tributaries, are associated with a higher chance
      of haemorrhoids.

      The aim of this study is to see in a group of patients suffering from haemorrhoids, whether
      all of them exhibit pelvic vein reflux feeding into the haemorrhoids.

      If we are able to prove that either all or the vast majority of patients with true
      haemorrhoids do have pelvic vein reflux feeding into them, this will support our hypothesis
      that the internal iliac vein and tributary reflux is causative of haemorrhoids.

      following this, in a future study we will treat internal iliac vein and tributary reflux to
      see if the results of haemorrhoid treatments are improved.

      If we find only a few patients with haemorrhoids have associated internal iliac vein and
      tributary reflux feeding into the haemorrhoids, we will be able to refute the hypothesis that
      there is a causative association, and will not need to progress with the studies and will
      look instead for a different aetiology.

      At the current time, there is no effective way of investigating male pelvic vein reflux. The
      gold standard investigation for pelvic vein reflux is transvaginal duplex ultrasound scan. As
      such this study will be restricted to females presenting with symptomatically haemorrhoids
      who are able and willing to undergo transvaginal ultrasound scan to assess their pelvic
      veins.
