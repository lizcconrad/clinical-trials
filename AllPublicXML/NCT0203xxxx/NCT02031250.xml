  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve locoregional control of poor prognosis Head and Neck Cancer (HNC)
      patients by selectively escalating the radiotherapy dose to subvolumes of tumor likely to be
      resistant to standard Radiation Therapy (RT) using DCE-MRI (Dynamic Contrast Enhanced
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Standard doses of radiotherapy to the rest of the tissues and
      surrounding normal tissues will be maintained.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologically‐confirmed, previously untreated, non‐metastatic
             locally/regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, stage
             III/IV, referred for definitive chemo‐RT, and meet one of the following six criteria:

               1. Primary tumor (T4) with or without metastatic lymph nodes. Tumor or nodes are:
                  unresectable, resection is considered by the treating surgeon or patient to
                  result in unacceptable functional or oncological results, patient refuses
                  surgery, or surgery is not possible due to comorbidities.

               2. HPV(‐) (Human Papillomavirus) or p16(-) locally/regionally advanced (T3‐4 or
                  N2‐3) oropharyngeal cancer.

               3. HPV(+) or p16(+) locally/regionally advanced (T4 or N3) oropharyngeal cancer.

               4. T3 or T4 laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer that is locally advanced, bulky (&gt;40
                  cc*), unresectable, or patient declines surgery.

               5. Stage III/IV oral cavity or paranasal sinus cancers in patients who refuse
                  surgery or are unfit for surgery.

               6. Locally/regionally advanced (stage T3‐4 and/or N3) nasopharyngeal cancer which is
                  EBV (‐) (Epstein‐Barr Virus).

          -  KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status: A measure of general well being and activities of
             daily living; scores range from 0 to 100 where 100 represents perfect health) &gt;70 (see
             Appendix A) within two weeks of enrollment.

          -  Pre‐treatment laboratory criteria within four weeks of enrollment:

          -  WBC (White Blood Cell) &gt; 3500/ul, granulocyte &gt; 1500/ul.

          -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/ul.

          -  Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN.

          -  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) &lt; 2.5 X ULN.

          -  Estimated Creatinine clearance &gt;30cc/min.

          -  Patients must be able to receive protocol chemotherapy in the judgment of the treating
             Medical Oncologist.

          -  Patients are adults (Age &gt;18).

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and given
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  EBV (+) Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in the protocol treated tumor.

          -  Prior head and neck radiation.

          -  Documented evidence of distant metastases.

          -  Patients with active infection.

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Patients should have no contraindications to having a contrast enhanced MRI scan.
             These contraindications will be assessed at the time of enrollment using the
             guidelines set up and in clinical use by the Institutional Standard Practice.
