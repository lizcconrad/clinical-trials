      Observational study of the effects of antibiotics on commensal flora. Realization of stool
      samples and nasal swabs before and after antibiotic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolone (FQ) and is a major problem worldwide. The
      commensal flora is the main reservoir for antibiotic resistance. Understanding the factors
      (environmental, patient-related, dosis-related, drug-related…) involved in the emergence of
      resistance to fluoroquinolones in the commensal flora of patients treated with a FQ, may help
      prevent it and preserve the efficiency of these important antibiotics. Samples of digestive
      flora will be collected from hospitalized patients before receiving a FQ or Ceftriaxone, at
      the end of the treatment and 3 month after the end of treatment. Clinical data will be
      collected.

    <description>A third reference group will consist of patients hospitalized in the same services as the &quot;case&quot; patients but did not receive antibiotics (60 patients). They will have an idea of possible changes in flora during hospitalization without any antibiotics, for example due to horizontal transfer of resistant strains. This group will be composed of 60 patients who had not received antibiotics within 3 months before and not receiving for the duration of their participation.</description>

  <biospec_retention>Samples With DNA</biospec_retention>
  <biospec_descr>
    <textblock>
      Stool samples will be collected on 4 separate days for patients treated with antibiotics:

      T0: before treatment begins T1: at the end of treatment or discharge from the hospital T2:
      3-6 months after the end of treatment T3: 10-14 months after the end of treatment For
      patients receiving sequentially ceftriaxone followed by a FQ, an additional sample will be
      collected at the end of ceftriaxone treatment.

      In the reference group, stool samples will be collected:

      T0: at inclusion in the study T1: at hospital discharge The purpose is to study the bacterial
      DNA contained in the stool. No analysis will be performed on the human patient DNA.

      Changes in the gut microflora will be analysed by metagenomics deep sequencing performed by
      Dushko Ehrlich (INRA, France).
