  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has previously been reported that men with prostate cancer are 1 ) reduced quality of life
      after diagnosis and treatment, 2 ) neuroticism increases the reduction in QoL related to
      treatment side effects, and 3) often have very involved and active spouses who seems to have
      been handed over / taken over parts of the men's responsibility for their own health. We
      postulate herein a new hypothesis that the stress level is elevated when harbouring
      undetected prostate cancer. We will investigate whether those who are diagnosed with prostate
      cancer already in beforehand have an increased degree of masculine stress ( experience of not
      living up to their own perception of the ideal man ) and neuroticism in the typology. We will
      examine different personality and QoL questionnaires for patients with elevated PSA, and
      compare those whose clinical assessment later reveals prostate cancer, with three control
      groups: 1) men with elevated PSA who are not diagnosed with prostate cancer, 2) men with
      normal PSA treated for benign prostate enlargement and 3) patient with substantial risk of
      colorectal cancer (CRC) who undergo colonoscopy, with regard to increased level of masculine
      stress and the personality trait neuroticism.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Men who are being referred as new urological outpatient and meet the following criteria:

             1. Wanted clinical examined because of elevated PSA

             2. Not strong family history of prostate cancer

             3. It is taken biopsy as part of routine investigation.

        2. Control groups: Men being referred to urological / gastroenterological outpatient
           clinic, and which meet the following criteria:

             1. urination complaints, normal PSA, and study shows prostate size&gt; 40cc

        3. Age&gt; 18 years and &lt;75 years

      Outcome measures:

      Together with statistician look for patterns / covariance in replies from those who are
      diagnosed with prostate cancer in the questionnaires personality evaluation adapted to normal
      population (Neo-FFI), gender differentiated stress response questionnaire (MGRSS) and
      questionnaires related to resilience, relationship and quality of life index, compared with
      the control groups.
