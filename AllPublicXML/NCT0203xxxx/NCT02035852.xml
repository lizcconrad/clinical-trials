      The study will compare two different size MRI's of a brain tumor.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to directly compare the MR images of a brain tumor obtained on the 3T
      and then 7T MRI in approximately 150 patients followed serially with MR imaging to evaluate
      for tumor progression.

    <description>1. To determine the benefit of 7T MR imaging in brain tumor patients with regard to the improvement in resolution, as measured by the area of T2 FLAIR signal abnormality and the ability to detect abnormalities in vascular integrity. The benefit will be determined at a single time point as well as longitudinally for each patient at 6 month intervals.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vascular Integrity</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months, up to 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if changes in vascular integrity at 7T can be correlated with tumor progression or transformation to high grade in patients with low grade gliomas.</description>
