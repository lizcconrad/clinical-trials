  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center study. The patients with peripheral arterial disease who
      underwent abdominal aortograms with runoff (which are arteriograms of the lower abdominal
      aorta and arteries in the legs) and Intravascular Ultrasound after stent deployment will be
      enrolled in the study. All patients who participated in the study will be treated according
      to standard of care.

      HYPOTHESIS The higher degree of plaque burden on landing zone has an effect on restenosis on
      peripheral artery intervention.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. To determine intravascular ultrasound parameters of stent deployment and outcomes of
           Femoro-popliteal Disease

        2. To determine clinical risk factors and outcomes of Femoro-popliteal Disease

        3. To obtain data that will eventually support development of a predictive model for ISR in
           Femoro-popliteal Disease

      METHODOLOGY Visit 1: After consent is given

      The subject will receive standard follow-up care. A member of the research team will collect
      information such as the subject's age, sex, ethnicity, and medical information from the
      subject's medical record.

      Visits 2-5: 1 day after enrollment, and at months 3 (+- 2 weeks), 6 (+- 2 weeks), and 12 (+-
      2 weeks)

      The subject will complete standard follow-up appointment at TTUHSC. This may include a
      Doppler ultrasound.

      A member of the research team will record information such as medications, ultrasounds, and
      need for additional care related to the subject's stent.

      The subject will complete the questionnaire on leg pain and mobility.
