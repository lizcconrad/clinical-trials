  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of childhood cancer have an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease due
      to both the therapies they received while undergoing treatment and diet and lifestyle
      factors. The nature of cardiovascular risk and the interaction between treatment affects and
      cardiovascular risk factors is unknown. We propose to study vascular inflammatory markers as
      well as measure of blood vessel stiffness (both of which are predictive of early heart
      disease) in 100 pediatric cancer survivors and 100 control children. Characterization of
      vascular inflammation and stiffness in long-term survivors will allow for the development of
      future interventions to decrease inflammation through both pharmacologic and lifestyle
      modifications.
