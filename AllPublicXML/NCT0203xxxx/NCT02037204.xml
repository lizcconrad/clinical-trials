  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Articular cartilage defects in the knee have a poor intrinsic healing capacity and may lead
      to functional disability and osteoarthritis. Cartilage cell therapy using autologous
      chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been established as the first advanced treatment therapy
      medicinal product. Although this technique has achieved good mid-term results, it is a costly
      and extensive two-stage procedure which is limited by the number of chondrocytes obtained by
      biopsy and the dedifferentiation resulting from the expansion phase. Therefore, there is a
      need for improvement. A new cartilage repair technique should aim at decreasing surgical
      trauma, lowering complexity, improving logistics and cost-effectiveness while retaining or
      improving clinical outcome. Direct contact between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and
      dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes in vitro showed improvement of the chondrogenic
      phenotype of dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes. In addition, preserving the
      pericellular matrix of chondrocytes improves cartilage formation. These chondrons
      (chondrocytes with their pericellular matrix) have shown improved cartilage formation when
      combined with allogeneic MSCs in extensive preclinical studies. The cells are mixed with
      fibrin cell carrier and applied to the cartilage lesion within one surgical procedure. This
      will reduce patient morbidity and improve patient care through immediate transplantation of a
      potent cell-based cartilage product. This is a phase I/II prospective monocenter study to
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of the IMPACT for treatment of focal articular cartilage
      lesions of the knee.
