    <textblock>
      This study is intended to compare the new Carnation patch monitoring system with the Zio
      patch, which represents the current standard for continuous recording of the ECG over
      extended periods.

      The purpose of this research is to confirm the clinical value of a new P-wave sensitive
      recording vector combined with an easy-to-use long-term cardiac rhythm monitoring patch
      system, the CarnationTM Ambulatory Monitoring (CAM) System. The P-wave is a critical aspect
      of the electrocardiogram and a key finding for proper arrhythmia diagnosis. The CAM system is
      optimized for both ease of use and for maximum P-wave clarity for arrhythmia diagnosis.

    <measure>ECG signal quality</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>ECG signal quality = scoring the ability of each system to record electrical activity from the atrium (P-waves). The Physician Event Committee will independently score the P-waves from all recordings, using the following scale: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Non-existent.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures will include Human Factors performance of the 2 systems, which will be scored and compared in the following areas and duration of patch adherence: skin irritation, comfort, contact and stability.</description>
