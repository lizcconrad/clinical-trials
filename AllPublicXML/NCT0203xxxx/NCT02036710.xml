    <textblock>
      Background: Physicians do not have a unified, scientifically tested theory of causation for
      obesity and its comorbidities, nor do they have explanations for the mechanics of the
      metabolic/bariatric surgery procedures. Integral to proffered hypotheses are the actions of
      the hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and leptin.

      Study objective: To obtain blood levels of GLP-1, PYY, and leptin after stimulation of the
      terminal ileum and cecum by a static infusion of a food hydrolysate in morbidly obese
      patients undergoing a duodenal switch procedure.

      Methods: Plasma levels of GLP-1, PYY, and leptin were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120
      minutes after instillation of 240 ml of a food hydrolysate into the ileum or cecum.
