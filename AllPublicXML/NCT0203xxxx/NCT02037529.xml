      This randomized phase III trial studies how well eribulin mesylate or paclitaxel work as
      first- or second-line therapy in treating patients with stage IIIC-IV breast cancer that has
      come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate and paclitaxel, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients randomized to treatment with eribulin
      mesylate (eribulin) versus standard weekly paclitaxel as first- or second-line therapy for
      locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of
      response (DOR), and time to treatment failure (TTF) in patients receiving eribulin versus
      standard weekly paclitaxel.

      II. To compare the 12 month rate of disease progression in patients receiving eribulin versus
      standard weekly paclitaxel.

      III. To assess the toxicities in patients receiving eribulin versus standard weekly
      paclitaxel.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare new metastasis free survival in patients receiving eribulin versus standard
      weekly paclitaxel.

      II. To evaluate the clinical value and feasibility of collecting patient-reported symptom
      toxicity information via the Patient-Report Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

      III. To further validate the PRO-CTCAE sensory neuropathy items. IV. To compare
      patient-reported neurotoxicity between arms using the European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral
      Neuropathy 20 (CIPN20) instrument.

      V. To validate polymorphisms in FGD4, EPHA5, and FZD3 as predictors of peripheral neuropathy
      from treatment with a microtubule dynamics inhibitor (i.e., eribulin or paclitaxel).

      VI. To evaluate circulating nucleosomes and the apoptosis associated M30 neo-epitope as
      potential biomarkers associated with clinical benefit from treatment with eribulin
      specifically or the microtubule dynamics inhibitors in general.

      VII. To evaluate tubulin isotype expression, mutations, and signaling pathway modifications
      in tumor tissue as potential biomarkers associated with clinical benefit from treatment with
      eribulin specifically or the microtubule dynamics inhibitors in general.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and
      8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.

          -  Documentation of HER2 negative breast cancer at the time of protocol registration;
             (Note: HER2 negativity is defined as 0 or 1+ by immunohistochemistry OR nonamplified

             the basis of historic results on the breast primary or a metastatic site, whichever is
             most recent; repeat biopsies are not required for participation in this protocol)

          -  Known hormone receptor status at the time of protocol registration; (Note: estrogen
             receptor [ER] and/or progesterone receptor [PgR] status are considered positive with a
             cut-off of &gt;= 1% invasive tumor cells; status may be defined on the basis of historic
             results on the breast primary or a metastatic site, whichever is most recent; repeat
             biopsies are not required for participation in this protocol)

          -  Patients must demonstrate resolution of all toxicities related to prior chemotherapy,
             endocrine therapy, or biologic therapy to grade =&lt; 1, including peripheral neuropathy,

                  preplanned treatment, given concomitantly, sequentially or both, is considered
                  one regimen

               -  Planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is
                  considered one regimen

               -  If the dosing of one or more of the chemotherapy components of a regimen must be
                  reduced for toxicity, the modified version of the original regimen is not
                  considered a new regimen

               -  If one or more of the chemotherapy components of a regimen must be omitted for
                  toxicity, the modified version of the original regimen is not considered a new
                  regimen

               -  If one of the chemotherapy components of a regimen must be replaced with another
                  similar drug of the same therapeutic class, the modified version of the original
                  regimen is not considered a new regimen; however, if a new component, dissimilar
                  to any of the original components, is added to the regimen, the modified version
                  is considered a new regimen

               -  If chemotherapy is interrupted for surgery or radiotherapy and then continues
                  with an unchanged schedule and components, treatment is considered as one regimen
                  despite the interruption

          -  Prior treatment may include a taxane as per the following criteria:

               -  Prior taxane (including paclitaxel) in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is

             prior to randomization

          -  Prior treatment with an investigational agent is allowed but must have been completed
             &gt;= 28 days prior to randomization with resolution of all treatment-related toxicities
             to grade =&lt; 1.

             mediastinoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, skin biopsy, percutaneous needle biopsy,
             and routine dental procedures; as a precautionary measure, it is recommended, but not
             strictly required, that placement of a central venous access device, thoracentesis, or
             paracentesis be done 7 days before the initiation of protocol directed chemotherapy
             with documentation of adequate recovery from associated complications to grade =&lt; 1
