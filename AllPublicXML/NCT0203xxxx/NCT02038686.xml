      1. Introduction:

           Controversy exists with regard to whether to treat AO/OTA (Orthopaedic Trauma
           Association) 32.A2 - 32-A3 fractures of the proximal part of the femur with an
           intramedullary short PFN-A or long PFN-A. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial is
           performed to compare the outcome treatment of these unstable fractures of the proximal
           part of the femur with either a short PFN-A (170-240mm) or long PFN-A (300-420mm).

        2. Objectives and Hypothesis The hypothesis is that the Short PFN-A would have fewer
           complications than Long PFN-A

           Main Objective: Is defined as Total number of complications between PFN-A short and
           PFN-A long. Outcome measures were subdivided into preoperative, perioperative and
           post-operative. Follow up data at four weeks, three months and one year.

           Secondary objectives: Complete and uneventful radiological and clinical healing of the
           fracture. Revision operations (related to the failure of primary treatment) and
           mortality. Baseline characteristics were documented pre-operatively: Outcome measures
           were subdivided into intra-operative, post-operative and follow up data at four weeks,
           three months and one year.

        3. Methodology: One hundred and eighty eight patients presenting with an AO/OTA 31-A2 and
           31-A3 fracture of the proximal part of the femur will be randomized, at the time of the
           admission, to fixation with use either a short PFN-A or a long PFN-A.
