  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at better understanding the impact of ivacaftor upon insulin and incretin
      secretion and glucose tolerance in patients with Cystic Fibrosis with a glycine (G551D)
      mutation. Investigators hypothesize that treatment with ivacaftor improves insulin secretion
      in individuals with CF.

      Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) is associated with worse nutritional status, greater
      pulmonary function decline, and increased mortality, highlighting its relevance in Cystic
      Fibrosis (CF). CFRD arises primarily from compromised insulin secretion - traditionally
      considered a by-product of pancreatic exocrine tissue damage and fibrosis. Recent
      developments in the field of diabetes are propelling a re-examination of this basic
      explanation. The impact of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
      potentiator, ivacaftor, upon insulin secretion and glucose regulation has not been examined,
      but improved glucose tolerance has been appreciated anecdotally. This study aims to
      understand the impact of ivacaftor therapy upon blood glucose and insulin and incretin
      secretion.
