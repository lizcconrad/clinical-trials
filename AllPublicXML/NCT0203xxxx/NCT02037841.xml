  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and is responsible for large portion
      of pediatric admissions to Canadian hospitals. There is evidence that clinical pathways allow
      for optimal delivery of care and may result in decreased length of stay, leading to important
      economic benefits. Weaning of asthma medications prescribed for asthma exacerbation is not
      standardized in the current model of care. Currently, weaning is performed by ward
      physicians; in a teaching hospital, this most often done by residents staff. Differences in
      practice between different physicians, delays in patient assessment and adjustment of
      doctor's orders, likely prolong the hospital stay for children admitted with asthma.

      This study's main objective is to determine the effect of a nursing-driven clinical pathway
      on children's length of stay when admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of acute asthma
      exacerbation. The pathway will allow nurses to wean a specific type of
      medication(β2-agonist), as compared to the current standard of care, which dictates that a
      physician writes an order to wean the medication. Number of administered β2-agonist
      treatments will be compared between both groups, as well as asthma-related health care
      utilization within two weeks of hospital discharge. Nursing, physician, and patients'
      satisfaction with the pathway will be evaluated, and a cost minimization analysis will be
      performed.

      This study has the potential to improve resource use efficiency, increase patient safety by
      avoiding administration of unnecessary medications, and ameliorate quality of care by
      standardizing the care of children admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute asthma
      exacerbation. The results of the study will be disseminated across the Canadian Health Care
      System with the goal of improving outcomes of children admitted to hospitals with acute
      asthma exacerbations.

    <description>Children randomized to the intervention group will have their β2-agonist medication weaned by the nurse, according to the steps outlined in the clinical pathway. The nurse will ensure that the patient's family is booked for asthma teaching, and will also remind the physicians to fill out an asthma action plan on discharge. Detailed information as to when to contact physicians in the event of an acute deterioration of the patient is included in the clinical pathway.</description>
