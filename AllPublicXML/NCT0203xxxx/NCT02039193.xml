      Background: Psychotherapy is an effective treatment for generalized anxiety disorder in
      comparison to no-treatment controls. Instead of creating more and more new overall
      treatment-packets within a medical meta-model, a complementary approach to investigate
      clinical research designs may lie into the understanding of already effective
      psychotherapies. Treatment manuals and protocols allow a relatively high degree of freedom of
      therapists' behaviors on how to implement the overall treatment manuals. There is a lack of
      systematical knowledge of how therapists have to customize these overall protocols. The
      present design experimentally examines 3 types of conducting a 15 session time-limited
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol and its relation to the therapists' protocol
      adherence and treatment efficacy.

      Methods/design: This trial investigates 3 different types of how to customize a
      well-introduced CBT-protocol using dyadic peer tutoring methodology (primings). The
      individuals with GAD are randomly assigned to 3 priming conditions (resource priming vs.
      supportive resource priming vs. adherence priming). Participants' treatment allocation is
      performed randomly, therapist's assignment to the peer tutoring partner and the priming
      condition is based on mutual agreement. Treatment outcomes are assessed at following levels:
      Observer based in-session outcomes, post-session outcomes from session 1 to 15, treatment
      outcome at post assessment and at 6-months follow-up assessments.

      Aims of the trial. This trial investigates 3 different types of how to customize a
      well-introduced CBT-protocol (Zinbarg, Craske, &amp; Barlow, 2006) using dyadic peer tutoring
      methodology (primings). The participants are randomly assigned to 3 priming conditions: (a)
      Resource priming (Flückiger, Wüsten et al., 2010; Flückiger &amp; Grosse Holtforth, 2008a); (b)
      Supportive resource priming and (c) Adherence priming.

      The main research questions are:

        1. In-session outcomes. Using the videotapes, observer-based videoanalyses will be
           conducted: (a) Do the resource priming conditions show comparable observer-based
           therapist's adherence in comparison to the adherence priming condition (Zinbarg et al.,
           2007)? (b) Do the resource priming conditions show more resource activating micro
           interventions than the adherence priming condition (ROMA; Flückiger &amp; Grosse Holtforth,
           2008a/b)? (c) Are the in-session processes predictors and mediators of session and
           therapy outcomes (Flückiger et al., 2009; Flückiger et al., 2013)?

        2. Post-session outcomes. Are there differences in the post-session outcomes of the 3
           priming conditions? Furthermore: Are the post-session outcomes along with symptom change
           predictors and mediators of therapy outcome (Flückiger et al., 2009; Flückiger et al.,
           2012)?

        3. Treatment outcomes. Do show the resource priming conditions comparable efficacy on GAD
           outcomes, general outcomes and dropout rates in comparison to the adherence priming
           condition?

      Methods/Design. This study is a randomized controlled trial with three active treatment arms.
      This trial is conducted at the Swiss psychotherapy outpatient clinic from the Department of
      Psychology at the University of Zürich. The treatments are based on the same treatment
      protocol (Zinbarg et al., 2006). Overall, a 3 x 4 design with one between-subject factor
      (resource priming vs. supportive resource priming vs. problem priming) and one within-subject
      factor (time: pre, mid (session 6), post (session 14), 6-months follow-up).

      Participants. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Participants will be included in the study if
      they: (a) are 18 years or older; (b) agree to the informed consent, (c) have sufficient
      knowledge of German; and (d) fulfill the diagnostic criteria of GAD DSM-IV criteria.
      Participants will be excluded if they have: (a) a score of 2 or higher on the suicide item of
      the BDI and/or with active suicidal plans according to the diagnostic screening interview,
      (b) a current medication of psychotic or bipolar disorder, (c) a current treatment by a
      professional psychotherapist. Further, prescribed medications for anxiety or depressive
      disorders do not lead to exclusion if the dosage has remained constant for at least one
      month. The presence of a comorbidity does not result in exclusion if GAD is in the foreground
      according to the severity rating of the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-diagnoses.

      Recruitment. Participants will be recruited by means of advertisements in newspapers and
      through internet forums. The high-circulation newspapers are delivered for free in the Swiss
      public transport systems. Interested individuals in participation will contact the study
      office via SMS, e-mail or phone. Screened positive patients are invited for an intake
      assessment to verify the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on a standardized interview.
      Participants that are not screened positive are informed about more appropriate treatments
      via phone call or if requested by a further face-to-face contact.

      Randomization and treatment allocation. After meeting the inclusion criteria, patients are
      randomized to the 3 conditions (resource priming, supportive resource priming, adherence
      priming). Treatment allocation is performed randomly by online application of a full
      randomization. In this way, we aim to ensure that trial arms are balanced with respect to the
      patients' baseline characteristics. Randomization procedure is conducted by two independent
      research assistants. Because all patients are treated by the same CBT-manual, patients are
      blinded for the treatment allocation and are not informed about the randomization procedure.

      GAD treatment protocol. CBT-manual (Zinbarg et al., 2006): Traditional cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT) for GAD typically consists of psycho education of generalized anxiety disorder,
      relaxation training (RT), cognitive restructuring (CR) and with some in-vivo situational
      exposure for patients with overt behavioral avoidance (e.g., Barlow, Rapee, &amp; Brown, 1992;
      Borkovec &amp; Costello, 1993). Furthermore, imagery exposure as a GAD-specific form of in-sensu
      exposition will be applied to reduce experiential avoidance based on a well-introduced
      CBT-manual (Zinbarg et al., 2006). The manualized therapy follows an usual time-limited
      treatment format of 14 sessions to 50 minutes and a booster session after 6-months (total 15
      sessions).

      Tandem peer tutoring (priming).

      To investigate various types of how to conduct a standardized CBT-protocol, all therapists
      are tutored in peer dyads (tandem peer tutoring). Immediate before sessions 1 to 5, the
      therapists are required to contact the tandem-partner face-to-face or via self-phone to
      deliberate the forthcoming session by a 5 to 10 minute brief communication (primings; for a
      comparable procedure see Flückiger &amp; Grosse Holtforth, 2008). The tandem peer tutoring are
      grouped in three conditions:

        1. Resource priming: Immediately before sessions 1 to 5, therapists have a five-minute
           conversation about how to implement strengths-based micro-interventions in the
           forthcoming session. Strengths-based micro-interventions addresses therapists explicit
           focus on patients' preexisting strengths and abilities, subtle changes and improvements
           during therapy (potential recources) as well as motivational preparedness, readiness and
           goals (motivational resources; Grawe, 2006; Flückiger et al., 2010).

        2. Supportive resource priming: The supportive resource priming condition has the very same
           protocol as the resource priming condition (5 brief tandem peer tutorings). The only
           difference in the procedure is that the therapists are allowed to integrate a helpful
           significant person of the patients (such as the partners or the best friends) around
           session 1 and 7 to encourage and support the patient to realize their treatment plans
           (active integration of interpersonal resources). However, the integration of a
           significant other person does not touch the CBT-treatment protocol.

        3. Adherence priming: Immediately before sessions 1 to 5, therapists have a five-minute
           conversation about how to implement the disorderspecific interventions that are
           described in the treatment protocol. These communications are focused on therapists'
           understanding of patients GAD and the related comorbidities and how these issues can be
           addressed in the prescriptive treatment protocol.

      Therapists. Twelve advanced trainees with at least 2 years post-graduate training are
      recruited from local (CBT)-training centers. The majority of the therapists have experience
      as study therapists in a prior randomized controlled trial. All the therapists participate in
      an initial 16-hour workshop presented by the developer of the treatment manual (Zinbarg et
      al., 2006). In addition to the peer-tutorings (primings), the therapists have regular
      supervision in small groups on a 14-day basis. The supervision is conducted in mixed groups
      over the 3 priming conditions. All the supervisors also participate in the initial 16-hour
      workshop. To respect and coordinate the therapists' preferences (e.g. preferences in working
      days and time schedules) they were assigned in a joint face-to-face session at study start.
      All the therapists gave verbal and written consent to the selected peer-tutoring partner and
      priming condition.

      Assessments. At intake, GAD-diagnosis and its core symptomatology are identified according to
      the structured interview section for GAD (DIPS; Margraf, Schneider, &amp; Ehlers, 1994).
      Furthermore, GAD-criteria are assessed by self-reports. The individual worries are identified
      using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and the Worry Domain Questionnaire (WDQ).
      Mental disorders on Axis I are assessed using face-to-face diagnostic interviews for Axis I
      (Diagnostisches Interview für Psychische Störungen für DSM-IV, SCID-I) and for Axis II
      (Strukturiertes Klinisches Interview für DSM-IV, Achse-II, Persönlichkeitsstörungen, SKID-II;
      Wittchen, Zaudig, &amp; Fydrich, 1997).

      PSWQ, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the State-Trait Anxiety (STAI) are used as
      GAD-outcomes. Premature termination from the trial, the interpersonal problems and strengths
      inventories, the behavioral inhibition and activation scale, as well as the resource
      potential questionnaire are used as general outcomes. The outcome measures are taken at
      intake, directly after session 6 (end of primings), session 14 (post-assessment), and at 6-
      month follow-up.

      The following process measures are examined: (a) Post-session reports (Flückiger et al.,
      2010), working alliance (Munder et al., 2009) and symptom change (BAI) are conducted from
      session 1 to 15 and (b) In-session processes: Using the recorded videotapes, adherence
      ratings (Zinbarg et al., 2007), the Resource-Oriented Microprocess Analysis (ROMA-P/T,
      Flückiger &amp; Grosse Holtforth, 2008) and the level of explication scale (Sachse, 1992) are
      conducted at session 2, 5 and 8.

      Study from the participants view. After contaciting the study administration, the
      participant's information contained a precise description of the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, the structure of the treatment manual as well as the data collection procedure
      including the video recordings. Confidentiality of the collected data is confirmed.
      Volontarines of participation is emphasized by the opportunity to terminate the treatment at
      every timepoint during treatment and the cancelation of all conducted data. Furthermore, an
      insurance for possible negative outcomes of clinical trials is contracted.

      Statistical Analysis. In order to handle the hierarchical data structures (sessions at Level
      1 nested within patients at Level 2 and therapists at Level 3), hierarchical linear model
      (HLM) with time as a within-groups factor and treatment condition as a between-groups factor
      will be used for the main research questions. The analyses will be conducted on the
      intention-to-treat sample as well as on the completer sample. To investigate if possible
      patients' and therapists' effects have an impact to the therapy outcomes, patients' and
      therapists' pretreatment characteristics are investigated as outcome predictors at Level 2
      and 3. Clinical significance will be defined as (a) a statistically reliable change according
      to the Reliable Change Index (RCI), and (b) being within two standard deviations of a
      nonclinical group at post-assessment or follow-up (Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991). All the analyses
      will be run by HLM and R packet.

      Sample size. Based on a power analysis with G*Power the optimal sample size with an
      Alpha-error of 5 %, and a Beta-error of 80% as well as a correlation coefficient of r = .30
      of the repeated assessments are 60 participants, i.e. 20 participants in each priming
      condition.
