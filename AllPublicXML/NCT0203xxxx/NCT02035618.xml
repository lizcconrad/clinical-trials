      Manual therapy combined with a protocol of therapeutic exercises will increase the beneficial
      effects on scapular kinematics, myofascial pain and function in subjects with shoulder
      impingement when compared to exercises only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  history of non-traumatic onset of shoulder pain;

          -  painful arc during active elevation of the arm;

          -  one or more positive shoulder impingement tests (Neer, Hawkins and Jobe), or pain
             during passive or resisted external rotation of the arm at 90° of abduction;

          -  pain with palpation of the rotator cuff tendons;

          -  all subjects need also to be able to reach 150° of arm elevation as evaluated by
             visual observation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  limitation of glenohumeral internal and external rotation as indicative of adhesive
             capsulitis;

          -  body mass index &gt; 28kg/m2 as the amount of subcutaneous tissue can compromise the
             quality of the signal increasing soft tissue artifact;

          -  numbness or tingling of the upper limb reproduced by cervical compression test;

          -  history of clavicle, scapula or humerus fracture;

          -  history of rotator cuff surgery;

          -  systemic illnesses;

          -  positive sulcus or apprehension tests as indicative of instability;

          -  positive drop arm test as indicative of full thickness tear;

          -  corticosteroid injection within 3 months prior to intervention, or physiotherapy
             within 6 months prior to intervention;

          -  depressive symptoms as evaluated by the Beck Depression Inventory score ( &gt; 9 points)
             due to its influence on myofascial pain;

          -  allergy to tape.
