    <textblock>
      The goal of study is to develop and test a parenting-focused version of mindfulness
      intervention (&quot;Parenting Mindfully&quot;) to reduce parent stress and prevent adolescent substance
      use and HIV risk behaviors (e.g., risky sex). The investigators hypothesize that Parenting
      Mindfully (PM) will decrease prevent adolescent substance use and HIV risk behaviors and
      intentions. Secondarily, PM will improve parenting, and decrease adolescent stress responses.
