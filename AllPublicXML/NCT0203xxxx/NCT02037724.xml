  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consequences of iron deficiency anemia in women are enormous, and especially in
      developing countries, as the condition adversely affects both their productive and
      reproductive capabilities. The study seeks to: 1) compare changes in iron status indicators
      among women receiving an iron-rich organic food supplement versus ferrous sulfate supplement,
      and 2) determine the suitable level of food supplement needed to prevent/reduce iron
      deficiency anemia among women in developing country settings.

      A double-blind, randomized, controlled, intervention trial will be implemented in women of
      childbearing age, 60 women with iron deficiency anemia and 60 women with iron deficiency.
      After screening potential subjects (up to 500 expected), approximately 30 will be recruited
      into each of four study groups; assuming 30% dropout rate, to detect an increase of 30% in
      ferritin as significant between the two time points at 80% power and alpha value of 0.05.
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into the four groups consisting
      of: 2 control groups (daily 60mg ferrous sulfate (FS-60) or daily 10mg ferrous sulfate
      (FS-10)), and 2 test groups (daily 60mg iron-rich supplement (IRS-60) or 10mg iron-rich
      supplement (IRS-10)). Subjects will take daily FS-60 and IRS-60 under supervision for 8 weeks
      while subjects taking FS-10 and IRS-10 will take the supplement under supervision for 12
      consecutive weeks.

      The design will involve screening of about 500 female adult students and staff of the
      University of Ghana who meet initial the inclusion criteria. Screening will involve pregnancy
      testing, assessment of hemoglobin, and ferritin and also administration of a health history
      questionnaire.

      Thereafter, 120 eligible subjects will enrolled and randomized to recieve the treatment. All
      subjects will complete 3-day dietary record (including 2 weekdays and 1 weekend) at baseline
      and at endline (i.e. one week prior to treatment completion). The dietary data will be
      analyzed using nationally-generated food composition tables together with the ESHA food
      processor software. In addition, body weight and height will be measured using standard
      methods at baseline and end of the study. Weekly monitoring of side effects will be recorded.
      Fasting blood samples will be collected at baseline and endline to enable determination of
      anemia status and other indicators including serum ferritin, transferrin receptor and full
      blood count, together with C-reactive protein.

    <description>We expect to have less side effects with IRS compared with ferrous sulfate (as observed in previous studies) that include: constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, gastrointestinal distress, change in stool color and others. We will assess these with a questionnaire.</description>
