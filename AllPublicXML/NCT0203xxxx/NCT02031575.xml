  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Study on Mhealth and Reproductive Health in Teens (SMART) is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of using text messages to improve the knowledge, communication, and
      attitudes about reproductive health among female adolescents in Greater Accra senior high
      schools. Previous research as well as qualitative work conducted by the Investigators shows
      that there are significant gaps in knowledge about reproductive health including on topics of
      pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and contraception among secondary school students
      in Greater Accra. These gaps contribute to unwanted pregnancy and spread of sexually
      transmitted diseases. At the same time, phone ownership and use among young people has spread
      rapidly, especially in urban areas such as Accra. The Study on Mhealth and Reproductive
      Health (SMART) will seek to use mobile phone messages to increase awareness of these
      reproductive health issues among female adolescents in Accra. The objectives of SMART are to
      evaluate whether the messages can increase knowledge, increase communication, and improve
      attitudes towards reproductive health among adolescents in Greater Accra. By conducting a
      randomized controlled trial, we will be able to statistically evaluate if the messages have
      had any effect on improving outcomes for adolescents in the areas of knowledge,
      communication, and attitudes. This work can help guide future programs that can scale up this
      intervention and ultimately improve the health and wellbeing of adolescents across Ghana.
