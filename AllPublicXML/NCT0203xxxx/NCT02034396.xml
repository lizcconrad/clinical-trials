  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no standard approach for the treatment of patients with venous stasis
      ulcers, and no means of accounting for the genetic factors that may contribute to a patient's
      response to different therapeutic interventions. In order to determine whether, or to what
      extent, genetic profiling of venous stasis ulcers can stratify patients according to their
      potential for disease progression or healing, and guide preventive strategies and levels of
      therapeutic interventions, the study will involve retrospective genetic profiling of patients
      with a healed or persistent venous stasis ulcer as a means of determining the efficacy of
      current therapies, and to establish a future prospective evaluation of treatment algorithms
      based on genetic phenotype and variation. Results obtained from the 2 aforementioned groups
      of participants will be compared with those of a control group of participants who have no
      history of venous ulcer nor peripheral vascular disease.

      A blood specimen will be drawn, medical and medication history taken, and wound/s will be
      assessed and followed for 2 years in regard to the enrollees w/active venous ulcer/s or
      healed venous ulcer/s.

      A venous duplex ultrasound of right and left lower extremities will be done at no cost, a
      blood specimen will be drawn, and medical and medication history will be taken in regard to
      control group enrollees.
