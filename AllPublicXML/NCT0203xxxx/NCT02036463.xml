  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease for which no
      curative treatment has yet been identified, making it important to slow progression and
      improve the quality of life among affected boys and young men. Treatment with corticosteroids
      is standard of care for patients with DMD five years old and older, due to the robust
      observation that this intervention lengthens the interval prior to loss of ambulation but is
      associated with many side effects. This clinical trial will be conducted in the youngest age
      group able to receive corticosteroids orally and on whom study outcomes are measurable, ages
      3 to 7 years. This is a randomized, double blinded, double masked, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial that will explore whether better synchronization of corticosteroid
      administration with the circadian rhythm will provide improved tolerability and at least
      comparable efficacy to current standards in which corticosteroids are always given in the
      morning. Furthermore, the trial provides a unique opportunity to rigorously evaluate
      corticosteroid effects in the young DMD patient, both for efficacy as compared to placebo and
      as a study of the impact of corticosteroid chronotherapy, or delayed release, on increased
      tolerability over standard therapy. The main hypothesis is that synchronization of the timing
      of corticosteroid dosing will improve medication tolerability in children, while maintaining
      (non-inferiority) the efficacy of corticosteroid. The study also offers a unique opportunity
      to measure several biomarkers as well as novel genetic modifiers that may further impact the
      response to corticosteroid in DMD.

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will measure safety and tolerability by tabulating number of adverse events occuring in patients in each treatment group. Adverse events are specified in the protocol and relate to excess weight gain, inadequate linear growth, elevated blood pressure, worsening scores on behavior scales, declining heart rate variability and abnormalities of circadian rhythm of sympathetic tone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to walk/run 50 meters</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test will measure the time it will take to run/walk 50 meters. It has not been typically used in clinical trials as a timed test measure, however, may be a more sensitive test measure in the very young cohort to assess functional strength as it measures a longer distance to run compared to the 10 meter walk. Preliminary analysis in a small pilot cohort indicates that it is better correlated with other functional assessments such as the North Star Ambulatory Assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NSAA is a clinician rated 17-item functional scale originally designed for ambulant boys with DMD who are able to ambulate at least 10 meters. This evaluation tool assesses functional activities including standing, getting up from the floor, negotiating steps, hopping, and running. The assessment is based on a 3-point rating scale of 2= ability to perform the test normally, 1= modified method or assistance to perform test, 0=unable to perform the test. Thus, total score can range from 0 (completely non-ambulant) to 34 (no impairment) on these assessments. NSAA has shown good reliability and validity in multi-center studies as well as good clinical validity demonstrated with Rasch analysis.</description>
