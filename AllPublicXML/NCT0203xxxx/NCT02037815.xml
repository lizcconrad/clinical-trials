  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osmotherapy has been used as the medical treatment for brain edema and intracranial
      hypertension in critically brain injured patients. Measurement of serum osmolality during
      osmotherapy is of clinical importance to determine clinical efficacy, adjust dosage and avoid
      side effect. Serum osmolality is often measured in laboratory by cryoscopic technique as the
      reference method. However, in clinical setting, routine measurement of serum osmolality is
      not feasible at bedside, either in intensive care unit (ICU) or neurosurgical ward.
      Therefore, clinicians usually estimate serum osmolality by using equations derived from serum
      osmoles that can be measured by bedside blood gas analysis or routine laboratory chemical
      analysis, such as sodium, potassium, urea, and glucose. In present study, mannitol or
      hypertonic saline will be used in patients after craniotomy, and serum osmolality will be
      measured before and during drug infusion. Investigators hypothesize that the correlation of
      measured and calculated serum osmolality is better during infusion of hypertonic saline than
      mannitol.
