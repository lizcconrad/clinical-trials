      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the general anesthesia immunosuppressive
      could effect hepatitis B Virus replication

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The change of immune state can influence HBV replication or elimination, it has been reported
      that a certain degree of immunosuppression occured after general anesthesia. In this study we
      detect the cytotoxic T lymphocyte(CTL) count and activity, interferon-γ(IFN-γ) and HBV-DNA
      content form the HBV patient who will accept general anesthesia. Our purpose is to evaluate
      the influence of general anesthesia immunosuppressive on HBV replication. If the results show
      that HBV-DNA quantity increases, so the patients might be given anti-HBV drugs or immune
      enhancer; otherwise it is indicated the general anesthesia immunosuppressive don't influence
      HBV replication.
