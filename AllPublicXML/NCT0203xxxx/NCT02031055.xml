    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in patients with advanced solid tumors, the mass
      balance of FTD and TPI after a single dose of TAS-102 with a light tracer dose of [14C]FTD or
      [14C]TPI.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study evaluating the mass balance of FTD and TPI after a single
      dose of TAS-102 with a light tracer dose of [14C]FTD or [14C]TPI. The study will be conducted
      in 2 parts: mass balance part and TAS-102 extension part. After completion of the mass
      balance part, patients will receive continued treatment with TAS-102 during the study
      extension part.
