    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic, and standard curative
             measures or other therapy that may provide clinical benefit do not exist or are no
             longer effective.

          -  For Veliparib monotherapy (must have tumor with defects in DNA repair mechanisms (BRCA
             mutation or high grade ovarian cancer or solid tumors for combination therapy.

          -  If the subject has known brain metastases must have clinically controlled neurologic
             symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 21 days of
             stable neurologic function and no evidence of Central Nervous System (CNS) disease
             progression as determined by comparing a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed during screening to a prior scan performed at
             least 4 weeks earlier and provided that the subject is asymptomatic, has no evidence
             of cavitation or hemorrhage, and does not require corticosteroids (must have
             discontinued steroids at least 3 months prior to study drug administration).

          -  Subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function per local
             laboratory reference range.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical condition(s)
             including but not limited to:

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder, including focal or generalized seizure within the last
             12 months;

          -  Uncontrolled nausea/vomiting/diarrhea;

          -  Active uncontrolled infection;

          -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure;

          -  Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia;

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study
             requirements;

          -  Any medical condition, which in the opinion of the study investigator, places the
             subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.

          -  Subjects who have hypersensitivity to Carboplatin, Paclitaxel or Cremophor should be
             excluded from arm B.

          -  Subject has received any of the following anti-cancer therapies 21 days prior to the
             first dose of study drug or a biologic agent for anti-neoplastic intent within 30 days
             prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Subject who requires parenteral nutrition, tube feeding or has evidence of a partial
             bowel obstruction or perforation within 28 days prior to study drug.

          -  The subject has had another active malignancy within the past 3 years except for any
             cancer in situ that the Principal Investigator considers to be cured.
