    <textblock>
      The purpose of the RESPOND post market study is to collect real world clinical and device
      performance outcomes data with the Lotus Valve System used in routine clinical practice to
      demonstrate that the commercially available Lotus Valve System is a safe and effective
      treatment for patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis.

      The RESPOND study is a prospective, open label, single arm, multi-center, observational post
      market study designed to collect real world clinical and device performance outcomes data of
      the commercially available Lotus Valve used in routine clinical practice for the treatment of
      severe calcific aortic stenosis. Approximately 1000 real-world, consecutive subjects will be
      enrolled at up to 50 study centers in Europe, Asia Pacific and Central/South America.

      All enrolled subjects will be contacted for follow-up at 30 days, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post
      index valve implantation. Follow-up visit at 1 year post valve implantation should be
      conducted via outpatient clinic visit. Follow-up visits at 30 days and 2 through 5 years may
      be conducted in person (preferred) and via telephone interview. Subjects who are not
      implanted with a Lotus Valve will be followed for safety through 30 days after the initial
      attempted index procedure.

      Collection of safety events will include any serious adverse event (SAE) that led to death,
      serious adverse device effect (SADE), adverse device effect (ADE), unanticipated serious
      adverse device effect (USADE), and all Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) events
      regardless of seriousness and device relationship through 5 year follow-up.

      The RESPOND study will be conducted in accordance with the International Organization for
      Standardization (ISO) 14155: 2011; ethical principles that have their origins in the
      Declaration of Helsinki; the relevant parts of the International Conference on Harmonization
      (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practices (GCP); and pertinent individual
      country/state/local laws and regulations.

      An additional cohort of approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled at up to 6 study centers
      in Europe after enrollment in the main cohort is completed to assess center-driven
      implantation technique with the commercially available Lotus Valve with Depth Guard
      technology.
