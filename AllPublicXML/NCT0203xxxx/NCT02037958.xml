  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesise that the use of the LMA-Supreme provides greater ease of insertion and reduced
      haemodynamic variability during insertion compared to the tracheal tube, whilst still
      maintaining a patent airway to facilitate elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in selected
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme(LMA-S) has been used successfully to maintain a patent
      airway for laparoscopic surgery. Our study compares the use of LMA-S with that of the
      tracheal tube (ETT) with respect to the ease of insertion and potential haemodynamic
      disturbance during insertion.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Number of attempts needed for successful placement of gastric tube. Correct gastric tube placement was determined by positive suctioning of gastric contents or detection of injected air with epigastric auscultation.</description>

    <description>Patients were asked about the presence of sore throat - defined as the presence of constant pain in the throat, independent of swallowing, 1 hr after the end of surgery. No further follow-up.</description>
