          5. Patients who are naive or experienced to 1 or more TNF antagonists (infliximab,
             adalimumab, or certolizumab pegol) at a dose approved for Crohn's Disease.TNF
             antagonist experienced patients may have stopped anti-TNF treatment due to primary or
             secondary non-responsiveness, intolerance or for other reasons.

             Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1
             year postmenopause), that, if sexually active agree to use one of the appropriate
             medically accepted methods of birth control in addition to the consistent and correct
             use of a condom from date of screening until 15 weeks after last administration of

             syndrome, or any other manifestation that might require surgery, could preclude the
             use of the CDAI to assess response to therapy, or would possibly confound the
             evaluation of benefit from treatment with BI 655066.

          2. Have any current or prior abscesses, unless they have been drained and treated at
