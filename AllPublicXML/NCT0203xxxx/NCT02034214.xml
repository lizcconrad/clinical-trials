      The SHAZ! study was a randomized trial that compared a package of life skills education,
      reproductive health care services, and economic livelihood development to a control package
      of life skills education and reproductive health care services alone. SHAZ! enrolled young
      women 16 to 19 years old who had been orphaned and who were currently out of school and not
      infected with HIV. Individuals participated in the project for up to two years.

    <description>The life skills curriculum drew upon Stepping Stones and CDC-Zimbabwe Talk Time, developed with input from the target population. It consisted of 14 modules delivered to groups of 25 over 4-6 weeks on: HIV/STI and reproductive health; relationship negotiation; strategies to avoid violence;and identification of safe and risky places in the community. Participants also attended a six-weeks-long home-based care training conducted through Red Cross Zimbabwe, to gain skills on safely caring for people living with HIV.</description>

    <description>All participants were provided a health screening at every study visit and were treated for treatable STIs and minor ailments. They received condoms, and contraceptive pills or injectable free upon request. Participants who tested positive for HIV were referred to local clinics, where the study team assisted with ART registration including payment for CD4 tests required for enrolment.</description>

    <description>The Livelihoods intervention consisted of financial literacy and a choice of vocational training at local training institutes. Courses were 6-months-long, conducted in English, with a practical and a theoretical component. In spite of encouragement to venture outside of accepted gender norms, the most popular courses were hairdressing, garment-making, and receptionist/secretarial and nurse-aid training. Participants who passed developed business plans that were supported with a micro-grant valued at $100US in the form of capital equipment, supplies or additional training.</description>
