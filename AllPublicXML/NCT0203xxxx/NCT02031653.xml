    <textblock>
      To provide evidence of promising tests to noninvasively diagnose bladder outlet obstruction
      (BOO) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

        1. Penile cuff test provides a means of obtaining a urodynamic diagnosis with a high level
           of accuracy without the morbidity and expense of invasive Pressure flow study.

        2. Penile cuff test may be particularly useful in the counseling of patients prior to
           benign prostatic hyperplasia operation. Patients diagnosed as obstructed following a
           penile cuff test can be reassured that surgery has a high chance of resulting in
           symptomatic benefit
