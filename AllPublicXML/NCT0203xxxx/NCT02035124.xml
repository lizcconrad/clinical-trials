  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there have been advances in the treatment of patients with metastatic
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), all patients eventually develop resistance to
      available therapy. Docetaxel is the accepted first-line agent followed by cabazitaxel in the
      post-docetaxel phase. In this study the investigators propose to evaluate BKM120, a PI3K
      inhibitor, with cabazitaxel in the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts. In a lead-in cohort, the feasibility and safety of
      administering BKM120 with a standard dose of cabazitaxel will be assessed. If safety is
      confirmed, a subsequent Phase II portion will assess the activity of the combination in
      patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel. The treatment will consist of 3-week
      (21-day) cycles.

      The ultimate purpose of this study will be to determine progression-free survival, response
      rate, disease control rate and overall survival of patients treated with the combination
      regimen and compare outcomes to historical results with single-agent cabazitaxel.
