      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of Somnarus diagnostic technology for
      diagnosis of sleep apnea in human subjects. This includes evaluation of Somnarus technology
      in Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Central Sleep Apnea (CSA), including Cheyne - Stokes
      respiration (CSR).
