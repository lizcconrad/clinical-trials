    <textblock>
      Background: Non-specific shoulder pain has a high prevalence in older adults and provokes
      functional alterations. Besides, there are difficulties for its clinical diagnosis, lack of
      effectiveness in the treatment and not much evidence is found regarding invasive physical
      therapy techniques in this population.

      Purpose: To determine the efficacy of a single physical therapy intervention with deep dry
      needling on latent and active myofascial trigger points in older adults with non-specific
      shoulder pain.

      Methods: Pilot Study, Single Blind Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial on 60 subjects aged
      65 and over, will be diagnosed with nonspecific shoulder pain. The study will be approved by
      the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the area. Sample will be recruited at their home
      and at a care center, and randomly will be distributed in Experimental Group (n=30), which
      will be received a session of Deep Dry Needling on an active and a latent Myofascial Trigger
      Points of the infraspinatus muscle; and Control Group (n=30), receiving a session of Deep Dry
      Needling only on an active Myofascial Trigger Point. A blind examiner will be evaluated Pain
      Intensity, Pain Pressure Threshold (anterior deltoid; extensor carpi radialis brevis) and
      Grip Strength, before, immediately after intervention and after a week of treatment.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Pain Intensity on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at 5 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity was measured with the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of 11 points (interval of 0-10), where 0 corresponds to no pain and 10 corresponds to the worst pain imaginable. In order to show a parametric analysis of the obtained data, a graphical representation of 11 spaces describes levels for the discrimination of the patient. The subjects will be asked to determine the subjective pain intensity of the painful shoulder using a finger.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Pain Pressure Threshold of anterior deltoid at 5 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) will be measured with a WAGNER FDK/FDN Series Force Dial Fisher type analogue algometer (Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, USA) which varies between 0-10 kg/cm2. After indicating the most hyperalgesic latent Myofascial Trigger Point (MTrP) of anterior deltoid muscle (located in referred pain area and with the same C5-6 segmentary innervation levels), examiner will determine PPT of such point.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum grip strength, defined as the maximum isometric muscular force in kg used in the manual pressure of a hydraulic dynamometer, will be measured with a JAMAR type hydraulic manual analogical dynamometer with an interval of 0-90kg to objectify the weakness of latent Myofascial Trigger Points (MTrPs) of the forearm. According to the fatigability of older adults, a single measurement will be performed to measure the manual grip strength.</description>
