      The primary objectives of this trial are:

        -  to show differences in the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with the bacteria
           Bifidobacterium sp. between infants born by normal or caesarean delivery, fed with the
           test or a control product

        -  to investigate whether there is equivalence in growth between the four different groups
           of infant described above.

      The primary objectives of this trial are:

        -  to show differences in the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with the bacteria
           Bifidobacterium sp. between infants born by normal or caesarean delivery, fed with the
           test or a control product

        -  to investigate whether there is equivalence in growth between the four different groups
           of infant described above.

      Design:

      This is a controlled, double blind, randomized, multi center, clinical trial of 4 groups in
      parallel.

      Two groups of infants (born from normal or caesarean delivery) will each consume one of 2
      milk formulae.

      Number of patients (to be enrolled / to be analyzed): Approximately 450 / 240 Stratification
      will be done by gender and delivery mode.

      Description of subjects and main criteria for inclusion:

      Healthy full term infants born from HIV positive mothers who have elected to feed their child
      exclusively with a milk formula from birth. Children born after normal or caesarean delivery
      will be considered separately.

  <why_stopped>
    South African Health Authorities now promote that HIV positive mothers should receive
    anti-retroviral drugs and breastfeed their infants.
