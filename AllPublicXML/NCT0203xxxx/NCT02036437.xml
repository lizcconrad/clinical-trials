      To test the safety and efficacy of titrated oral misoprostol compared to vaginal dinoprostone
      for labor induction.

  <detailed_description>

      -  There are many indications for induction of labor in the obstetric practice, of which
           prolonged gestational age stands as the most common indication. It is well recognized
           that with an unripe cervix, induction may be difficult and often unsuccessful. The use
           of an agent to ripen the cervix prior to induction is acceptable in the modern practice.

        -  Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is the most interesting alternative to
           Dinoprostone because of its effectiveness, low cost, and temperature stability. It
           ripens the cervix by inducing regular uterine contractions. However, it is associated
           with several adverse effects especially uterine hyperstimulation, which is painful and
           may result in fetal compromise.

        -  Testing the efficacy and safety of titrated oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone
           may develop a new safe and effective method for labor induction.

    <description>A dose of 20ug is required obtained by dissolving the 200ug tablet (Misotac® Sigma Pharmaceutical Industries) in 200 ml water (1ug per ml), the solution is shaked well before each administration. The solution will be orally administrated every two hours (max. 12 hrs) until adequate uterine contractions obtained (3 per 10 minutes each lasting 40-60 seconds) and then stopped. The initial dose will be increased to 40 ml (40ug) after two doses if there are no contractions. The timing and strength of contractions will be assessed by abdominal palpation. If the contractions are inadequate, augmentation of the active phase of labor will be attempted by hourly-titrated oral misoprostol (20 ml) +/- amniotomy.</description>
