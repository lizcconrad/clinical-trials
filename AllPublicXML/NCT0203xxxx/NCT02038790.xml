  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare overall patient preference for either
      Suboxone® sublingual film 8/2 or Zubsolv® sublingual tablets 5.7/1.4. Suboxone sublingual
      film 8/2 contains 8mg buprenorphine and 2mg naloxone. Zubsolv sublingual tablets contain 5.7
      mg buprenorphine and 1.4 mg naloxone. Both interventions act as a substitute for opiate drugs
      like heroin, morphine or oxycodone and help withdrawal from opiate drugs over a period of
      time.
