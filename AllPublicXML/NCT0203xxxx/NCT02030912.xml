    <textblock>
      A randomised, open labelled study design is selected in order to determine the emergence and
      persistence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in humans and on the composition of the
      indigenous microbiotas at various body sites. These will involve the administration to
      volunteers of minocycline and amoxicillin- a control group will receive a placebo.
      Microbiology of the skin, saliva, faecal, skin and nasal micro flora, safety and adverse
      events, vital signs, will be evaluated. The objectives of metagenomic analysis are:

        -  To identify the in vivo molecular mechanisms responsible for antibiotic resistance and
           its transfer in the indigenous oral and faecal microbiotas using metagenomics resistome
           analysis.

        -  To determine the impact of the use of antimicrobial agents on the oral resistome

        -  To determine the impact of the use of antimicrobial agents on the faecal resistome

        -  To determine the ecological impact of the use of antimicrobial agents on the relative
           abundance of phylotypes of the indigenous oral microbiota

          1. Men and women aged between 18 and 40 years.

          2. Following verbal &amp; written information about the trial, the subject has signed &amp; dated
             informed consent before any study related activity was carried out.

          3. Subject legally competent and able to communicate effectively with the study personnel

          4. Normal finding in the medical history and physical examination, unless the
             investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically irrelevant.

          5. Male or female subjects who are using a medically acceptable method of contraception
             or of non-childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterile-bilateral tubal ligation or

             postmenopausal for at least one year with a Screening FSH leveâ‰¥l 40 mIU/L). - - A
             negative serum pregnancy test is required at Screening for females.
