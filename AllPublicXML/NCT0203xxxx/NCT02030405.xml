  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 trial studies how well ixazomib(MLN9708) works in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Determine the best response including complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete recovery
      (CRi), and partial remission (PR) after 3 cycles of treatment with MLN9708 (ixazomib) in
      patients with nucleophosmin (NPM)1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (following the
      LeukemiaNet1 guidelines for response criteria).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the duration of remission in all responders after treatment with MLN9708
           defined as the time of documented remission until relapse.

        -  Determine the 1 year overall survival, which will be measured from time of study entry
           to the earlier of death from any cause or end of follow up at 1 year.

        -  Establish toxicity and tolerability of MLN9708 treatment in AML, including
           non-hematologic toxicities grade 3 or above as specified by Common Terminology Criteria
           for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>Overall response rate after 3 cycles of treatment (9 weeks) was assessed as complete remission (CR); CR with incomplete recovery (CRi); and partial remission (PR) with MLN9708, in patients with NPM1-mutated AML by LeukemiaNet1 guidelines:
CR is defined as either a full CR, or a CR with incomplete recovery. Although achievement of CR has unique clinical significance for improved overall survival and relapsed free survival compared to achievement of CR with incomplete platelet recovery, the latter is still a clinically meaningful response, as it is independently superior to resistant disease. Partial remission (PR) is defined as meeting all hematologic criteria for CR with an allowance for 5% to 25% bone marrow blasts or decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%. Stable disease is defined as a change in bone marrow aspirate blast count within 10% of baseline. Relapsed disease is defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or bone marrow blasts</description>

        <description>Overall response rate after 3 cycles of treatment (9 weeks) was assessed as complete remission (CR); CR with incomplete recovery (CRi); and partial remission (PR) with MLN9708, in patients with NPM1-mutated AML by LeukemiaNet1 guidelines:
CR is defined as either a full CR, or a CR with incomplete recovery. Although achievement of CR has unique clinical significance for improved overall survival and relapsed free survival compared to achievement of CR with incomplete platelet recovery, the latter is still a clinically meaningful response, as it is independently superior to resistant disease. Partial remission (PR) is defined as meeting all hematologic criteria for CR with an allowance for 5% to 25% bone marrow blasts or decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%. Stable disease is defined as a change in bone marrow aspirate blast count within 10% of baseline. Relapsed disease is defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or bone marrow blasts</description>
