  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose
      dexamethasone in participants with refractory or relapsed and refractory Multiple Myeloma
      (rrMM), and in combination with carfilzomib and low-dose dexamethasone in participants with
      relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma (rMM).

      This study is being done to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose
      (MAD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      pembrolizumab when given in combination with standard of care (SOC) treatments in
      participants with rrMM or rMM. Preliminary efficacy data will also be assessed. The primary
      study hypothesis is that these combinations are sufficiently well tolerated to permit further
      clinical investigation.

      On 03-Jul-2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) placed Cohort 1 of
      this protocol on clinical hold based on safety data from two other pembrolizumab protocols:
      MK-2375-183 (NCT02576977) and MK-3475-185 (NCT02579863) presented to the Data Monitoring
      Committee.

      On 15-Sep-2017, the US FDA placed Cohort 2 of this study on partial clinical hold. Enrollment
      has been stopped and will not be reopened. Participants who are deriving clinical benefit
      will be allowed to continue receiving study treatment until protocol-specific end of
      treatment, and then progress into long term safety and survival follow up. Participants who
      are not deriving clinical benefit, must stop study treatment and move into the long term
      safety and survival follow up.
