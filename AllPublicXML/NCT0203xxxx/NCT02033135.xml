    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical study is intended to evaluate the use of Zilver PTX stents for
      treatment of thigh atherosclerosis.

      Research question: Is there an adjuvant benefit of angioplasty and stenting using the new
      paclitaxel eluting stent, Zilver-PTX, over risk factor modification and medical therapy alone
      in patients with stable, mild to moderate intermittent claudication caused by femoropopliteal
      lesions suitable for endovascular management.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has signed and dated the informed consent.

          -  Patient has 1- 2 documented stenotic or occluded atherosclerotic lesions (up to 18 cm
             long) of the above-the-knee femoropopliteal artery, that meet all of the inclusion
             criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

          -  Reference vessel (the above-the-knee femoropopliteal artery) diameter of 4 mm to 9 mm.

          -  Taget lesion(s) should be accessible for stenting, as imaged with angiography (digital
             subtraction, MRI or CTI), i.e. proximal cm of SFA must be open

          -  Patient has a de novo or restenotic lesion(s) with &gt;50% stenosis documented
             angiographically and no prior stent in the target lesion.

          -  Patient has symptoms of peripheral arterial disease classified as Rutherford Category
             2 (moderate claudication) or 3 (severe claudication) lasting for at least 3 months.
             (Positive Claudication Questionnaire)

          -  Exercise therapy, smoking cessation advise and best medical therapy must have been
             implemented at least 3 months ago and without significant clinical effect.

          -  Patient has a resting ABI &lt;0.9 or an abnormal exercise ABI (decrease of more than
             0.15) if resting ABI is normal. Patient with incompressible arteries (ABI &gt;1.2) must
             have a TBI &lt;0.8.

          -  Patient agrees to return for a clinical status assessment and duplex ultrasound at 6
             weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and at 24 months.

             study.

          -  Patient has any planned surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days after the
             study procedure.

          -  Patient in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated.

             medication, contrast dye, paclitaxel or nitinol.

          -  Patient 2-3 patent crural vessel runoff with &lt;50% stenosis throughout its course.

          -  Activity limited by co-morbid condition other than claudication, for example: severe
             coronary artery disease; angina pectoris; chronic lung disease; neurological disorder
             such as hemiparesis; arthritis, or other musculoskeletal conditions including
             amputation and BMI &gt; 40

          -  Other active significant medical problems such as cancer, known chronic renal disease
             (serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl within 60 days or renal replacement therapy),
             known chronic liver disease or anaemia, active substance abuse, or known history of
             dementia
