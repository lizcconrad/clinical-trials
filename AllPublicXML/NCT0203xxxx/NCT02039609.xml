  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the post-genomic era, a major challenge for health research is to understand the complex
      interactions among genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors including dietary intake.
      Unfortunately, such initiatives are hampered by the lack of accurate dietary intake
      assessment methods for large studies. The newly emerging field of metabolomics offers unique
      possibilities to characterize individual food intake, dietary patterns and effects of dietary
      intervention in large studies. The investigators propose to develop a platform to detect
      broad metabolomic responses to food intake in controlled trials as well as to use targeted
      metabolomics approaches to characterize dietary intake in longitudinal studies. Our
      laboratory has a long history of developing methodology for assessing nutritional status and
      effects of diet on metabolism. Here, the investigators team up with the Sahlgrenska Academy
      Core Facility and the Swedish NMR Centre at the University of Gothenburg, that offer modern
      metabolomics equipment and competence in bioinformatics, and use this in the context of
      nutrition research. To their knowledge, the investigators are among the first groups in the
      country to develop skills in metabolomics to assess dietary intake and effects of nutrition
      on metabolism, and probably the first to use two complementary platforms with both
      mass-spectrometry and nuclear magnetic spectroscopy. Hence, our methodological results should
      be useful to nutritional scientists nationally as well as internationally.

    <time_frame>Fasting blood sample in the morning at one occasion</time_frame>
    <description>Long-time vegans, vegetarians and omnivores will be asked to donate a fasting blood sample at one occasion, in the early morning. This blood sample will be analyzed, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques to reveal all metabolites. Patterns among these metabolites will be distinguished using the statistical techniques principal component analysis and discriminant analysis.</description>

    <description>The same study group also was asked to donate 5-10 hairs of 2 cm closest to the scalp. These were analyzed using isotope ratios of 15N and 13C by IRMS, to see if also this method could discriminate between the groups</description>
