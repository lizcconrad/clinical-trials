    <textblock>
      After successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest, cooling the whole body is a well
      established treatment that improves the chances of the brain recovering. This however, has to
      be done within a certain time-frame from the arrest. The purpose of this study is to explore
      the best way of dosing the muscle relaxing medications that are given during the cooling
      process.

      Hypothesis: In the context of our institutional therapeutic hypothermia protocol,
      cisatracurium infusions lead to faster drops in core temperature when compared to
      cisatracurium prn boluses alone.

      STUDY RATIONALE:

      A large proportion of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest presenting to our intensive care
      units at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) undergo therapeutic hypothermia. Current
      evidence suggests that timely achievement of target temperatures is desirable to improve
      outcomes. At LHSC, this intervention is protocolized with a defined set of preprinted orders
      that includes a dosing regimen for neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA's). Our preprinted
      protocol has been in place since January of 2004. Cisatracurium infusions were part of the
      therapeutic hypothermia protocol until October 2011. Since that time, our protocol has
      changed to cisatracurium prn boluses for any observed shivering. In this study we will
      examine if there has been any change in the times to achieving target temperatures with the
      implementation of this change. It is important to note that no other change in our protocol
      has taken place since it was first implemented, making our before and after comparison valid
      and fair.

      Our hypothesis is that NMBA infusions lead to a faster drop in core temperatures when
      compared to NMBA prn boluses. If this were to stand true, we would expect cisatracurium IV
      infusions to result in faster reductions in core temperature when compared with cisatracurium
      prn boluses in the context of our therapeutic hypothermia protocol. Hypothermia has been
      known to cause a subclinical increase in muscle tone. This previously reported phenomenon has
      been named &quot;microshivering&quot;. When attempting to reduce core temperatures, microshivering is
      likely a natural body response to try to restore body temperature back to normal. We
      therefore hypothesize that NMBA infusions are likely more effective at abolishing
      microshivering, which would be a desirable effect when trying to induce therapeutic
      hypothermia.

      Although current American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines suggest considering the
      administration of NMBA's to facilitate induced hypothermia and control shivering. Their
      recommendation is to minimize the duration of NMBA use or if possible, avoid them altogether.
      After the publication of these guidelines our institutional protocol changed to prn boluses
      instead of the previous infusion orders. We therefore believe it is important to examine the
      effects of this change on our cooling protocol and potentially add to the growing body of
      knowledge in this field.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to attaining target temperature (hours).</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of hypothermia protocol to reaching a core body temperature of ≤34ºC, assessed up to 72 hours from protocol initiation.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be a binary outcome that is: adequate cooling time versus inadequate cooling time based on the time needed to achieve target temperatures. We will define adequate cooling time as being ≤ 4 hours from initiation of protocol to reaching target temperature. Inadequate cooling time will be requiring &gt; 4 hours to achieve that goal. Target core body temperature range in our institutional protocol is 32 - 34ºC.
The primary outcome will be assessed using a logistic regression model, constructed using covariates affecting speed of cooling as determined by expert opinion and current evidence apriori. The variables will be age, sex, weight, pre-protocol core body temperature, initial arrest rhythm and infusion versus boluses. The model will be used to determine whether the cisatracurium dosing regimen is an independent predictor of adequate patient cooling time or not.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cerebral performance category score on hospital discharge.</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon discharge from hospital, assessed up to 36 months postcardiac arrest.</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological outcome on discharge from hospital as defined by the cerebral performance category (CPC) scale. The CPC scale is a 5 point scale. The outcome measure will be dichotomized into good or bad. Good outcome will be equivalent to CPC scores of 1 &amp; 2 (where the patient is independent), and bad outcome will be equivalent to CPC scores of 3, 4 &amp; 5 (where the patient is either dependent or dead). We will examine whether the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent infusion correlates with good CPC scores on hospital discharge or not.
CPC Scale:
Functioning normally and independent, possibly with a minor disability.
Moderately disabled, still independent.
Conscious but with a severe disability, dependent.
Unconscious (comatose or in a persistent vegetative state).
Brain dead or dead by traditional criteria.</description>

    <measure>Hospital length of stay postcardiac arrest (days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Days spent in hospital after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest, assessed up to 36 months from the date of cardiac arrest</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital length of stay (LOS) post-cardiac arrest will be calculated from the day of the cardiac arrest to the day of hospital discharge. If prior to the arrest the patient was an inpatient, we will only count the days from the arrest to discharge. Days spent in hospital prior to the arrest will not be included.</description>

    <measure>Time required to normalize lactate (hours)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from a sustained return of spontaneous circulation to the first recorded normal lactate level, assessed up to 7 days (168 hours) postcardiac arrest.</time_frame>
    <description>Neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) infusions are likely to abolish microshivering and hence reduce lactate generation. This is likely to reduce the times needed for patients to normalize their lactate levels post resuscitation from cardiac arrest. We will examine whether NMBA infusions were associated with better lactate clearance rates (shorter times to normalization of lactate levels) in comparison to NMBA prn boluses or not.</description>
