    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare bonding time, bond survival, amount of adhesive
      remaining on the tooth surface after bracket debonding, and time required for adhesive
      remnant cleanup between a new &quot;flash-free&quot; and a conventional adhesive resin for orthodontic
      bracket bonding.

      Patients presenting for comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances at the
      University of Minnesota, who are willing to participate, will be included in the initial
      study. Selection criteria will include full permanent dentition through the first molars,
      teeth with sound, non-carious buccal enamel and no pretreatment with chemical agents such as
      hydrogen peroxide, and no previous orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. The patients
      will have their maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars bonded with ceramic orthodontic
      brackets pre-coated with a &quot;flash-free&quot; adhesive resin (Clarity Advanced Brackets APC
      flash-free, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA) on one side and a conventional adhesive resin
      (Clarity Advanced Brackets APC II, 3M Unitek) on the other side. The side allocation and
      order of bonding will be randomized for each patient.
