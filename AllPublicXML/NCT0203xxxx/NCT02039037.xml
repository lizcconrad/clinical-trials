    <textblock>
      Chronic nonspecific low back pain is a major health and socioeconomic responsible for a high
      rate of employee absenteeism and reduced functional performance. The use of acupuncture as an
      alternative therapy in the treatment of low back pain and electroacupuncture to enhance the
      treatment has been effective; however, there is little evidence of the effectiveness of one
      over the other.

      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of acupuncture and electroacupuncture as an alternative
      therapy in patients with chronic low back pain to be able to identify whether
      electroacupuncture has more benefits than just acupuncture in the treatment of low back pain
      to be more widespread with scientific.

      METHOD: Sixty subjects will be randomized into two groups: Group Acupuncture treatment of low
      back pain (AG) and Group Acupuncture with the use of electroacupuncture (EG). The primary
      clinical outcomes will be pain, assessed with the numerical pain scale and McGill Pain
      Questionnaire and disability assessed with Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary
      outcomes will be measured with global perception scale of global perceived effect, quality of
      life using the Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36), Beck Depression (Beck
      Depression Inventory BDI), Flexibility, kinesiophobia and through bank Wells. The groups will
      be treated with two weekly sessions lasting about an hour, 6 weeks, totaling 12 sessions. The
      outcomes will be achieved in the final and initial ratings after six months of treatment
      completion. Data will be collected by a blinded examiner who also has made the allocation of
      patients to groups.
