      This will be a randomized, open-label, 5-treatment-period study to evaluate the PK and PD of
      avatrombopag following a single administration of avatrombopag in the fed and fasted
      condition, or the fed condition, to healthy Japanese and white subjects. A standard high-fat,
      high calorie breakfast will be used to assess the fed condition.

      The study will comprise a Prerandomization Phase and a Randomization Phase. The
      Prerandomization Phase will include 2 periods, Screening and Baseline 1. The Screening Period
      will be up to 3 weeks (21 days) in duration. The Randomization Phase will consist of 5
      single-dose treatment periods, of which 3 will include administration of avatrombopag in the
      fed condition and 2 will include administration of avatrombopag in the fasted condition. Each
      treatment period will be separated by a wash out interval of at least 28 days. Before each
      treatment period, subjects will complete a baseline period (Baseline Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5),
      during which baseline assessments will be collected. A Final Visit will occur 28 days (+/- 1
      day) after dosing in Treatment Period 5.
