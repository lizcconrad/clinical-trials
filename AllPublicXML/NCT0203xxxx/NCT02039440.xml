    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are persisting antibodies against
      Japanese Encephalitis 6 years after the last vaccination with IXIARO(R) and to adapt or
      confirm mathematical models accordingly.

    <textblock>
      Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a potentially devastating mosquito-borne viral disease. The JE
      virus (JEV), a Flavivirus, is endemic to many regions in Asia, and while JE is primarily a
      pediatric disease in the endemic regions, travelers from non-endemic regions to Asia are
      usually naïve to the virus and may be at risk for contracting JE at any age.

      The present study aims to investigate antibody titers at approximately 6 years after the
      third dose of JE vaccine (JE-VC), in a cohort of participants from an earlier booster dose
      trial, to strengthen the statistical model of the duration of protection after the booster.
