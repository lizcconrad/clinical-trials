  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to enable a possible transition to intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous
      (SQ) administration for subsequent studies with GSK933776 by characterizing the safety,
      tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic profiles, and immunogenicity of GSK933776 following IM
      and SQ administration in healthy volunteers. Such alternate routes of administration may
      provide more options in the selection of an efficacious dose for subsequent development in
      patients with geographic atrophy. There will be four treatment arms in the study and
      participants will be assigned to 1 of 4 possible treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The
      planned number of evaluable participants for this study is 24 with 6 participants completing
      all critical assessments in each of the four treatment arms. The total duration of
      participation from screening to follow-up for Treatment Arms A, B and D (single dose of
      GSK933776), will be approximately 113 days and total duration for Treatment Arm C (repeat
      dose of GSK933776) will be approximately 134 days.
