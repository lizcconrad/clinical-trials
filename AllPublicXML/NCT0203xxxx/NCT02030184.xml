  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts to this trial. The first study will evaluate increasing doses of Re188
      P2045 in patients with advanced small cell lung cancer that has recurred after initial
      therapy or in patients with other advanced neuroendocrine cancers that have progressed after
      therapy.

      Re188 P2045 is designed to attach to type 2 somatostatin receptors that are frequently
      expressed in those cancers and then the radioactivity from Re188 will kill the cancer cell.
      Only patients who have cancers that can be seen when Tc99 P2045 is administered (also seeks
      out the SSTR2, but Tc99 images, but does not treat the cells) will be treated.

      Therefore, this approach maximizes the possibility that patients will benefit from treatment
      in that only those who have cancers that have the target will undergo treatment. The primary
      purpose of this study will be to determine the highest dose of Re188 P2045 that can be safely
      administered.

      The second study will open after the conclusion of the first. Patients will first undergo the
      scan with Tc99 P2045 and then be treated with topotecan for three days. Topotecan is a
      standard chemotherapy drug that is approved for second line therapy for small cell and
      frequently used for other neuroendocrine cancers. Following that, patients will then be
      re-evaluated with the Tc99 P2045 scan and if it demonstrates that the tumor is positive for
      SSTR2, then patients will receive Re188 P2045. The goal of this study is to determine the
      highest dose of Re188 P2045 that can be safely administered after topotecan as well as to
      determine if topotecan will increase the chance that the tumor will express SSTR2.

      This trial will be conducted patients with small cell lung cancer and other neuroendocrine
      cancers. These include extrapulmonary small cell, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors that
      arise from pulmonary lesions, and large cell neuroendocrine (NE) tumors.

      First, the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) for Rhenium
      Re188-P2045 alone will be determined when it is administered as a single dose, at 80, 90,
      130, 170, 210 or (up to) 250 mCi/m2.

      Subsequently, in the second study Rhenium Re 188-P2045 will be administered at 40, 50, 75, 85
      and up to 100 per cent of the MTD determined in the first study, as a single agent or
      following 3 daily topotecan treatments (at 1.0 or 1.5 mg/m2) in patients with advanced
      neuroendocrine tumors and SSTR2 expression as determined by Technicium (Tc) Tc99m P2045
      scanning.

      The overall response and survival rates of patient treated with Rhenium Re188 P2045 when
      administered as a single dose or following topotecan will be measured.

      The change (if any) in SSTR2 expression, as determined by Tc99m P2045 scanning after
      topotecan administration will also be determined . The correlation of pre-therapy SSTR2
      expression (as determined by Tc99m P2045 scan) with overall response and survival rates will
      be calculated.
