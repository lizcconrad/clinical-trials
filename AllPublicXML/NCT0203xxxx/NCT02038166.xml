  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if acquired (partial) Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
      Conductance Regulator (CFTR) deficiency contributes substantially to the pathogenic
      mechanisms underlying Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS), creating a localized environment that
      impairs mucociliary clearance (MCC).

      Nasal Potential Difference (NPD) measurements will be conducted on participants. The NPD
      measurement, is a bioelectric assay of CFTR-dependent ion transport that has been used in a
      variety of protocols designed to detect CFTR function. A 4-Step protocol will be utilized.
      The nasal cavities will be perfused in a step-wise fashion with the following solutions: 1)
      Ringer's solution, 2) Ringer's solution + amiloride 100μM, 3) Low-Cl--containing solution,
      and 4) Low-Cl- + isoproterenol (10 µM). The potential difference will be monitored in nasal
      epithelium in comparison to an agar filled reference butterfly electrode placed in the volar
      aspect of the forearm, and connected via a calomel cell to a high impedance voltmeter.

      Following placement of the subcutaneous reference bridge, the nasal probe will be secured 1-3
      cm within the inferior meatus and secured in position at the most polarizing position. Each
      nare will then be sequentially perfused with Ringer solution. All nasal potential difference
      tracings will be scored independently by a single reviewer.

      The investigator and an internal committee comprised of Gregory Fleming James Associate
      Scientists will oversee the safety of the study. Our internal committee is a
      multidisciplinary group consisting of physician and subspecialists who, collectively, have
      experience in treatment patients with cystic fibrosis and other airway disease in the conduct
      of randomized clinical trials. The primary responsibility of this committee is to protect the
      safety and welfare of subjects consenting to the investigator's procurement of remnant tissue
      during endoscopic sinus procedure. Members are responsible for reviewing procedural conduct,
      including acquisition of consents and materials, to protect patient well-being. An interim
      data safety review will be conducted on a yearly basis. The committee will consist of at
      least 3 members with clinical trials experience in airway diseases. During annual review,
      issues relating to the safety and process for acquiring human tissues will be reviewed.
      Summary reports from each annual meeting will be prepared and will address concerns about the
      procurement of tissue or any other information deemed pertinent to the review.

    <description>A &gt;-5 mV increase in total chloride secretion (change in NPD following nominal Cl- solution + amiloride + isoproterenol) is typically designated as evidence of measurable difference in CFTR function. Results of NPD measurements between CRS patients and healthy controls will be examined.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The patient eligibility criteria are designed to limit enrollment to healthy individuals
        and patients who clearly have CRS based on Sinus and Allergy health partnership criteria,
        but who are sufficiently well (both in terms of CRS and in terms of concomitant illness,
        such as asthma) to safely participate in study procedures and provide interpretable
        results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        a. Patients with CRS will be diagnosed according to Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership
        symptom-based and objective criteria as follows: i. Duration of disease is qualified by
        continuous symptoms (≥ 2 major factors or at least 1 major factor &amp; 2 minor symptoms; Table
        2) for ≥ 12 consecutive weeks or ≥ 12 weeks of physical findings. ii. One of these signs of
        inflammation must be present and identified in association with ongoing symptoms.

          1. Discolored nasal drainage arising from the nasal passages, nasal polyps, or polypoid
             swelling as identified on physical examination with nasal endoscopy.

          2. Edema or erythema of the middle meatus or ethmoid bulla

          3. Generalized or localized erythema or edema. If it does not involve the middle meatus
             or ethmoid bulla, CT scan is performed to confirm a diagnosis.

          4. The CT scan must demonstrate isolated or diffuse mucosal thickening, bone changes,
             air-fluid levels. b. Age ≥ 19 years and Weight ≥ 50 kg c. Ability to perform NPD
             testing d. Negative pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) e. Written
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute illness within 2 weeks before start of study treatment.

          2. History of major asthma attack within 2 months prior to start of study treatment.

          3. Change in intranasal medications (including use of corticosteroids, cromolyn,
             atrovent, phenylephrine, or oxymetazoline) within 14 days prior to start of study
             treatment.

          4. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody test, or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test.

          5. Hemoglobin &lt;10 gm/dL and Serum albumin &lt;2.5 g/dL.

          6. Abnormal liver function (serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin &gt;2
             times upper limit of normal).

          7. Abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal).

          8. Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          9. History of solid organ or hematological transplantation

         10. History of autoimmune or granulomatous disorder.
