  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether revalidation following total hip
      replacement through the percutaneous approach is faster or better than following the
      anterolateral approach. We assume this would be the case since it is possible to spare a
      large part of the gluteus medius muscle with the percutaneous approach.

    <measure>change in time needed for the timed get up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject is asked to stand up from a chair, walk 3m to a cone, return to the chair and sit down again. The time needed to perform this test is recorded in seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>surface electromyography (sEMG) of gluteus medius</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>sEMG of the gluteus medius is recorded during maximally voluntary isometric contraction and during single leg stance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hip abductor muscle strength measured by MicroFET 2</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient lies supine. Resistance is administered on the lateral side of the leg, just proximal of the knee joint. Patients will be asked for a maximally voluntary isometric contraction. The test will be repeated 3 times. The mean value will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in knee extensor muscle strength measured by MicroFET 2</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is seated with the hips and knees bent 90°. Resistance is administered on the ventral side of the leg, just proximal of the ankle joint. Patients will be asked for a maximally voluntary isometric contraction. The test will be repeated 3 times. The mean value will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on the Trendelenburg test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is asked to raise one leg (sound side) and lift the non-stance side of the pelvis as high as possible for 30 seconds. The response is classified as followed:
Normal: the pelvis on the non-stance side can be lifted maximally during 30 seconds
The pelvis on the non-stance side can be lifted, but not maximally
The pelvis on the non-stance side is elevated, but not maintained for 30 seconds.
No elevating of the pelvis on the non-stance side
Drooping of the pelvis
Non-valid response: due to hip pain or uncooperative patient</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on the Oxford Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) is a disease-specific questionnaire that consists of 12 questions for the evaluation of pain and hip function in relation to various activities. Each question contains 5 quantifiable answers, leading to a total score that can range from 12 (least problems) to 60 (most problems).</description>

    <measure>Change in score on the SF-36 and it's subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a generic questionnaire that contains 36 items measuring health on 8 different dimensions. These dimensions cover functional status, wellbeing and overall evaluation of health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in time needed to complete the 5 times sit-to-stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This easily feasible test where the patient has to stand up and sit back down 5 times as fast as possible is a good predictor of falling. A worse score (i.e. a longer time needed to complete the test) on the 5 times sit to stand (5tSTS) implies a greater chance of falling.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in distance walked during the 6 minute walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The test measures the distance a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a time-period of 6 minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Percutaneous assisted approach</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this technique, a second small incision (1 cm) at the anterior border of the femur is made. A canulla is placed underneath the muscle and used to pass the reamers in the direction of the acetabulum. There's no need to enlarge the skin incision or to release more muscle insertion to achieve good working access to the acetabulum. Two advantages can be defined: sparing of the gluteus medius muscle and safe access to the acetabulum to obtain perfect positioning of the implants.</description>

    <description>A standard transgluteal approach is used. This means a large part of the gluteus medius muscle is released to obtain good access to the acetabulum.</description>

    <description>All patients will get a standard total hip replacement (cementless hydroxyapatite coated cup and a titanium plasmasprayed stem) with a ceramic on ceramic (third generation biolox delta) couple. Preoperative leg length and offset are marked to reconstruct the preoperative leg length and to obtain the optimal offset.</description>
