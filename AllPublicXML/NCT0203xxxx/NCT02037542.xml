      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that an intervention of lifestyle
      modification will positively impact women with breast cancer who are overweight and/or obese.
      To that end, our primary endpoint is to examine the effects of a practical lifestyle
      intervention that can be implemented by overweight or obese women (BMI greater or equal to
      25) with early stage breast cancer (I-III) on outcomes such as body weight and change in BMI
      over the course of the study.

      -  Primary endpoint: To examine the effects of a practical lifestyle intervention that can
           be implemented by overweight or obese women (BMI greater or equal to 25) with early
           stage breast cancer (I-III) on outcomes such as body weight and change in BMI over the
           course of the study.

        -  Secondary endpoint: To assess the impact of such intervention on lipid profiles and
           hemoglobin A1C. The study group will be compared with a historical control group of
           patients with early stage breast cancer who are obese or overweight who were not given
           the intervention

        -  Secondary endpoint: To examine whether an active intervention program will lead into
           longstanding lifestyle modification in breast cancer patients with a BMI greater or
           equal to 25.

    <description>Prospective, observational, cohort study, with a proposed start date of May 2013 and proposed end date of June 2018. Our goal is to gather data on a total of 200 patients: 100 patients (study group) will be prospectively enrolled, while data on another 100 patients (control) will be accessed through retrospective data collection. Number of patients to be analyzed will depend on enrollment and patient compliance. We would like to enroll the proposed 100 patients in the first 1-3 years of the study (approximately 30 per year).</description>

    <description>Upon enrollment, the patient will be asked to meet with a dietitian to assess the individual patient's current diet and exercise routines. In the first session, the dietitian will provide individual counseling and together with the patient devise weight loss / exercise strategies that fit the patients' lifestyle. Following the initial assessment, patients will embark on a weekly program, with weekly meetings lasting 30min - 1h. Patients will be asked to record meal portions weekly in a Food Log (Appendix B), according to the established goal. At each meeting, the dietitian will review the Food Log with the patient and evaluate progress.</description>
