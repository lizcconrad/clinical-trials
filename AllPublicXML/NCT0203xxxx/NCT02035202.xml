  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile real-time cognitive
      behavioral intervention for serious mental illness (SMI) and to identify the facilitators,
      barriers, and costs of implementation. We would like to determine whether the addition of a
      mobile phone monitoring software program to a brief behavioral intervention for bipolar
      disorder or schizophrenia improves symptoms arising from the disorders. In this study we will
      be assessing the feasibility, acceptability and short term effect of the mobile phone
      enhanced intervention for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the
      costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that
      evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically
      significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the
      community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited
      by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and
      cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems.
      Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide
      automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable,
      and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our
      intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized
      interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have
      developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or
      data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go,
      including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead
      to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims
      of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative
      features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barriers to implementation in a public
      mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2)
      an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device
      contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be
      recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment)
      and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global
      psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social
      functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants
      will benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also
      examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of
      CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in
      traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will
      employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of
      adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and
      front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and
      implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - 24 item expanded version 4.0 (BPRS-24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Change at Mid-treatment (6 weeks), Change at Post-treatment (12 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The BPRS-24 includes 24 items that cover depression, anxiety, mania, suicidality, delusions/hallucinations, and unusual behavior. The BPRS is reliable, valid, and sensitive to change in both BD and SZ, and therefore enables the examination of diagnosis as a moderator of treatment effect. Items are rated on a 1-7 scale and the Total Score will be the primary outcome for analyses (15 Minutes).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Thrice daily for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EMA is an ambulatory data collection technique that allows the real-time in vivo assessment of moods, symptoms, and behaviors (e.g., social interactions, taking medications). Modern EMA uses handheld microcomputer or smartphone devices to signal participants several times throughout the day to respond to questionnaires about their recent activities and experiences. EMA has been applied with success to the study of a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, including personality disorders, anxiety and depression psychosis, and substance abuse.</description>

    <measure>Birchwood Social Functioning Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-point (6 weeks), at post-treatment (12 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The SFS is a 79-item self-report of social functioning across 7 domains: 1) social engagement, 2) interpersonal behavior, 3) prosocial activities, 4) recreation, 5) independence/competence, 6) independence/performance, and 7) employment. Items are scored on a 4-point scale with higher scores indicating a higher level of functioning amd subscales are converted to a scaled score. The SFS has been used in both BD91 and SZ, and was recently selected by an expert panel among measures to assess social function in SZ92. The SFS is administered in interview (versus self-report) and best estimate ratings are based on observations, the reports of the participant and available informant or medical record data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSR Toolkit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-point (6 weeks), at post-treatment (12 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The PSR Toolkit93 is used to collect objective information on employment, residential situation, and hospitalizations/ER visits. The measure requires no subject testing burden, because research staff complete the PSR Toolkit (with participant release of information) by obtaining medical records, employment status records, visiting residential settings to determine level of services.
Participant status in each domain is rated on a scale from the absence of meaningful functioning to fully independent functioning. A PSR Toolkit global indicator will be derived as the % of participants who show increase (+1 or more on status rating) on one or more of the indicators from baseline to 6-month follow-up.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-point (6 weeks), at post-treatment (12 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive ability will be measured with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) developed through systematic selection and psychometric evaluation of the tests involved. This measure was developed for schizophrenia and is the preferred neurocognitive battery as per a recent international panel of experts in BD (ISBD-BANC). Additional evidence of the validity of the MCCB comes from 80 patients with BD. The global composite score will be used as the primary moderator.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-point (6 weeks), at post-treatment (12 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS is a 40-item self-report subscale indexing maladaptive attitudes, particularly one's ability to perform tasks and one's need for approval from others. The DAS has been widely used in CBT-related research in both BD and SZ, with consistent associations with symptoms and functioning, along with mediation of CBT. The psychometric properties of the DAS in both BD and SZ are strong.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Cognitive Insight Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-point (6 weeks), at post-treatment (12 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The BCIS is a 15-item self-report scale that assesses two general constructs, self-reflectiveness and self-certainty in relation to evaluating anomalous beliefs. The BCIS is associated with psychotic and affective symptom severity and change in BCIS scores are associated with response to CBT. Although developed for psychotic disorders, two observational studies found equivalent properties and scores in BD and SZ.</description>
