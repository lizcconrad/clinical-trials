    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of the
      trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of insulin degludec (IDeg) and insulin glargine
      (IGlar), both with insulin aspart (IAsp) as mealtime insulin in subjects with type 1
      diabetes.

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe or BG (Blood Glucose) Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes During the Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>A 16-week treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe and/or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value of &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode was defined as an event with onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than the last day of randomised treatment. Maintenance period: 16 weeks of treatment, in each treatment period (Week 16-32 and Week 48-64).</description>

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe or BG Confirmed Symptomatic Nocturnal Hypoglycaemic Episodes During the Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>After 16 weeks of treatment, in each treatment period (Week 16-32 and Week 48-64)</time_frame>
    <description>Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe and/or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value of &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and with time of onset between 00:01 and 05.59 a.m., both inclusive. Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode was defined as an event with onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than the last day of randomised treatment.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With One or More Severe Hypoglycaemic Episodes During the Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>After 16 weeks of treatment, in each treatment period (Week 16-32 and Week 48-64)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects who experienced one or more severe hypoglycaemic episodes during the maintenance period. Severe hypoglycaemia (according to the American Diabetes Association 2013 definition): A hypoglycaemic episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose values may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 weeks of treatment for each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment emergent adverse event was defined as an event with onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than the last day of randomised treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HbA1c (Glycosylated Haemoglobin)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 32, Week 64</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) at week 32 (treatment period 1) and at week 64 (treatment period 2). Week 32 HbA1c absolute value was considered as baseline for calculating change from baseline in HbA1c at week 64.</description>

          <title>Insulin Degludec/Insulin Glargine (IDeg/IGlar)</title>
          <description>Subjects received insulin degludec (IDeg) in treatment period 1 and insulin glargine (IGlar) in treatment period 2. Each treatment period consisted of a 16-week titration period and a 16-week maintenance period (total 32 weeks for each treatment period). IDeg and IGlar were administered subcutaneously (s.c.; under the skin) in the morning (from waking up to breakfast) or in the evening (from main evening meal to bedtime), as per randomisation and were to be taken once daily (OD) at the same time of day throughout the trial. To prevent an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in the first treatment month, the overall daily doses of IDeg and IGlar were reduced by 20% at the start of both the treatment periods. Doses of IDeg and IGlar were titrated individually. Titration of the dose was performed once weekly based on the lowest of 3 pre-breakfast self measured plasma glucose(SMPG) values measured on 3 consecutive days immediately prior to titration (fasting glycaemic target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L)</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe or BG (Blood Glucose) Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes During the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>Severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe and/or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value of &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode was defined as an event with onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than the last day of randomised treatment. Maintenance period: 16 weeks of treatment, in each treatment period (Week 16-32 and Week 48-64).</description>
        <time_frame>A 16-week treatment period.</time_frame>
        <population>The trial followed a cross over design. Descriptive analysis was based on the safety analysis set (SAS: subjects receiving at least 1 dose of the investigational product, IDeg or its comparator, IGlar). Number of subjects analysed=subjects in the SAS, who were exposed in at least one maintenance period.</population>

Each treatment period consisted of a 16-week titration period and a 16-week maintenance period (total 32 weeks for each treatment period). IDeg was administered s.c. in the morning (from waking up to breakfast) or in the evening (from main evening meal to bedtime), as per randomisation and was to be taken OD at the same time of day throughout the trial. To prevent an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in the first treatment month, the overall daily doses of IDeg were reduced by 20% at the start of both the treatment periods. Doses of IDeg were titrated individually. Titration of the dose was performed once weekly based on the lowest of 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on 3 consecutive days immediately prior to titration (fasting glycaemic target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L).</description>

Each treatment period consisted of a 16-week titration period and a 16-week maintenance period (total 32 weeks for each treatment period). IGlar was administered s.c. in the morning (from waking up to breakfast) or in the evening (from main evening meal to bedtime), as per randomisation and was to be taken OD at the same time of day throughout the trial. To prevent an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in the first treatment month, the overall daily doses of IGlar were reduced by 20% at the start of both the treatment periods. Doses of IGlar were titrated individually. Titration of the dose was performed once weekly based on the lowest of 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on 3 consecutive days immediately prior to titration (fasting glycaemic target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L).</description>
