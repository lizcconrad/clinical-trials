  <brief_summary>

      To determine differences in thigh muscle function in individuals with and without knee
      arthritis, and also determine the effectiveness of common physical therapy interventions on
      clinical and patient oriented outcomes.

      The primary objective of the proposed research evaluates the concurrent changes in
      corticospinal excitability and central sensitization of pain pathways for their influence on
      quadriceps voluntary activation. A secondary objective is to establish the feasibility of an
      intervention study to determine if changes in the excitability of these supraspinal motor and
      sensory processes can be modified by physical therapy interventions targeting pain and muscle
      strengthening. We hypothesize that patients with knee osteoarthritis will show measurable
      deficits in quadriceps voluntary activation that can be explained by lower levels of
      corticospinal excitability and increased pain sensitization. A 1 week physical therapy
      intervention will improve voluntary activation and reduce pain with concurrent changes in
      underlying motor and sensory processes. We further hypothesize that part of this improvement
      will be attributed to positive treatment expectation.

    <description>Quadriceps activation will be estimated by utilizing the burst-superimposition technique on a maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and during a resting condition. The burst-superimposition technique provides the muscle with a percutaneous stimulus to recruit any remaining muscle fibers which have not been stimulated.</description>

    <description>The physical therapist will read a script indicating that the intervention is an effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis and is expected to reduce pain and improve strength. Patients are then instructed on the home exercise program and how to operate the TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) unit. The duration of intervention is 1 week during which patients will wear then wear the TENS unit for 8 hours per day and perform no more than 3 sets of 10 repetitions of the physical therapy exercises daily.</description>

    <description>The physical therapist will read a script indicating that the intervention may or may not be an effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis and may nor may not reduce pain and improve strength. Patients are then instructed on the home exercise program and how to operate the TENS unit.

    <description>The TENS electrodes will be applied on the medial and lateral superior, as well as the medial and lateral inferior, borders of the patella. A continuous biphasic pulsatile current (150 Hz, phase duration 150 Âµs) will be applied at an intensity that produces a comfortable sensation but not a muscle contraction. The duration of intervention will be 8 hours per day for 1 week.</description>
