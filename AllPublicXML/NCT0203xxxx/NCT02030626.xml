      The present study aims to compare directly the efficacy of two noninvasive neurostimulation
      techniques : repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct electrical
      current of the motor cortex in patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy on pain intensity.

      The present study ims to compare directly the efficacy of two noninvasive neurostimulation
      techniques : repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct
      electrical current (tDCS) of the motor cortex in patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy
      on average pain intensity. This will be a sham controlled crossover design : patients will be
      randomized to receive either active rTMS or tDCS during 3 consecutive days followed by the
      alternative treatment within 3 weeks apart, or sham rTMS or tDCS during 3 consecutive dats
      followed by the alternative treatment within 3 weeks apart. The investigator will be blind to
      the treatment. Assessments will be performed before each treatment, then 1 hour after the end
      of the third day session, then 2 days and 1 week after the stimulation. Assessments will
      include pain questionnaires, quality of life, anxiety and depression, catastrophizing and
      evaluation of treatment effect on experimental pain using Quantitative sensory testing.
