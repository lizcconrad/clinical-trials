    <textblock>
      Background: Subcortical Vascular Dementia (VaD), consequent to deep brain small vessel
      disease (SVD), is the most frequent form of VaD. The term vascular mild cognitive impairment
      (VMCI) defines a transitional state between normal ageing and VaD. Attentional deficits are a
      common finding in patients affected by VMCI or subcortical VaD. At present, no drug treatment
      is available to prevent vascular dementia in patients with VMCI or to improve cognitive
      performances of this large group of patients. Cognitive rehabilitation is directed to achieve
      functional changes by reinforcing, strengthening, or reestablishing previously learned
      patterns of behavior, or establishing new patterns of cognitive activity or compensatory
      mechanisms.

      A hierarchical model of attention has been used to build the Attention Process Training-II
      (APT-II) programme.

      The APT-II programme effectiveness have been demonstrated in traumatic brain injury and
      post-stroke rehabilitation, but there is an increasing interest in the study of cognitive
      rehabilitation in pathological processes that evolve over time, such as chronic
      cerebrovascular diseases (CVD).

      Aims: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the APT-II programme could be a
      useful tool in the rehabilitation of attention in individuals affected by VMCI with SVD, and
      if so, whether the improvement in performance is generalized to functionality in daily
      activities and quality of life.

      Main Expected Results and Impact: Considering that the APT-II contains specific exercises to
      facilitate generalization to daily life, the skills that are learned by each patient during
      the rehabilitation programme should be generalized to daily activities.

      Furthermore, the improvement of cognitive skills should also improve patient's overall
      quality of life because these learned skills are applicable to real-life situations. The main
      expected results are: 1) an impact of APT-II on disability, everyday cognition, quality of
      life, and performance on attention tests at short and long term after rehabilitation
      programme ending as compared with standard care; 2) a reduction of the risk of transition to
      dementia at 1 year follow-up as compared with control group.

      Study design

      The present study is a 3-year prospective, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. The
      enrolment will be carried out at the Stroke Unit and the VASCOG clinic of the Careggi
      University Hospital. Forty patients will be enrolled according to the following criteria: 1)
      MCI defined according to Winblad et al. criteria (19); 2) Evidence of impairment across
      attention neuropsychological tests; 3) Evidence on MRI of subcortical vascular lesions:

      moderate to severe age-related white matter changes (WMC) according to a modified version of
      the Fazekas scale (20). Exclusion criteria: age&lt;18 years. All enrolled patients will be
      evaluated at baseline according to the study protocol, that includes: 1) Clinical assessment;
      2) Functional, quality of life and mood assessment; 3) Extensive neuropsychological
      assessment; 4) MRI protocol. After baseline assessment, participants will be randomly
      assigned to attention training or standard care. Stratified minimization randomization will
      be used to ensure the balance for possible prognostic factors (i.e., age, gender, MMSE total
      score, extension and localization of WMC) across the groups. All APT-II sessions will be
      administered by a clinical neuropsychologist, or an appositely trained graduate student in
      medicine. The student clinicians will receive a minimum of 30 hours of training with adult
      rehabilitation patients, and will be closely supervised by the neuropsychologist.
      Participants in the APT-II group will receive overall up to 40 hours of individual attention
      process training. Therapy will be administered in one two-hour session each week over a total
      of 20 weeks. Participants in the standard care group will not receive cognitive training or
      rehabilitation interventions, will be instructed to have an usual lifestyle, and will be
      conventionally provided of medication and clinic consultations. Each patient will be
      followed-up at 6 and 12 months after baseline assessment. During the follow-up visits
      clinical assessment, an extensive neuropsychological evaluation, and mood, functional, and
      quality of life assessments will be performed according to the baseline protocol. The MRI
      protocol will be repeated at 1-year follow-up.

      Work Methodology

      Baseline and follow-up clinical, neuropsychological, functional, and MRI data will be
      collected in a dedicated database. Data will be checked and controlled for consistency in
      real time during collection. At the end of the enrolment, a first exploratory data analysis
      will be carried out. Postprocessing of neuroimaging acquired at baseline will be performed by
      an experienced radiologist. At the end of each follow-up (6 and 12 months after enrollment),
      analysis of data (uni- and multivariate models and effect size measures) will be carried out.
      All analyses will be performed using SPSS 18 and will be mainly directed to: 1) evaluate the
      short and long-term effectiveness of the rehabilitation program, using cognitive performance
      and functional and quality of life measures as dependents variables (within and between
      groups analyses); 2) identify potential predictors of effectiveness of the rehabilitation
      program (multivariate model). The variables included in the model will be: demographic and
      vascular risk factors, baseline cognitive profile and functional status, and preexisting
      brain structural changes; 3) evaluate the potential protective effect of the rehabilitation
      program on the increase of cognitive impairment or transition to dementia at 1 year
      follow-up; 4) evaluate the long-term effect of rehabilitation on brain activation, using
      f-MRI data, whole-brain histograms, and voxel-based analyses as dependents variables (within
      and between groups analyses).
