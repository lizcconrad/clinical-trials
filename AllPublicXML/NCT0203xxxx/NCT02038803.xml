  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled tobramycin is a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommended effective treatment for
      individuals with cystic fibrosis for the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway
      colonization and improves the FEV1 and reduces the number of acute pulmonary exacerbations of
      CF. Patients typically use the inhaled tobramycin for a period of 28 days. Unfortunately, the
      standard nebulizer method for delivering tobramycin inhaled solution (TIS) is time-consuming
      and may result in missed therapy doses and suboptimal care. A new inhaled formulation and
      delivery device, the TOBI Podhaler (TPI), is a quicker, more efficient method of
      administering inhaled Tobramycin. This new pocket-sized disposable inhaler is maintenance
      free, requires no refrigeration or power source, and should greatly increase patient mobility
      and improve time management.

      Adult cystic fibrosis patients from the Rush University Medical Center Adult Cystic Fibrosis
      Program will be recruited for a prospective before and after cohort study to evaluate patient
      preference for either the TOBI Podhaler or inhaled tobramycin solution and compare the
      efficacy of the TOBI Podhaler to tobramycin inhaled solution. This project will evaluate the
      potential differences in efficacy, medication adherence, treatment time, side effects/adverse
      effects, quality of life, and identify patient preferences between the use of TIP and TIS.
      Measurements after a 28-day cycle of tobramycin inhaled solution, first 28-day cycle of TOBI
      Podhaler and third 28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler will include FEV1, number of acute pulmonary
      exacerbations, adherence, cough frequency, sputum characteristics, and side effects or
      adverse events. The quality of life as assessed by the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised
      (CFQ-R) will be measured after a 28-day cycle of tobramycin inhaled solution and the third
      28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler. The FEV1 values, number of missed treatments, and total
      treatment time will be analyzed through a repeated measures analysis of variance. Comparisons
      of the CFQ-R data before and after the switch to the TPI will be made with the Student's
      t-test. The chi square test will be used to evaluate differences in categorical data. All
      tests will be tested at an alpha equal to 0.05. Responses for the adverse reactions or side
      effects will be listed and categorized. The percentages of patients preferring each inhaled
      solution will be reported.
