  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the impact of newly created and available symptom management patient
      education brochures on symptom burden [measured via the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System
      (ESAS)], health-related quality of life [measured by the European Organisation for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30)], patient satisfaction
      with care [measured by the Princess Margaret Hospital Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire
      (PMH/PSQ-MD 29) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Patient
      Satisfaction with Radiation or Chemotherapy (EORTC PatSat35 RT/CT)], self-efficacy, and
      knowledge at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Canada. These brochures are
      designed for oncology patients in order to provide a response to symptom screening and are
      now a standard part of care. Symptom screening occurs at each visit as patients are required
      to fill out ESAS, that asks about their experience with the occurence and severity of
      symptoms. The intent of the patient brochures are to acknowledge the screen, validate the
      symptom and provide knowledge of self-management strategies for symptoms. The brochures also
      provide information to patients about when and how to seek further help from their oncology
      team. The hope is that patients will experience a useful response to their screen with all
      levels of symptoms-from 0-10 in severity

      It is hypothesized that the addition of patient education symptom management pamphlets on 7
      of the symptoms measured by ESAS (appetite, nausea and vomiting, depression, anxiety,
      fatigue, dyspnea and pain) will provide new and meaningful information which will build
      knowledge, validate the patient's experience of the symptom, lead to increased satisfaction
      with care, improved self efficacy in managing and accessing help for the symptom and
      therefore improved health related quality of life.

    <description>Participants who are asked to read patient education pamphlets on symptoms will complete our survey subsequent to reading which test their knowledge about pamphlets. We will be about to conclude later whether reading the pamphlets was correlated with greater knowledge when compared to the control group who did not read the pamphlets.</description>

    <description>This study will assess whether the intervention group (who read the patient education pamphlets) differed from the control group (that did not read the pamphlets) in terms of self-efficacy. More specifically, this study will evaluate self-efficacy in terms of patient confidence in managing their symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>approx. 6 months for data collection</time_frame>
    <description>This study will evaluate whether the intervention group (who read patient education pamphlets) differed from the control group (who did not), in terms of patient satisfaction with care. We predict that patients who read the education pamphlets will be more satisfied with their care.</description>

    <description>The intervention in this study is the administration of patient education pamphlets and instructions to read them. Half of all patients who participate in this study will be required to read pamphlets on symptoms that are relevant to them (i.e. symptoms that they are experiencing). Subsequent to reading pamphlets, patients will complete study questionnaires to assess their impact.</description>
