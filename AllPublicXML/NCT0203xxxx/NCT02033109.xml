    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate MIV-150, a third generation non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor, co-formulated with a potentially potent agent, zinc acetate for the
      prevention of HIV infection in women. This is the first in-human of PC-1005 (MIV-150/zinc
      acetate in a carrageenan gel), the first study in which females will be exposed to MIV-150,
      the first time MIV-150 will be administered topically, and the first time MIV-150 will be
      administered intravaginally.

      This study will begin with a safety run-in, which is an open label, single-arm safety run-in
      with 5 women receiving PC-1005 once daily for 3 consecutive days. Safety and pharmacokinetics
      will take place after each dose. the participants from the run-in will not be eligible for
      the main study.

      The main study participants will be randomized 4:1 to the study gels: 24 randomized to
      PC-1005 (active) and 6 randomized to HEC gel (placebo). The study product will be applied
      vaginally once daily for 14 days with clinical and laboratory assessments at baseline
      (enrollment) and after the 1st, 2nd, 8th, 9th, and 14th doses, and a safety follow-up visit 7
      days after the 14th dose.

      Participants in the run-in and main study will be requested to be sexually abstinent starting
      immediately after the Screening Visit until study exit.
