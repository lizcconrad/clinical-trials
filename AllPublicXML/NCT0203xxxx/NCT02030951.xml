      Feeding that circumvents the oral cavity drastically alters the infant's feeding experience
      (pre, intra and post feeding) and may lead to oral feeding difficulty. It is estimated that
      35 - 40% of infants exhibit oral feeding difficulty. Consequences include delayed oral
      feeding, growth failure, and inadequate mother-infant interaction. Behaviors related to the
      feeding experience include behavioral state transitions, orally directed behaviors, hunger
      and satiation cues, and social interactive behaviors. It is unknown whether these early
      behaviors differ for hospitalized infants who receive long term tube feedings when compared
      with infants fed orally or whether alterations in these behaviors can be early indicators of
      later oral feeding difficulty. Documentation of these missing or altered behaviors is needed
      prior to the development and testing of interventions to prevent oral feeding difficulty.

      For 75 hospitalized infants with long term tube feedings, this research will: 1) describe the
      range of early feeding behaviors encompassing the feeding experience; 2) identify the change
      in early feeding behaviors throughout hospitalization; 3) compare the early feeding behaviors
      of infants with and without oral feeding difficulty at 12 months corrected age (CA); and 4)
      compare parent perception and provider assessment of feeding, for infants with and without
      oral feeding difficulty.

      We will document infant behaviors surrounding the feeding experience during tube feedings
      weekly during hospital stay. Throughout the first year of life, infant growth, parent
      perception and clinician assessment of infant feeding and infant and maternal behavior during
      feeding will be evaluated to document the occurrence of oral feeding difficulty, allowing for
      a comparison with early in hospital feeding behaviors. To analyze for changes over time, we
      will use Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) for repeated count (Poisson) and
      frequency/categorical (logistic and multinomial logistic) outcomes (e.g., frequency of infant
      behaviors). Understanding the constellation of these behaviors and when they begin, will
      guide the development of interventions whose goal will be to alleviate the long term
      consequences of oral feeding difficulty, inform clinical practice, and reduce cost.

      SPECIFIC AIMS: Feeding that circumvents the oral cavity drastically alters the infant's
      feeding experience and may lead to oral feeding difficulty. It is estimated that 35 - 40% of
      infants exhibit oral feeding difficulty and 34% of infants evaluated for oral feeding
      difficulty develop oral feeding resistance during the first year of life. Behaviors
      associated with oral feeding difficulty include: unclear infant behaviors signaling hunger or
      satiation; the infant frequently interrupts the feeding, spitting or vomiting, or postural
      changes during the feeding; infant irritability; increased or decreased length of feeding;
      delayed acquisition of feeding skills, and disengagement during feeding. Oral feeding
      resistance is more severe and includes persistent food refusal &gt;1 month, disruptive mealtime
      behavior, rigid food preferences, gagging in anticipation of feeding, and/or vomiting and
      failure to master feeding skills consistent with the child's developmental level. The
      consequences of oral feeding difficulty involve: delayed oral feeding, growth failure,
      delayed perceptual motor performance, and disengagement with the caregiver related to
      feeding, which leads to less optimal patterns of parent-infant interaction. It is currently
      unknown what the early indicators of oral feeding difficulty are or when they begin to
      develop. The purpose of this research is to prospectively describe early feeding and social
      interactive behaviors of tube fed infants prior to the later development of oral feeding
      difficulty and retrospectively compare differences in these behaviors in infants who exhibit
      oral feeding difficulty with infants not exhibiting these behaviors.

      Throughout the first year of life, infant growth, parent perception of infant feeding,
      clinician assessment of infant feeding skills, and infant and maternal behavior during
      feeding will be evaluated to document the occurrence of oral feeding difficulty, allowing for
      a comparison of these early in hospital feeding behaviors. The study aims are to:

      Aim 1: Describe the range of early feeding behaviors (pre-feeding, intra feeding, and post)
      and feeding progression in hospitalized infants who have long term exposure to naso-gastric,
      oral-gastric and gastrostomy tube feedings. Feeding behaviors are measured as behavioral
      states, orally directed behaviors, social interactive behaviors (engagement and disengagement
      behaviors), hunger and satiation cues, sucking organization, and motor activity. Feeding
      progression is measured as the daily change in the proportion of tube to oral intake.

      Aim 2: Identify the change in early feeding behaviors throughout the infant's hospital stay.

      Aim 3: Compare the early feeding behaviors of infants with and without oral feeding
      difficulty at 12 months corrected age (CA).

      Aim 4: Compare parent perception and provider assessment of feeding, maternal sensitivity to
      infant, response to distress, social-emotional and cognitive growth foster cues and infant
      clarity of cues and responsivity to mother during feeding at hospital discharge and 2, 4, 6,
      and 12 months CA for infants with and without oral feeding difficulty at 12 months CA.

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: While most healthy infants establish the recurring cycle of
      hunger, oral feeding, and satiation in association with transition of behavioral states,
      orally directed behaviors, and social interaction, hospitalized infants often experience tube
      or intravenous feeding for extended periods of time, which contributes to non-establishment
      of hunger, feeding, and satiation patterns. Unlike normal healthy infants who experience the
      pleasurable sensations of smell, taste, touch, and social interaction associated with oral
      feeding, hospitalized infants often have aversive oral experiences related to intubation,
      insertion of oral gastric tubes, and suctioning. Behaviors associated with oral feeding
      difficulty include: unclear infant behaviors signaling hunger or satiation; the infant
      frequently interrupts the feeding, frequent interruptions, spitting or vomiting, or postural
      changes during the feeding; infant irritability; increased or decreased length of feeding;
      delayed acquisition of feeding skills, and behavioral disengagement during feeding. Oral
      feeding resistance is more severe and may include but is not limited to food refusal,
      disruptive mealtime behavior, rigid food preferences, increased or decreased length of
      feeding, altered patterns of mother-infant interaction, suboptimal growth, and failure to
      master feeding skills consistent with the child's developmental level. The consequences
      include: delayed oral feeding, and disengagement with the caregiver related to feeding (which
      leads to parent/caregiver frustration.

      The cost of tube feeding averages $40,000 during the first year of life. The cost of
      outpatient behavioral treatment ranges from $10,000 to $52,000 and readmission treatment
      averages $ 330,000.

      Infant Characteristics and Behaviors Related to Feeding and Oral Feeding Difficulty: The
      feeding experience encompasses the infant's preparation for feeding (prefeeding period), as
      well as the actual feeding (intra feeding) and post feeding periods. Feeding involves complex
      anatomic structures, coordination of breathing, sucking and swallowing, reflex activity, a
      constellation of behaviors, and social interaction. Several infant characteristics including
      gestational age (GA), post menstrual age, birth weight, health status, and long term tube
      feeding have been shown to influence oral feeding.

      There is a paucity of research that identifies the constellation of behaviors prior to,
      during and post feeding for infants during tube feedings. Additionally, interventions
      currently in use for hospitalized infants experiencing feeding difficulties predominately
      address the intra feeding period. Management of oral feeding difficulty for older
      infants/children is intensive, yet also addresses the intra feeding period.

      Oral Feeding Progression: Low level oral feeding skills and slow feeding progression are key
      indicators of oral feeding difficulty. Lau and Smith categorized levels of oral feeding skill
      that include fatigue and endurance. Infants with more alert behavioral states progressed more
      quickly to complete oral feedings.

      Importance of Mother-Infant Interaction: Feeding holds the central opportunity for the
      development of long lasting patterns of mother infant interaction. Feeding is critically
      important because it involves mother-infant interaction; is a primary factor that affects
      growth; and is a major concern for both clinicians and parents during the transition to full
      oral feeding and through discharge to home. When the infant is unable able to engage with the
      mother during feedings, this difficulty leads to non-optimal mother-infant interaction and
      the potential for altered infant development.

      Oral Feeding Difficulty: Oral feeding difficulty is identified by both parents and
      clinicians. Parent perception offers detailed information from the parent's perspective and
      includes ease/difficulty of feeding the infant, the infant's behavioral cues surrounding the
      feeding experience, how the parent sets up and begins the feedings, and the length of
      feeding. Clinician assessment identifies the infant's oral feeding skills.

      Design and Methods Prospective design. Infant feeding behavior, feeding progression, and
      growth will be evaluated weekly during hospital stay. Parent perception and clinician
      assessment of oral feeding difficulty will be evaluated at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months corrected
      age. Mother-infant interaction will be evaluated at hospital discharge and throughout the
      first year of life.

      Sample: We will enroll 75 infants from Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) who are
      expected to receive a minimum of two weeks of non-oral formula/breast milk feedings during
      hospitalization. Infants meeting the following criteria will be eligible for this study:
      prior surgical treatment for gut, or chest surgery (non cardiac), or non-surgical infants who
      will require a minimum of two weeks of non-oral formula/breast milk feedings. Infants may be
      receiving oxygen therapy and intravenous therapy. Infants may have previously been treated
      for sepsis, pneumonia, received intravenous only intake, or managed with assisted
      ventilation.

      Exclusion criteria include those infants who are currently being treated for sepsis,
      pneumonia, intravenous only intake, receiving assisted ventilation, have congenital anomalies
      of the oral cavity, chromosomal abnormalities, or are not neurologically intact (e.g. hypoxic
      ischemic encephalopathy or significant neurologic deficit).

      Procedures Procedures for Data Collection. Evaluation data are collected at enrollment,
      weekly during hospitalization, at hospital discharge, and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months CA. At
      enrollment, after informed consent is obtained, the in-hospital research nurse will conduct
      the medical record review and obtain the infant demographics/risk factors.

      The early feeding behaviors data will be obtained weekly. Infants will be video recorded for
      90 minutes. The first 30 minutes will comprise the pre feeding time. Immediately following
      the 30 minute pre feeding recording, the infant will be fed (approximately 20 - 30 minutes
      for the feeding). After the feeding is complete, the video recording will be continued for an
      additional 30 minutes. The early feeding behaviors data are assessed during the entire 90
      minute data collection session. Infants will remain on their cardiac monitors during the
      session. The video recorded data will be transferred from the video camera to the secure
      (encrypted) server and saved. The video recordings will also be downloaded into the Mangold
      system for coding. The feeding progression data will be collected from the medical record.

      Outcomes assessed at hospital discharge. Within 24 hours of discharge, the final assessment
      of early feeding behaviors will occur. In addition, sucking organization will be measured for
      infants who are partially or fully oral fed at discharge. The medical record will be reviewed
      for the hospital progression data (feeding progression, type of feeding the infant receives,
      weight gain, length, head circumference, length of hospital stay). The oral feeding skills
      and sucking organization data will be collected by a member of the research team.
      Mother-infant interaction will be assessed during a feeding.

      Outcomes assessed after Infant Discharge at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months CA. Infant growth and
      mother-Infant interaction during feeding and play will be assessed at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months
      CA in the Pediatric Translational Research Unit. Difficulty with Oral Feeding during the
      infant's first 12 months, will be identified through parent self report and clinician
      assessment. Mother-infant interaction will be assessed during a feeding.

      Statistical Analysis Plan: Frequencies and 95% confidence intervals based on the appropriate
      model for the variation will be calculated for the behavioral data and changes in the
      behavior over time. The behavioral data will be converted to percents, counts and rates over
      time (weeks) to evaluate change over time (maturation). Changes over time will be modeled as
      linear, curvilinear or step functions with fractional polynomials. Analysis of changes over
      time will use Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) for repeated count (Poisson) and
      frequency/categorical (logistic and multinomial logistic). Where the outcome occurs only
      once, such as feeding by tube at discharge, the corresponding Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
      will be used for regression modeling; e.g. a Poisson GLM instead of Poisson GLMM, a logistic
      GLM in place of a logistic GLMM, etc. (AIM 1 and AIM 3).
