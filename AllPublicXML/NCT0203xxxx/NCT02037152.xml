  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a smartphone-based mindfulness training program for
      chronic pain. Research participants use a 20 minute app-guided audio program six days per
      week. The study hypothesis is that training in this technique over a period of four weeks
      will reduce pain interference with daily life activities. This study does not require any
      travel or in-person contact with research staff-- all elements of the study are completed on
      the participant's smartphone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, waitlist controlled trial. Smartphone users who download the research
      app complete an electronic informed consent before the app content is made available.
      Subjects meeting inclusion criteria are then prompted to complete baseline questionnaires.
      Submission of questionaires triggers randomization to one of two groups-- active treatment or
      waitlist. Subjects have equal chance of entering either group.

      The active treatment group is instructed to use the app-guided &quot;body scan&quot; exercise daily for
      six days per week. The waitlist group is instructed that the research intervention will be
      made available to them in four weeks time. On a weekly basis, all subjects complete a Brief
      Pain Inventory scale. At the end of four weeks, subjects again complete a Brief Pain
      Inventory as well as the questionnaires measuring secondary outcomes. Upon completion of the
      control condition, waitlist subjects are invited to begin using the &quot;body scan&quot; exercise as
      described above. From this point forward, subjects receive the same protocol as the active
      treatment group. This study involves no face-to-face contact between participants and study
      investigators/staff.

    <description>The active treatment group will be instructed to use the app-guided &quot;body scan&quot; exercise daily for six days per week over a period of four weeks. The &quot;body scan&quot; includes 20 minutes of guided audio-- the pre-recorded voice of a narrator instructs the user to systematically direct attention to various parts of the body. Before and after each use of the body scan, users complete a single-item scale measuring pain intensity/distress. Users are prompted to complete all other questionnaires at weekly or four-week intervals. The app includes access to a graphical display showing changes in average pain level. Subjects also have access to a section of frequently asked questions about the practice.</description>
