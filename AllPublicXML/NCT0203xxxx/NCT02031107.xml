  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability. Non-invasive brain stimulation can
      induce significant and sustained improvements in functional outcome. However the effect is
      inconsistent and difficult to predict, in particular in the subacute phase after stroke.
      Although several different stimulation techniques are available, it is unknown which is
      suitable for which patient.

      Objectives: This study has three main objectives:

        1. To compare the effects of two techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation (cTBC,
           continuous theta-burst stimulation; tDCS, direct current transcranial stimulation) on
           clinical recovery in patients with subacute stroke.

        2. To assess the effect of these brain stimulation techniques on brain organization with
           non-invasive imaging.

        3. To find clinical and neural predictors of responsiveness to brain stimulation therapy.

      Method: 45 patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke will be randomly assigned to one of 3
      groups: cTBS, tDCS, or sham stimulation. Each group will receive the corresponding
      stimulation therapy 3 times per week for 3 weeks, immediately before intensive physical
      therapy. Before and after the treatment period, standardized assessments of sensorimotor
      function areas are obtained together with electroencephalography and functional magnetic
      resonance recordings. These recordings will be used to analyze and compare the neural effects
      of each treatment modality.

      Clinical Implication: The results of this study might help optimize and individualize
      stimulation treatment for patients with subacute stroke. It may hence facilitate the transfer
      of brain stimulation therapy to routine clinical practice.

    <description>The Fugl Meyer motor assessment (FMA), the Nine Hole Peg test (expressed as pegs per minute), and the Jamar dynamometer strength of the affected arm are normalized to the healthy arm and averaged to a compound motor score. This score is obtained twice before treatment (at weeks -1 and 0 relative to treatment start), and twice after treatment (at weeks 4 and 8). Primary outcome measure is the change in slope from week 0 to 4 as compared to the slope between week -1 and 0.</description>

    <description>A transcranial magnetic stimulator (MagPro X100, Medtronic Functional Diagnostics, Skovlunde, Denmark) will deliver continuous bursts of bipolar magnetic pulses exerting an inhibition on the underlying brain tissue (cTBS). The stimulation coil will be placed over the unaffected primary motor cortex. The stimulation protocol implies 200 bursts, each consisting of three pulses applied at 30 Hz, repeated at inter-burst intervals of 167 ms. Two stimulation trains of 30 s, separated by 15 min, will be applied 3 times per week for 3 weeks and will be immediately followed by physical therapy.</description>

    <description>A stimulator (NeuroConn GmbH, Illmenau, Germany) will deliver cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the unaffected motor cortex. The anode will be placed over the contralateral supraorbital region. Stimulation will be performed for 25 min, 3 times per week for 3 weeks during upper extremity treatment sessions.</description>
