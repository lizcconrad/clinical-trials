  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' long-term goal is to improve the survival of patients with pancreatic
      cancer by enhancing the efficacy of gemcitabine-radiation by adding the Wee1 inhibitor
      MK-1775.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with phosphorylation inhibition of greater than 0</measure>
    <time_frame>First Cycle of Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>During the first cycle of treatment, patients will undergo 2 biopsies: 3 h after treatment with gemcitabine (but before MK-1775), and 2 hours after MK-1775. WEE1 signaling will be assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to measure phosphorylation of various markers including Cdk1 (Y15). Inhibition will be quantified as the within subject change in the above markers between the two biopsy timepoints. Descriptive statistics of inhibition across subjects (for each marker) will be calculated and reported by dose level.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  Patients will have unresectable disease, defined radiographically as &gt;180 degrees
             involvement of the superior mesenteric artery or celiac trunk or SMV/portal vein
             impingement that cannot be surgically reconstructed, in the absence of distant
             metastasis..

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status (measure of general well being that
             ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 represents perfect health) of &lt; 2.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function defined as follows: absolute neutrophil
             count of ≥ 1500/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dl, total
             bilirubin ≤ 3, (with relief of biliary obstruction if present (PTC tube or endobiliary
             stent)) and AST &lt; 5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method
             during participation in this trial and for 6 months after the trial. Patients must not
             be breastfeeding.

          -  Patients must be aware of the investigational nature of the therapy and provide
             written informed consent.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other serious uncontrolled concomitant systemic disorders or psychiatric condition
             that would interfere with the safe delivery of protocol therapy.

          -  A history of previous chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer or abdominal radiation
             therapy.

          -  The use of any investigational agent in the month before enrollment into the study.

          -  Inability to discontinue a prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products
             known to be metabolized by CYP3A4, or to inhibit or induce CYP3A4 prior to Day 1 of
             dosing and to withhold throughout the study until 2 weeks after the last dose of study
             medication. Medications of particular concern are the following inhibitors of CYP3A4:
             azole antifungals (ketoconazole itraconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole), macrolide
             antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin), cimetidine, aprepitant, HIV protease
             inhibitors, nefazodone and the following inducers of CYP3A4: phenytoin, barbiturates
             and rifampicin. Substrates of CYP3A4 include statins (lovastatin, simvastatin),
             midazolam, terfenadine, astemizole, and cisapride.
