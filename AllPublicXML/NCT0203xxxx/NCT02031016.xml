  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the influence of intra-operative use of remifentanil versus
      fentanyl on the percentage of patients with chronic thoracic after cardiac surgery via
      sternotomy. Secondary quantitative sensory testing is performed to determine thermal and
      electrical detection and pain threshold and the difference in pain variability scoring.
      Postoperative pain scores, analgesic use, genetic variances and costs are measured.
