      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dosage of etanercept in patients
      treated for idiopathic juvenile arthritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Etanercept, a fully human soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor fusion protein, has
      been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of patients with polyarticular
      JIA. However, many patients experience primary or secondary response failure, suggesting that
      individualization of treatment regimens may be beneficial. It has been shown that the
      clinical response to two anti-TNFalpha biological agents (infliximab, adalimumab) closely
      follows the trough drug levels and the presence of antibodies directed against the drugs.
      This study was undertaken to investigate whether serologic monitoring of etanercept
      bioavailability and immunogenicity in individual patients with JIA would be useful in
      optimizing treatment regimens to improve efficacy and tolerability

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

          -  Age &lt;18 years and&gt; 4 years (which corresponds to the pediatric AMM)

          -  Patient on Etanercept treatment in the context of his usual care, whatever the dose
             (but the dose should remain stable in the weight during the study period). The patient
             must have received at least one injection of etanercept before participating in the
             study.

          -  Signature of consent by the guardians of the child

          -  Patient affiliate or entitled to a social security scheme

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infection progressive

          -  Pregnancy and lactation. For adolescents of reproductive age and sexually active,
             contraception should be used during the duration of treatment with etanercept

          -  Contraindication to treatment with Etanercept

          -  Refusal of the study
