        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a man or woman 18 through 45 years of age at the SV.

          -  The subject is assessed as being in good health based on a screening examination that
             includes medical history, physical examination (including a complete oropharyngeal
             examination), ECG assessment, and clinical laboratory results (ie, serum chemistry,
             hematology, and urinalysis).

          -  If female, subject is currently not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become
             pregnant (for 30 days before the SV and throughout the duration of the study and for
             30 days after subject's last visit), or is of non-childbearing potential, defined as
             any of the following:

               -  pre-menarche

               -  at least 1 year postmenopausal

               -  surgically sterile (tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy, or
                  hysterectomy)

               -  congenital sterility

               -  diagnosed as infertile and not undergoing treatment to reverse infertility

               -  or is of childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and is
                  willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control as
                  defined below for the duration of the study:

               -  systemic contraception used for at least 1 month before the SV including birth
                  control pills, transdermal patch (Ortho Evra®, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., or
                  equivalent), vaginal ring (NuvaRing®, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., or equivalent),
                  levonorgesterel implant (Norplant®, Population Council, or equivalent), or
                  injectable progesterone (Depo-Provera®, Pfizer Inc., or equivalent)

               -  double barrier methods (condoms, cervical cap, diaphragm, and vaginal
                  contraceptive film with spermicide)

               -  intrauterine device (IUD) with a low failure rate defined as less than 1% per
                  year

               -  monogamous with a vasectomized male partner or same-sex female partner

               -  or is of childbearing potential and not sexually active, has a negative serum
                  pregnancy test, and is willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable
                  method of birth control as defined above for the duration of the study, in the
                  event the subject becomes sexually active.

               -  If male, the subject is willing to commit to an acceptable method of birth
                  control for the duration of the study, and for 3 months after dosing, or
                  exclusively has same-sex partners.

          -  Subject is of normal body weight as evidenced by a BMI of at least 18 but no more than
             30 kg/m2 (≥18 and ≤30 kg/m2), and has a body weight over 50 kg (&gt;50 kg). The BMI is
             calculated as follows: weight (kg)/height2 (m).

          -  Subject does not have any concomitant conditions or treatment that could interfere
             with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study observations/results, or put
             the subject at increased risk during the study.

          -  Other criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has clinically relevant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology or any
             other laboratory variables.

          -  Subject has an irregular day/nighttime rhythm in daily living habits (eg, night work
             or repeated travels to places belonging to different time zones).

          -  Subject has been treated with any known cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor or
             inducers (eg, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, ritonavir, barbiturates, phenothiazines,
             cimetidine ) within 30 days before the Screening Visit (SV).

          -  Subject has been exposed to systemic corticosteroids (during the past 60 days) or
             intranasal/orally inhaled corticosteroids (during the past 30 days) for any
             indication, chronic or intermittent; or subject has an underlying condition that can
             reasonably be expected to require treatment with corticosteroids during the course of
             the study.

          -  Subject has used topical corticosteroids in concentrations in excess of 1%
             hydrocortisone or equivalent within 30 days before the SV; used a topical
             hydrocortisone or equivalent in any concentration covering greater than 20% of the
             body surface; or used any topical corticosteroids with an occlusive dressing; or has
             an underlying condition (as judged by the investigator) that can reasonably be
             expected to require treatment with such preparations during the course of the study.

          -  Subject has used any prohibited medication (see Section 5.3) within the prescribed
             period before the SV.

          -  Subject is currently a smoker or has used any tobacco products within 1 year or has a
             &gt;10-pack/year smoking history (ie, the equivalent of smoking 1 pack per day per 10
             years).

          -  Subject has any piercings of the tongue, lips, or mouth.

          -  Other criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information.
