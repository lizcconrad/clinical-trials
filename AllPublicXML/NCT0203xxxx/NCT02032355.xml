  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal hypotension is a common side effect after spinal anesthesia for cesarean
      delivery.Decreased vascular resistance and cardiac output, due to sympathetic blockade1and
      blood pooling in blocked areas of the body respectively, are main causes of spinal
      anaesthesia-induced hypotension during Caesarean delivery.

      Cardiac output, which has shown to be a better predictor of organ and placental perfusion
      than arterial blood pressure.Few studies have measured CO after spinal anesthesia in the
      maternal population.This is largely because of the lack of availability of accurate and
      reproducible noninvasive measurement techniques. Up to now, preventing hypotension has
      continued to focus on arterial blood pressure variables, fluid, and ephedrine requirements as
      markers of cardiovascular status, because these are more easily measured.

      Investgators hypothesized that CO and PetCO2, in parturients with the degree of hypotension
      during spinal anaesthesia, would also have a positive and significant association.
