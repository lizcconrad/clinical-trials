      The cluster randomized trial (CITFOMIST) was conducted on 15-19-year old guidance and high
      school students of both genders from different districts of Tehran, the Iranian capital, in
      winter 2011. The 36 schools enrolled in this study were randomly assigned to receive one of
      the three groups of milk -- whole milk, milk that contained 600 IU Vit D/1000cc, milk that
      contained 1000 IU Vit D /1000cc -- for a 30-day period. In order to study the effect of
      vitamin D-fortified milk on the circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D, a serum vitamin D
      levels were checked in a subgroup before and after the intervention.

      winter 2011.

      The 36 schools enrolled in this study were randomly assigned to receive one of the three
      groups of milk -- whole milk, milk that contained 600 international unit (IU) Vit D/1000cc
      (120IU), milk that contained 1000 IU Vit D /1000cc (200IU)-- for a 30-day period. In order to
      study the effect of vitamin D-fortified milk on the circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D, a
      serum vitamin D levels were checked in a subgroup before and after the intervention.
