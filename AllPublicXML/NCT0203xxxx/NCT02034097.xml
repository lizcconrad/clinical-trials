    <textblock>
      Foretinib (GSK1363089) is an investigational, oral, multikinase inhibitor involved in
      invasion, migration, and angiogenesis. This is a phase II, open label, uncontrolled,
      parallel, multi-cohort, multicenter 2-stage study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      foretinib and erlotinib combination therapy and foretinib monotherapy in genomic
      subpopulations of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated informed consent, approved by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
             or Institutional Review Board (IRB), obtained prior to the performance of any
             study-specific procedures or assessments. The subject must be able to understand and
             comply with protocol requirements and instructions.

          -  Males and females &gt;=18 years of age (at the time consent is obtained).

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented stage IV NSCLC, with prior
             histopathological reports showing one of the following: Evidence of Epidermal growth
             factor receptor activating mutation positive (EGFRm) or Epidermal growth factor
             receptor (EGFR)/ Wild Type (WT) genes in Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) derived from
             formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human non-small cell lung cancer tumor tissue; An
             orphan receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) chromosomal rearrangements as determined by
             ectopic expression of the ROS1 protein by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or detection
             of ROS1 rearrangements as determined by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); In
             Cohort 3, subjects with alternative molecular profiles (e.g., Non-receptor tyrosine
             kinases [NRTK], Tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the glial cell line-derived
             neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family [RET], etc.) may be enrolled as subsets of this
             cohort if emerging data suggest they would likely respond to therapy. If genetic
             analyses have been performed previously, a copy of the complete mutation profile is
             requested.

          -  Tumor biopsy: For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, a fresh tumor sample after progression on
             erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or another EGFR- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and
             before starting in this study is required; in addition, archival samples obtained
             pre-EGFR-TKI are required (if available). For Cohort 3, subjects who are
             crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor naive will be required to provide a copy of the genetic
             report showing ROS1 positive mutation and archival tissue if available; subjects with
             ROS1 fusions who progressed on crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor will be required to provide a
             copy of the genetic report showing ROS1 positive mutation and a fresh biopsy.

          -  Subjects must meet one of the following: Cohort 1 (EGFRm): Has documented progression
             (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria) after &gt;=4 months of clinical benefit on prior
             erlotinib/gefitinib/afatinib therapy within 30 days prior to the first dose of
             foretinib; Cohort 2 (EGFR/WT): Has documented progression (based on RECIST
             1.1criteria) after &gt;=2 months of clinical benefit on prior EGFR-TKI therapy within 30
             days prior to the first dose of foretinib, or; Cohort 3: For the ROS1 subset,
             documented progression (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria) on or was intolerant of prior
             crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor therapy or is naive to crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor. Note:
             Crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor naive subjects will be eligible for the study if
             crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor is not available to them and participation in this trial is
             their only option for targeted ROS1 treatment. For additional biomarker-driven
             subsets, written documentation of entry requirements will be provided to
             IRB(s)/IEC(s).

          -  Only one prior line of EGFR-TKI therapy immediately preceding enrolment into the
             current study for Cohorts 1 or 2. Progression will have occurred on single agent
             EGFR-TKI treatment in the 1st line setting for EGFRm subjects, and in the 2nd line or
             maintenance setting for EGFRm or EGFR/WT subjects.

          -  Measurable disease, i.e., presenting with at least one measurable lesion per RECIST
             v1.1.

          -  Subjects must not have participated in another clinical trial except with single agent
             EGFR-TKI or crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor within the past 3 months and may not have
             received any intervening therapy of any kind (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.)
             between the time of progression on prior TKI and enrolment on this trial. Additional
             requirements regarding prior therapy may be added for Cohort 3 subsets as they are
             added to this study. Note: Subjects may continue treatment with the prior TKI on which
             they progressed during this 30 day period at the discretion of investigator, but must
             discontinue the prior TKI to allow 5 half-lives off drug prior to the first dose of
             foretinib in this study.

          -  A minimum of 14 days must have elapsed since any palliative radiotherapy and subjects
             must have recovered from any treatment related toxicities prior to enrolment.

          -  A minimum of 14 days has elapsed from last surgery prior to first dose and wound
             healing has occurred. If subject has had exploratory thoracotomy, they must have
             recovered from the procedure prior to start.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1.

          -  Any ongoing potentially reversible treatment-related toxicities must be (National
             Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03
             (NCI-CTCAE v4.03) &lt;=Grade 1 and not progressing in severity, except alopecia or the
             expected EGFR-TKI toxicities of rash or diarrhea that are stable with intervention and
             then only if agreed to by the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor and the
             investigator.

          -  Adequate baseline organ function as defined in the protocol. Note: Laboratory results
             obtained during Screening should be used to determine eligibility criteria. In
             situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted range, the investigator
             may opt to retest the subject and the subsequent within range screening result may be
             used to confirm eligibility.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days of first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception, as

             study treatment.

          -  Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior
             vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception as described in the protocol for at
             least 14 days prior to administration of the first dose of study until 21 days after
             the last dose of study treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm.

          -  Subjects must discontinue hormone replacement therapy prior to study enrolment due to
             the potential for inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize estrogens and
             progestins.

          -  Cotinine level within the quantification limits of the assay. Subjects in erlotinib
             combination cohorts must have stopped smoking prior to study entry and must not have

             are eligible providing that they are asymptomatic and do not require corticosteroids.

          -  Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder, or other
             conditions that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent, or
