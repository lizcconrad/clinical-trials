      Background: Hypertension in adults is the factor most prevalent cardiovascular risk and
      motivates further inquiries, generating a very high cost of medical care.

      Objective: To evaluate the monitoring of well-controlled hypertensive patients Pharmacy
      Offices. Hypothesis: the monitoring of these patients through the Office of Pharmacy will be
      as effective in obtaining good control of blood pressure as it is to obtained through health
      centers. Design: Multicenter randomized controlled trial along one year of follow up.
      Location: the city of Cerdanyola del Vallès (Barcelona). Participants: All patients diagnosed
      with hypertension and good control criteria in the past year. Arms: Health centers (control)
      and Pharmacy Offices (intervention). Outcome variable: blood pressure under good control
      along the monitoring
