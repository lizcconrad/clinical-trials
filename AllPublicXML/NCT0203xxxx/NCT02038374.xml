  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disorder in children. Despite significant
      advances in understanding of asthma, available therapies fail to alter the natural history
      and progression of the disease. Airway epithelial cells are continuously exposed to and
      injured by environmental irritants, such as viruses and pollutants, and as such are ideally
      situated to orchestrate airway function in response to these stimuli.

      Severe or difficult-to-treat asthma in children is a complicated disorder characterized by
      ongoing symptoms and persistent airway inflammation and oxidant stress despite corticosteroid
      treatment. Although severe asthma is likely a heterogeneous disorder, affected children
      similar clinical features, including gas trapping, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and
      aeroallergen sensitization. However, the molecular and cellular pattern of inflammation in
      children with severe asthma are not uniform : some investigators have found increased
      eosinophils and TH2 derived cytokines, others have noted noneosinophilic patterns with
      neutrophil activation.

      Given the heterogeneity of the inflammatory response in children with severe asthma,
      additional methods to distinguish severe asthma are needed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children 0-18 years

          -  patients followed regularly for at least one year.

          -  The diagnosis of asthma is increased according to the criteria of the Global
             Initiative for Asthma (GINA): children with a history of recurrent episodes of
             bronchial obstruction.

          -  children with severe asthma defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS): Severe
             asthma is defined by the presence of a major criterion: the need for high doses of

             five minor criteria:

          -  The daily use of beta 2 long-acting or short-term daily action (&lt;4 years) or
             anti-leukotrienes associated with inhaled corticosteroids Daily or almost daily use of
             beta-2 short-acting Permanent-bronchial obstruction (FEV &lt;80% predicted FEV)

          -  At least one emergency department visit for asthma exacerbations in France

          -  At least 3 courses of oral corticosteroids per year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  parents' refusal to participate in the study

          -  refusal children to participate pathology underlying cardiac, neuromuscular,
             immunodeficiency
