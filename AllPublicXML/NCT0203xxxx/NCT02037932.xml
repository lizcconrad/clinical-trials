  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the GELATIN registry is to prospectively evaluate intracranial aneurysm
      occlusion and retreatment rates as well as adverse event rates in patients undergoing
      balloon-assisted coiling using the MicroVention Scepter Occlusion Balloon Catheter and
      second-generation MicroVention hydrogel coils for treatment of previously treated or
      untreated ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, single arm, single center study of patients with ruptured or
      unruptured saccular aneurysms that are embolized using MicroVention second-generation
      hydrogel coils and undergo balloon remodeling with the MicroVention Scepter Occlusion Balloon
      Catheter. Data for each patient will be collected 6 ± 3 months post-procedure for the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18-80 years of age.

          -  Patient has a documented, previously treated or untreated saccular intracranial
             aneurysm, 4- 20 mm unruptured or ruptured, suitable for treatment with balloon
             assisted coil embolization.

          -  Target aneurysm has a neck ≥4mm or the largest diameter to neck ratio of 2 or less.

          -  Patient has a Hunt and Hess Score of 3 or less.

          -  Patient has a premorbid mRS of 3 or less.

          -  Patient or patient's legally authorized representative has provided written informed
             consent.

          -  Patient is willing to and can comply with study follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to obtain informed consent.

          -  Patient is &lt;18 or &gt;80 years of age.

          -  Target aneurysm is dissecting, fusiform, mycotic, or arteriovenous
             malformation-related.

          -  Aneurysm that was treated previously with stent-assisted coiling.

          -  Implantation of the stent after the balloon-assisted coiling or combined stent and
             balloon assisted coiling.

          -  Target aneurysm is deemed unsuitable for balloon-assisted coiling by the treating
             physician prior to the procedure.

          -  Target aneurysm will be treated with a total coil length comprised of less than 80%
             second generation MicroVention Hydrogel Coils.

          -  Balloon-assisted coiling will be performed using a balloon catheter other than the
             MicroVention Scepter balloon (Scepter C, Scepter XC, any future Scepter
             configurations).

          -  Patients in which the target aneurysm is planned not to be coiled in one procedure
             (i.e. staged procedure).

          -  Patients with more than one aneurysm that requires treatment. (However, a second small
             low risk aneurysm that does not require therapy may be allowed.)

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of ≤ 9 months.
