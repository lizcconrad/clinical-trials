  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of standard of care treatments (physical therapy versus
      manual therapy) in older adult patients who have balance problems with or without low back
      pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized controlled research design and will enroll up to three hundred
      patients. Treatment will take place in outpatient facilities. It is hypothesized that among
      older adults with low back pain manual therapy will reduce low back pain and improve balance
      more than physical therapy; and that among older adults without low back pain manual therapy
      and physical therapy will be equally efficacious in improving balance. The results of this
      study will help to further define effective treatment protocols.

    <description>Participants complete functional performance tests and self-report questionnaires related to balance, pain, and quality of life. Testing is performed at baseline, after 6 weeks of care, and at 12 weeks. Balance tests included the Berg Balance Scale, The Timed Get up and Go (TGUG) test, Performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA), NeuroCom Balance assessment tests which included the Limits of Stability (LOS) Test and Modified Clinical test for the sensory integration of Balance (Mod CTSIB).</description>
