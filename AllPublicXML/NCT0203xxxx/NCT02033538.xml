    <textblock>
      Albumin-bound paclitaxel regimen in advanced NSCLC has a better tumor response rate and
      safety than solvent-based paclitaxel. However, the safety and efficacy is uncertain in
      neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal cancer. The objective of this single-arm phase II trial was
      to evaluate the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with nanoparticle albumin-bound
      paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.

      In the past decade, clinical trials have evaluated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
      radiation, or both, for patients with surgically resectable esophageal carcinoma, but have
      all failed to demonstrate a consistent survival benefit. In Eastern countries, preoperative
      chemotherapy followed by radical surgery became one of the treatment strategies for
      resectable, clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy
      of systemic chemotherapy, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of
      nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil as perioperative therapy for
      patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma.
