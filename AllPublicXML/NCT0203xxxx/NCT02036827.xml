  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is any difference in incidence of
      shoulder tip pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy between the groups with moderate
      neuromuscular block and deep neuromuscular block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the gold standard treatment for gall bladder disease.
      However, 30-50% of patients suffer from shoulder tip pain, which might arise from diaphragm
      stretch due to pneumoperitoneum.

      In the previous pilot study, working intra-abdominal space was increased in the condition of
      deep neuromuscular blockade. And thus investigators hypothesized that the depth of
      neuromuscular blockade can affect insufflation pressure and intra-abdominal volume, which
      result in the severity of diaphragm stretch and postoperative shoulder pain. In addition, the
      depth of neuromuscular blockade can alter pulmonary compliance.
