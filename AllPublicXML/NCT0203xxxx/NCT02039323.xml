      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a novel method to assess
      antiretroviral efficacy for protection against HIV-1 infection in vaginal and cervical tissue
      biopsies.

      Participants: Six premenopausal healthy volunteer women between 18-49 years of age with an
      intact uterus and cervix.

      Procedures (methods): Subjects will be given a single dose of two oral antiretrovirals
      (maraviroc 600mg/tenofovir 600 mg). Subjects will be monitored and assessed for adverse
      events post-dose. Subjects will be sent home and asked to return in 24 hours. 24 hours
      post-dose, two vaginal and two cervical biopsies will be obtained. These biopsies will then
      be placed in an ex-vivo culture system and exposed to HIV. Viral RNA will be measured over
      two days to determine whether the tissues were protected from infection. A final visit for
      safety will be conducted 7-14 days post-enrollment.

          -  All subjects must have an estimated calculated creatinine clearance (eCcr) of at least
             80 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula where: eCcr (female) in mL/min = [(140 - age
             in years) x (weight in kg) x 0.85] / (72x serum creatinine in mg/dL).

          -  All subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and negative urine
             pregnancy tests on days of dose administration and should be using at least one of the
             following methods of contraception from the screening visit through 72 hours prior to
             first outpatient visit (at which time the women will be asked to remain abstinent
             until after their follow-up visit)

               -  Systemic hormonal contraceptive (oral, depot, transdermal or implant)
