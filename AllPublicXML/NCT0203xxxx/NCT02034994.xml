      combining change in nutritional behaviors with after school physical activity activities in
      reducing the excessive weight gain in schoolchildren.

    <description>A combination of two prevention school based programs will be addressed to schoolchildren over one year. Primary prevention will be developed monthly in order to reduce cookies and sugar sweetened beverages consumption, reduction of sedentary activities, increase meal consumption frequency and quality etc, in all children from 6th and 7th grades. Overweight and obese children will be invited to participate on a secondary prevention program in which daily physical activity classes will be performed by physical education teachers in school facilities.</description>
