  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is present in food either naturally or by fortification and included in nutritional
      supplements. It is also synthesized photochemically by the skin from ultraviolet B radiation.
      Vitamin D synthesis varies by season and with latitude as well as according to intensity of
      skin pigmentation. Recent research in the United States found lower circulating levels of 25
      (OH) D, the primary indicator of vitamin D status, among minority women who were either
      pregnant or in their reproductive years. The extent to which maternal vitamin D has an
      influence on the course and outcome of human pregnancy remains to be more completely studied.
      We propose to use the HPLC method to assay cholecaliferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol
      (vitamin D2) to assess maternal vitamin D status. This will be accomplished by analyzing
      existing fasting samples and data derived from the 2001-2006 cohort (N=1141) of young, low
      income minority gravidae from Camden, New Jersey to determine:

        1. The prognostic importance of maternal vitamin D status for birth weight, gestation
           duration and poor pregnancy outcomes (low birth weight, preterm delivery, fetal growth
           restriction).

        2. The relation of maternal vitamin D status to important complications of pregnancy
           (gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia).

        3. The relationship of maternal vitamin D status to maternal diet and supplement use,
           season of year, ethnicity, overweight/obesity, and other maternal characteristics.

      Blood and urine collection: Fasting (&gt;8 h) maternal blood samples were collected at entry to
      care and week 28 of gestation. Blood specimens were also collected at 1-hour of the 50g
      glucose challenge test. Fasting blood samples collected at each visit were immediately
      refrigerated and centrifuged at 4oC. Plasma and serum were preserved from each patient (at
      -70oC) until assayed. 20 ml of urine was collected at entry to care and week 28 in metal free
      plastic containers and stored at -70oC.
