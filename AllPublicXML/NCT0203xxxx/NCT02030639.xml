  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of how the experimental anti-cancer
      drug, rigosertib, is metabolized in the body and excreted in the urine and feces after it is
      given as an intravenous infusion. In addition, the study will be carefully monitored to see
      if any side effects occur.

      A radioactive drug is used in this study because it is easier and more accurate to measure
      radioactivity than to use more complicated and less sensitive chemical tests for the drug.

      This study will be an open-label, non-randomized, metabolism and excretion study of
      [14C]-rigosertib administered as a single dose of approximately 450 mg containing 250 μCi
      [14C]-labeled rigosertib as a 24-hour continuous intravenous (CIV) infusion in healthy
      volunteers. Up to 8 subjects will be enrolled to ensure at least 6 subjects have evaluable
      data.

      Eligible subjects will be confined at the clinical site from the time of Check-in
      (approximately 24 hours prior to dosing) until Discharge (between Days 6 and 10). One single
      dose of [14C]-rigosertib will be administered as a 24-hour continuous intravenous infusion on
      Day 1. Subjects will be discharged as early as 120 hours after the start of the infusion,
      after ≥ 90% of the administered radioactive dose has been recovered in urine and feces or
      when the combined total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces is ≤ 1% of the
      administered radioactive dose for 2 consecutive 24-hr samples. The maximum stay will be until
      Day 10 (216 hours after the start of the infusion).
