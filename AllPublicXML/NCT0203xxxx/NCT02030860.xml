      This study is a randomized pilot/pharmacodynamic/genomic study of neoadjuvant paricalcitol to
      target the microenvironment in resectable pancreatic cancer to determine the effect of
      targeting the vitamin D metabolic program in the tumors of patients treated with one cycle of
      gemcitabine/abraxane with or without paricalcitol prior to surgery for resectable pancreatic
      cancer through an assessment of cellular and imaging markers.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Previously untreated, apparently resectable, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas at
             registration.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  Standard laboratory criteria for hematologic, biochemical, and urinary indices within
             a range that, in the opinion of the physician, clinically supports enrollment of the
             patient on the trial. Note: subjects must have: Creatinine &lt; 2xULN, Transaminases &lt;
             3xULN, Neutrophils &gt;1.5x109/L, and Platelets &gt;100,000/mm3

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with hypercalcemia (blood levels greater than 11.5 mg/dL; in patients with
             kidney disease, blood calcium levels must be 9.5 mg/dL or lower before starting
             paricalcitol).

          -  Patients who are currently pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breast-feeding.

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the physician, would not be clinically appropriate for
             receipt of the therapy regimen associated with participation
