      Female participants will undergo a baseline pelvic examination. Participating couples will be
      given The Stork™ Conception System (OTC), including Instructions for Use, the questionnaire
      and two ziplock bags. The device will be used in accordance with the instructions for use.
      Participants will use the Conceptacle as a collection condom during sexual intercourse.
      Participants will remove the Cervical Cap from the Sheath of the Conceptacle and discard the
      Sheath. Participants will then load the Cervical Cap into the Applicator for insertion,
      placement and deployment of the device. Participants will wash the applicator with soap and
      water and place it in the double zip lock bags. During the time the cervical cap is inserted,
      normal activity will be recommended with the exception of having intercourse. The female
      participants will leave the conception cap inserted for a period of time between 4 and 12
      hours, return to the investigator's office for examination, remove the Cervical Cap, and
      undergo a follow up pelvic examination. Participants will be asked to complete the study and
      the questionnaire within 3 days of receiving the study packet. As a result, this study could
      take up to 4 days to complete per enrolled couple.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is comprised of 3 parts. It is binary, in the sense that if all of the three parts are &quot;passed&quot; then the endpoint is met for that couple. If any part of the endpoint is not met then the endpoint for that couple is not met. The three parts of the endpoint are:
P1: Participants indicate ability to collect and contain semen using the Conceptacle™.
The examinations will occur 4-12 hours after device insertion.</description>
