  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that the transradial cardiac catheterization has decreased not
      only bleeding complications related to the access site and procedural discomfort but also
      morbidity and hospitalization as compared to transfemoral approach. At present, the right
      radial approach (RRA) is the first choice routinely for coronary angiography and
      interventions in daily clinical practice despite more marked subclavian artery tortuosity
      than left radial approach (LRA). Although LRA has been thought to be more direct access to
      the ascending aorta similar to transfemoral approach and may reduce fluoroscopy time and
      cerebrovascular complications compared with RRA, the application of LRA for coronary
      intervention is still low. Moreover, several studies have also obtained conflicting results
      showing no difference in procedural success rate compared LRA and RRA using Judkins
      catheters. To date, it remains unclear whether LRA is superior to RRA in term of safety and
      feasibility for coronary angiography and interventions in real world practice and few data of
      randomized control trial are available.

      The aim of this study was to randomly investigate and compare the safety and feasibility of
      LRA compared with RRA for coronary diagnostic angiography in Chinese subjects.

      The investigators will enroll consecutively for 2 years all patients undergoing coronary
      diagnostic procedures through trans radial approach.

      The primary outcome was total procedural duration. Secondary outcomes included fluoroscopy
      time, dose of radiation including cumulative air kerma and dose area product, contrast volume
      and the incidence of vascular complications.
