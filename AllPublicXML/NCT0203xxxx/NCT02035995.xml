    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a risk factor for the development of type II diabetes
      and it is responsible for the morbidity of both mother and child. The aim of this study was
      to determine retinal findings of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

    <textblock>
      We have three groups; the first group consisted of pregnant volunteers with GDM. The second
      group consisted of healthy pregnant participants. The third group consisted of healthy,
      non-pregnant women at the reproductive age. Macular, choroid and retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFL) thicknesses were evaluated in patients with GDM and comparisons were made among GDM,
      healthy pregnant and healthy non-pregnant subjects for these parameters by using optic
      cohorence tomography.
