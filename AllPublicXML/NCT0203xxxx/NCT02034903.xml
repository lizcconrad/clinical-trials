  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The temperature of milk fed to infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) has been
      shown to vary greatly, and is influenced by individual provider practice. The clinical effect
      of varying milk temperatures on preterm infant feeding tolerance has not been well studied.
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of warming method, water bath versus
      commercial warmer and its impact on feeding tolerance. Sample population will include
      eighty-six infants born at 30-0/7 weeks or less, and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care
      Unit at Advocate Children's Hospital, Park Ridge within 48 hours of birth and remain in the
      study for a minimum of 28 days. After obtaining consent, eligible infants will be assigned to
      a control (water bath) or experimental (commercial warmer) group using a randomized sampling
      scheme. After warming, and just prior to feeding, milk temperatures will be taken and
      recorded by a trained data recorder. Feeding tolerance will be measured based on gastric
      residual volume and length of time required to achieve full feeds. Based upon the available
      evidence, the study investigators hypothesize that warming feeds to a consistent temperature
      range using commercially available milk warmer will improve feeding tolerance and decrease
      time to full feedings in preterm infants.

Significant gastric residuals:
25-50% of feeding volume x 2 consecutive feeds
