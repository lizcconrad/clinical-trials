        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged ≥ 18 years

          -  Current diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (updated Dana Point Classification 1).

          -  Current inhalative therapy with 5 µg iloprost using the I-Neb nebulizer

          -  WHO functional class III at the time of the patient's commencement of inhalative
             therapy with iloprost

          -  Hemodynamic diagnosis of Pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH) showing mean pulmonary
             arterial pressure (mPAP) &gt; 25 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or left
             ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) &lt; 15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance
             (PVR) &gt; 320 dyn•s•cm-5

          -  If non-specific types of chronic treatment for PAH are being administered: Stable
             dosage of these for at least the 4 weeks up to screening

          -  If PAH-specific drug treatments (such as endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) or
             phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors) are being administered: Stable dosage of these
             for at least the 3 months up to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             (PVOD)

          -  Clinically relevant obstructive lung disease

          -  Evidence of thromboembolic disease (probable pulmonary embolism) within 3 years before
             screening

          -  Cerebrovascular events within 3 months before screening

          -  Atrial septostomy within the 6 months before screening

          -  Severe arrhythmia, or severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina, or myocardial
             infarction within 6 months before screening, or congenital or acquired valvular
             defects with clinically relevant myocardial function disorders unrelated to PAH

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mm Hg, or uncontrolled systemic hypertension (systolic BP
             &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg)

          -  Hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B, C) or chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 2.5
             mg/dl) and /or requirement of dialysis

          -  Clinically relevant bleedings disorders or conditions with increased risk for
             hemorrhages (active ulcers, trauma etc.)

          -  Addition or dose change of PAH specific drug treatments such as ERA or PDE5 inhibitors
             within 3 months before screening, or addition or dose change of non-specific
             treatments for PAH such as calcium channel blockers, nitrates, digitalis, diuretics
             within 4 weeks before Screening, or any kind of prostanoid other than those mentioned
             in inclusion criteria within less than 5 half-lives before treatment
