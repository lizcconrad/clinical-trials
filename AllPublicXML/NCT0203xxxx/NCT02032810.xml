  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if an investigational drug called panobinostat can
      be given safely with another drug called ipilimumab. Investigators want to learn more about
      the side effects of this combination of drugs using different doses of panobinostat and the
      same dose of ipilimumab.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of panobinostat administered in combination with ipilimumab in participants with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma.
The trial will enroll up to 36 patients for determination of the MTD, but will be successfully concluded earlier if 12 patients are accrued at the dose determined to be the MTD, with 3 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).
All participants who receive study any drug therapy will be evaluated for safety. Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 of induction cycle 1. Single 12-lead ECGs will be collected at screening, prior to dosing on Day 1 of each treatment cycle, at the end of treatment and at the 90-day follow up visit.</description>

    <measure>Occurrence of Anti-tumor Activity of Panobinostat Administered in Combination with Ipilimumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune-related Response Criteria (irRC).
RECIST: Best overall response from start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Progressive Disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.
Immune-related Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions for at least 4 weeks from date of documentation of irCR. Immune-related Partial Response (irPR): Sum of the products of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions, measured and captured as the Sum of Product of Diameters (SPD) baseline. Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD): At least a 25% increase in the SPD of all index lesions and new measurable lesions (irSPD) over the nadir SPD calculated for the index lesions.</description>
