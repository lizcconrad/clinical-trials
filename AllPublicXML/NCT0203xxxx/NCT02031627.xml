      Proof of principle study in order to determine if there is a difference in treatment effect
      across the 3 study groups when treating lower extremity lymphoedema using a pneumatic
      compression device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, 3 arm, prospective, randomized, clinical trial to assess the
      difference between 3 treatment options for achieving a measurable physiologic effect on lower
      extremity lymphedema with pneumatic compression device. Each intervention arm will include 10
      completed subjects for a total of 30 completed subjects.
