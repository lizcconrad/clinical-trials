      The purpose of this study is to determine the chemopreventive properties of capsaicin, the
      active compound in chili peppers, in prostate cancer patients enrolled in the active
      surveillance program or patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy.

      Rationale A large body of evidence supports the role of dietary factors in prostate cancer
      development and progression. Most of this evidence suggests that diet high in fat including
      red meat and low in micronutrients and other anti-oxidants, increases the risk of disease. We
      are interested in the therapeutic potential of the dietary agent, capsaicin (CAP). Capsaicin
      is the active compound in chili peppers, and related plants. Pre-clinical studies have found
      that capsaicin has potent growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects. It is thought that
      consumption of a capsaicin supplement may have a clinical benefit for subjects with localized
      prostate cancer who have chosen to be managed by active surveillance or improve surgical
      outcome of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.

      Objective(s) Primary • To assess the effect of capsaicin daily therapy on the expression of
      ki67 and p27 biomarkers in a post-treatment biopsy or prostate specimen from RP.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effect of therapy with repeat oral dosing of capsaicin two times daily on
           Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) kinetics in men on active surveillance for localized
           prostate cancer

        -  To assess the effect of therapy with repeat oral dosing of capsaicin two times daily on
           grade and the presence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in a post-treatment
           biopsy

        -  To assess the effect of therapy with repeat oral dosing of capsaicin two times daily on
           the expression of markers of apoptosis, cell cycle, TRP-V1 and TRP-V6

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of capsaicin therapy in men on active surveillance
           (AS) for prostate cancer

        -  To assess alterations in prostate volume and time to recurrence

      Endpoint(s) Primary

      • Determine effect of capsaicin therapy on expression of ki67 and p27 biomarkers in a
      post-treatment biopsy

      Secondary

        -  Determine effect of capsaicin daily therapy on PSA kinetics in men on active
           surveillance for localized prostate cancer

        -  To evaluate the effect of capsaicin daily therapy on grade and the presence of prostatic
           intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in post treatment biopsy

        -  To assess the effect of capsaicin therapy on the expression of markers of apoptosis,
           cell cycle, TRP-V1 and TRP-V6

      Safety and Tolerability

        -  Adverse events (AEs)

        -  Clinical laboratory evaluations (PSA, electrolytes, biochemistry, hematology,
           cholesterol)

      Pharmacodynamic

        -  Levels of serum capsaicin (CAP)

        -  Levels of serum testosterone (T)

      Study Design This is a phase II, open label, single centre study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of repeat oral dosing of one CAP capsules twice times daily for 6 months prior to a
      prostate biopsy in men on active surveillance for localized prostate cancer, as well as 6
      weeks prior to radical prostatectomy (RP).

      Study Population One hundred men men monitored (sixty from active surveillance (AS) and forty
      patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy) will be eligible for participation.
      Subjects must satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria. A sufficient number will be
      enrolled to achieve at least 100 completed subjects
