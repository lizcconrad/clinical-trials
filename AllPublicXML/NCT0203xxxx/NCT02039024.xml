    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to investigate the monoaminergic
      (dopamine、serotonin、and norepinephrine ) nervous system and amyloid deposition in Parkinson's
      disease patients with non-motor symptoms (focus on impulse control disorders and dementia) by
      novel 18F-DTBZ and Florbetapir F-18 PET imaging.

      This study will compare the amyloid deposition of brain by florbetapir F-18 PET imaging and
      monoaminergic function by18F- DTBZ PET in NC group, PD group, PDD group, AD group.

      Investigators will also analyze monoaminergic function by18F- DTBZ PET in PDI group.

      Study duration is expected to be completed in a period of 3 year. This study will compare the
      amyloid deposition of brain by florbetapir F-18 PET imaging and monoaminergic function by18F-
      DTBZ PET in 10 age-matched healthy subjects (NC group), 30 PD patients without dementia/ICD
      (PD group), 30 PD patients with dementia (PDD group), and 20 patients with dementia (AD
      group). We will also analyze monoaminergic function by18F- DTBZ PET in 30 PD patients with
      ICD (PDI group).

      Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria according the subject grouping, healthy subjects, PD, PDD, and AD patients will have
      4 visits in this study ,as one screening visit, one florbetapir F-18 imaging visit, one
      18F-DTBZ imaging visit, and one safety evaluation.PDI patients will have 3 visits in this
      study, as one screening visit, one 18F-DTBZ imaging visit, and one safety evaluation. Safety
      measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,
      laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.

    <description>During this study, subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of approximately 370MBq (10 mCi) 18F- DTBZ immediately prior to imaging. The dosage of DTBZ is 10 nmole. The effective dose in human body is about 5.6 mSV.
During this study, subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of approximately 370MBq (10 mCi) florbetapir F-18 immediately prior to imaging. The dosage of DTBZ is 10 nmole. The effective dose in human body is about 5.6 mSV.
The proposed dose for this study is based on our phase I study. At the proposed human dose of 10 mCi, the whole body effective dose (ED) will be approximately 680 mrem. The estimated human ED is expected to be comparable to or below the range of other approved brain imaging agents, such as 18F-FDG (Lin 2010).</description>
