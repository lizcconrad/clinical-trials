    <textblock>
      First, this study will investigate the viability of 24-hour eye patching as a potential
      treatment modality for CSR. Second, this study will assess a potential physiologic
      explanation for CSR, namely if inhibition of photic stimulation of the diseased retina will
      aid in ameliorating disease severity and disease duration.
