      The purpose of this study is to assess Abatacept Intravenous (IV) effectiveness in patients
      with inadequate response to one or more conventional Disease Modifying Against Rheumatism
      (DMARDs) including Methotrexate in France, through the estimation of Abatacept retention rate
      over 2 years and reasons of discontinuation

      Observational Model:

      Other: ReACTION is a study using secondary data originally collected in ACTION study. In
      ACTION, data were collected prospectively from October 2010 up to 2015 at each clinical
      visit. In France, data collection started in June 2011
