  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of RX-3117 in subjects
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (Phase 1). The purpose of the Phase 2 portion is to
      estimate anti-tumor activity in subjects with advanced malignancies (relapsed or refractory
      pancreatic or advanced bladder cancer).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-finding, open-label, single agent study of RX-3117. Once the maximum tolerated
      dose is identified additional subjects will be treated in a dose expansion followed by a
      2-stage Phase 2 study. Subjects will be treated for up to 8 cycles of therapy. A cycle will
      be 4 weeks. RX-3117 dosing will be 3 times each week for 3 weeks follow by 1 week off
      treatment. All subjects will be followed for at least 30 days after the last dose of RX-3117.
