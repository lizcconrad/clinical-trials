      Purpose: This is an open label, single-arm, single-center study of the addition of metformin
      to standard levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LR-IUD) treatment of 30 evaluable
      non-surgical patients with either complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH; n=15) or grade 1
      endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC; n=15).

      Participants:Women, over the age of 18 years, with biopsy-proven CAH/EC who are not
      candidates for surgical management, and therefore are planned to start standard of care
      treatment with the LR-IUD

      Procedures (methods): subjects will be given oral metformin therapy for 12 months, or until
      disease progression occurs (whichever occurs first), in addition to LR-IUD treatment. Serial
      endometrial biopsies will be performed, as per standard of care, to assess disease status.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective

      -To compare the rate of CR at 6 months in non-surgical grade 1 EC and CAH patients receiving
      metformin + LR-IUD to 50%

      Secondary Objectives

        -  to estimate the rate of CR at 6 months separately in grade 1 EC and CAH patients
           receiving metformin + LR-IUD

        -  to estimate the rate of CR at 12 months in non-surgical grade 1 EC and CAH patients
           receiving metformin + LR-IUD

        -  to document patient adherence to long-term (≥3 months) metformin administration

        -  To describe safety of metformin + LR-IUD treatment

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To explore changes in cellular proliferation as measured by the marker, Ki-67, from
           baseline to 6 months

        -  To explore association between the level of expression of the metformin transporter
           proteins and key targets of the metformin/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
           pathway and CR status at 6 months

        -  To perform a comprehensive unbiased profiling of metabolites by analyzing the metabolic
           &quot;fingerprints&quot; of the biofluids (i.e. serum and urine) and &quot;footprints&quot; of the tumor
           tissue pre- and post- 6 months of metformin treatment

        -  To explore association between metabolic factors and metformin concentration levels in
           tumor tissue/blood/urine and CR at 6 months

      This is an open label, single-arm, single-center study of the addition of metformin to
      standard levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LR-IUD) treatment of 30 evaluable
      non-surgical patients with either complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH; n=15) or grade 1
      endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC; n=15). Women, over the age of 18 years, with biopsy-proven
      CAH/EC who are not candidates for surgical management, and therefore are planned to start
      standard of care treatment with the LR-IUD, will be given oral metformin therapy for 12
      months, or until disease progression occurs (whichever occurs first), in addition to LR-IUD
      treatment. Serial endometrial biopsies will be performed, as per standard of care, to assess
      disease status. We hypothesize that the addition of metformin to standard LR-IUD treatment of
      CAH and grade 1 EC will result in a complete response (CR) rate at 6 months that is
      significantly higher than 50% in a population of non-surgical candidates. In addition, we
      plan to estimate CR rate at 6 months in CAH and EC separately, and in the group as a whole at
      12 months. We will also document the rate of patient adherence to long-term metformin
      therapy.
