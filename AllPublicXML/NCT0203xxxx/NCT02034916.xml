    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-stage, 2-cohort Phase 2 trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer with a deleterious germline BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation. Subjects will be assigned to
      either Cohort 1 or 2 based on prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease:

        -  Cohort 1) Subjects with a documented PR or CR to a prior platinum-containing regimen for
           metastatic disease with disease progression &gt; 8 weeks following the last dose of
           platinum; or

        -  Cohort 2) Subjects who have received &gt; 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic
           disease and who have had no prior platinum therapy for metastatic disease

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until data cutoff date (01 Sep 2016)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR: Percentage of participants with a confirmed best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, including target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm) in short axis. PR: Greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. Response evaluation was done by an independent radiology facility (IRF).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate-24 (CBR-24)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until data cutoff date (01 Sep 2016)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR24: Percentage of participants with a best response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD) sustained for at least 24 weeks, as assessed by IRF using RECIST 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, including target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to &lt;10 mm in short axis. PR: &gt;=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. SD: Neither PR nor progression of disease (PD) criteria met. SD follow PR only when sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but previously seen 30% decrease from baseline no longer hold. PD: &gt;=20% increase (&gt;=5 mm absolute increase) in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>In this study, enrollment of participants was to be done in 2 stages for each of the two cohorts. Sufficient responses in each cohort were observed such that enrollment could proceed to Stage 2 for both cohorts. However, due to Sponsor decision, enrollment in the overall trial was terminated early.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Outcome in Response to Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Outcome of an AE was response to a question answered by the investigator: ‘Is the AE leading to study discontinuation or death?’ as ‘yes’.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever occurred first (up to data cutoff date [01 Sep 2016])</time_frame>
        <population>Safety population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of talazoparib. Here 'Overall Number of Participants Analyzed' signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a standardized instrument developed to assess the quality of life of people with cancer. EORTC-QLQ-C30 functional subscale includes 5 items: physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning. All of the single items of functional status subscale measures and global health status/QOL subscale range from 0 to 100, where higher scores represent a better level of functioning/quality of life.</description>

EORTC-QLQ-C30 functional subscale includes 5 items: physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning. All of the single items of functional status subscale measures and global health status/QOL subscale range from 0 to 100, where higher scores represent a better level of functioning/quality of life.</description>

        <description>Time to deterioration was defined as the time from baseline to day to death, first occurrence of progression, or a &gt;=10 point change from baseline in any of the symptom score based on the EORTC-QLQ-BR23, whichever occurred first. EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a disease-specific module for breast cancer developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer. EORTC-QLQ-BR23 symptoms subscale includes 4 items: systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, upset by hair loss. Each item is rated by choosing 1 of 4 possible responses that record the level of intensity (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, and 4= very much) within each scale.</description>
