  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this clinical trial is to generate additional safety data in a highly
      immunocompromised population. HIV-infected persons are considered excellent candidates to
      represent the highly immunocompromised population for enrolment in this trial. Additionally,
      the immune system's response (protection against smallpox as measured by the amount of
      antibodies produced) following injections of MVA-BN® smallpox vaccine will be evaluated. All
      participants in this trial will be randomly and evenly assigned to one of three groups to
      receive two, three or four injections. Group 1 will receive the standard regime consisting of
      one dose at each vaccination time point, Group 2 will receive two doses at each vaccination
      time point and Group 3 will receive a booster vaccination 12 weeks after the first dose of
      the standard vaccination schedule with MVA-BN® smallpox vaccine. Participation in the trial
      is scheduled to last up to 48 weeks.
