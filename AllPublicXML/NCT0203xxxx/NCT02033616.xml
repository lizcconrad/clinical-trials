  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind study in which approximately 99 study patients will be randomized in a
      2:1 ratio to receive either AVOVA-1 or MC. Patients eligible for randomization and treatment
      will be those (1) who have undergone debulking surgery, (2) for whom a cell line has been
      established, (3) who have undergone leukapheresis from which sufficient PMBC were obtained,
      and (4) have an ECOG performance grade of 0 or 1 (Karnofsky score of 70-100%).

      The primary endpoint of this trial is death from any cause with the metric of OS from the
      date of randomization. PFS will be a secondary endpoint and will be calculated as the time
      from the date of randomization for treatment until subjective tumor progression or death.
      Progression will be subjectively defined by the treating physician, and is expected to be
      based on tumor marker levels (e.g. CA-125) and/or imaging. Secondarily, we will also define
      PFS and OS from the date of debulking surgery.

      Patients will be stratified into (1) no evidence of disease (NED) (no measurable or
      non-measurable disease per RECIST and normal CA-125 levels) or (2) non-NED (measurable or
      non-measurable disease per RECIST or elevated CA-125 levels).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1 (Karnofsky score of 70-100%)

          -  Successful establishment of an autologous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or
             primary peritoneal cancer cell line by AIVITA Biomedical, Inc.

          -  Patients must previously have been staged as having stage III [intraperitoneal (IP)]
             or Stage IV (distant metastatic) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
             cancer, have undergone surgical debulking, and have initiated or completed standard
             adjuvant chemotherapy, which may include intravenous (IV) and/or IP chemotherapy using
             standard regimens. Patients will be characterized as being NED or non-NED per physical
             exam, CT and/or PET scans, and CA-125.

          -  Have undergone leukapheresis from which sufficient provided PBMC were obtained to
             produce an investigational treatment.

          -  Patients with one or a few brain metastases that have been treated with stereotactic
             radiotherapy consisting of a single dose, such as Gamma Knife or Cyberknife, are
             allowed to be included in the study, but need wait one week after such treatment.

          -  Written informed consent for treatment with investigational treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known to have active hepatitis B or C or HIV

          -  ECOG performance status greater than 1 (Karnofsky score less than 70%).

          -  Known underlying cardiac disease associated with myocardial dysfunction that requires
             active medical treatment, or unstable angina related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular
             disease, or under treatment for arterial or venous peripheral vascular disease

          -  Diagnosis of any other invasive cancer or other disease process which is considered to
             be life-threatening within the next five years, and/or taking anti-cancer therapy for
             cancer other than ovarian (such as continuation of hormonal therapy for prostate or
             breast cancer diagnosed more than five years earlier).

          -  Active infection or other active medical condition that could be eminently
             life-threatening, including active blood clotting or bleeding diathesis.

          -  Active central nervous system metastases at the time of treatment.

          -  Known autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, or disease process that involves the use
             of immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  Received another investigational drug within 28 days of the first dose or are planning
             to receive another investigational drug while receiving this investigational
             treatment.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to GM-CSF
