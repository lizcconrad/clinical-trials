      This is a double blind randomized study with control group. The population is patients in
      intensive care unit of Shahid Beheshti hospital of Babol city. Main include criteria are
      18-55 years old, need to having urine catheter for 10 days at least and no urinary infection
      in catheterization time. Main exclude criteria are appearing genital wound, allergic or
      dermatitis disorders. Sample size include 105 patients dividing in three equal groups of
      Povidone-iodine, Chlorhexidine and Normal saline randomly. Interventions are Washing perinea
      area and catheter first 5 centimeters by 15 ml of Povidone-iodine 10%, Chlorhexidine .2% or
      Normal saline .9%, 3 times a day for 10 days. Urine analysis are performed in days 1,3,5,7
      and 9 after catheterization and urine cultures are performed in days 5 and 10 after
      catheterization for detection of bacteriuria and microorganism type.
