    <textblock>
      Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) encompasses all pathological processes that affect the
      small vessels of the brain. On brain-MRI cSVD is characterized by structural brain
      abnormalities such as white matter lesions (WMLs). Clinically, cSVD is related to acute
      syndromes as lacunar stroke but also to more chronic health problems such as cognitive
      decline. Recent literature suggests that a disrupted blood brain barrier (BBB), leading to
      elevated BBB permeability, may play a pivotal role in the aetiology of cSVD and lacunar
      stroke. The BBB is a complex system of neuronal, glial and vascular cells which main function
      is to shield the brain from toxic components and regulate the homeostasis. Elucidating the
      role of the BBB may have far reaching consequences for the treatment of cSVD patients and the
      reduction of recurrence rate of the disease. This could lead to a better quality of life
      among cSVD patients and reduce the economic burden on society. Currently the exact
      contribution and extent of a possibly defective BBB in cSVD remains largely unclear, due to
      the lack of a reliable method to accurately quantify the BBB permeability in cSVD patients.
      As a result, the current treatment consists of treating the cardiovascular risk factors,
      often with poor results.

      Quantification of the BBB permeability provides an objective measure of the integrity of the
      BBB and as such aids the study of the role of the BBB. The aim of this study is to realize a
      clinically applicable MRI-method to quantify the BBB permeability. Moreover, the method can
      be used to study the involvement of BBB disruption in other neuropathologies including
      Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, hypertension and diabetes.

      Primary Study Objective:

      To realize a clinically applicable quantification of BBB permeability using DCE-MRI by
      determining the reproducibility of the DCE-MRI method

      Secondary Study Objective:

      To achieve the shortest scan duration without compromising the reliability of the BBB
      permeability quantification.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Using an optimized DCE-MRI method to quantify the BBB permeability, the BBB permeability
           can be reliably determined in cSVD patients.

        2. The scan duration can be shortened without compromising the reliability of the BBB
           permeability quantification.
