    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a combination of two different drugs -
      trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (T-DM1) and BYL719 is safe, and if it might be effective in treating
      metastatic breast cancer. T-DM1 is a type of drug that contains an antibody (trastuzumab)
      linked to chemotherapy. The antibody in T-DM1 targets a marker on breast cancer cells called
      HER2, which allows the drug to go directly to the cancer cells. The use of T-DM1 in this
      study is considered standard treatment for the type of cancer in this study. Participants in
      this study have already been treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the past, and their
      cancer has gotten worse in spite of those treatments. BYL719 is an oral drug (taken by mouth)
      that the researchers think may help T-DM1 to work better.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety, tolerability, feasibility, and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of
      dose-escalating BYL719 in combination with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with
      HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after progression on trastuzumab and
      taxane-based therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of BYL719 administered in combination with T-DM1.

      II. Assess any preliminary evidence of efficacy of BYL719 and T-DM1 in combination in
      patients with HER2-positive MBC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore efficacy in patients whose tumors have an alteration (mutation or amplification)
      of the PIK3CA gene and decrease of phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) expression.
      (Optional) II. Examine other v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt)/mechanistic
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream markers by immunohistochemistry. (Optional)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BYL719.

      Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BYL719 orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and ado-trastuzumab
      emtansine (T-DM1) intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

                            are not allowed as the sole method of contraception, as BYL719 has not
                            been characterized with respect to its potential to interfere with the
