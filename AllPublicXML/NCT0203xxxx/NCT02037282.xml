  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite currently available antivirals, influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality,
      with 226,000 excess hospitalizations and 30,000-50,000 deaths each year in the United States
      alone, and more therapies are needed in the armamentarium of anti-influenza medications
      including humoral immunity-based agents.

      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of an anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous
      immunoglobulin. Beginning with a low dose, subjects will receive anti-influenza intravenous
      immunoglobulin (FLU-IVIG) and evaluated on Study Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. The safety and
      tolerability is evaluated using symptoms, clinical laboratory tests, and pharmacokinetics.
      Utilizing serum antibody responses as determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays,
      the dose will be escalated as immunogenicity is established....

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 50 years

               2. Weight less than or equal to 100 kg

               3. Patients must be willing to forgo the seasonal influenza vaccine for 28 days, and
                  the MMR and varicella vaccines for 3 months post infusion of the study drug

               4. Females who are able to become pregnant (i.e., are not postmenopausal, have not
                  undergone surgical sterilization, and are sexually active with men) must agree to
                  use at least 1 effective form of contraception from the date of the subject s
                  signing of the informed consent form through 28 days after the dose of the study
                  drug

        EXCLUSION CRIATERIA:

          1. Any chronic medical problem that requires daily oral medications (except Tylenol, oral
             contraceptives, vitamins, and seasonal allergy medications), or other medical history
             that in the opinion of the investigator significantly increases the risk associated
             with IVIG

          2. Women who are breast-feeding

          3. Positive urine or serum pregnancy test

          9. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 60 mL/min at screening, calculated using

             0) through 28 days after the dose of the study drug

         18. Presence of any pre-existing illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             place the patient at an unreasonably increased risk through participation in this
