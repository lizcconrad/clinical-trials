    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, cross-sectional observational single centre study to assess the
      feasibility of intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) of breast cancer wide
      local excision (WLE) specimens and dissected lymph nodes. The samples will be imaged using
      the LightPathTM Imaging System. The LightPathTM Imaging System which consists of a
      light-tight box on which are mounted an ultra-sensitive lens and radiation-shielded camera.
      This study will measure the correlation between margin status of the WLE specimen and the
      metastatic status of dissected lymph nodes as determined by the LightPathTM Imaging System
      and by histopathology. This is a pilot study to assess feasibility before proceeding to a
      pivotal study to evaluate the benefits of the LightPathTM Imaging System in clinical
      practice.

      Subject's blood glucose level will be measured on the day of surgery. Subjects with a blood
      glucose level &lt; 12 mmol/l receive an intravenous injection of 5 MBq/kg, up to a maximum 300
      MBq of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) prior to surgery. Breast cancer surgery will be
      performed per standard of care. SLNB will be performed using a dose of 150 MBq technetium 99
      (99mTc) nanocolloid and patent blue dye. The resected WLE specimen and lymph nodes will be
      imaged in the LightPathTM Imaging System. A member of the research team who is not the
      operating surgeon will capture LightPathTM images intra-operatively.

      Prior to CLI, the WLE specimen will be placed in a specimen holder. CLI is performed
      according to the LightPathTM Imaging System instructions for use. All CLI will be performed
      between 1 and 3 hours post injection of 18F-FDG.

      The WLE specimen will then undergo standard of care histopathological analysis with a
      positive margin defined as either invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
      within 2mm of the specimen surface. Lymph nodes will also be examined according to standard
      of care histopathological analysis.

      The CLI results will not be used to influence any surgical or clinical decision-making.

      All staff in the operating theatre and the recovery area caring for the patient, and
      pathology staff processing surgical specimens will wear badge dosimeters. Staff handling
      surgical specimens will also wear ring dosimeters.
