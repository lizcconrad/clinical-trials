    <textblock>
      The recommended length of antibiotic treatment to patients with infective endocarditis is 4-6
      weeks. All patients receive the same dosis except for those with renal impairment who receive
      a smaller dose. For Beta-lactam antibiotics, a plasma concentration above the minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) for at least 50% of the time in a dosing interval maximize
      bactericidal activity. To estimate the time for which the antibiotic concentration is above
      the MIC (T&gt;MIC) and to see if there might be a relationship between the concentration of
      antibiotics and possible side-effects, toxicity and treatment failure, all patients admitted
      with infective endocarditis will be followed and have two blood tests withdrawn once a week
      during antibiotic treatment, an expected average of 5 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comorbidity is common in patients admitted with infective endocarditis and this may effect
      the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics. The same dose of antibiotics may therefore result in
      different plasma concentrations in different patients, and this might influence possible
      side-effects, toxicity and treatment failure.

      To investigate this further, all patients admitted with infective endocarditis, treated with
      Beta-lactam antibiotics, will be followed and have two blood tests withdrawn once a week
      during antibiotic treatment, an expected average of 5 weeks. Beta-lactam is administered
      every 6th hour. The first blood test will be withdrawn three hours after antibiotic infusion.
      The second blood test will be withdrawn right before the next antibiotic infusion. There is
      no intervention in the study, the results are observational. The results will contribute to
      assess the efficacy and quality of the treatment and help evaluate whether plasma
      concentration of antibiotics should be taken as a routine blood test every week in patients
      with infective endocarditis.
