    <textblock>
      This study will assess the absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of lesinurad and
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of lesinurad and [14C]lesinurad in healthy adult
      male subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study a single dose of lesinurad will be administered after an overnight fast
      followed by a single 15-minute infusion of a radiolabeled intravenous micro tracer dose of
      [14C]lesinurad to assess the in vivo performance of lesinurad.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a body weight ≥ 50 kg (110 lbs) and body mass index ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2.

          -  Subject is free of any clinically significant disease or medical condition, per the
             Investigator's judgment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history or suspicion of kidney stones.

          -  Subject has undergone major surgery within 3 months prior to Screening.

          -  Subject donated blood or experienced significant blood loss (&gt;450 mL) within 12 weeks
             prior to Screening or gave a plasma donation within 4 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Subject has inadequate venous access or unsuitable veins for repeated venipuncture.

          -  Subject does not have a normal or clinically acceptable physical examination, per the
             Investigator's judgment.

          -  Subject has clinically relevant abnormalities in blood pressure, heart rate, or body
             temperature, per the Investigator's judgment.

          -  Subject has Screening clinical safety laboratory parameters (serum chemistry,
             hematology, or urinalysis) that are outside the normal limits and are considered
             clinically significant by the Investigator.

          -  Subject has clinically relevant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram, per the
             Investigator's judgment.

          -  Subject has a Screening serum urate level &gt; 7 mg/dL.

          -  Subject had radiation exposure that exceeds 5 mSv in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in
             the last 5 years. This includes radiation exposure from the present study or other
             clinical studies, including diagnostic X-rays and other medical exposures but
             excluding exposure to background radiation. No occupationally exposed worker, as
             defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999, shall participate in the study.
