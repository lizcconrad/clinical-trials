    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of 2
      Canagliflozin/extended release Metformin (CANA/MET XR) fixed dose combination tablets (150
      mg/1,000 mg each) following once-daily oral dosing in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (physicians and participants know the identity of the assigned
      treatment), multiple-dose, single-center, pharmacokinetic study of a fixed dose combination
      (FDC) of 150 mg/1,000 mg Canagliflozin/extended release Metformin (CANA/MET XR) tablets. The
      study will consist of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of approximately 3 weeks, an Open-Label
      Treatment Phase, (when the participants will be confined to the study center for 11 days),
      and a Follow-up Phase of about 10 days. The total duration of the study will be about 42 days
      for each participant. During the Open-Label Treatment Phase, approximately 12 healthy adult
      participants will receive a single oral dose of 2 CANA/MET XR tablets once daily for 7 days
      after a provided dinner. Participants will be required to fast from the end of lunch until
      the dinner (a period of at least 6.5 hours) on Days 1 and 7 only.
