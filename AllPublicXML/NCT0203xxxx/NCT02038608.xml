  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is characterized by a large number of non motor, especially
      neuropsychiatric, signs. Their pathophysiology is complex but the role of dopaminergic and
      serotoninergic systems dysfunction is suggested by several studies. In addition, the
      serotoninergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of dyskinesias. Very few studies
      have analyzed the abnormalities of these two neurotransmission systems at disease onset, in
      de novo PD patients. Furthermore, the parallel evolution of the degeneration of the
      dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems with disease progression remains unknown. Thus the
      present study aims at determining, by using PET and 11C-PE2I and 11C-DASB the respective role
      of the serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems dysfunction in motor and non motor
      manifestations in PD, at different evolution stages.
