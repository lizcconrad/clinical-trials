  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim was to test if interpersonal relationships group strategies provided by nursing can
      promote an additional benefit on blood pressure (BP) control and quality of life (QoL) in
      hypertensive patients. Methods: 21 treated patients were randomized into two groups: Group A
      10 patients (8 women), underwent to a health educational orientation program
      (inter-relational strategy), with group meetings every 15 days during 4 months(8 meetings).
      Group B 11 patients (7 women), who underwent group orientation by the nurse every 40 days
      during 4 months (3 meetings). Both groups received the same content guidelines (healthy
      lifestyle and prevention of risk factors). The patients had 2 visits by nurses at baseline
      (15 days) and at the final study (120 days). BP was measured by auscultatory method and QoL
      questionnaire (WHOQoL-Brief)was applied. The dispensing and pill counts were done every 30
      days. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed at baseline and after 120
      days.

    <description>At the first nurse interview (day 0: randomization) three consecutive measurements of BP were taken after the patient had rested for 5 min in the supine position.Ambulatory BP monitoring was recorded at 15 and 180 days of follow-up for 24 h with a noninvasive ABPM (Space Labs 90207 monitor; Space Labs, Redmond, WA) with an appropriate-sized cuff. The monitor was placed on the nondominant arm and was set to take BP readings every 10 min during the day and every 20 min at night</description>

    <measure>QoL questionnaire (WHOQoL-Brief)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the first nurse interview (day 0: randomization), a questionnaire was used to obtain information related to general data, habits, history of disease, other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and prescribed medications. This questionnaire was used only to characterize the adherence behavior and the risk factors at the beginning the study, but was not used to evaluate modifications of behavior during the study.</description>
