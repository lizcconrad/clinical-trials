    <textblock>
      an open-label, multi-centre, randomized, phase II study evaluating efficacy of erlotinib
      monotherapy vs. docetaxel plus cisplatin chemotherapy.

      Patients with histological documented stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma. The tumor specimens
      were examined for EGFR gene mutation (Exon 18-21).

      Those with exon 19 deletion and L858R, G719X, L861Q mutation were randomized as erlotinib
      monotherapy or docetaxel plus cisplatin chemotherapy.

      The randomization will be stratified by center

      Study treatment Patients will receive treatment for 9 weeks unless disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity or death.

      Erlotinib arm:

      Patients in erlotinib arm will take erlotinib 150mg/day for 9 weeks unless disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or death.

      Chemotherapy arm:

      Patients in chemotherapy arm will then receive 3 cycles (9 weeks) of chemotherapy with
      docetaxel 35mg/m2 IV on day 1 and day 8, and cisplatin 75mg/m2 on day 8.

      Treatment failure will include patients who fail to complete 3 cycles (9 weeks) of study
      treatments due to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with no disease progression after terminating study treatment will undergo surgical
      resection and be followed until disease progression is noted, or study end. Survival will be
      recorded and analyzed.

      If progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity occurs during study treatments, patients will
      be treated at discretion of investigator according to local protocol.

      Please note:

      • If it is judged by the investigator to be in the best interest of the patient, patients
      discontinuing study treatment may receive second-line treatment.
