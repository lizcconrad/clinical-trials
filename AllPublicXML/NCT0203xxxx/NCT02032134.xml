  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing need for blood components and the increasingly careful donor selection
      procedures, make the availability of blood components very reduced, in particular for
      platelets that are currently administered preferably &quot;fresh&quot; or cryopreserved, only in
      emergency conditions.

      Exceeding this limit through the spread of use of cryopreserved platelets in the common
      clinical practice, might help clinicians to avoid wasting valuable products and face periods
      of particular shortage of donors Some studies already published in the literature over the
      last decade (1,2) have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of autologous cryopreserved
      platelets .

      The main objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of platelets,
      cryopreserved with DMSO using a a new method, in patients with severe thrombocytopenia.

      This is the in vivo phase of a study where availability and efficacy of cryopreserved
      platelets has been assessed in vitro.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy and safety in the
      recipients of platelets obtained from buffy coat of multiple donors (five), cryopreserved
      with DMSO using a new patented method, up to 9 months from the collection.

      Further goals are the registration of any related- adverse event (idiosyncrasy, allergy,
      toxicity)
