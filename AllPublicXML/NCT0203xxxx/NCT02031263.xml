    <textblock>
      The investigators will find out if bronchial thermoplasty shows efficacy in reducing acute
      exacerbation and improving quality of life for uncontrolled asthma in Korea through this
      research. US FDA approved this procedure and CE mark was taken in Europe. Many procedure was
      performed in Western countries.

      Korean FDA have approved this procedure in 2013. However, no procedure was performed in
      Korea, and the data is rare in Asian countries. In this study, investigators will examine the
      efficacy of this procedure in Korean asthmatics.
