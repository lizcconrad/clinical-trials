  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) and large artery damage is a major factor that contributes to death. Metabolic
      acidosis is a common complication of CKD resulting from an inability of the diseased kidney
      to excrete the daily dietary acid load and it is associated with all-cause mortality in
      patients with CKD. However, the effect of treatment of metabolic acidosis with oral sodium
      bicarbonate on endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness in patients with CKD has not
      been evaluated. The investigators propose a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label
      14-week crossover pilot study examining the effect of treatment of metabolic acidosis with
      oral sodium bicarbonate on vascular endothelial function in 20 patients with CKD stage IV
      with metabolic acidosis.
