  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare-associated infections are a major cause of morbidity among critically ill
      patients. Bathing critically ill patients with cloths impregnated with the broad-spectrum
      antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine-gluconate may decrease healthcare-associated infections.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily bathing with disposable
      chlorhexidine-impregnated bathing cloths, as compared to daily bathing with disposable
      standard non-chlorhexidine-impregnated bathing cloths, on the rates of healthcare-associated
      infections in critically-ill patients.

      Hypothesis: Daily bathing of the skin with chlorhexidine-impregnated bathing cloths will
      result in reduced rates of healthcare-associated infections in patients admitted to intensive
      care units (ICU).

    <description>Patients in an ICU randomized to treatment arm 1 will be bathed with single use, no rinse, disposable cloths impregnated with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution (Sage速 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cloths). Bathing of the skin of the arms, chest, abdomen, back, both legs, perineum, and buttocks will be performed daily and as needed after patients become soiled. The face and neck will not be bathed in this manner but will be bathed with water-moistened washcloths. All other infection control and cleaning procedures will be performed per the current practice in each intensive care unit.</description>
