  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, phase 2 study to assess the feasibility of using
      cabozantinib in recurrent/metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma patients that progressed after
      platinum-based therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cabozantinib (XL184) is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and was approved
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 29 November 2012 for the treatment of
      patients with progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. It is commercially available
      as COMETRIQ™ in the United States.

      During the Pre Treatment Period, participants are consented and qualified (screened) for the
      study. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.

      Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days, during which time the participant will be taking the
      study drug, cabozantinib, once daily. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary
      for each treatment cycle. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the
      study drug.

      - Participants will be followed for 8 weeks after removal from study or until death,
      whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will
      be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Merkel Cell Carcinoma that is
             metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or
             are no longer effective

          -  Must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm with
             conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan (see section 10 for the
             evaluation of measureable disease). Tumors within a previously irradiated field will
             be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented

          -  Must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of
             primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin or another organoplatinum compound.
             Patients are also eligible if they received curative intent platinum-based therapy and
             progressed within a year of therapy

          -  No prior MET inhibitor is allowed

          -  At least 2 weeks since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. At least 3 weeks since
             prior biologics or investigational agents

          -  Recovery from effects of recent treatment to baseline or CTCAE ≤ grade 1 toxicity from
             all prior therapies except alopecia and other non-clinically significant AEs
