  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of a safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine strategy would probably be the best
      solution for the ultimate control of the worldwide AIDS pandemic. Heterologous prime-boost
      immunisations are today considered promising HIV prophylactic vaccine strategies. It is thus
      relevant to pursue the development of different candidate vaccines in prime-boost vaccine
      strategies to identify the most promising prime-boost combinations and to integrate
      scientific inquiry into trial protocols from the beginning to maximize learning
      opportunities.

      Phase I/II, multicenter, national, open-label, randomized trial HIV including 4 prophylactic
      prime-boost HIV vaccines strategies:

      Volunteers are randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio at trial entry to 4 parallel arms with
      the following prime-boost strategies:

      Arm 1. MVA HIV-B primes at Week 0 and Week 8 + LIPO-5 boosts at Week 20 and Week 28 Arm 2.
      LIPO-5 primes at Week 0 and Week 8 + MVA HIV-B boosts at Week 20 and Week 28 Arm 3.
      GTU-MultiHIV B primes at Week 0, Week 4 and Week 12 + LIPO-5 boosts at Week 20 and Week 28
      Arm 4. GTU-MultiHIV B primes at Week 0, Week 4 and Week 12 + MVA HIV-B boosts at Week 20 and
