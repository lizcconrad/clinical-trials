  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to study the impact of BIA screening on anxiety and primary prevention strategies
      for lymphedema development among patients with recent surgery for breast cancer. Currently,
      professional societies recommend scheduled follow-up visits to screen for lymphedema after
      recovery from breast cancer (e.g., 6-week, 3-month, 6-month visits with a certified
      lymphedema therapist). Screening involves a discussion of lymphedema symptoms and risk
      reduction strategies, measurement of the affected limb with a tape measure, and physical
      inspection for physical changes consistent with lymphedema. In the proposed study, patients
      will be randomly assigned to the addition of BIA screening vs. usual care. At each screening
      visit, all patients will be assessed for their current lymphedema risk behaviors, as outlined
      by the National Lymphedema Network (7). To evaluate anxiety levels, all patients will be
      asked to fill out the Beck Anxiety Inventory, a validated screening tool used in prior
      studies of patients with breast cancer (8,9). This questionnaire will be administered at each
      follow-up lymphedema screening visit, and the baseline will be administered at the
      preoperative visit. For patients randomly assigned to BIA screening, this involves the
      placement of adhesive electrodes on the each wrist and an ankle, followed by connection of
      the electrodes to the BIA machine, which then uses a painless electrical impulse to measure
      impedance of flow and thus asymmetry in the extracellular lymphedema volume between the 2
      upper limbs (6,10). Statistical analysis will involve comparison of lymphedema risk behaviors
      and anxiety levels between those patients with vs. without BIA screening.
