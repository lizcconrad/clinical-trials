  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to demonstrate that epidural stimulation (ES) can be used to recover significant
      levels of autonomic control of cardiovascular and respiratory function as well as the ability
      to voluntarily control leg movements below the injury level. This intervention would provide
      an immediate therapeutic alternative to individuals who now have no recourse for treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll 4 research participants who have sustained a motor complete SCI to participate
      in the proposed experiments. Participants will be screened for eligibility, followed by 80
      days of usual care, epidural implantation, 80 days of cardiovascular epidural stimulation
      training, 80 days of voluntary movement (VM) epidural stimulation training and finally 80
      days of stand epidural stimulation training. These interventions are done in sequential
      order, however they are cumulative. In between each intervention, participants will undergo
      motor and cardiovascular experiments and assessments.
