  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are recruiting for a chronic hives study. This research is being done to
      test whether an investigational drug called AstraZeneca drug (AZD)1981 may be helpful for
      treating people with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria who continue to have symptoms despite
      taking antihistamines. The word &quot;investigational&quot; means that AZD1981 is not approved for
      marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is allowing the use of AZD1981
      in this study.

      People with chronic hives lasting for at least 6 months and without a known cause may join.
      The study involves 6 visits over 8 weeks. Approximately 48 participants expected to take part
      in this study at the Johns Hopkins Asthma and Allergy Clinic. All participants will be
      treated with the study medication and/or placebo for 8 weeks.

      The results of this trial may have a benefit others with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria who
      don't respond well to antihistamines by generating experience and data to support the design
      of a larger, multicenter trial investigating the efficacy of AZD1981 in treating
      antihistamine refractory CIU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use AZD1981 in subjects with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU)
      who are otherwise uncontrolled on first-line, oral antihistamine therapy. The skin lesion
      pathology in CIU shows a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes (both Th2 and Th1),
      eosinophils, and basophils, and closely resembles an allergen-induced late-phase reaction.
      Further, murine studies show that the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed
      on Th2 (CRTh2) pathway is important in leukocyte recruitment following allergen challenge of
      the skin. Our proposed hypothesis is that AZD1981 in CIU will reduce CRTh2-expressing,
      leukocyte recruitment to the skin and reduce leukocyte activation through CRTh2, thus
      reducing the signs and symptoms in CIU refractory to control with antihistamines.

    <measure>The Change in Diary-based Clinical Symptoms as Measured by the Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS score, which is the sum of pruritus and hives, will be used to calculate the UAS7. UAS is a validated measure of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) disease activity which scores the intensity of pruritus (0-3, with 0 = no itch and 3 is severe itch) and number of hives (0-3 0 means no hives and 3 means greater than 50 hives) with a maximum value of 6 for a given day. The UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UAS scores (average of a.m. and p.m.) for 7 days with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum value of 42. The UAS7 is a sum of the daily average (average of a.m. and p.m.) for 7 days. The baseline score was established during the second placebo therapy week and compared to the final week of the 4 week active treatment period.</description>

    <measure>The Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of AZD1981 will be assessed using the following outcome measures: incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, clinical laboratory measures, and vital signs. In particular we will measure CBC's with differential at baseline and week 4 and liver function tests every 2 weeks based on past trial experience of dose-related toxicity.</description>

        <title>The Change in Diary-based Clinical Symptoms as Measured by the Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7)</title>
        <description>The UAS score, which is the sum of pruritus and hives, will be used to calculate the UAS7. UAS is a validated measure of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) disease activity which scores the intensity of pruritus (0–3, with 0 = no itch and 3 is severe itch) and number of hives (0–3 0 means no hives and 3 means greater than 50 hives) with a maximum value of 6 for a given day. The UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UAS scores (average of a.m. and p.m.) for 7 days with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum value of 42. The UAS7 is a sum of the daily average (average of a.m. and p.m.) for 7 days. The baseline score was established during the second placebo therapy week and compared to the final week of the 4 week active treatment period.</description>
