      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of 12 week lifestyle intervention on
      diabetes risk in obese Latino adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in the United States has reached epidemic proportions and Latinos youth are
      disproportionally impacted. Pediatric obesity is associated with several chronic health
      conditions including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, very few interventions
      specifically targeting diabetes prevention for obese Latino adolescents have been developed.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects a culturally-grounded,
      community-based lifestyle intervention on psychosocial and health outcomes among obese Latino
      adolescents. Eligible participants of this study will be randomly selected to the
      intervention group or the delayed-intervention group (control group) after an initial health
      screening for eligibility.

      Participants selected to the intervention group will attend weekly healthy lifestyle
      education sessions with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and three physical activity sessions /
      week with other youth. After which, participants will attend monthly booster group meetings
      for three months.

      All participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for insulin
      sensitivity, glucose tolerance, quality of life, fitness, and nutrition and physical activity
      behaviors.

    <description>Youth participants randomized to participate in the experimental group will attend weekly healthy lifestyles education session with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and will also attend exercise sessions 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The education sessions will cover topics such as healthy eating choices, roles and responsibilities of both parents and youth in the realm of the family unit as well as in youth's own health, and self esteem among other topics. The exercise sessions will incorporate both aerobic and resistance training as well as other &quot;free-play&quot; physical activities i.e. basketball, volleyball etc.</description>
