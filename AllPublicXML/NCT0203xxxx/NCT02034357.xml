  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of sleep and breathing problems during
      sleep on memory, attention, and general well being (quality of life) in people with Parkinson
      Disease.

      During the 2 year award period, we will prospectively enroll 200 patients with idiopathic
      Parkinson Disease (PD), who meet eligibility criteria below. All patients will undergo a
      baseline polysomnography (PSG) to diagnose Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) and will be asked
      to complete validated questionnaires to measure Sleep Quality, SDB risk, insomnia severity,
      daytime sleepiness, presence of restless leg syndrome (RLS), anxiety/depression, and quality
      of life. Medical records will be reviewed to determine co-morbidities and medication use.
      Each PD participant will undergo a full neurological examination, including the Unified
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage and a battery of
      neuro-cognitive measures at baseline. Patients with SDB will be offered PAP titration and
      treatment for 4 months. All patients (SDB [PAP compliant, non-compliant], and no SDB
      [controls]) will complete repeat neuro-cognitive evaluation, questionnaires, neurological
      evaluation and UPDRS assessment at 4 month and at 1 year follow-up. PD participants will be
      assessed in the &quot;on&quot; state in the morning. In the event that a participant goes &quot;off&quot; during
      testing, a break will be taken and participants will be given the option of taking their
      medication to return to the &quot;on&quot; state and resume testing or they can return later in the
      week to complete the evaluation. Although participants will understand the general purpose of
      the study, they will be blinded to the major study hypothesis. Neuropsychological examiners
      and the neurologist conducting the neurological exam will be blinded to the SDB status of the
      patient. Four month follow-up will be staggered according to enrolment date and will be
      completed by Year 2.
