    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioavailability of Apixaban oral solution
      administered through an Nasogastric Tube (NGT) in the presence of Boost® Plus and Apixaban
      administered as crushed tablet through a nasogastric tube relative to Apixaban solution
      administered orally in healthy subjects.
