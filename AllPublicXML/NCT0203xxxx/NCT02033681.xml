  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to know the characteristic of &quot;one-per-mil&quot; tumescent solution in
      regards of the optimal time delay to achieve optimal visualization of operation field in hand
      and digit surgery.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Epinephine in &quot;one-per-mil&quot; concentration by tumescent injection technique will provide
           faster decrease in oxygen saturation compared to normal saline solution injected by
           tumescent technique.

        2. Epinephrine in &quot;one-per-mil&quot; concentration by tumescent injection technique will provide
           effectiveness in vasoconstriction longer than 10 minutes as the optimal time delay.

        3. Epinephine in &quot;one-per-mil&quot; concentration by tumescent injection technique causes no
           finger necrosis as normal saline solution injected by tumescent technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to measure the optimal time delay of
      1:1,000,000 epinephrine in saline solution injected by tumescent technique until maximum
      vasocontriction in the distal finger is achieved.

      Subjects will be injected in both his ring fingers(distal phalanges, volar side) with
      randomized solutions, one containing &quot;one-per-mil&quot; tumescent solution and the other
      containing only normal saline solution; information which both the injector and examiner are
      blinded from. Maximum vasoconstriction of the finger injected is depicted by the lowest
      oxygen saturation (recorded every minute until 45 minutes using pulse oxymeter).

    <description>After being injected with the solution, the ring finger is put on a continuous monitoring of pulse oxymeter, while the examiner records the decrease of oxygen saturation every minute until 45 minutes length of time. The time when lowest oxygen saturation is achieved is recorded, depicting the optimal time delay to achieve maximum vasoconstriction of the finger after injection.</description>

    <measure>Pain Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pain sensation of the finger's pulp was examined (using VAS) and recorded every 15 minutes. These data will be compared to the baseline data prior to injection.</description>

    <measure>Tactile Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile sensation of the finger's pulp was examined (using Semmes Weinstein Touch Test) and recorded every 15 minutes after the injection. We will compare this data with the baseline data collected prior to injection.</description>

    <time_frame>45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After injection, temperature of fingertip is measured and recorded every 15 minutes for total time of 45 minutes. The data will be compared with baseline temperature recorded before injection</description>
