  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the safety and feasibility of a new treatment for adolescents who are slow to recover
      from a sport-related concussion, the investigators are conducting a randomised controlled
      trial comparing treatment as usual with an active rehabilitation program that involves
      sub-symptom threshold cardiac exertion, sport-specific coordination activities, and positive
      visualisation techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most adolescents recover within the first month following a sport-related concussion.
      However, some do not. Little is known about how to best facilitate recovery when symptoms do
      not resolve spontaneously and swiftly. Although active rehabilitation has been recently
      suggested as a promising means of promoting recovery, current literature does not provide
      adequate evidence for safe adaptation into clinical practice.

      Objective: The purpose of this project is to evaluate an active rehabilitation protocol for
      adolescents who are slow to recover following sport-related concussion. Primary aims: to
      confirm the tolerability and safety of the active rehabilitation protocol as compared to
      treatment as usual controls. Secondary aims: 1) to document the impact of active
      rehabilitation on post-concussion symptoms and return to activity; 2) to explore the
      intervention effects on quality of life, mood, energy level, balance, cognitive functioning,
      and return to pre-injury activities.

      Study design: A parallel group open label randomized comparison trial of 30 adolescents who
      are slow to recover following sport-related concussion. After initial screening and
      assessment, both groups will receive treatment as usual. Participants in the experimental
      group will also participate in sub-symptom threshold exercise, sport-specific coordination
      practice, and positive visualisation daily.

      Outcome measures: The investigators will monitor for adverse events and assess
      post-concussion symptoms throughout the study as a primary marker of recovery. The
      investigators will also report secondary outcomes such as quality of life, mood, energy
      level, balance and cognitive functioning. Finally the investigators will record rates of
      return to school (full time, part time) and rates of return to sport (regular pre-injury vs.
      modified level). As a result, clinicians will be able to follow a new rehabilitation protocol
      in a safe and meaningful way. Lastly, research findings will be disseminated in the form of a
      publication, at conferences, and via in-services.

      Hypotheses:

      1a. The drop-out rate will be comparable in the groups receiving treatment-as-usual (TAU)
      only versus TAU plus active rehabilitation.

      1b. Adverse events occurring outside of the clinic will be comparable in the groups receiving
      TAU only versus TAU plus active rehabilitation.

      1c. For the group receiving active rehabilitation, symptom exacerbations in the in-clinic
      exercise sessions will resolve within 30 minutes.

      2. Participants receiving active rehabilitation will report greater improvement of
      post-concussion symptoms (primary outcome) at follow-up.

      3. Participants receiving active rehabilitation will report higher quality of life, fewer
      depressive symptoms, and higher energy levels; demonstrate better balance and
      neuropsychological performance at follow-up; and return to their pre-injury activities at
      higher rates.

    <description>The Post-Concussion Scale consists of 22 subjectively-experienced symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, concentration problems, and fogginess). A total score is derived from this 22-item scale. Athletes report symptoms based on the severity of each symptom that day, allowing tracking of symptoms over very short intervals</description>

    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale will be used to monitor fatigue in the study participants, another commonly reported complaint after a MTBI.

    <description>The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) is a commonly used measure of static balance and postural stability. The test is rapid, relatively easy-to-administer, and inexpensive. A combination of three stances (narrow double leg stance; single leg stance; and tandem stance) and footing surfaces (firm surface/floor or medium density foam) are used for the test. Each stance is held, with hands on hips and eyes closed, for 20 seconds. &quot;Error&quot; points are given for specific behaviors, including opening eyes, lifting hands off hips, or stepping, stumbling, or falling.
Safety Issue: Falls and fall-related injuries. Testing will be supervised by a registered physiotherapist.</description>

    <description>ImPACT is a computerized neuropsychological test battery that consists of six individual test modules that measure multiple aspects of cognitive functioning including attention, memory, working memory, visual scanning, reaction time, and processing speed. The test takes 20-25 minutes. Four composite (i.e., summary) scores are tabulated based upon these individual test scores: Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, Reaction Time, and Processing Speed.</description>
