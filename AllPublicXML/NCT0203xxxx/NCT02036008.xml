  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Gadofosveset Trisodium (Gdfos, Ablavar) is a
      useful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent in accurately diagnosing liver
      metastases compared to the standard agent gadobutrol (EcGd, Gadovist).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a single centre, prospective trial comparing the sensitivity and
      specificity of using Gadofosveset Trisodium (Gdfos, Ablavar) as the MRI contrast agent as
      compared to gadobutrol (EcGd, Gadovist).

      The study population will include cancer patient's referred for an MRI study of the liver to
      rule out metastases. Those who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will their routine
      (clinical) MRI of the liver with EcGd. They will also receive an additional MRI with Gdfos
      within 4 weeks of the original study.

      The patient data will be anonymized and the imaging will be read by radiologists and
      radiology residents and comparison will be made between the diagnostic accuracy of the
      EcGd-enhanced study and the Gdfos-enhanced study.

    <description>All participants will receive two contrast-enhanced MRI studies of the liver: one with gadofosveset trisodium (Gdfos) and one with gadobutrol (EcGd) at a dose of 0.1 mL/kg body mass up to 10 mL.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive Gdfos at a dose of 10 mL of 0.25mmol/mL. This will be administered automatically using an MRI-compatible power injector, as a bolus through an intravenous line placed in an antecubital vein at a rate of 1.5 mL/s followed by 25 mL of 0.9% saline flush.
Participants will be imaged using a 3.0 T MRI scanner with an 8 channel body phased array coil utilized covering the entire liver. Images of the liver will be obtained including: axial precontrast phase, axial arterial phase, axial portovenous phase, axial 5 minute delayed phase, axial 10 minute delayed phase, axial 20 minute delayed phase.
This study will be performed within 4 weeks of the MRI study with EcGd.</description>
