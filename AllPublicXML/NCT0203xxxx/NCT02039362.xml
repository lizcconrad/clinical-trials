  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of vertical HBV transmission is related to HBV DNA level in pregnant women, around
      30% in women with HBV DNA above 1, 000 000 I.U/mL despite serovaccination of newborns. Using
      tenofovir DF during the last trimester of pregnancy allows to reduce the risk, but data from
      Western countries are needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of HBs Ag carriage in pregnant women varies in France, according to the native
      country, with higher rates in those originating from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia (5 to 8% in
      Parisian area). The level of HBV DNA varies according to HBe status and geographical origin,
      and is strongly predictive of the risk of HBV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). The rate
      of vertical transmission (Yuan J et al. J Viral Hepatitis 2006) was 0% in newborns to mothers
      with HBV DNA less than 100,000 copies/mL and up to more than 40% in newborns to mothers with
      HBV DNA above 8 Log10 copies/mL, despite serovaccination at birth, thus justifying the use of
      tenofovir DF during the last trimester of pregnancy in highly viraemic pregnant women, as
      mentionned in EASL 2012 Guidelines. Data are needed concerning the results of this strategy
      in western countries, justifying this prospective study.
