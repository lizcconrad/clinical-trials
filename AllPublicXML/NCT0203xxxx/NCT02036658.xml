      The purpose of the study is to investigate the immediate and longer-term impact of
      Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT) versus Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
      for patients with Social Anxiety Disorder.

      A. Aims

      The overall goal of this research is to elucidate the neural bases of two specific forms of
      emotion regulation - cognitive regulation (CR) and attention regulation (AR). CR and AR are
      thought to be important mechanisms underlying therapeutic change associated with
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for
      generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). We seek to test whether changes in CR and AR
      underlie the therapeutic effects of CBT and MBSR, which have been shown in the clinical
      science literature to be effective treatments for SAD. We will examine CR and AR in healthy
      controls (HCs) and in participants with generalized SAD at baseline, as well as in
      participants with SAD after they have completed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
      three treatment arms: CBT, MBSR, or Waitlist (WL). This work will address 3 aims: Aim 1 will
      examine the efficacy of CR and AR in individuals with SAD versus HCs; Aim 2 will investigate
      the immediate and longer-term impact of CBT versus MBSR for SAD; and Aim 3 will examine
      treatment-related changes in CR and AR and test whether these changes mediate the effects of
      CBT versus MBSR. The broad, long-term objective of this research is to contribute to advances
      in clinical interventions targeting individuals suffering from SAD, as well as a wide range
      of other anxiety and mood disorders.

    <intervention_model_description>To investigate treatment outcome and mediators of Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT) vs. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) vs. Waitlist (WL) in patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD), unmedicated patients with a primary diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) will be randomized to CBGT vs. MBSR vs. WL and will complete assessments at baseline, post-treatment/WL, and at 1-year follow-up, including the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale - Self-Report (primary outcome; Liebowitz, 1987) as well as measures of treatment-related processes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a self-report questionnaire which assesses the severity of social anxiety symptoms (Fresco et al., 2001; Liebowitz, 1987). Respondents are asked to rate their level of fear and avoidance to 11 social interaction situations and 13 performance situations. A 4-point Likert-type scale is used for ratings of fear and of avoidance, with a range from 0 (none and never, respectively) to 3 (severe and usually, respectively) for each situation during the past week. Ratings are summed for a total LSAS-SR score (range 0 to 144). The LSAS-SR has demonstrated good reliability and construct validity (Rytwinski et al., 2009).</description>

    <description>Cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) will be delivered by two Ph.D. clinical psychologists trained by Dr. Richard Heimberg to implement his CBGT for SAD (Heimberg &amp; Becker, 2002). Groups of six individuals will meet for 12 sessions of 2.5 hours each. The participants will also use selected portions of the client workbook developed by (Hope, Heimberg, &amp; Turk, 2010) to supplement relevant portions of the protocol. The treatment will be comprised of four major components: (1) psychoeducation and orientation to CBGT; (2) cognitive restructuring skills; (3) graduated exposure to feared social situations, within session and as homework; and (4) relapse prevention and termination. Further details of the treatment are available elsewhere (Heimberg &amp; Becker, 2002).</description>

    <description>MBSR will follow the standard curriculum outline compiled in 1993 by Jon Kabat-Zinn except that the one-day meditation retreat will be converted to four additional weekly group sessions between the standard class 6 and 7 so that there will be 12 weekly 2.5 hour sessions. This will be done to match the CBGT protocol in duration and time. The MBSR intervention will be delivered by a University of Massachusetts Center for Mindfulness certified MBSR instructor with more than 30 years of teaching experience. To support the practice, each participant will be given A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook (Stahl &amp; Goldstein, 2010), which includes descriptions of mindfulness exercises together with pre-recorded audio files to support ongoing practice.</description>
