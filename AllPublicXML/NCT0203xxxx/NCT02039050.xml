  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the airways of the lungs are narrowed or
      blocked. Bronchodilators are drugs usually delivered through inhalers which help open up the
      airways. Tiotropium is a type of bronchodilator drug known as a long-acting muscarinic
      antagonist (LAMA). For a long time tiotropium was the only available LAMA. More recently, a
      new LAMA called aclidinium has been approved for use in COPD. There are potentially important
      differences between these two medications that might have an impact on the treatment of COPD
      patients.

      In this study we aim to compare the effects of tiotropium and aclidinium in people with COPD.
      The main comparison will be done using a very sensitive breathing test called impulse
      oscillometry
