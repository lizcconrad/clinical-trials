  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 study
      designed to is to determine if the combination treatment can improve progression free
      survival (defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first
      documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first) when compared with
      placebo + paclitaxel.

      The drug tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested to treat people
      who have Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). This study determined the safety and efficacy for
      alisertib when given twice a day along with paclitaxel.

      This open label study enrolled 178 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Alisertib 40 mg

        -  Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2

        -  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants received treatment until their disease progressed or they experienced
      unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity.

      This multi-center trial was conducted world-wide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately up to 22 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      and will be contacted by telephone every month for 6 months after the end of treatment (EOT)
      for follow-up assessment of progression free survival and for overall survival every 2 months
      until death, study closure, or 14 months after randomization of the last participant.

    <description>PFS is defined as time in days from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression based on Investigator's assessment or up to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1. Disease progression or PD was defined as ≥20% increase in sum longest diameter (LD) in reference to the smallest on-study sum LD, or the appearance of new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of drug, whether or not it is considered related to drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any experience that suggests significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that:results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.</description>

    <description>CRR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) as best response and ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved CR or partial response (PR) as best response based on Investigator's assessment according to RECIST v 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm.

    <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of partcipants who achieved CR, PR, or SD (when SD was a minimum of 8 weeks in duration). Duration of SD was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression for participants who achieved SD as their best overall response. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm.

PR was defined as ≥ 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. PD was defined as ≥20% increase in sum LD in reference to the smallest on-study sum LD, or the appearance of new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

             pericardial effusion or restrictive cardiomyopathy) within 6 months before receiving
             the first dose of study drug.
