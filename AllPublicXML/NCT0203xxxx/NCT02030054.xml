  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statin interference has been suggested among the mechanisms of reduction of the antiplatelet
      effect of clopidogrel. The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of
      rosuvastatin and atorvastatin on platelet reactivity in patients with coronary artery disease
      undergone double antiplatelet therapy with new P2Y12 inhibitors. This is a single-center,
      prospective, randomized, crossover study conducted in the Department of Heart and Great
      Vessels &quot;Attilio Reale&quot;, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. All consecutive patients undergone
      PTCA in our institution in the period between July 2013 and December 2013 will be eligible to
      be enrolled.

      Patients will be offered to participate to the trial at time of 1-month post-angioplasty
      follow-up visit.patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (prasugrel 10 mg or brilique 90
      mg x 2 plus aspirin 100 mg) after percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were randomly
      assigned to rosuvastatin (20 mg day) or atorvastatin (40 mg day) for 30 days. After 1-week
      wash-out period to avoid any carryover effect, cross-over was performed, and patients were
      switched to the other drug which was continued for 30 days.

      Platelet function will be evaluated using a validated method: the VerifyNow System
      (Accumetrics Inc., San Diego, CA), which is a point-of-care turbidimetry-based optical
      detection system that measures platelet-induced aggregation. Platelet function will be
      measured with the VerifyNow P2Y12 test at baseline and after 30 days from rosuvastatin or
      atorvastatin administration.

      Platelet reactivity will be expressed in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). PRU values &gt;208 are
      suggestive of high platelet reactivity.
