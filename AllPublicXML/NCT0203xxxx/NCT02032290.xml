      The administration of these drugs is realized according to the European Society of Cardiology
      guidelines.

      All patients will be pretreated with aspirin 300 mg orally, heparin iv to maintain an
      activated clotting time of &gt;250 sec, and a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg) or clopidogrel
      (600 mg) immediately before the revascularization. The list of assignment to ticagrelor or
      clopidogrel will be generated by a computer according to a 1:1 randomization. Primary
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention will be performed according to standard clinical practice
      using femoral or radial artery Judkins approach via six or seven French heath insertion.
      After crossing the target occlusive Lesion, coronary stenting will be performed based on
      standard practice. Patients subsequently will receive heparin for 48 hr, aspirin 100 mg
      daily, and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) or ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) for at least 12 months.
      Other adjunctive pharmacotherapy in Intensive Care Unit will be administered according to
      operator discretion. All patients will provide written informed consent before entering the
      study.

      Before and after the procedure a 12-leads ECG and an echocardiogram will be performed as
      standard practice. Then, all the pre-, intra-, and post-procedure data patients will be
      collected in a database.

      Investigators aim to perform a prospective, single-center, investigator-initiated, randomized
      study to compare the Adenosine-induced coronary vasodilatation after the loading dose of
      Ticagrelor either Clopidogrel during the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. Patients with
      Acute Coronary Syndrome undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention will be enrolled in the
      study and will be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive a loading dose of Ticagrelor (180
      mg) or Clopidogrel (600 mg). Coronary Flow Reserve will be recorded by intracoronary Doppler
      Flow Wire before the stent implantation and after the procedure at baseline and 2-minute
      later adenosine intravenous administration at incremental doses of 50, 80, 110 and 140
      ug/Kg/min with 2 minutes interval between infusions.

      Coronary Flow Reserve is the ability of the myocardium to increase blood flow in response to
      maximal exercise. Doppler Flow Wire allows to measure this increase expressing it as a ratio
      between maximal vasodilation and flow at rest. Coronary Flow Reserve is routinely measured in
      patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome, without an increased risk of adverse events for
      patients neither adjunctive costs for the National Health System.

      Furthermore, Plasma concentrations of Ticagrelor and its main metabolite (AR-C124910XX) will
      be measured in venous blood collected at the end of the procedure. In patients requiring a
      second Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, for example for multivessel disease, all these
      measures will be repeated in the same manner.
