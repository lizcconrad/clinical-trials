    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the anatomical and functional outcomes of ocriplasmin
      (JETREA®) over a 6-month follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After receiving a single intravitreal injection as per country's product label (Day 0),
      subjects were followed for a 6-month period (Day 180).

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Nonsurgical Resolution of Focal Vitreomacular Traction (VMT/VMA) at Day 28, as Determined by Central Reading Center (CRC) Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD‐OCT) Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Vitreous separation was assessed by SD-OCT using scores ranging from 1 (vitreous attached from macula to ON; separated elsewhere cannot determine foveal) to 12 (unable to determine state of separation). Nonsurgical resolution was defined as a change from baseline score of 5/6/8 to 7/9/10 at Day 28. The assessment of resolution of VMT/sVMA was based upon the anatomical resolution of VMA only, i.e. no resolution of the related symptoms was considered. Thus, the term VMA is used interchangeably with VMT/sVMA. Proportion of subjects is presented as a percentage, with percentage based on the number of subjects who have VMT/sVMA at baseline and SD-OCT value at Day 28. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Nonsurgical Change From Baseline in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 28, Day 90, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) was assessed using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing at 4 meters. The charts contain 14 rows of letters. BCVA was calculated as the number of letters read correctly and improvement defined as an increase (gain) in letters read from the baseline assessment. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Nonsurgical Closure of Macular Hole (MH), if Present at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28, Day 90, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>The closure of macular hole (a full thickness defect of the retinal tissue involving the anatomical fovea) is defined as a flattened and reattached hole rim along the whole circumference of macular hole. Closure was determined by SD-OCT evaluation and the percentage of subjects tabulated. Proportion of subjects is presented as a percentage, with percentage based on the number of subjects who had macular hole at baseline and OCT value at each specific visit. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Nonsurgical Resolution of VMT/sVMA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 90, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Vitreous separation was assessed by SD-OCT using scores ranging from 1 (vitreous attached from macula to ON; separated elsewhere cannot determine foveal) to 12 (unable to determine state of separation).

Thus, the term VMA is used interchangeably with VMT/sVMA.

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Experiencing Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV) at Day 180</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Pars plana vitrectomy (the surgical removal of vitreous gel from the eye) was captured in Concomitant Ocular Procedures. Proportion of subjects is reported as a percentage. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Nonsurgical Change From Baseline in Central Foveal Thickness (CFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 28, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Nonsurgical change in central foveal thickness (CFT values after a vitrectomy were imputed with the last non-missing value prior to the vitrectomy) was determined by subtracting the measurements in subretinal fluid and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) elevations and/or SHRM (subretinal hyper-reflective material, such as choroidal neovascularization (CNV)) from the value in total retinal measurement. A lower CFT indicates improvement. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects With Nonsurgical Resolution of VMT/sVMA</title>
        <description>Vitreous separation was assessed by SD-OCT using scores ranging from 1 (vitreous attached from macula to ON; separated elsewhere cannot determine foveal) to 12 (unable to determine state of separation). Nonsurgical resolution was defined as a change from baseline score of 5/6/8 to 7/9/10 at Day 90 and Day 180. The assessment of resolution of VMT/sVMA was based upon the anatomical resolution of VMA only, i.e. no resolution of the related symptoms was considered. Thus, the term VMA is used interchangeably with VMT/sVMA. Proportion of subjects is presented as a percentage, with percentage based on the number of subjects who have VMT/sVMA at baseline and SD-OCT value at Day 90/Day 180.
