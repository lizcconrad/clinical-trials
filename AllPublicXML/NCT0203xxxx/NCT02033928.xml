    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to describe a patients' fitness before and after
      treatment (whether that treatment be chemotherapy or a transplant). Fitness is a way of
      measuring a patient's current quality of health. With surveys, questionnaires and blood
      tests, we hope to create a tool that will give a good picture of patients' ability to
      tolerate treatment. In the future, we hope to devise the best treatment for a patient based
      on their &quot;fitness&quot;.

    <measure>Change in Comprehensive Frailty Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Responses to the Comprehensive Frailty Assessment will be assessed before and after treatment and changes will be evaluated. In transplant patients, this will be measured one year post transplant and in the non-transplant arm, this will be assessed after the second cycle of treatment.</description>

    <description>We will assess time to progression for multiple myeloma patients and the relationships of those outcomes to patients' functional, cognitive and psychosocial health.</description>
