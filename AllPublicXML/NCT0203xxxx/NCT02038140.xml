    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical outcome
      data for commercially available Zimmer Trabecular Metal Total Ankle implants used in primary
      or revision total ankle arthroplasty. The assessment will include implant survivorship and
      clinical performance measured by pain and function, quality of life data, radiographic
      parameters and survivorship.

      The study design is a prospective, multicenter, study of the commercially available Zimmer
      Trabecular Metal Ankle semiconstrained implants. The study will require each site to obtain
      Institutional Review Board approval prior to study enrollment. All potential study subjects
      will be required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

      All study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their primary or
      revision total ankle arthroplasty. The post-operative clinical and radiographic evaluations
      will be conducted at 6 weeks, 6 month, 1 year, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. Follow-up surveys
      will occur at 4, 6, 8, and 9 years.
