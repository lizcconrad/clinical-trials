    <textblock>
      Research Problem: Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) dramatically changed the management of renal
      and ureteral calculus disease. In vitro studies suggest that progressive increase in
      lithotripter energy output voltage could produce the best overall stone comminution in
      comparison with constant or deescalating energy output. However, it is possible that the
      beneficial impact of slow rate SWL on comminution of stones and stone free rates has masked
      any marginal benefits for energy output escalation. The Escalating SW method adds the benefit
      of less renal tissue injury.

      Research Significance:The present study will signifies and evaluates the stone free rates of
      three groups of patients with renal stones treated with different SWL energy outputs
      (Escalating, Constant and Reduction energy output).

      Research Objectives: The aim of this research project is to study the effect of dose
      adjustment strategies on success rate of Shock Wave Lithotripsy in the clinical setting and
      to optimize the conditions for successful Shock Wave Lithotripsy.

      Research Methodology: This clinical trial will be conducted at a tertiary care university
      hospital. 150 patients referred to the Shock wave lithotripsy unit will be evaluated for
      eligibility to be randomized into three groups (Dose Escalation, Dose reduction and constant
      dose). Parameter of the three groups will be compared to detect the treatment difference.

      Escalating SW amplitude treatment protocols have been shown to be safe on long-term with less
      harm to kidney tissue. This clinical trial will be conducted at a tertiary care university
      hospital. All patients referred to the SWL unit will be evaluated for eligibility to be
      randomized. Randomization process &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;unrestricted&quot; randomization was used to
      allocate patients to the three arms of the clinical trial where one patient was randomly
      assigned to one of the three arms blindly.
