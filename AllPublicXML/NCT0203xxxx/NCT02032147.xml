    <textblock>
      Cerebral radiation necrosis (CRN) is a well-documented late complication of radiation therapy
      for cancers, and may have a devastating effect on the patient's quality of life (QOL).
      However,CRN was once regarded as a progressive and irreversible disease, no standard therapy
      has been suggested for CRN. In our clinical practice, we have used nerve growth factor(NGF)
      to treat CRN, and found that GM1 can successfully reverse CRN. A case report has been
      published in Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) in 2011. So we carried out this prospective
      study to test the efficacy of NGF for CRN.

        Patients must have undergone definitive RT for histologically confirmed NPC years before.
        They were required to have at least two consecutive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study
        supporting the diagnosis of CRN with an interval of 3-4 months, with the second MRI showing
        progressive disease compared with the first MRI. The necrotic mass shown on MRI must be
        measured in two dimensions in order to define the response to treatment. Other radiologic
        studies were also required to support the non-existence of local or regional recurrence,
        distant metastasis. Patients must have undergone mental status examinations and had
        progressive neurologic symptoms or signs. In addition, they were required to have a
        Karnofsky performance status of at least 70 and were supposed to live more than 6 months.
