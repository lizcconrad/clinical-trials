  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2879552 is a potent, selective, mechanism-based inactivator of Lysine Specific Demethylase
      1 (LSD1)/ CoRepressor for Element-1-Silencing Transcription factor (CoREST) activity. This is
      a phase I, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, 2-part first time in human (FTIH) study
      for GSK2879552. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase to determine the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) for GSK2879552 based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles observed after oral administration of GSK2879552. Any dose
      level(s) may be expanded up to 12 subjects in order to collect additional data on PK and
      PD.The safety and PK/PD data will be reviewed prior to the dose decision, and the dose
      escalation will be guided by the Neuenschwander -continuous reassessment method (N-CRM).
      Built-in safety constraints are in place to prevent exposing subjects to undue risk of
      toxicity. Once RP2D is identified, an expansion cohort (Part 2) of up to 30 subjects will be
      enrolled to further evaluate the clinical activity and tolerability of GSK2879552 in subjects
      with relapsed/refractory SCLC.
