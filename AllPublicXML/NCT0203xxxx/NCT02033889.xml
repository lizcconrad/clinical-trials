  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of ertugliflozin in participants with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The primary study
      hypothesis is that at Week 26, the mean reduction from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for
      ertugliflozin is greater than that for placebo.

      The trial includes a 13-15 week run-in period prior to randomization, and a 26-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period (Phase A) followed by a 78-week
      double-blind, extension period (Phase B).

    <description>Ertugliflozin 5 mg orally, once daily from Day 1 to Week 104. Participants will receive 1 ertugliflozin 5 mg tablet and 1 placebo ertugliflozin 10 mg tablet per day. Participants requiring glycemic rescue during the 26-week initial treatment period (Phase A) will receive open-label glimepiride. This rescue will continue through the 78-week, double-blind, extension period (Phase B). If not rescued during Phase A, participants will receive placebo to glimepiride (up to a maximum of 6 or 8 mg per day, based on the local label of glimepiride) during Phase B. All participants will also receive metformin at a dose &gt;=1500 mg/day in Phase A and B.</description>
