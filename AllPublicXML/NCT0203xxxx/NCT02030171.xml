    <textblock>
      Compare the efficacy of 1 year of participation, of three programs of care for patients with
      chronic law back, referred to specialists rehabilitation centers or directly to the
      multidisciplinary consultation of university hospital of Angers.

      The primary objectif is to assess the efficacy of 1 year of the three therapeutics strategies
      with the number of days off work in the year following treatment.

    <description>Compare the efficacy of 1 year of participation of the three programs of care for chronic low back pain patients referred to specialists rehabilitation centers or directly to the multidisciplinary consultation UH Angers.
The primary endpoint to assess the efficacy of 1 year of support on the participation of the patient is the number of days off work in the year following treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoints to assess the efficacy of 1-year quality of life of the patient is the SF-36 score.
The quality of life questionnaire is collected early in the program at the end (after the 5-week program ended) at 6 months and one year.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoint to assess the efficacy of 1 year of support on improving social inclusion is the score of Dallas.
The Dallas questionnaire is collected early in the program at the end (after the 5-week program ended) at 6 months and one year.</description>

    <measure>Compare the effectiveness of 1 year on physical deconditioning, three programs of care in these patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoints to assess efficacy at 1 year of support on the physical deconditioning of the patient are the finger-floor distance, Ito test, and the test port heavy load.
These tests are performed early in the program at the end (after the program ended five weeks) at 6 months and one year.</description>
