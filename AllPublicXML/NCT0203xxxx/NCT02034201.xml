  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine dependence is a serious public health problem, with methamphetamine abusers
      being at risk for significant morbidity and mortality, including HIV. To date, no medication
      or psychotherapeutic strategy has shown robust, long-term efficacy in treating this disorder.
      This clinical trial will examine whether lisdexamfetamine shows promise in alleviating
      withdrawal symptoms and preventing relapse relative to placebo in recently-abstinent
      methamphetamine dependent individuals. Findings of this study will not only shed light on
      whether lisdexamfetamine may improve upon treatment for this disorder but also inform future
      medication development strategies for improving treatment for drug dependence disorders.
      Discovering efficacious limited risk interventions that show more robust, longer-term
      outcomes would be beneficial both to the individual and society.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age (18-65 yrs).

          2. Participants must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for Methamphetamine dependence These
             criteria will be ascertained in the following manner: the physician will determine
             whether the individual is appropriate based on clinical assessments and the patient
             will also need to meet criteria for methamphetamine dependence based on administration
             of the SCID.

          3. Self-reported average METH use of at least 250 mg of methamphetamine per occasion at
             least once weekly during the preceding 3-month period.

          4. A positive urine toxicology screen for methamphetamine. Participants must submit a
             urine sample negative for drugs of abuse (opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and PCP)
             other than methamphetamine or marijuana during the week prior to starting the study.

          5. Women of child-bearing potential will be included provided they 1) have a negative
             pregnancy test, 2) agree to adequate contraception (tubal ligation, hysterectomy,
             barrier contraceptive method or oral contraceptive method) to prevent pregnancy during
             the study and 3) are not nursing.

          6. Normal blood pressure with SBP &gt;89 and &lt; 141, DBP &gt;59 and &lt; 91.

          1. Current suicidality or psychosis

          2. Current cocaine dependence or opioid, alcohol, or sedative physical dependence

          3. Major hepatic or cardiovascular disorder (including history of myocardial infarction,
             cardiovascular disease, or history of or currently clinically significant ECG
             abnormality) or unstable medical condition that contraindicates study participation

          4. History of schizophrenia or bipolar type I disorder

          5. Use of medications that would be expected to have major interaction with LDX including
             psychotropics

          6. Medical contraindication to receiving LDX

          7. Positive drug screen for cocaine, opiates, sedatives or PCP.

          8. History of Seizure disorder

          9. Documented hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines

         10. LFT &gt;3xULN
