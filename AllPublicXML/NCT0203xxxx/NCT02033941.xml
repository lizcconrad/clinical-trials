  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a progressive brain disease generally known as senile dementia. Our
      proposed study will establish safety and pharmacokinetics of Meganatural-AZ GSPE in AD
      subjects. As secondary measures, we will also provide the essential human data to guide the
      design of future studies to test the efficacy of GSPE in mitigating cognitive deterioration
      in AD patients.

      This study aims to establish the safety and pharmacokinetics of Meganatural-Az® GSPE in
      subjects with Alzheimer's disease. As a secondary goal, clinical and biomarker indices of
      therapeutic efficacy will also be evaluated. The proposed study will provide the essential
      human data necessary to guide the design of future studies testing the efficacy of GSPE in
      mitigating cognitive deterioration in AD patients.
