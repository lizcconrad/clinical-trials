      To determine the percentage of women who achieve anemia correction after a single dose of
      1000mg of low molecular weight iron dextran(infed).

      To determine whether IV iron supplementation has a higher satisfaction with treatment as
      compared to oral supplementation in a population previously intolerant of or unresponsive to
      oral iron.

      To evaluate the safety of IV low molecular weight iron dextran in pregnant women.

      To assess maternal and fetal outcomes-preterm delivery, low birth weight deliveries, ER
      visits and hospitalizations related to preterm labor, preterm contractions, ante-partum and
      post-partum transfusions, maternal hemoglobin at post-partum visit after IV iron
      supplementation groups.

    <description>To evaluate the safety of IV low molecular weight iron dextran in pregnant women. Also to asses maternal and fetal outcomes-preterm delivery, low-birth weight deliveries, ER visits and hospitalizations related to preterm labor, preterm contractions, ante-partum and post partum transfusions, maternal hemoglobin at post-partum visit after IV iron supplementation groups. A questionaire with a list of symptoms to include nausea, dizziness, hypotension, edema, headache, abdominal pain, chest pain, cough, itching, fever, back pain, muscle cramps and rash are asked immediately after administration and phone calls at 24, 48 hours and 7 days.</description>
