  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, 3-period crossover, single dose study. Three (3) single
      doses of AZD3293 (2 different tablet formulations, and an oral solution) will be administered
      with a washout period of at least 1 week between the doses to investigate the relative
      bioavailability of AZD3293 after administration via 2 tablet formulations compared with oral
      solution and to evaluate basic systemic pharmacokinetic parameters of the tablet formulations
      compared to the oral solution of AZD3293.

      The safety and tolerability of AZD3293 in healthy subjects will also be assessed in the
      study. AZD3293 is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
