    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, comparison, open-label, phase IV study in kidney
      transplant recipients whose immunosuppressive regimen is converted from Cyclosporine with
      corticosteroid to Advagraf® with corticosteroid. The eligible patients will be randomized
      into either Arm 1 or Arm 2. The Arm 1 will be reduced corticosteroid slowly until 50% lower
      dose from 4 weeks to 12 weeks in the Advagraf®-based immunosuppressive regimen, and the Arm 2
      will receive the same corticosteroid dose for 24 weeks with Advagraf ®.

      The primary objective is to assess the changes in the GFR after 24 weeks of treatment between
      the group that was reduced corticosteroid slowly until 50% lower dose from 4 weeks to 12
      weeks and the group with maintained corticosteroid in stable kidney transplant subjects whose
      regimen was converted from a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen with corticosteroid to an
      Advagraf®-based immunosuppressive regimen with corticosteroid for kidney transplant subjects
      whose regimen was converted from a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen.

      The secondary objective is to assess the creatinine clearance rate, acute rejection,
      satisfaction of medication and safety of the group with a 50% reduced dose of corticosteroid
      and the group in which the Advagraf ®-based immunosuppressive regimen with maintained
      corticosteroid.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Had a kidney transplant at least 12 months before his/her enrollment in this study
             (including a kidney retransplantation).

          -  Underwent a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen since his/her last transplantation.
             The CyA dose remained unchanged during the last four weeks before the subject's
             enrollment.

          -  The immunosuppressive regimen (combination of medications) remained unchanged for a
             minimum of four weeks before the subject's enrollment.

             study, or had an acute rejection episode within 24 weeks before his/her enrollment in
             this study that required anti-lymphocyte antibody therapy

          -  Had been diagnosed with new-onset malignancy after his/her transplantation, except for
             basocellular or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that had been treated successfully
