    <textblock>
      Connect.Parkinson is a randomized comparative effectiveness study, comparing usual care
      enhanced with educational materials to usual care, educational materials, and the delivery of
      specialty care via telemedicine into patient's homes. The study's specific aims are the
      following:

        1. To demonstrate the feasibility of using telemedicine to deliver specialty care into the
           homes of individuals with Parkinson disease who have limited access to care;

        2. To show that such an approach can improve quality of life;

        3. To establish that the telemedicine can enhance the quality of care; and

        4. To demonstrate that this remote approach to care saves time, reduces travel, and
           decreases care partner burden.

      Connect.Parkinson is a national study examining the feasibility and effectiveness of using
      video calls to bring expert Parkinson disease care directly into patients' homes. Currently,
      access to care for Parkinson disease is limited by distance, disability, and the distribution
      of doctors. Approximately 200 individuals with Parkinson disease (who due to distance,
      disability, disparity, or doctor distribution have limited access to care) will be randomized
      to one of two arms in this comparative effectiveness study. The first (control) arm will be
      the individual's &quot;usual care&quot; supplemented by educational materials on their condition. This
      usual care may include care from a generalist, care from a neurologist, or in-person care
      from a Parkinson specialist. The care received by the control group will vary but will be an
      accurate reflection of usual care in this country. The second (intervention) arm will be
      usual care supplemented by educational materials and care from a Parkinson disease specialist
      delivered via web-based video conferencing into the patient's home. The participants will
      also be asked with they have a primary care partner, and care partners will be invited to
      enroll, for a total of approximately 400 participants.

    <time_frame>Baseline to One year</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed as the change in quality of life, measured by the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39). The PDQ-39 is a 39-item self-report questionnaire, which assesses Parkinson's disease-specific health related quality over the last month. Assesses how often patients experience difficulties across the 8 quality of life dimensions. Assesses impact of Parkinson's Disease (PD) on specific dimensions of functioning and well-being. The score ranges from 0-100 with lower scores reflecting better quality of life.</description>

    <description>EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. Health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The scale ranges from 11111 to 55555 with higher numbers indicating worse health status. The five-digit descriptors are converted to EQ-5D Index Values, which range from -0.109 (corresponding to 55555, the worst possible health) to 1.000 (corresponding to 11111, the best possible health).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Individuals with Parkinson disease were recruited and enrolled remotely and sent educational materials about Parkinson disease created by the National Parkinson Foundation. Recruitment for the study began in February 2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>272 individuals were referred to 18 sites to be consented. Two hundred ten individuals with Parkinson disease enrolled in the study, and 195 were eventually randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Usual Care and Educational Materials</title>
          <description>Participants with Parkinson disease will receive educational materials from the National Parkinson Foundation, complete a baseline assessment survey and virtual visit with a physician independent rater, then continue with their usual care in their communities for the duration of the study. After 12 months, they will have another virtual study assessment with an independent rater, after which they will receive a free, one-time virtual consultation with a Parkinson disease specialist in their state.</description>

          <title>Virtual Visits and Educational Materials</title>
          <description>Participants with Parkinson disease randomized to the virtual visit intervention will receive educational materials from the National Parkinson Foundation, complete a baseline assessment and virtual study assessment with a physician independent rater, and then receive four virtual care visits with a Parkinson disease specialist in their state. Specialists will provide recommendations for care to participants and their designated local health care provider. At 12 months, these individuals will again be assessed by the independent rater, who will be blind to treatment assignment.
Virtual Visits: Virtual visits will be completed using HIPAA-compliant video conferencing software from SBR Health and Vidyo, designed specifically for use in the healthcare industry. The software is available for Windows and Mac OS, as well as iOS devices (iPad and iPhone).</description>

        <description>Assessed as the change in quality of life, measured by the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39). The PDQ-39 is a 39-item self-report questionnaire, which assesses Parkinson’s disease-specific health related quality over the last month. Assesses how often patients experience difficulties across the 8 quality of life dimensions. Assesses impact of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) on specific dimensions of functioning and well-being. The score ranges from 0-100 with lower scores reflecting better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change in EQ-5D Index Value</title>
        <description>EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. Health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The scale ranges from 11111 to 55555 with higher numbers indicating worse health status. The five-digit descriptors are converted to EQ-5D Index Values, which range from -0.109 (corresponding to 55555, the worst possible health) to 1.000 (corresponding to 11111, the best possible health).</description>

        <title>Change in Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part 2</title>
        <description>Parkinson disease clinical characteristics will be assessed by a physician independent rater, blinded to treatment group, at baseline and at the conclusion of the study, using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Part II concerns motor experiences of daily living. The scale ranges from 0 to 52 with higher numbers indicated more severe disease.</description>

            <description>Participants with Parkinson disease will receive educational materials from the National Parkinson Foundation, complete a baseline assessment survey and virtual visit with a physician independent rater, then continue with their usual care in their communities for the duration of the study. After 12 months, they will have another virtual study assessment with an independent rater, after which they will receive a free, one-time virtual consultation with a Parkinson disease specialist in their state.</description>

            <description>Participants with Parkinson disease randomized to the virtual visit intervention will receive educational materials from the National Parkinson Foundation, complete a baseline assessment and virtual study assessment with a physician independent rater, and then receive four virtual care visits with a Parkinson disease specialist in their state. Specialists will provide recommendations for care to participants and their designated local health care provider. At 12 months, these individuals will again be assessed by the independent rater, who will be blind to treatment assignment.
Virtual Visits: Virtual visits will be completed using HIPAA-compliant video conferencing software from SBR Health and Vidyo, designed specifically for use in the healthcare industry. The software is available for Windows and Mac OS, as well as iOS devices (iPad and iPhone).</description>
