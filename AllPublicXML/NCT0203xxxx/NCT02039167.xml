    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the superiority of left atrial appendage occlusion
      in comparison to oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (INR 2-3) related to the
      frequency of occurrence of at least one bleeding classified as moderate or major within 24
      months.

      Open, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical investigation. Transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE) for all patients within 14 days of the Enrolment Visit. Patients
      randomized to oral anticoagulation (OAC) will receive standard of care (SOC) vitamin K
      antagonist treatment throughout the 24 months clinical investigation period, managed by the
      primary care physician, with the goal of achieving and maintaining an INR of 2-3 (INR
      monitoring by the primary care physician every two weeks throughout study period).

      Patients randomized to the WATCHMAN device will undergo device implantation within 48 hours
      of the screening TEE and after confirmation of INR ≤ 1.7 in the catheterization laboratory
      with a subsequent hospitalization for 24-48 hours.

      Concomitant treatment with Aspirin/Clopidogrel (managed by the patient's primary care
      physician) will be initiated on the day prior to device implantation, and will be continued
      for 6 months after the procedure, at which time Clopidogrel will be discontinued;
      administration of Aspirin will be continued indefinitely.

      Follow-up visits for all patients will take place on Day 45, and at Month 6, Month 12 and
      Month 24 (End of Study). Routine safety and efficacy assessments at each visit will be the
      same for all patients regardless of treatment group.

      Follow-up- visits at day 45, months 6, 12 and 24. Patients randomized to the WATCHMAN device
      will have additional TEE imaging performed at the Day 45 and Month 6 visits.

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee will monitor safety. A blinded and independent
      Endpoint Committee will evaluate end-points throughout the entire study period.
