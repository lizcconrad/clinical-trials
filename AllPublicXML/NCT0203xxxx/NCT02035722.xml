    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injection of Ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech) is clinically indicated for
      patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) An disadvantage of this technique is
      the anxiety and discomfort which patients often experience due to the idea of &quot;getting a
      needle in the eye&quot;. In addition, a recent case study indicated the importance of patient
      education in achieving positive outcomes from intravitreal injections of anti-vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. The purpose of our study is to determine whether
      visual education on AMD and intravitreal injection can reduce patients' anxiety prior to the
      treatment, and lessen the impact of socioeconomical status on their understanding of the
      treatment and prognosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of intravitreal injections of Ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech) is becoming
      increasing common for the management of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is
      therefore important to acknowledge and address patients' anxiety due to anticipated
      discomfort from the idea of &quot;getting a needle in the eye&quot;. In addition, visual provision of
      information at diagnosis concerning long-term treatment expectation may enhance the informed
      consent process. The use of visual aids may also accommodate patients of different
      educational background when presented with new and complex treatment information. The purpose
      of our study is to determine whether visual education on AMD and intravitreal injection can
      reduce patients' anxiety prior to the treatment, and lessen the impact of socioeconomical
      status on their understanding of the treatment and prognosis. Although this tool will be
      developed in the context of injection-requiring retinal diseases, it has applications in the
      care of disease requiring long-term treatments.
