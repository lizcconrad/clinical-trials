  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study basic physiology of human peripheral nerves using high-count
      microelectrode arrays implanted into peripheral nerves of patients with limb amputations or
      peripheral nerve injury. These microelectrodes will be custom-made and are not available for
      commercial distribution. The investigators hypothesize that recording neural signals from a
      large number of microelectrodes will provide selective motor information in high enough
      numbers to allow control over future artificial devices with many moving parts, i.e.
      artificial limbs with shoulder, elbow, wrist, and/or individual fingers that move. These
      studies will also investigate to what extent microstimulation of nerve fibers can provide
      sensory feedback from a prosthetic limb.

      The investigators will also conduct up to three acute surgeries where a Utah slanted
      Electrode Array (USEA) will be implanted in volunteers who are about to undergo limb
      amputations. These acute implantations will provide Dr. Hutchinson with human surgical
      experience in implanting USEAs and evaluating the containment system we will be using to
      immobilize the implanted USEA in the nerve.
