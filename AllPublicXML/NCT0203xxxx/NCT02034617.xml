    <textblock>
      When becoming a parent of a preterm infant there is an increased risk of stress. There are a
      number of studies showing that parental stress has a negative impact on their engagement with
      their child. Other studies, on the other hand, show that different intervention programs with
      the aim to strengthen the relationship can decrease parental stress and hence affect the
      parent-infant interaction in a positive way. Structured intervention programs for preterm
      infants have also been successful in improving the infants' cognitive functions.

      The investigators have developed a program with the aim to strengthen the parent-infant
      interaction for late preterm infants. The observational program is called LiMoNid. Our
      hypothesis is that LiMoNid will strengthen the parents' own parental abilities and give them
      a deeper understanding of their child. They will hopefully develop more skills on how to
      communicate with their child; to see, interpret, understand and approach the child, which can
      lead to an improved parent-child interaction. Parental stress may also be reduced by
      increased understanding and control. Regarding the child itself, we hypothesize that the
      psychological development will be affected depending on the communication with the caregiver
      and depending on the support it has received in expressing its feelings and needs. The
      emotional regulation should be strengthened by such an intervention.

      The aim is to study if LiMoNid can have an impact on cognition, stress, parent-child
      interaction.

      The Design is a randomised controlled study in two groups; intervention group versus standard
      care. Parents who meet the inclusion criteria are given oral and written information about
      the study aim and procedure and are asked for participation. If the parents consent they will
      be randomised to one of two groups. Follow-ups will be conducted at 1 month, 4 months, 10
      months corrected age and when the child is 4 years.
