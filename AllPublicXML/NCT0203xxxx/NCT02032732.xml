  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric joint infections are a common diagnostic dilemma encountered by treating
      orthopaedic surgeons. No single test is sensitive or specific enough to stand alone in
      determining the presence of joint infection.

      The purpose of this study is to test the usefulness of a chemical test strip to detect
      infection in fluid that is removed from a joint (intra-articular aspiration) in pediatric
      patients. The test strip measures an enzyme called leukocyte esterase, which has been shown
      to be useful in detecting the presence of infection in fluids from other parts of the body.
      This study will assess the efficacy of the leukocyte esterase test as a diagnostic tool for
      evaluating pediatric joint infections. The hypothesis of the study is that a positive
      leukocyte esterase test identifies a septic joint in pediatric patients undergoing
      intraoperative joint aspiration.

      Pediatric patients requiring an intra-articular joint aspiration for suspected infection or
      for other reasons will have a leukocyte esterase test performed on fluid removed from the
      joint. A convenience sample of consecutive patients will be screened according to
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and enrolled in the study by informed consent. All patients who
      will be screened for the study will have already been identified as needing an
      intra-articular joint aspiration in accordance with standard of care. All patients who are
      enrolled in the study will have the leukocyte esterase test performed on the fluid that is
      aspirated. Results of the test strip will be recorded.
