      The purpose of this study is to determine whether two-step method of diagnostic strategy is
      effective in the diagnosis and treatment of fever of unknown origin (FUO). (TSMD research, a
      pilot study) Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a fever in excess of 38.3◦C continued for more
      than 3 weeks, and its cause could not be identified by tests during hospitalization for more
      than 1 week [1]. As diagnostic techniques such as imaging technology and clinical tests have
      been developed and outpatient access to diagnostic tests have improved, the FUO is defined as
      a shortened period where the cause could not be revealed despite diagnostic tests during
      three visits to the outpatient department or during 3 days of hospitalization [2]. FUO can be
      caused by many diseases, and causes can vary depending on region and time period. FUO was
      first reported in the medical literature 80 years ago. Since then, the causative diseases
      have greatly changed with changes in the social environment and widespread use of diagnostic
      imaging. The causes of FUO, according to traditional diagnosis and treatment, could be
      divided into four principal groups: infections, non-infectious inflammatory diseases (NIID,
      including rheumatic diseases and vasculitic diseases), neoplasms, and other diseases. Despite
      the development of various diagnostic techniques, 34-51% of FUO patients remain undiagnosed
      [3,4]. In China, over-reliance on antibiotics for disease therapy and infection prevention
      are common phenomena in traditional treatment of FUO[5].

      Two-step method of diagnostic strategy is a method to diagnose FUO disease. First step is to
      differentiate FUO according to the onset of disease and invasive pathogens. Second step is to
      further differentiate FUO according to trends of disease and inflammation scores. The
      diagnosis of FUO can be difficult for both patients and their physicians. Depending on the
      experience and qualifications of the treating physicians, time to reach a diagnosis can vary.
      Two-step method of diagnostic strategy would afford a standard method for physicians to
      diagnoses the FUO.

      So many reports of FUO have also been published in China, but have been limited to
      single-facility or limited-region studies; no nationwide studies have yet been conducted.
      Moreover, few assessments of tests used in the diagnostic evaluation of FUO have been
      reported. In particular, few studies have assessed the clinical usefulness of tests such as
      serum procalcitonin or positron emission tomography (PET) in China, although these tests are
      now frequently used.

      We therefore will conduct a multicenter collaborative retrospective and prospective
      （randomized and controlled ）study of patients with FUO at hospitals affiliated with China's
      Ministry of Health. This is the first nationwide study in China on diseases causing FUO and
      the diagnostic workup, and identified diseases that should be considered when evaluating FUO
      in China. In addition, we will investigate the rate of performing various tests in the
      current diagnostic workup of FUO.

      Classical FUO was diagnosed based on the definition by Durack et al[6] in patients meeting
      all of criteria 1-4 below.

      1. Fever with axillary temperature ≥38°C at least twice over a ≥3-week period. 2. Unknown
      cause after three outpatient visits or during 3 days of hospitalization.

      3. Not diagnosed with immunodeficiency before fever onset. 4. No confirmed HIV infection
      before fever onset. The data described below were collected. No additional testing was
      performed in this study due to insufficient data.

        1. Patient characteristics: sex, age, concomitant disease, medical history and medication
           history.

        2. Clinical findings: subjective symptoms and objective physical findings.

        3. Blood tests: blood count, biochemical examination and inflammatory markers (C reactive
           protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin, etc.).

        4. Results of blood cultures if performed.

        5. Results of imaging studies and endoscopy if performed.

        6. Results of cytology, histology, genetic testing or autopsy findings if performed.

        7. Final diagnosis, day of diagnosis and outcome. This study is safety for no drug involved
           to determine the effectiveness of two-step method of diagnostic strategy in the
           diagnosis and treatment of fever of unknown origin.

    <description>The first step is to differentiate FUO according to the onset of disease and invasive pathogens. Apart from collecting detailed present medical history and careful physical examination, it focuses on seeking the clues of bacterial invasion two weeks before the fever onset from five aspects.To finish this part, the doctor needs to ask for informations following a list we already made, which covers more than forty definite items. If some of these items were proved existed, result of first step would be positive.
The second step is calculating the integral score of inflammatory biomarkers and vital diagnostic clues, WBC&amp; N, ESR, CRP, LDH, SF, ANCA, ANA, RF, PCT and T-Spot, as well as the clinical findings were included in this integrating system.The results of these items will be recorded and calculated with certain interval of time. If the score were more than nine, this part would be considered. positive.</description>
