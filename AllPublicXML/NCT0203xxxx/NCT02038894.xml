    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of three
      commonly used techniques for delivering anesthesia during a procedure known as
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different anesthetic techniques are currently in use at Cincinnati Children's Hospital
      Medical Center (CCHMC) for delivering anesthesia during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
      Because there is a lack of evidence to delineate the best techniques, pediatric
      anesthesiologists select the technique based on clinical preference and experience. One
      anesthetic technique involves the use of general anesthesia with the placement of an
      endotracheal tube, and maintenance with an inhalation agent, such as sevoflurane (IS). These
      patients may be extubated under deep anesthesia in the operating room, and allowed to awaken
      in the post anesthesia care unit. A similar technique involves the placement of an
      endotracheal tube, and anesthetic maintenance with a continuous infusion of propofol (IP).
      These patients are also extubated under deep anesthesia in the operating room, and allowed to
      awaken in the postoperative care unit. The third technique does not use an endotracheal tube
      and anesthetic maintenance occurs with continuous infusion of propofol with the patient
      breathing oxygen through their natural airway (NA). Our objective in this study is to compare
      outcomes between these three established anesthetic techniques.

      Children in the study will be recruited from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
      Operating Room Schedule. They will be cared for in the Operating Rooms and Post Anesthesia
      Care Unit.

    <time_frame>Admission for surgery through recovery period, approximately 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>An important outcome in the anesthetic management of these patients is to maintain a balance between a safe technique with a minimal incidence of respiratory complications, and a technique that facilitates rapid turnover of the gastrointestinal suite. A chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test will measure differences among the three anesthetic groups. Different anesthetic techniques are currently in use at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). Because there is a lack of evidence to delineate the best techniques, pediatric anesthesiologists select the technique based on clinical preference and experience.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficiency comparing three different anesthetic techniques</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission for surgery through recovery period, approximately 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>After informed consent has been obtained subjects will be randomized using computer generated random numbers into one of three groups:
Group IS: intubation with sevoflurane maintenance
Group IP: intubation with propofol maintenance
Group NA: native airway with propofol maintenance
Time measurements are used to evaluate the efficiency of the different techniques. We will compare the times spent in the operating room and the postoperative unit for each technique. We will assess the operating conditions for the Gastroenterologist under each technique. We will also measure parental satisfaction with a questionnaire given to the parents when the patients are ready to be discharged. variables will be analyzed using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank tests.
This study has the potential to clarify which anesthetic technique has a better safety profile as well as better efficiency.</description>
