      Researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine are seeking participants for a
      research study examining the effectiveness of a pivotal response treatment package (PRT-P) in
      targeting language skills in young children with autism. Research has demonstrated that
      behavioral interventions, such as Pivotal Response Training (PRT), lead to improvements in
      the core symptoms of autism. Researchers have begun to develop strategies to investigate the
      effectiveness of combining a parent training program teaching parents how to implement PRT
      with in-home, therapist-implemented treatment. To determine the effectiveness of a PRT-P, it
      will be compared to a delayed treatment group (DTG) by conducting a randomized controlled
      24-week trial. This research will allow us to help in the development of therapeutic
      approaches that can meet the increasing service demands for families. We hope that
      investigating interventions that aim to improve core deficits will aid clinicians in
      providing better care for children with autism.
