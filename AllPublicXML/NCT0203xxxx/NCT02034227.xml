  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the experimental drug, SG2000 is safe and
      tolerable in the treatment of participants with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia and
      acute myeloid leukemia whose standard treatment did not work, whose cancer came back or who
      are not candidates for other types of standard therapy.
