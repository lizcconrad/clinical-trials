      As specified in the VA Uniform Services Handbook, Family Psycho-Education (FPE) treatment
      must be available to all Veterans with schizophrenia who could benefit, and their family
      members. This includes those receiving care at Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs),
      and at Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers (PRRCs), whether provided on site, by
      referral, or by telemental health. However, less than 5% of VA medical centers offer FPE.
      Clearly, a major challenge is to devise ways to deliver mental health treatments and services
      to Veterans who need them in ways that meet their needs and preferences. The proposed project
      will compare the use of a website to deliver FPE to that of in-person delivered FPE. The
      findings could have profound implications for the VA's ability to improve the reach, use,
      appeal, and effectiveness of FPE for Veterans with schizophrenia, by using an e-health model
      that facilitates family involvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the VA Family Psycho-Educational (FPE) is a component of the Uniform Services standard for
      care of Veterans with schizophrenia and their family members. FPE includes single family
      variants, e.g., Behavioral Family Therapy, which is provided to individual families (consumer
      and family members); and multi-family variants, e.g., Multi-Family Group Psycho-Education
      (MFG-stands for 'Multi-Family Group'), which is provided to multiple families (consumers and
      family members together) in a single treatment group. To promote the availability of FPE to
      all Veterans who could benefit, the VA began national trainings of clinicians in FPE. Despite
      this training, the proven effectiveness of FPE, and that it is the standard for care, it is
      not widely available to Veterans, is underutilized even where available, and can incur
      relatively high resistance from Veterans and families. Less than 5% of VA Medical Centers
      provide FPE. Further, even where it is available, it reaches a relatively small proportion of
      Veterans who could benefit. Barriers to receiving this treatment include the lack of
      appropriately trained clinicians, the need for Veterans and family members to travel to
      receive these services--this maybe a particularly important hurdle for a treatment that meets
      bi-weekly for a minimum of nine months--the tendency to avoid in-person treatment due to the
      stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment, and the difficulty of providing
      treatments after hours or on weekends when families are more likely be able to attend. It is
      important for the VA to have treatment delivery models that maximize the likelihood that all
      Veterans in need will receive interventions such as FPE, including Veterans residing in rural
      settings, and Veterans who avoid VA settings due to stigma. E-health delivery of services has
      been a focus of the VA as a way to overcome these barriers. Specialized web-based approaches
      have been studied and found to be successful for people with schizophrenia, and their
      families, and can deliver content that is intensive and engaging with reduced requirements
      for staff time.

      The investigators' previous work has developed a model and guidelines to design e-health
      applications for persons with schizophrenia and others with cognitive impairments (e.g.,
      Rotondi, VA RR&amp;D D61804R), and developed a highly scalable intervention termed Schizophrenia
      On-line Access to Resources (SOAR) (Rotondi, R01 MH63484). SOAR incorporated FPE into a
      modernized model that: incorporates web-based delivery; provides the ability of users to
      individualize commitment and services to meet varied preferences and needs, in order to
      address prominent reasons for resistance to FPE; and is accessible from homes and smart
      phones. SOAR was highly successful at reducing illness symptoms for persons with
      schizophrenia and improving their and their family members' knowledge of the illness.

      The aims of this study are to conduct: 1) To conduct a non-inferiority randomized trial of
      DSW vs. in-person MFG vs. Treatment as usual (TAU) that compares changes in severity of
      positive and negative psychiatric symptoms, and family psychological burden, during treatment
      and 3-months post-treatment 2) exploratory secondary analyses to identify Veteran and family
      characteristics that are associated with decreased levels of psychiatric symptoms and
      caregiver burden; 3) exploratory qualitative analyses to inform a larger implementation of
      SOAR by identifying barriers, facilitators, VA system requirements, etc. from clinicians
      providing the treatments, their supervisors, and participants. If successful, SOAR could
      substantially increase the options, availability, utilization, appeal, and effectiveness of
      FPE for Veterans and their families, thereby improving Veteran well-being, recovery, and
      Veteran and family quality of life.
