  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uraemic pruritus (UP) remains a frequent and distressing problem in patients with advanced
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

      Calmmax is a new topical cream that was introduced recently by Calmmax Pharma, an Israeli
      pharmaceutical company developed a topical cream based on active plant extracts for treatment
      of skin inflammation. We intend to conduct a prospective, double blind, placebo controlled,
      randomized trial that will assess the therapeutic effect of Calmmax cream on UP in a cohort
      of CKD and ESRD patients.
