      It is intended to examine the safety and efficacy of desensitization therapy by GB-0998
      (intravenous immunoglobulin) for the anti-donor antibody positive recipient in need of
      pre-transplant desensitization. Patients with positive FCXM-T after performing twice double
      filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) therapy will receive GB-0998 1g/kg/day for four days.
