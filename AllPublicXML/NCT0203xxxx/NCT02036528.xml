    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AppliGel-G (Gentamicin topical gel) plus
      oral Ciprofloxacin / Doxycycline are safe and effective in the treatment of mild to
      moderately infected foot ulcers in diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a serious and common complication of diabetes and
      is among the most common diabetes-related cause of hospitalization and the leading cause of
      diabetes-associated lower limb amputation. The effectiveness of various systemic antibiotics,
      particularly the fluoroquinolones, in treating infected DFUs has been demonstrated.

      An alternative or adjunct to systemic antibiotic treatment of infected DFU's is topical
      antibiotic treatment. Topical treatment would have the advantages of avoiding systemic
      adverse effects, providing increased target site concentration, and allowing the use of
      antibiotics not approved for systemic treatment.

      AppliGel-G is a topically applied hydrogel formulation of gentamicin sulfate (GMS). Once in
      place the product remains in contact with the wound bed and releases Gentamicin to the wound
      bed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 18 years of age or older

          2. Subject has a mild to moderately infected (IDSA Mild or Moderate/ PEDIS Grade 2 or 3)
             diabetic foot ulcer and without a previous history of partial foot amputation.

          3. Subject has Diabetes Mellitus (type 1 or type 2).

          4. Wound area measurement between 1-25 cm2 and does not exceed 25 cm2.

          5. Subject is in general good health in the opinion of the investigator as determined by
             medical history, vital signs and a physical examination.

          6. Female subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and be willing
             and able to use a medically acceptable method of birth control or declare that they
