      Post-Marketing Requirement study to evaluate the safety of octaplas™ versus plasma in
      patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The primary objective is to
      assess the incidence of hyperfibrinolysis in patients undergoing (OLT) receiving octaplas™
      versus regular plasma (e.g., fresh frozen plasma and other FDA and AABB approved plasma
      products).

    <measure>To assess the incidence of hyperfibinolysis in patients undergoing OLT receiving octaplas™ versus regular plasma (e.g., fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and other FDA and American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) approved plasma products).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days (perioperative period plus post-operative follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of 'clinically relevant hyperfibrinolytic events' in patients receiving octaplas™ will be compared with the incidence rate in patients receiving plasma. For this trial a 'clinically relevant hyperfibrinolytic event' is defined as a decrease of at least 7.5% in the maximum amplitude (MA) as measured by the thromboelastography (TEG) or rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM) within 30 minutes after MA is achieved and the event is associated with bleeding requiring intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety of octaplas™ in comparison to plasma will be assessed by monitoring the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (i.e., transfusion reactions).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days (perioperative period plus post-operative follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of all adverse drug reactions (i.e., transfusion reactions) during the study period among patients receiving octaplas™ in comparison to standard plasma products.</description>
