  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A genomic test was developed to predict chemo-sensitivity to taxane-anthracycline-based
      chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment. The primary aim of this study is to prospectively
      evaluate the microarray-based, genomic test as a predictor of axillary lymph node response.
      Also, to determine whether the probability of achieving negative axillary nodes, is
      sufficiently high for patients whose breast cancer is predicted to be chemo-sensitive to
      support omitting axillary dissection.

    <description>The overall rate of pathologic lymph node-negative status (pLN0) will be evaluated, including clinically lymph node-negative (cLN-) and lymph node-positive (cLN+) patients. For sample size calculation we will consider the rate of nodal conversion from clinically node-positive (cLN+) before treatment to pathologic node-negative (pLN0) after the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who are clinically node positive (cLN+) will be evaluated for nodal response, i.e. conversion to pLN0 status. We assume that 30% of these patients will be predicted by the genomic predictor as responders (i.e. pLN0 status) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and that 70% of them will actually achieve pLN0 status. The study will be sized to have 80% power to detect observed response (pLN-negative) rates &gt; 50% in cLN-positive patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a 95% confidence level (one sided). Probability will be measured in percent.</description>
