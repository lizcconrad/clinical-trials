  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Atezolizumab in
      participants with PD-L1-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Participants will receive Atezolizumab 1200 milligrams (mg) intravenously every 3
      weeks as long as participants are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the
      investigator, that is , in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration
      attributed to disease progression.

    <description>ORR was the percentage of participants whose confirmed best overall response was either a Partial Response (PR) or a Complete Response (CR) based upon the IRF assessment per RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm); PR:greater than (&gt;) or equal to (=) 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline in sum of diameters of target lesions, non-progressive disease (PD) non-target lesions and no new lesions. Results were reported by line of therapy and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression Subgroup (tumor cell [TC]3 [TC3] or tumor-infiltrating immune cell [IC] 3 [IC3], TC3 or IC2/3, TC2/3 or IC2/3).</description>

CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm; PR: &gt; or = 30 % decrease from baseline in sum of diameters of target lesions, non-PD non-target lesions and no new lesions; PD: one or more of the following: at least 20% increase from nadir in sum of diameters of target lesions (with an absolute increase of at least 5mm), appearance of new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. DOR was assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results were reported by line of therapy (reporting arms) and PD-L1 Expression Subgroup (TC3 or IC3, TC3 or IC2/3, TC2/3 or IC2/3).</description>

Participants were permitted to continue treatment after progressive disease, if the following criteria were met: evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator; absence of symptoms and signs indicating unequivocal progression of disease; no decline in ECOG performance status; absence of tumor growth at critical anatomical sites that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions; evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator. Participants in this cohort progressed during or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic setting.</description>
