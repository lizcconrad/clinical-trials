      Korean Red Ginseng may improve fatigue in healthy subject. It is not yet known whether Korean
      Red Ginseng is effective compared with a placebo in chemotherapy.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Korean Red Ginseng is effective in the
      treatment of the fatigue from colorectal cancer with chemotherapy.(modified FOLFOX-6)
