      The primary objective is to show that multiple transportable carbohydrate ingestion is more
      effective in improving endurance performance compared to single transportable carbohydrate
      ingestion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males aged 18 to 60 years

          -  A history of competitive triathlon performance (≥ 2 years)

          -  Participation in at least four competitive triathlon events within the past 2 years

          -  Be in regular training for triathlon events

          -  A personal best time for a standard ½ Ironman race (1.9 km swim, 90 km cycle, 21.1 km
             run) in the last year of either:

               -  ≤ 6 h 00 min, for men aged 18-40 years

               -  or ≤6 h 05 min for men aged 40-50 years

               -  or ≤6 h 20 min for men aged 50-60 years

          -  Alternatively, if not competed in ½ Ironman in the last year, at least one standard
             distance triathlon (1.5 km swim, 40 km cycle, 10 km run) within the last 12 months:

               -  ≤2 h 13 min, for men aged 18-40 years

               -  or ≤2 h 18 min for men aged 40-50 years

               -  or ≤2 h 23 min for men aged 50-60 years

          -  Available to compete in the ½ Ironman events and complete all study requirements

          -  Experienced in using carbohydrate supplementation, as gels, bars, and drinks in
             training/racing, specifically at rates ≥60-90g/h)

          -  Experience of specific formulations may include both or only multiple and single
             transportable carbohydrates, thus a full assessment would be made prior to recruitment
             to ensure balance during randomization and account for any association with the
             primary outcome

          -  Obtained his (or his legal representative's) informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet health requirements defined in the Health Questionnaire

          -  Prior known fructose intolerance

          -  Wheat intolerance or other precluding food or packaging-related allergies

          -  An existing injury affecting ability to race to best ability

          -  A chronic injury that may affect ability to complete the races

          -  Unable to carry out performance assessments and questionnaires correctly

          -  Unable to tolerate the treatment during the familiarization sessions

          -  Taking medications thought to interfere with the study outcomes

          -  Currently participating or having participated in another clinical study during the
             last four weeks prior to the beginning of this study
