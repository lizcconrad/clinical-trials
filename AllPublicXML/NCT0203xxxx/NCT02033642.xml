  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of a
      24-session, 6-month family-based behavioral intervention (FBBI) - as compared to a delayed
      treatment group which later receives the same FBBI - that targets weight loss in
      adolescents/young adults with intellectual disability aged 15-22 years. The second purpose of
      this randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of a 12-session, 6-month
      Maintenance intervention that targets maintenance of weight loss in the same population of
      adolescents/young adults with intellectual disability. The Maintenance condition follows the
      completion of each FBBI group and involves a re-randomization to either the Maintenance
      intervention or no further intervention. Outcome measures include Body Mass Index (BMI),
      waist circumference, physical activity/sedentary behavior (measured via accelerometry),
      dietary patterns (3-Day Food Records), self-efficacy and psychosocial characteristics
      (Adolescent Depression and Anxiety Scale). Hypotheses are that (1) participants in the FBBI
      condition will lose more weight (reduced BMI) than participants in the delayed treatment
      condition, and that (2) participants in the Maintenance condition will maintain weight lost
      (reductions in BMI) or experience less weight regain, as compared with participants who
      receive no further intervention following FBBI.

Self-efficacy is a measure of confidence in one's ability to competently engage in a behavior. In this case, self efficacy will be assessed for adolescents' dietary and physical activity behaviors.</description>
