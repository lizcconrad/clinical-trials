  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical utility study is based on a review of real but de-identified and randomized
      patient cases and aims to evaluate radiation oncologist's treatment recommendations before
      and after reviewing the results provided by the Decipher test. The primary intent is to help
      guide development and design of future clinical utility studies for Decipher.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient cases were selected using existing data generated from patient specimens collected in
      a separate IRB approved protocol, in which pathological specimens were tested to generate a
      test result for comparison to outcomes. Those test results are presented in this study, but
      not the individual patient outcomes. Physicians participating in this current study did not
      provide care for any of the subjects in the previous study. Cases are presented to physicians
      in a randomized order and in a form that prevents the patients from being identified,
      directly or indirectly.

      High risk patient cases were selected to reflect a range of clinicopathological variables and
      were further stratified based on the Decipher predicted probability of developing metastasis
      5 years after RP and 3 years after BCR (as shown in the table below). High (low) Decipher
      (GC) risk was defined as a 5- or 3-year predicted probability of metastasis greater (less)
      than 6% for the adjuvant setting and greater (less) than 18% for the salvage setting.

Perform consultations on at least 80 patients with prostate cancer annually
Each participant is asked to complete a questionnaire to assess the impact of Decipher on physicians' treatment recommendation. All participants use the same data collection instrument. Each participant's opinion is collected based on a random selection of cases.</description>

    <description>Pathological data from 12 de-identified patient cases will be reviewed by at least 25 Radiation Oncologists before and after exposure to the Decipher test results. Given the number of patient cases, reviewed by each participant, this allows for assessment of decision making based on 300 patient case reviews at each time point, immediately following RP and at the time of PSA rise.</description>

        Radiation oncologists targeted for recruitment into the study must meet the following
        criteria:

          -  Perform consultations on at least 80 patients with prostate cancer annually.

        Patients:

        Patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer that received radical prostatectomy as
        the first line treatment.

        De-identified patient cases were selected from an independent clinical validation study of
        patients with adverse pathology features treated between 2000 and 2006. (Karnes et al.,
        2013)

        Patient cases eligible for this study were treated with radical prostatectomy and have one
        or more adverse pathological features present defined as:

        Pathological Gleason score ≥ 8 or Gleason score 7 with primary pattern 4; Pathological
        stage T3a (= Extracapsular extension) or T3b (=Seminal vesicle invasion); Positive surgical
        margins Gleason grade upgrade from biopsy to surgery Detectable PSA, defined as failure of
        PSA to fall to undetectable, or PSA detectable and rising on 2 or more subsequent
        determinations

        Case Exclusion Criteria:

        Metastatic disease (M+) prior to surgery Received any neo-adjuvant prostate cancer
        treatment prior to radical prostatectomy (radiation, hormone, chemotherapy)
