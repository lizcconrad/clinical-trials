      Hope is important for family/friends of persons with dementia residing in Long Term Care
      Facilities. Our research team has developed a program (Living with Hope) to increase hope and
      quality of life of family caregivers. The Living with Hope Program involves a) viewing the
      Living with Hope film which features caregivers of persons with dementia describing their
      hope and b) a hope activity entitled &quot;Stories of the Present&quot;. A new Living with Hope film
      entitled &quot;Connecting with Hope&quot; has been produced and will be used in this pilot study. The
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Living
      With Hope Program and collect preliminary data on the effectiveness of the Living with Hope
      Program for family members of persons with dementia residing in Long Term Care.

      30 participants will be recruited from St. Joseph's Auxiliary hospital, the Alzheimer's
      Society of Alberta, and the Alberta Caregivers Association in Edmonton based on inclusion
      criteria. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: treatment (Watching
      a film on hope and Stories of the Present for one month); low dose group (Stories of the
      Present only); or usual care group. In all groups measures of hope, quality of life,
      self-efficacy and guild will be collected at visit 1, day 7, day 14 and one month in addition
      to demographic information. Participants in group 1 and 2 (treatment group) will be asked to
      describe what they were thinking about when doing the hope activities on day 7, 14 and one
      month using qualitative interviews. At one month all participants will be interviewed using
      open ended audio-taped questions to help evaluate the study procedures

      Background: Hope is important for family/friends of persons with dementia residing in Long
      Term Care Facilities (LTC). Our research team has developed a program (Living with Hope) to
      increase hope and quality of life of family caregivers. The Living with Hope Program (LWHP)
      involves a) viewing the Living with Hope film which features caregivers of persons with
      dementia describing their hope and b) a hope activity entitled &quot;Stories of the Present&quot;. The
      hope activity consists of participants writing at the end of the day about their thoughts,
      challenges and what gave them hope over a 4- week time period. For family caregivers of
      persons with advanced cancer, this LWHP has been found to increase their hope and feelings of
      self-efficacy (confidence in their ability to deal with difficult situations). Based on a
      qualitative study of hope of family caregivers of persons with dementia residing in LTC, the
      LWHP has been adapted to that population. A new Living with Hope film entitled &quot;Connecting
      with Hope&quot; has been produced and will be used in this pilot study.

      Aims: The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the
      LWHP and collect preliminary data on the effectiveness of the Living with Hope Program for
      family members of persons with dementia residing in LTC.

      Sample: Shannon Stachnik (Social Worker St. Joseph's Auxiliary Hospital), Arlene Huhn
      (Alzheimer's Society of Alberta - Edmonton) and Anna Mann (Alberta Caregivers Association)
      will identify potential participants based on the inclusion criteria. They will make contact
      and ask if the potential participants are willing to talk with a research nurse about the
      study. If they agree the research nurse will contact potential participants. Inclusion
      criterion for participants are: a) 18 years of age and older, b) English speaking, and c)
      have a family member or friend with dementia who resides in LTC.

      The research nurse will contact potential participants and ask them when it will be a
      convenient time to meet with and obtain written informed consent.

      Design: Using a mixed-methods randomized control trial (Quantitative +qualitative) design, 30
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) treatment (Watching a film
      on hope and Stories of the Present for one month), 2) low dose group (Stories of the Present
      only) or 3) usual care group. In all groups, demographic information, and baseline, day 7 ,14
      and one month, measures of hope (Herth Hope Index), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), general
      self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale) and guilt (Caregiver Guilt Questionnaire) will be
      collected by a trained research nurse. Participants in group 1 and 2 (treatment group) will
      be asked to describe what they were thinking about when doing the hope activities on day 7,
      14 and one month using qualitative interviews. At one month all participants will be
      interviewed using open ended audiotaped questions to help evaluate the study procedures

    <description>Hope is measured by the Herth Hope Index (HHI). The Herth Hope Index is a 12 item (1-4 point)Likert scale that delineates three sub-scales of hope: a) temporality and future, b) positive readiness and expectancy, and c) interconnectedness. The HHI has been found to take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Summative scores range from 12-48, with a higher score denoting greater hope. The HHI has been found to be reliable (test-retest r=91, p&lt;0.05) and valid (concurrent validity, r=84, p.,0.05; criterion, r=92, p,0.05; divergent, r=-0.73, p,0.05).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at day 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life is measured by the World Health Organization Quality of Life -Bref measure. The WHOQOL-BREF is a quality of life assessment measure based on the World Health Organization definition of quality of life reflecting 4 domains of quality of life: physical health (Domain 1), psychological health (Domain 2), social relations (Domain 3), and environment (Domain 4). The WHOQOL-BREF is comprised of 26 items measuring the domains and is a shorter version of the original WHOQOL. The scores are not reported as a total, but per domain. The higher the score, the higher the subjects' reported quality of life in each domain. Reliability has been reported to be 0.82. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was r = 0.76.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>General Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at day 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>General Self-efficacy is measured using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). This 10 item (0-4) Likert type scale produces a total perceived self-efficacy score. Higher scores on the GSES indicate a higher self-efficacy or the confidence of one's ability to deal with adverse situations. It has a maximum score of 40.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver guilt</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at day 7 , 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver guilt is measured by the Caregiver Guilt Questionnaire. This 22 item scale measures guilt on a five-point Likert scale (0 &quot;Never&quot; to 4 &quot;Always&quot;) with a total range between 0 and 88. A higher score indicates that the respondent experienced more feelings of guilt related to their care giving. Cronbach's alpha indicated excellent internal consistency at 0.926.</description>
