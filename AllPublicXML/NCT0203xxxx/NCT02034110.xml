  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study of oral Dabrafenib in
      combination with oral Trametinib in subjects with rare cancers including anaplastic thyroid
      cancer, biliary tract cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, non-seminomatous germ cell
      tumor/non-geminomatous germ cell tumor, hairy cell leukemia, World Health Organization (WHO)
      Grade 1 or 2 glioma, WHO Grade 3 or 4 (high-grade) glioma, multiple myeloma, and
      adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, with BRAF V600E positive-mutations. This study is
      designed to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of oral Dabrafenib in combination with
      oral Trametinib in subjects with rare BRAF V600E mutated cancers. Subjects will need to have
      a fresh or frozen tumor tissue sample provided to confirm the BRAF V600E mutation status.
      Only subjects with histologically confirmed advanced disease and no available standard
      treatment options will be eligible for enrollment. Subjects will undergo screening
      assessments within 14 days (up to 35 days for ophthalmology exam, echocardiogram or disease
      assessments) prior to the start of treatment to determine their eligibility for enrollment in
      the study.
