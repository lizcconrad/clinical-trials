  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based education program
      incorporating virtual coaching. For this study, the virtual coach will consist of online
      videos aimed at providing acne education and promoting behaviors that support healthy skin.
      The use of Web-based technologies and virtual coaching in acne-related patient education is
      novel, and may significantly improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in acne patients.
      We hypothesize that an interactive Internet-based education and counseling program will be
      more effective than Internet-based education alone in improving clinical outcomes and quality
      of life in acne patients.
