  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in healthy male and female subjects. The study will
      consist of 2 parts: Part A (3 cohorts of healthy Japanese subjects dosed in the evening) and
      Part B (one cohort of healthy white subjects dosed in the evening). The cohorts will be
      conducted sequentially. Part A will be started first with the 2.5-mg dose cohort, followed by
      the 10-mg dose cohort and then the 25-mg dose cohort. Part B will be conducted in parallel
      with the 10-mg cohort of Part A, with the possibility of overlap.
