  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellulitis is among the most common infections leading to hospitalization, yet the optimal
      duration of therapy remains ill defined. Pragmatically, Dutch guidelines advise 10-14 days of
      antibiotics, which is the current standard of care. Recently it has been shown that
      antibiotic treatment for pneumonia and urinary tract infections can safely and significantly
      be shortened. Importantly, in an outpatient setting, treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis
      with 5 days of antibiotics was as effective as 10 days. We hypothesize that there is no
      difference in outcomes when patients hospitalized with cellulitis are treated with either a
      short-course (6 days) or standard-course (12 days) of antibiotics.

The response is deemed indeterminate when the patients (i) received less than 80% of the study drug for reasons other than treatment failure, (ii) acquired a concomitant infection outside of the skin requiring antibiotic treatment, (iii) were lost to follow-up, or (iv) died unrelated to the primary diagnosis.</description>

Indeterminate is (i) receiving &lt;80% of study drug for reasons other than unblinding/requiring new AB for cellulitis/being unable to continue due to adverse effects, (ii) acquired a concomitant infection outside of the skin requiring antibiotic treatment, (iii) were lost to follow-up, or (iv) died unrelated to the primary diagnosis.
