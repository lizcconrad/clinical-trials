  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single group study to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of
      atazanavir 300 mg daily boosted with ritonavir 100mg daily in HIV-infected patients over a
      period of 9 days.

      Ritonavir and atazanavir are protease inhibitors used to treat HIV. However, ritonavir, when
      used at low doses (up to 100mg) does not have HIV activity, but will enhance (boost) the
      blood concentrations of other drugs like atazanavir.

      Recently, a study showed that taking 50mg of ritonavir administered in an oral solution led
      to similar blood concentrations of atazanavir than when given with 100mg of ritonavir.
      Potential benefits associated with a lower dose of ritonavir may include a reduction of side
      effects such as upset stomach and an improvement in cholesterol level. This study will look
      at the amount of atazanavir into your blood when given with ritonavir in a tablet formulation
      at 50mg or 100mg with standard atazanavir dose (300mg).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients meeting the following criteria will be eligible for participation in this
             study:

               1. Signed informed consent prior to any study-related activities.

               2. Documented HIV infection.

               3. Male or female patients between 18 and 70 years of age inclusively.

               4. Medication history, vital signs and physical exam adequately showing no signs of
                  acute illness at screening, as per the assessment by the physician.

               5. Patients must be willing to stop using any herbal or natural health products for
                  4 weeks prior to and during the study including:

                    -  Grapefruit, grapefruit juice, St. John's Wort and any others as determined
                       by the investigators.

               6. Patients must be on an antiretroviral regimen with atazanavir/ ritonavir 300/100
                  mg daily as the only protease inhibitor plus any combination of nucleoside
                  reverse transcriptase inhibitors, for at least four weeks.

               7. VL&lt;40 copies/mL on the most recent measurement, during treatment with atazanavir
                  300 mg daily and ritonavir 100 mg daily, which must be within 12 weeks of the
                  study start date.
