      Randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, multicenter, efficacy and
      safety study in subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.

      Following the double blind period, subjects will be allowed to continue treatment with
      topical MRX-6 Cream 2% in an open-label extension. Demonstrate the efficacy of MRX-6 Cream 2%
      compared to Vehicle for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis and
      demonstrate the safety of MRX-6 Cream 2% for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of
      atopic dermatitis.
