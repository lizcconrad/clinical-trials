      Background: In hypertension, a highly prevalent disease, up to 10-15% of hypertensive
      patients have uncontrolled blood pressure despite a regimen of ≥ 3 drugs, which is known as
      resistant hypertension (RH). Cardiovascular prognosis in patients with RH is worse than in
      controlled hypertensives. Efferent renal sympathetic nerves play an important role in volume
      homeostasis and blood pressure. A novel minimally invasive technique based on the use of
      selective radiofrequency renal sympathetic denervation has shown promising preliminary
      results for the treatment of these patients. On the other hand, some patients with RH could
      improve their blood pressure control by adding spironolactone, an antagonist of aldosterone
      receptors.

      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency renal sympathetic denervation in
      patients with RH, as compared with the addition of spironolactone to the therapeutic regimen
      at baseline.

      Method: interventional, prospective, randomized, open study, of a cohort of 50 patients with
      RH, with office systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg and also with 24h systolic blood pressure
      ≥ 140 mmHg, despite treatment with ≥ 3 drugs in adequate doses, one of them a diuretic, and
      whitout treatment with either spironolactone or eplerenone. Patients will be randomized (1:1)
      to renal sympathetic denervation treatment or spironolactone (50mg), performing determination
      of office blood pressure and 24h-ABPM at pre-randomization, 1, 3 and 6 months, as well as
      laboratory tests, echocardiography, measurement of carotid intima-media thickness and central
      blood pressure measurement at pre-randomization and after 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 80 years.

          2. Subjects with diagnosed resistant arterial hypertension (office blood pressure ≥ 140
             and/or 90 mm Hg despite treatment with at least 3 antihypertensive drugs given at the
             maximum tolerated therapeutic dosage, being one of them a diuretic), with this
             therapeutic regimen maintained for at least the last 3 months.

          3. Office systolic blood pressure ≥150 mm Hg, with confirmation of resistance to
             treatment by 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, with 24h-systolic blood
             pressure ≥140 mmHg being required to be included.

          4. Patients who have freely given informed consent in writing, after the nature of the
             study and the disclosure of their data have been explained to them.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Secondary hypertension, renovascular disease included with appropriate tests
             according to investigator criteria (with the exceptions of chronic renal disease and
             obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome). 2. Inability to perform magnetic resonance
             angiography or renal CT angiography (contrast allergy). 3. Patients unlikely compliant
             with treatment (assessed according to Haynes-Sackett test). 4. Patients currently on
             treatment with an aldosterone receptor blocker (spironolactone, eplerenone) or who had
             previously received one of such class of drugs and had been withdrawn due to lack of
             efficacy and/or adverse effects. 5. Stage 3B, 4 or 5 of chronic renal disease
             (estimated glomerular filtration rate by MDRD equation &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73m2). 6.
             Pre-randomization serum potassium (K+) level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L. 7. Significant renal
             vascular anomalies. 8. Pregnant women. 9. Significant valvular heart disease. 10.

             disease) &lt; 6 months prior to study enrolment.
