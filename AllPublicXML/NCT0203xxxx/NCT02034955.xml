      This study will ultimately aim to evaluate the side effects of treatment by asking 20
      subjects to receive post-operative radiotherapy for prostate cancer with the treatment plan
      adapted after the first week of treatment to account for changes in the target shape. These
      patients will be asked to complete toxicity scores and a quality of life questionnaire at the
      start and completion of treatment, and at 3 months 1, 2 and 5 years from the start of
      radiotherapy. These results will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed
      approach, and obtain early estimates of improvements in uncertainty margin requirements for
      this population of patients.
