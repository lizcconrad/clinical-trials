  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators proposes a prospective cohort study in patients with high risk bladder
      cancer who have opted for radical cystectomy. The investigators aim to correlate
      pre-operative measures of body composition, cognitive and functional status with impaired
      survival at 6 months after cystectomy. Impairment in this context will be a compilation of
      several specific objective measures including: 1) death from any cause, 2) major complication
      (Clavien score7 ≥ 3), 3) loss of independent living status, 4) performance status, and 5)
      global well-being. The study team believes that Impairment Free Survival is an important
      endpoint as it accounts for many aspects of a patient's functional status that might alter a
      patient's choice to proceed with radical surgery.

    <description>Impairment-free survival is defined as the time from radical cystectomy to the identification of: 1) major complication (Clavien score7 ≥ 3), 2) loss of independent living status, 3) ECOG performance status ≥ 3 beyond 4 weeks from RC, 4) global well-being or 5) death from any cause. Patients who drop-out before the 6-month end of study and who have not had an impairment event will be censored at their time of drop-out.</description>

        Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be recruited from genitourinary cancer clinics
        at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. Patients undergoing initial
        consultation, active treatment, or surveillance after endoscopic or intravesical therapy
        will be identified and screened. Interested patients will be counseled by Dr. Lee or her
        designee, who will review the rationale and benefits of the study, the potential risks and
        probability of their occurrence, and the procedures to minimize these risks. Patients who
        wish to enter the study will be asked to sign a consent form that meets the requirements of
        the University of Michigan IRB. A signed copy of the patient consent will be entered into
        the medical record.
