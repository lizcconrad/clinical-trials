  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerves are made of different fats including omega-3s and omega-6s; however, dietary intakes
      of omega-6s are very high and omega-3 intakes are very low. We hypothesize that omega-3
      supplementation will stop diabetes related changes in cornea nerve structure in patients with
      type 1 diabetes to stop the development of nerve injury associated with future risk of
      neuropathy, and reflect changes in the degree of nerve injury over time. As such, we
      anticipate that patients in the study will maintain Corneal Nerve Fiber Length (CNFL), the
      primary outcome measure.

      This study will test the use of an omega-3 supplement as a potential way to stop nerve damage
      that has been observed in individuals with type 1 diabetes Nerves supply signals to all
      structures in the body and take signals back to the spinal cord and brain. Both small and
      large nerve fibres can be affected in disease states, such as diabetes. Since defects of
      small nerve fibre activity have important consequences (painful symptoms, erectile
      dysfunction, cardiac rhythm disturbances, bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction), it is
      important to determine new ways to maintain their function to help individuals maintain a
      high quality of life.

      Until now, researchers have only tested the effect of omega-3 supplementation in animals with
      diabetes and have found this nutrient to lessen nerve damage while maintaining the function
      of nerves. However, there has not been any research on the use of omega-3s on nerve structure
      and function in humans with type 1 diabetes.

      Current standard of care for type 1 diabetes is to manage glycemic control and any painful
      symptoms through medication. The use of omega-3 supplements for prevent or limit nerve damage
      in diabetes is not within the current standard of care. In this study omega-3 supplementation
      is experimental and has been approved by Health Canada for use in this study.
