    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of hormones on lung disease in
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Due to improved therapies, CF patients are living longer and
      healthier lives than they did 20 years ago. However, females have been shown to have a
      survival disadvantage. The median life expectancy is 33 in women and 37 in men with CF. The
      hypothesis is that estrogen and/or progesterone negatively impact lung health in CF.
      Therefore, understanding the impact of sex hormones (including the use of birth control
      pills) on the disease process is increasingly important. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if lung function, respiratory symptoms, or various markers of lung health change
      during different phases of the natural ovulatory cycle in order to understand if estrogen or
      progesterone hormones are impacting the disease relative to fluctuations in men with stable
      testosterone levels. The research objectives of this project are to:

        -  Determine if lung function, respiratory symptoms, or various markers of lung health
           change during different hormonal phases of the ovulatory cycle in women.

        -  Determine if men change lung function, respiratory symptoms, or various markers of lung
           health over time.

        -  Determine if oral contraceptive pills in women stabilize fluctuations in symptoms and
           improve lung health.

    <description>The main study is an observational study.
All women will be followed for one menstrual cycle (or approximately one month) observationally off of any hormone supplementation. They will have 3 study visits corresponding to their menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, and luteal).
Women participating in the main study may participate in the optional interventional sub-study.
Men participating in this study will be followed for 1 month observationally. They will have 3 study visits that correlate with the female arm of this study.</description>

    <description>Women participating in the main study may participate in the optional sub-study. Following a negative urine pregnancy test, women will be started on once daily oral Loestrin (1.5 mg norethindrone + 0.03 mg ethyl estradiol). They will be followed for two months on this agent and have 2 additional study visits.</description>

    <description>This is an optional substudy that females participating in the main study can choose to participate in. Loestrin, an oral contraceptive or birth control pill, will be prescribed and taken daily for approximately 2 months.</description>

          -  Female subjects starting this study must be willing to use a double barrier method of
             birth control (such as condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a substance that
             kills sperm), while participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria for Main Study:

          -  Women who are pregnant, breast feeding, or who have had an oophorectomy.

          -  Women who have received a hormone contraceptive injection (such as Depo Provera)

             mellitus with vascular disease, or have had a stroke, heart attack, or blood clot
             within the past year, due to a possible reaction to Loestrin.

          -  Women who currently smoke cigarettes, due to the increased risk of serious
             cardiovascular events with Loestrin use.
