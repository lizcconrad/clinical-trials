  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular breakfast consumption may help lower body weight reduce body fatness and improve
      cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, the best kind of breakfast to consume to
      achieve these effects is unclear. We hypothesized that a high fiber breakfast would suppress
      appetite, lower body weight and improve cardiovascular disease risk factors compared with a
      no-fiber breakfast.

      Participants will report to the hospital cafeteria between 0800 and 0900h following an
      overnight fast every weekday for 4 consecutive weeks. On arrival, participants will be
      provided will the allocated breakfast and will be given 15 min to consume all the foods
      provided. The oatmeal breakfast will consist of 80g dry oatmeal (Quaker Quick Oats) prepared
      with 120mL fat-free milk and 230mL water. The frosted flakes breakfast will consist of 62g
      frosted flakes and 160mL whole milk and 190mL water served on the side. The No-breakfast
      (control) will consist of only 350mL plain water. All participants will also receive 200mL
      decaffeinated coffee with 12mL non-dairy creamer and 1g packet of non-caloric sweetener. On
      Friday of each week participants will be provided with two portions of the breakfasts to take
      home at consume on the weekend days. On the first day of the intervention and weekly
      thereafter participants will complete 3hr subjective appetite ratings responses to the
      breakfast. Laboratory assessments including body weight, composition, blood pressure and a
      fasting blood sample will be collected before the start of the intervention and at the end of
      the intervention.
