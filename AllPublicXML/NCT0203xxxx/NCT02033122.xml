  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training has been proposed as adjunctive therapy in asthma to improve many clinical
      outcomes; however its effects on bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and inflammation,
      characteristic features in asthma, remains poorly understood. We aim to investigate the
      effects of aerobic training on BHR (primary aim) and systemic inflammation (secondary aim).
      In addition, clinical control and health related quality of life (HRQoL) will be also
      assessed.

      This is a randomized, controlled and single-blind trial whose intervention will be an aerobic
      training. Fifty -eight patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma will be recruited
      at a university hospital and randomly assigned in two groups: control (CG) or training (TG)
      .The study will be performed between two medical visits with intervals of six months and
      during this period the same medication dosage will be maintained. Patients in CG will perform
      (an educational program + breathing exercise; n=28) and TG patients will perform (an
      educational program+breathing exercises+aerobic training; n=30).The sessions will be
      conducted twice a week, for 3 months. Before and after the intervention, all patients will be
      evaluated by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, serum cytokines levels, total immunoglobulin E,
      induced sputum, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), asthma clinical control (daily
      symptoms dairy, exacerbations and asthma control questionnaire - ACQ), health related quality
      of life (HRQoL); asthma quality of life questionnaire-(AQLQ), pulmonary function and
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing. All the patients will be evaluated by specific
      immunoglobulin E (atopy) through (skin prick test or Phadiatop).

    <description>The bronchial provocation test will be conducted according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guideline (1999). Patients will inhale increasing concentrations of histamine following the sequences: 0.0625, 0.25, 1.0, 4.0 and 16.0 mg/ ml using the method of the dosimeter (DeVilbiss 646nebulizer, DeVilbiss Health Care, USA) . Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) will be measured after 30 and 90 seconds from the end of inhalations. The test will considered positive when the concentration of histamine promotes a fall ≥ 20% in FEV1 (PC20) with respect to the post-saline value or when the maximum concentration is reached (16 mg/mL).</description>

    <description>the intervention will be an aerobic training program. For the TG subjects, breathing exercises will have duration of 30 minutes and will be always followed by aerobic training sessions that will consist in 35 minutes divided in 5 minutes of warm-up, 25 minutes of aerobic training and 5 minutes of cool down. Initially, aerobic training will be performed at the heart rate (HR) corresponding to one third of the difference between the anaerobic threshold (AnT) and the respiratory compensation point (RCP) obtained in the incremental cardiopulmonary testing (CPET) and after two weeks of the adaptation, the intensity will increased to two thirds of the difference between AnT and RCP. The program will be performed twice a week, for 3 months.</description>
