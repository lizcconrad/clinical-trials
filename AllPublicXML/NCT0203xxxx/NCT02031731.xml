      This phase I study will examine the pharmacokinetics and safety of Onartuzumab (MetMAb) in
      chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Patients will be divided
      into 3 cohorts, which will each be given a different dose of MetMAb. The cohorts will be
      treated sequentially, starting with the lowest dose. MetMAb will be administered
      intravenously every 3 weeks. Patients may be treated for up to 16 cycles (21 days each) or 1
      year, whichever occurs first, in the absence of disease progression.

             within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment.
