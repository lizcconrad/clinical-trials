  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      subcutaneously administered tocilizumab in monotherapy and/or in combination with
      methotrexate and other non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARDs) in
      participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are naïve to tocilizumab. Participants
      will receive tocilizumab 162 milligram (mg) subcutaneously weekly for 24 weeks. Participants
      who complete the core study achieving at least a moderate European League Against Rheumatism
      (EULAR) response at Week 24 may enter the extension phase and receive for a further 28 weeks
      at the most.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) Score in the Full Analysis Set (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count of 28 joints (TJC28), swollen joint count of 28 joints (SJC28), patient's global assessment of disease activity visual analog scale (PGA VAS) with 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity displayed on the 100-millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS and acute phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP]) for a total possible score of 0 to 10. For this study ESR was used to calculate the DAS28 score. The index is calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56*√[TJC28]) + (0.28*√[SJC28]) + (0.70*ln[ESR]) + (0.014*VAS). Higher scores represent higher disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Positive American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Response Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 2, Week 24, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR core set of outcome measures and their definition of improvement includes a &gt;= 20% improvement (ACR20) compared to Baseline in both SJC and TJC as well as in three out of five additional parameters: Physician's Global Assessment of disease activity VAS, PGA VAS, patient's assessment of pain VAS, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and acute phase reactant (CRP or ESR). VAS range for all assessments was 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity displayed on the 100-mm horizontal VAS. Achievement of an ACR50 requires a &gt;= 50% improvement in the same parameters and an ACR70 requires a &gt;= 70% improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Responses According to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR ) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 2, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>EULAR response was calculated as the difference between DAS28-ESR scores at baseline and Week 24, and reported as the percentage of participants with good, moderate, or no response. Good responders = decrease from baseline &gt;1.2 with a DAS28 score of &lt;=3.2; moderate responders = decrease from baseline &gt;1.2 with a DAS28 score of &gt;3.2, or decrease from baseline &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 with a DAS28 score of &lt;=5.1; non-responders = decrease from baseline &lt;=0.6 or decrease from baseline &gt;0.6 and &lt;=1.2 with a DAS28 score of &gt;5.1.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)/Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 2, Week 24 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SDAI is a similar index to DAS28 but has the advantage of not needing a complicated mathematical formula for its determination, but a simple arithmetical addition of TJC28 and SJC28, PGA VAS and Physician Global Assessment of disease activity VAS, and CRP concentration in mg/L. CDAI does not incorporate an acute response, therefore it can be used to evaluate disease activity in the absence of laboratory testing of CRP and ESR. VAS range for all assessments was 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity displayed on the 100-mm horizontal VAS. SDAI scores ranged from 0 to 86, CDAI from 0 to 76 with higher scores indicating increased disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 2, Week 24 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The symptom-specific measure FACIT-F was developed to assess chronic illness therapy with special emphasis on fatigue in the past 7 days. In this study, only the FACIT-F short questionnaire, which is a shorter version of the initial FACIT-F questionnaire, was used. Each of the questions is categorically answered using the scales 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much. The figures are reversed during score calculations, so that higher score values indicate more favorable conditions. The 13 items included in the FACIT-F short can be used to calculate the brief score for FACIT-F scale (score range: 0-52). A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 4, Week 24 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The participant self-rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. Global scores range from 0 to 21 and a global sum of &quot;5&quot; or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper. Although there are several questions that request the evaluation of the participant's bed mate or roommate, these are not scored. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Safety: Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) Score in the Full Analysis Set (FAS)</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity calculated using the tender joint count of 28 joints (TJC28), swollen joint count of 28 joints (SJC28), patient’s global assessment of disease activity visual analog scale (PGA VAS) with 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity displayed on the 100-millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS and acute phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP]) for a total possible score of 0 to 10. For this study ESR was used to calculate the DAS28 score. The index is calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56*√[TJC28]) + (0.28*√[SJC28]) + (0.70*ln[ESR]) + (0.014*VAS). Higher scores represent higher disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity calculated using the TJC28, SJC28, PGA VAS with 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity displayed on the 100-mm horizontal VAS and acute phase reactant (ESR or CRP) for a total possible score of 0 to 10. For this study ESR was used to calculate the DAS28 score. The index is calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56*√[TJC28]) + (0.28*√[SJC28]) + (0.70*ln[ESR]) + (0.014*VAS). Higher scores represent higher disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
          <population>The PPS consisted of all participants of the FAS having a value at baseline and at Week 24 for the endpoint DAS28-ESR, excluding sponsor defined deviation(s) which could have affected the evaluation of the primary endpoint (DAS28-ESR). Here, n is the number of participants with evaluable data for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>SDAI is a similar index to DAS28 but has the advantage of not needing a complicated mathematical formula for its determination, but a simple arithmetical addition of TJC28 and SJC28, PGA VAS and Physician Global Assessment of disease activity VAS, and CRP concentration in mg/L. CDAI does not incorporate an acute response, therefore it can be used to evaluate disease activity in the absence of laboratory testing of CRP and ESR. VAS range for all assessments was 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity displayed on the 100-mm horizontal VAS. SDAI scores ranged from 0 to 86, CDAI from 0 to 76 with higher scores indicating increased disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity calculated using TJC28, SJC28, PGA VAS with 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity displayed on the 100-millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS and acute phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP]) for a total possible score of 0 to 10. For this study ESR was used to calculate the DAS28 score. The index is calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56*√[TJC28]) + (0.28*√[SJC28]) + (0.70*ln[ESR]) + (0.014*VAS). Higher scores represent higher disease activity. Clinical remission = score &lt;2.6; Low disease activity = score ≥2.6 and ≤3.2; Moderate disease activity = score &gt; 3.2 and ≤5.1; High disease activity = score &gt;5.1.</description>

Clinical remission = score &lt;2.6; Low disease activity = score ≥2.6 and ≤3.2; Moderate disease activity = score &gt; 3.2 and ≤5.1; High disease activity = score &gt;5.1.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Clinically Significant Improvement in DAS28</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity calculated using TJC28, SJC28, PGA VAS with 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity displayed on the 100-millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS and acute phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP]) for a total possible score of 0 to 10. For this study ESR was used to calculate the DAS28 score. The index is calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56*√[TJC28]) + (0.28*√[SJC28]) + (0.70*ln[ESR]) + (0.014*VAS). Higher scores represent higher disease activity. DAS28 Clinically Significant Improvement was defined as a DAS28 score reduction of at least 1.2 units from Baseline.</description>

It consists of 20 questions referring to eight component sets: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other common activities. Each category contains multiple questions, which were answered using a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. The overall index score was an average of the individual item responses and may range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate more difficulty in daily living activities. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F)</title>
        <description>The symptom-specific measure FACIT-F was developed to assess chronic illness therapy with special emphasis on fatigue in the past 7 days. In this study, only the FACIT-F short questionnaire, which is a shorter version of the initial FACIT-F questionnaire, was used. Each of the questions is categorically answered using the scales 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much. The figures are reversed during score calculations, so that higher score values indicate more favorable conditions. The 13 items included in the FACIT-F short can be used to calculate the brief score for FACIT-F scale (score range: 0-52). A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</title>
        <description>The PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven “component” scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The participant self-rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. Global scores range from 0 to 21 and a global sum of “5” or greater indicates a “poor” sleeper. Although there are several questions that request the evaluation of the participant’s bed mate or roommate, these are not scored. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA-WIS)</title>
        <description>The 23-item RA-WIS is a simple, validated screening tool for work instability, i.e., the consequences of a mismatch between an individual’s functional ability and their work tasks. This self-administered questionnaire covers a broad range of specific work-related issues and enables monitoring the risk of work disability in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The RA-WIS is scored by summing responses from all 23 scale items. The scale ranges from 0 to 23. Cut points have been established to differentiate levels of work instability: low &lt; 10, moderate 10-17 and high &gt; 17. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA-WIS)</title>
          <description>The 23-item RA-WIS is a simple, validated screening tool for work instability, i.e., the consequences of a mismatch between an individual’s functional ability and their work tasks. This self-administered questionnaire covers a broad range of specific work-related issues and enables monitoring the risk of work disability in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The RA-WIS is scored by summing responses from all 23 scale items. The scale ranges from 0 to 23. Cut points have been established to differentiate levels of work instability: low &lt; 10, moderate 10-17 and high &gt; 17. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
