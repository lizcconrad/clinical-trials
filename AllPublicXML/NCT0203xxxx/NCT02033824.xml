    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of dHACM in reducing scar tissue
      formation in craniectomy patients as well as facilitating reoperation and repair.
      Specifically this study compares craniectomy without dHACM application to craniectomy with
      placement of dHACM between the galea and dura over dural suture line and/or exposed
      parenchyma.
