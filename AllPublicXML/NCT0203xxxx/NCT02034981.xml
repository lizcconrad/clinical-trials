  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a biology driven, trans-tumoral, multicentric phase II trial assessing the efficacy
      and the safety of the targeted agent crizotinib as a monotherapy in 23 cohorts of patients
      with identified activating molecular alterations in the crizotinib target genes. A cohort is
      defined by a pathology and a crizotinib-target alteration (eg gastric cancer with MET
      amplification).

      For each cohort a two-stage design will be implemented. In the situation where expected
      accrual allows for a sufficient number of patients to be accrued, the alpha and beta errors
      will be fixed at 10%. However, in very rare diseases, such as inflammatory myofibroblastic
      tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), it is anticipated that
      the target number may not be achievable in a reasonable timeframe; for these cohorts, the
      alpha and beta errors will be fixed at 15%. Consequently three different statistical designs
      will be a priori considered according to the expected response rate and incidence.

      Twenty cohorts are identified, a cohort being defined as [one pathology, one target
      alteration] such as [gastric cancer with MET amplification (6%)].

      One cohort will be dedicated to miscellaneous, very rare pediatric diseases identified
      through INCa platforms or pan-genome programs (e.g. MOSKIDO, IGR) and will recruit up to 10
      patients.

      Two cohorts will be dedicated to a couple of diseases harbouring at least one specific
      alteration in one crizotinib target, same or different from those listed above, e.g. in AXL
      gene, arising from pan-genome trials.

    <description>Anti-tumor activity of crizotinib, as the primary objective of the trial, will be carried out by the determination of the objective response assessed in each cohort defined by a pathology associated with a crizotinib target alteration.
The objective response is defined as either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.
The objective response after 2 cycles (8 weeks) will be reported to define a success in the 2-stage design.</description>

    <time_frame>Safety profile will be assessed during the whole treatment period (6 months expected in average) followed by a 2-year post-treatment follow-up period, and reported during the visits scheduled by the study flow chart</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be assessed by clinical and paraclinical examinations at every scheduled visit during the whole treatment period and the post-treatment follow-up period (around 2.5 years) This study will use the International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, for adverse event reporting.</description>
