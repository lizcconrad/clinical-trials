      Study design Investigators aim to perform a prospective, single-center,
      investigator-initiated, randomized study to compare the Adenosine-induced coronary
      vasodilatation after the loading dose of Ticagrelor either Prasugrel during the Percutaneous
      Coronary Intervention. Patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention will be enrolled in the study and will be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive
      a loading dose of Ticagrelor (180 mg) or Prasugrel (60 mg). In patients with non-ST elevation
      myocardial infarction these drugs will be administered only when the coronary anatomy will be
      known, to avoid bleeding due to prasugrel, in patients suitable for coronary artery bypass
      grafting as recommended by European Society of Cardiology guidelines (Class IB) (10). In
      patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, instead, prasugrel and ticagrelor will be
      administrated before the procedure, according to the European Society of Cardiology
      guidelines (Class IB) (11). Coronary Flow Reserve will be recorded by intracoronary Doppler
      Flow Wire before the stent implantation and after the procedure at baseline and 2-minute
      later adenosine intravenous administration at incremental doses of 50, 80, 110 and 140
      ug/Kg/min with 2 minutes interval between infusions.

      Coronary Flow Reserve is the ability of the myocardium to increase blood flow in response to
      maximal exercise. Doppler Flow Wire allows to measure this increase expressing it as a ratio
      between maximal vasodilation and flow at rest. Coronary Flow Reserve is routinely measured in
      patients with acute coronary syndrome, without an increased risk of adverse events for
      patients neither adjunctive costs for the National Health System.

      Furthermore, Plasma concentrations of Ticagrelor and its main metabolite (AR-C124910XX) will
      be measured in venous blood collected at the end of the procedure. . In patients requiring a
      second Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, for example for multivessel disease, all these
      measures will be repeated in the same manner.
