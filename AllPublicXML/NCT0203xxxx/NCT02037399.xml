  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Besides major ESD-related complications, minor adverse events after ESD are also commonly
      noticed. Pain is one of minor ESD-related complications. . The causes of pain associated with
      ESD or gastric polypectomy are thought to be associated with transmural burn or transmural
      air leak. How control localized pain for patients who suffered from pain after ESD is
      appearing as new medical interests. There are few studies about management strategy for pain
      after ESD. Glucocorticoids are used to reduce inflammation and tissue damage in various
      clinical settings including inflammatory disease, rheumatic disease, and so on. The efficacy
      of glucocorticoids for reducing pain after surgery has recently been investigated.
      Glucocorticoids are thought to locally inhibit collagen deposition and fibrosis and finally
      reduce scar-tissue formation. Especially systemic steroids are easy to achieve a continuous
      effect through stable serum concentrations. If pain was partially associated with acute
      inflammation, we assumed intravenous dexamethasone could be helpful to relieve pain after ESD
      based on previous studies. we aimed to assess the efficacy of single dose postoperative
      intravenous dexamethasone for pain relief after ESD.

    <description>The primary outcomes of this study was present pain intensity (PPI) measured at 6 hours after ESD. The reason for adopting 6- hour PPI as primary endpoint was due to maximized pain at 6 hours after ESD in our pilot study.</description>

    <description>Patients were enrolled in outpatient settings after evaluating appropriate ESD indications. A single study coordinator performed a randomization process by using a table of random numbers. The patients were allocated to receive intravenous dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) immediately after ESD. The patients with an odd number were assigned into DEXA group, and the patients with an even number were assigned into placebo group. The syringe including dexamethasone was completely covered with a paper sticker to mask treatment assignment. The operator and assisting nurse were also blinded to the study.
At the day and next day of ESD, intravenous proton pump inhibitor was routinely administered to prevent complications including bleeding. At 3rd day of ESD, all patients started to take 40mg oral lansoprazole once a day and sucralfate suspension 3 times a day for 28 days.</description>
