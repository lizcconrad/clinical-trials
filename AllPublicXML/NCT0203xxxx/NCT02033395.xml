  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study follows subjects who have been exposed to a traumatic event and are
      at risk of developing PTSD symptoms. Participants are recruited within six hours of a
      traumatic event, and, starting from the recruitment session, are then examined on six set
      points of time within a period of thirteen months. The examinations include both biological
      studies of cortisol in hair, blood and saliva, and psychological examinations and
      questionaires that assess the development and severity of PTSD symptoms.

      The novel method of sampling hair cortisol allows investigators to retroactively estimate the
      mean levels of blood cortisol during the tree months prior to the sampling.

      The study aims at further illuminating the correlation between cortisol levels both prior and
      following a traumatic event, and the development and severity of PTSD symptoms
