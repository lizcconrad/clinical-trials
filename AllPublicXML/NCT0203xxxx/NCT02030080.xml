  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Employers are increasingly looking for opportunities to motivate sedentary employees to
      become more physically active. Workplace walking programs have had mixed success and
      typically show most improvement among participants that are already fairly active at a
      baseline. The goal of this study is to determine whether a financial incentive program can
      motivate sedentary employees to increase the number of steps they walk per day to meet a
      minimum threshold.

      The primary outcome measure is the proportion of days a minimum activity of 7000 steps or
      more is achieved. Outcomes will be assessed each week for 3 months using incentives followed
      by 3 months of follow-up without incentives. Secondary outcomes will include the average
      steps walked per day.

They will also be told the average for the 50th percentile in their arm. If their team's average daily step count is ≥ 7000 steps, they'll be eligible to collect winnings from a weekly lottery. Teams whose average daily step count is less than 7000 will receive messages about how much they would have won had the team met its goal.
