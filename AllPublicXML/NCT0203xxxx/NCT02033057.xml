  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even 20-50% of patients under sedation and mechanical ventilation develops myopathy and / or
      neuropathy which difficulties both the process of extubation and the functional recovery. The
      objective of this project is to analyze the effect of muscle electrostimulation (ESM) on
      muscle weakness acquired in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and its consequences. Study design: a
      single center, prospective, randomized trial to be held in the ICU of &quot; Universitarian
      hospital La Fe&quot; in collaboration with the service of Neurophysiology of the hospital. All
      patients undergoing sedation and mechanical ventilation (with an expected duration longer
      than 48h) and without any of the exclusion criteria detailed in the Methodology section will
      be included in the study. The intervention will consist of a muscular electrostimulation with
      the Super Pro Excel 70,UltratoneTM. The stimulation will be performed in 10 muscle groups (5
      per side) following established protocols, at least 5 days a week. We will evaluate muscle
      strength by Medical Research Council scale, functional capacity by Barthel scale and
      Neurophaty Disability Scale, all clinical events will be collected and electrophysiologic,
      echographic and histologic parameters will be measured. The process of extubation will be
      performed following an established protocol, the duration will be collected as the same
      manner as ICU.
