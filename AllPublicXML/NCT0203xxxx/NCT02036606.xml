    <textblock>
      Racing thoughts relate to subjective acceleration of thinking which has been essentially
      associated with manic episodes in bipolar disorder. Qualitatively, the phenomenology of
      racing thoughts in major depression seems to differ from rumination and pure manic racing
      thoughts: thoughts of all kinds accumulate in the patient's head. Recent qualitative evidence
      is consistent with the existence of these two kinds of &quot;thought overactivity&quot; related to mood
      disorders. In order to evaluate this and better understand the psychopathological and
      cognitive mechanisms that underlie thought overactivity in mood disorders, we have created a
      34-item self-questionnaire - the Racing and Crowded Thoughts Questionnaire (RCTQ) and a
      number of neuropsychological tasks (time perception, cognitive flexibility). Also, given the
      relationship between mood disorders and creativity, it is likely that thought overactivity is
      related to increased creativity. We aim at evaluating this relationship through the French
      version of the Cognitive Processes Associated with Creativity scale (CPAC).
