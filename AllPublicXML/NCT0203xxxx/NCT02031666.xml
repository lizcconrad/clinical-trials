  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the
      medication) and relative bioavailability (the extent to which a medication or other substance
      becomes available to the body) of JNJ-56021927 when administered as 7 test tablet
      formulations of JNJ-56021927 compared with the softgel capsule formulation of JNJ-56021927 in
      healthy male participants under fasted conditions at a single dose of 240 mg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), single-center, 8-treatment, parallel-group (each
      group of participants will be treated at the same time) study. Approximately 120 participants
      (15 participants in each treatment group) will participate in this study. All participants
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of 8 possible treatments (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H). The
      study will consist of a screening phase (within 21 days before the first administration of
      the study medication), a treatment phase with 8 parallel single-dose treatments (8 days); a
      follow up phase (42 days) and an end-of-study or early withdrawal assessments (Day 57).
      Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      vital signs, and physical examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The
      duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be approximately 78
      days.
