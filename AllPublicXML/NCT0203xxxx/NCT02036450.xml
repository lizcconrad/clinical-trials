      The LOOP study aims to clarify whether stroke and peripheral emboli can be prevented by
      monitoring the heart rhythm with a small device (called a loop recorder). The recorder which
      is placed under the skin on the front of the chest wall allows monitoring of the heart rhythm
      24-hours a day 7 days a week.

      The study has 6,000 participants with risk factors for stroke (age &gt;70 years, and at least
      one of the diseases: diabetes, hypertension, heart failure or previous stroke) but without a
      history of atrial fibrillation, of which 1,500 will have a loop recorder implanted and 4,500
      will be included in a control group. Participants are randomised to receive a loop recorder
      or not (control).

      If a participant has atrial fibrillation of more than 6 min duration the study participant
      will start oral anticoagulation therapy according to local guidelines.

      Background:

      Stroke is a major health problem, which affects approximately 16,000 people annually in
      Denmark, causing severe and burdensome consequences for its victims, who suffer a significant
      loss in quality of life (QOL), and their families. Stroke is often caused by atrial
      fibrillation (AF), which is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia. Effective management
      of AF with anticoagulation therapy is available and may have considerable benefits for
      patients as well as society. Difficult to detect, however, asymptomatic AF is usually only
      diagnosed by chance. Recently developed technology (implantable loop recorder; ILR) allows
      continuous long-term electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring and may constitute a substantial
      improvement in AF diagnosis.

      Primary objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine, whether patients with increased risk of
      stroke have a high occurrence of AF without symptoms when studied by continuous ECG
      monitoring using an ILR and whether the risk of stroke and peripheral emboli can be reduced
      by initiating anticoagulation therapy according to pre-specified local study guidelines;

      Secondary objectives:

      a) Whether analysis of ECG intervals obtained from a single ECG lead (from the ILR ) and from
      conventional ECG can predict future development of AF; and b) Whether the use of an expensive
      monitor technology - such as an ILR - for the diagnosis of AF will be cost effective in a
      health economics analysis due to a reduction in the number of strokes.

      Study design:

      Randomised, un-blinded, controlled parallel two group trial.

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: Time to stroke or systemic embolism.

      Secondary:

        -  Composite endpoint of time to stroke or systemic embolic episode or death

        -  Death due to any reason

        -  Death due to cardiovascular reasons

        -  Acute hospitalization due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, unstable angina

        -  Major bleeding complications (according to the International Society on Thrombosis and
           Haemostasis criteria)

        -  Cerebral haemorrhage

        -  Transitory ischemic attack

        -  Time to one or more of; atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular or supraventricular
           tachycardias (≥16 beats at ≥158 beats per minute), asystole (≥3 s), bradycardia (≥4
           beats at ≤30 beats per minute), pacemaker implantation, percutaneous coronary
           intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, transcatheter aortic valve replacement,
           transcatheter mitral valve repair, cardiac valve thoracic surgery

        -  Changes in the use of healthcare resources and costs, i.e. hospital treatment, general
           practitioner services, medical specialists, pharmaceuticals, rehabilitation, nursing
           home and QALYs

        -  QoL measurements using validated instruments (SF-36 and the Euro-Qual survey forms,
           EQ-5D)

        -  Cognitive decline evaluated by Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) tests

        -  Chronological developments of ECG markers measured from ILR and 12-lead ECG

        -  Presence of brain infarcts and white matter hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging
           (MRI) and association with AF and future strokes

        -  Cardiac chamber dimensions and function and fibrosis in chamber walls as assessed by MRI
           with gadolinium contrast and association with AF and future strokes

        -  Echocardiographic prediction of AF and stroke

        -  Cardiac hormones and serologic risk markers and prediction of AF and stroke

        -  Genetic prediction of AF and stroke

        -  Safety aspects of device implants

      Sample size:

      In total 6,000 subjects will participate and will be randomised in a 1:3 ratio: 1,500
      randomised to receive an implantable loop recorder (ILR group) and 4,500 randomised to
      receive standard care (control group).

      Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:

      Subjects will be 70 years of age or older and will have at least one of the following
      diseases: hypertension, diabetes, heart failure or previous stroke (and biologically a
      candidate for OAC).

      ILR group:

      Patients randomised to the ILR group will receive the monitoring device and if AF is detected
      anticoagulation therapy will be given according to study guidelines.

      Control group:

      Patients will be treated according to standard care.

      Study Duration:

      The study comprises a screening period of up to 12-36 months followed by at treatment phase
      of a minimum of 36 months. The total study duration will therefore be approximately 6 years.

      Screening and Randomisation:

      Treatment: After randomisation patients allocated to the ILR group should receive the
      implantation as fast as possible, and preferably within 4 weeks.

      Statistical Considerations:

      Regarding AF prevalence in the study population, we expect that 30% of the participants will
      have documented AF episodes qualifying for OAC during ILR monitoring for at least three
      years. This is comparable with ASSERT, where 35% had at least one episode lasting ≥6 minutes
      during a median follow-up of 2.5 years. The study population is expected to have a stroke
      rate of 0.7%/year in non-AF patients, and 2%/year in AF patients not treated with OAC. While
      we expect the number of AF-related strokes to be reduced by OAC (odds ratio 0.29), we
      presuppose that strokes unrelated to AF will not be influenced by this. We also include in
      our calculations the assumption that 3% of all participants in the control group will become
      diagnosed with AF and start OAC. The annual rate of the primary end point in the control
      group is thus expected to be 1%. Finally, we expect that 5% in the ILR group will not be
      monitored due to refusal of ILR implantation or ILR explantation due to discomfort. These
      patients will participate at the same risk as patients in the control group and will be
      included in the analysis of the primary endpoint according to the intention-to-treat
      principle.

      We thus expect the overall hazard ratio to be 0.65. To analyse this reduction in the primary
      endpoint with a 2-sided α-level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, we will need 279 primary events.
      Follow-up duration will be adjusted to accommodate the number of primary events.

      Primary Endpoint Analysis:

      The principal analysis for the primary endpoint (time to one of the events in the combined
      endpoint) will employ the intent-to-threat principle and use a survival analysis. For each
      randomised group, Kaplan-Meier curves will be estimated, graphically displayed and compared
      using a logrank test. A co-variate adjusted analysis of the combined primary endpoint using a
      Cox proportional regression model will be performed as a supportive analysis. The hazard
      ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated. Subjects completing
      the study and not reaching the composite endpoint will be censored.

      Secondary Endpoint Analysis:

      All time-to-event secondary endpoints will be analysed similarly to the primary endpoint.

      Event Committee:

      An event adjudication committee will classify endpoint events throughout the study.

      Funding:

      Research grants have been obtained from the Danish National Foundation for Strategic Research
      (DKK 15.6 mio), the Research Foundation for the Capital Region of Denmark (DKK 2.0 mio) and
      the Danish Heart Foundation (DKK 150.000). Medtronic (manufacturer of the ILRs will donate an
      unrestricted research grant to the study covering costs related to 900 ILRs (which has a
      value of DKK 5.4 mio (reduced price) or DKK 22.5 mio (ordinary list price)) and a grant to
      cover salary for research nurses at the hospitals (DKK 1.9 mio).

      Additional research grants will be applied for from private and public research foundations
      as well as from industry.
