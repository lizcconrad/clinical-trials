      To determine if autologous human umbilical cord blood infusion in children with acquired
      hearing loss is safe, feasible, improves inner ear function, audition and language

    <textblock>
      There is currently no treatment available to repair/reverse acquired sensorineural hearing
      loss. Recent experiments using human umbilical cord blood treatment of a mouse and guinea pig
      models have demonstrated hair cell re-growth following acquired sensorineural loss as well as
      partial restoration of ABR. Autologous human umbilical cord blood therapy, which has been
      used for over twenty years, has an excellent safety record. This study will determine if
      autologous human umbilical cord blood infusion in children with hearing loss is safe and
      feasible, improves inner ear function, audition, and language development. The patients
      umbilical cord stem cells collected at birth and stored at Cord Blood Registry will be used
      for infusion.

    <description>To determine if autologous human umbilical cord blood (hUBC) infusion in children with hearing loss is safe and feasible. Infusion related toxicity as measured by:
i. hemodynamic instability: An adverse event will be defined as a sustained (&gt; 10 minutes) &gt;20% decrease in MAP.
ii. acute lung injury: Chest X-ray will be done at baseline and at 1 day post infusion to assess for polymorphonuclear infiltrates iii. hepatic injury/toxicity: Hepatic panel will be performed at baseline and 1 day post infusion. Injury is defined as acute elevation of the AST/ALT hepatic enzymes &gt; 900 U/dl in the first 24 hours post infusion iv. renal injury/insufficiency: CMP will be performed at baseline and 1 day after infusion v. exacerbation of neurological status: defined as a change in Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary size/reactivity, motor/sensory evaluation of extremities, and seizure activity from infusion to discharge.</description>
