      You have been asked to consider participating in the study because you have a cancer of the
      prostate, which is to be treated with external beam radiation. You have chosen or felt not to
      be a good candidate for just watching your cancer. As your doctor has informed you, this
      involves delivering small amounts of radiation daily over several weeks. Normally, a small
      field directed to the prostate gland is given for 7.5 - 8 weeks. In total, 39 days of
      radiation are delivered. There is now growing evidence that prostate cancer cells may be
      killed more effectively if higher doses of radiation are delivered everyday (known as
      hypofractionation). However, the downside to such a strategy is the potential to cause more
      side effects because normal organs (such as the rectum and bladder) are also exposed to the
      higher doses. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a high-precision technique which
      has the ability to deliver radiation in a more focused manor, meaning that the radiation dose
      can be &quot;sculpted&quot; to the prostate gland, while minimizing the amount of radiation to the
      bladder and rectum.

      A certain amount of movement of the prostate normally occurs within the body. To make sure
      that the prostate will not be missed, a margin of tissue around the prostate also needs to be
      treated. Although a wide margin will ensure that the prostate is included, it will also cause
      more normal tissue to receive high doses of radiation. This, in turn, would result in more
      side effects. To reduce the margin needed around the prostate, and side effects, tiny gold
      seeds measuring 3.0 x 1.2mm will be inserted into the prostate which can be seen using a
      special type of X-Ray camera called a portal imager during treatment. This will allow for
      targeting of the prostate gland more precisely so that a significantly smaller margin of
      normal tissue will need to be treated. By using gold seeds in conjunction with SABR, there is
      the potential to safely deliver a more intensive dose of radiation to the prostate gland
      without increasing the amount of side effects.

      In other studies where shorter and more intense courses of radiation have been given using
      similar high-precision techniques, the side effects of treatment have indeed been no worse
      than the usual techniques. Over the last 7 years, Sunnybrook researchers have treated over
      three hundred prostate cancer patients on various research protocols with SABR. In those
      protocols, patients received 5 SBRT treatments over 29 days and this is currently being
      compared to 5 SBRT treatments over 11 days in an ongoing randomized study. In the United
      States, several groups have investigated the 5 SBRT approach in 11 days or less and early
      findings suggest a good tolerance.

      The study is being done to determine the side effects, quality of life and efficacy of
      2-fraction adaptive SBRT technique (2STAR) in the treatment of low and intermediate risk
      prostate cancer. All participants will receive the same dose and fractionation scheme.
