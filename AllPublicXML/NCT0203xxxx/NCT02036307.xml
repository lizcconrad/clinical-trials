  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial of two marketed fish oil supplements, one with a high EPA:DHA ratio and the
      other with a high DHA:EPA ratio, to examine differential effects on platelet function, blood
      pressure, and fasting triglyceride levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies have shown that fish consumption is associated with a lower risk of
      cardiovascular disease, and clinical trials have demonstrated that fish oil nutritional
      supplementation is associated with improvement in cardiometabolic risk factor profiles
      including fasting triglycerides and blood pressure. However, the mechanisms of action of fish
      oils are not well understood. Specifically, the effects of different compositions in terms of
      the ratio of the fatty acids EPA and DHA are not known. We are proposing a pilot and
      feasibility study of fish oil nutritional supplementation in 40 healthy adult participants
      with two different commercially available fish oil (high EPA/DHA ratio, high DHA/EPA ratio,
      sample of 20 per group) with the hypothesis that 4 weeks of supplementation with fish oil
      results in differential changes in platelet function, blood pressure and fasting triglyceride
      levels . We will also bank blood and urine for future mechanistic studies. This pilot study
      will allow us to collect preliminary data for definitive mechanistic studies of the effects
      of fish oil supplementation and to demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol.
