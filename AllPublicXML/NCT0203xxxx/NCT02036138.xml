  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growing incidence of obesity and type2 DM globally is widely recognized as one of the
      most challenging contemporary threats to public health. Uncontrolled diabetes leads to
      macrovascular and microvascular complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke,
      blindness, neuropathy, and renal failure in many patients. The current goal of medical
      treatment is to halt disease progression by reducing hyperglycemia, hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Despite improvements in pharmacotherapy,
      fewer than 50% of patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 diabetes actually achieve and
      maintain therapeutic thresholds, particularly for glycemic control. Observational studies
      have suggested that bariatric or metabolic surgery can rapidly improve glycemic control and
      cardiovascular risk factors in severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes Few randomized,
      controlled trials have compared bariatric surgery with intensive medical therapy,
      particularly in moderately obese patients (defined as those having a BMI of 30 to 34.9) with
      type2 DM. Accordingly, many unanswered questions remain regarding the relative efficacy of
      bariatric surgery in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. This randomized, controlled,
      prospective multicenter study was designed to compare intensive medical therapy with surgical
      treatment (LRYGB or LSG) as a means of improving glycemic control in moderately obese
      patients (BMI 30-34.9) with type- 2 DM.
