      This is a single center, single arm, open-label phase II study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of a single infusion of autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors
      expressing tandem TCR and 4-1BB (TCR/4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as CART-19
      cells) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
      Inclusion criteria are designed to include adult patients aged greater than 18 with B cell
      ALL, relapsed or refractory, with no available curative treatment options (such as autologous
      or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) who have limited prognosis (greater than 12 weeks
      survival expectancy) with currently available therapies. The study product is CART-19 cells
      transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv TCR:41BB administered by a
      single i.v. infusion of 1 to 5 x 108 transduced CAR T cells.
