    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Global Assessment of Acne Severity (GAAS) Score by Physician</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator evaluated the participant's acne severity using the 5-point GAAS grading scale: 0= No evidence of facial acne vulgaris to 4= Significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules were a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions could have been present; comedones (small pumps on the skin caused by acne) could have been present. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Lesion Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator evaluated Inflammatory (papule, pustule and nodule/cyst) and Non-inflammatory (blackhead and whitehead) lesions. A papule is a small, red, solid elevation less than 1.0 cm in diameter, a pustule is a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin that contains yellow-white exudate and a nodule/cyst is a circumscribed, elevated, solid lesion generally more than 0.5 cm in diameter with palpable depth. The total lesion count was the sum of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A negative percent change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 0 (None) or 1 (Minimal) on the GAAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator evaluated the participant's acne severity using the 5-point GAAS grading scale: 0= No evidence of facial acne vulgaris to 4= Significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules were a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions could have been present; comedones (small pumps on the skin caused by acne) could have been present. The percentage of participants with a score of 0=none or 1=minimal is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acne Symptom and Impact Scale (ASIS) Sign Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed signs of acne vulgaris using the ASIS. The sign domain is a composite of 9 items of the 17 items on the overall scale. Each of the items is answered on a 5-point scale: 0 (best) to 4 (worst). The sign domain score is calculated as the average of the 9 items for a total possible score of 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate the presence of more severe signs of acne.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ASIS Impact Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed the impact of acne vulgaris using the ASIS. The impact domain is a composite of 8 items assessing the psychosocial impacts (6 items emotional and 2 items social) of the 17 items on the overall scale. Each of the items is answered on a 5-point scale: 0 (best) to 4 (worst). The impact domain score is calculated as the average of the 8 items for a total possible score of 0 to 4. Higher scores on the ASIS Impact Domain indicate greater negative impact of acne on health-related quality of life and appearance.</description>

        <description>The investigator evaluated Inflammatory (papule, pustule and nodule/cyst) and Non-inflammatory (blackhead and whitehead) lesions. A papule is a small, red, solid elevation less than 1.0 cm in diameter, a pustule is a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin that contains yellow-white exudate and a nodule/cyst is a circumscribed, elevated, solid lesion generally more than 0.5 cm in diameter with palpable depth. The total lesion count was the sum of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A negative percent change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>

        <title>ASIS Impact Domain Score</title>
        <description>The participant assessed the impact of acne vulgaris using the ASIS. The impact domain is a composite of 8 items assessing the psychosocial impacts (6 items emotional and 2 items social) of the 17 items on the overall scale. Each of the items is answered on a 5-point scale: 0 (best) to 4 (worst). The impact domain score is calculated as the average of the 8 items for a total possible score of 0 to 4. Higher scores on the ASIS Impact Domain indicate greater negative impact of acne on health-related quality of life and appearance.</description>
