  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes are common blood disorders that can affect as many as one in 1000
      Canadians over the age of 65. They are characterized by low blood counts that require
      frequent blood transfusions. The development of iron overload in these patients is
      inevitable. The iron deposits in vital organs such as the heart and the liver and can lead to
      organ dysfunction. Deferasirox is a well-studied drug that helps remove iron from the body.
      Most people with this disorder die due to progression of their disease to acute leukemia
      through multiple mechanisms. Iron overload in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes has
      been shown to be associated with shorter survival, and potentially a higher chance of
      leukemia. In a certain sub-group of higher risk patients, the drug azacitidine has been shown
      to decrease the chance of progression to leukemia and death from it. Thus, it is presently
      the standard of care for these patients. However, 50% of higher risk patients are still
      unresponsive to this medication, leaving a large group of patients for which other treatment
      options are emergently needed. Given that a large proportion of higher risk MDS patients fail
      to respond to azacitidine, and the evidence that iron deposition may lead to increased
      leukemic transformation, we would like to study whether iron removal from the body with
      deferasirox potentiates azacitidine in its effects on overall survival, as well as the chance
      of leukemia transformation. This question needs to be addressed in a randomized controlled
      trial, and the first step is a preliminary study to determine if the combination of
      azacitidine and deferasirox has any biologic effect. This study will determine whether this
      combination leads to blood count improvement over azacitidine alone. If this drug combination
      ultimately proves more useful than azacitidine alone with respect to survival, this has the
      potential to impact the care of a large proportion of patients with myelodysplastic
      syndromes.

      Patients with stable disease after 6 cycles of AZA with higher risk MDS will be randomized to
      either standard of care (continued AZA until progression ) or AZA + defasirox. Primary
      endpoint is augmented response rate by the addition of deferasirox
