      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial of a peer-based, social media intervention to
      prevent obesity in infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This novel intervention, delivered to mothers primarily through private Facebook groups, will
      promote behavior change through peer and self-modeling photo/video activities.

      In this study, investigators will implement the intervention with small peer groups of 6-12
      mothers, beginning during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Investigators will assess
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and explore its impact on outcomes,
      particularly behaviors associated with healthy growth.
