        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histological confirmed malignancy and presence of intraparenchymal
             brain metastases

          -  Patients are treated by WBRT, SRS, or FSRT

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  A life expectancy of greater than or equal to 8 weeks

          -  Karnofsky performance status (an assessment of general well being and ability to do
             activities of daily living; scale ranges from 0 to 100 where 100 is perfect health)
             greater than or equal to 60

          -  Informed consent with signed study-specific informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major medical or psychiatric illness, which, in the investigator's opinion, will
             prevent completion of the protocol

          -  Patients with lepto-meningeal metastases documented by Magnetic Resonance Imagine
             (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), or Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) evaluation

          -  For patients that will undergo Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT), previous WBRT is
             not allowed. Patients who have had brain metastases managed by Stereotactic
             Radiosurgery (SRS), Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (FSRT), or surgery are
             eligible

          -  For patients that will undergo Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), previous Whole Brain
             Radiation Therapy (WBRT) within 5 months prior to study entry is not allowed. Prior
             Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (FSRT),
             or surgery is allowed if current treatment will be for a lesion(s) not previously
             treated.

          -  For patients that will undergo Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (FSRT),
             previous Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) within 5 months prior to study entry is
             not allowed. Prior Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), Fractionated Stereotactic
             Radiation Therapy (FSRT), or surgery is allowed if current treatment will be for a
             lesion(s) not previously treated.

          -  Patients unable to undergo or tolerate MRI scans (presence of cardiac pacemaker,
             implanted cardiac defibrillator, aneurysm clips, etc).

          -  Patients should have no contraindications to having a contrast enhanced Magnetic
             Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. These contraindications will be assessed at the time of
             enrollment using the guidelines set up and in clinical use by the University of
             Michigan.

          -  Women who are pregnant are excluded.
