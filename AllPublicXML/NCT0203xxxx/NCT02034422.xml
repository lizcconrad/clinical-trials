  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects 37% of the Veteran population, making it the most common medical
      condition treated by the VA Health Care System. Physical activity is the first line of
      defense in the treatment and management of hypertension. However, individuals with
      hypertension have impaired muscle blood flow and exhibit exaggerated increases in blood
      pressure during exercise (exercise pressor reflex or EPR) leading to exercise intolerance and
      increased risk of stroke and heart attack. The cause of these impairments is not known, but
      it is highly likely that free radical production and the subsequent increase in oxidative
      stress plays a significant role. Two aims are proposed; Aim 1 will identify the physiological
      consequences of elevated oxidative stress in hypertension, and Aim 2 will utilize an
      antioxidant treatment to ameliorate the effects of an exaggerated EPR allowing the safe
      performance of a clinical exercise rehabilitation program which will then, itself, attenuate
      the EPR and reduce hypertension.

    <textblock>
      Nearly 37% of all Veterans are clinically hypertensive, making hypertension the most common
      medical condition in the VA Health Care System. Importantly, of the 67 million Americans
      diagnosed with hypertension less than half are being effectively treated for their condition.
      Hypertension constitutes a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and when left
      untreated leads to the development of heart failure, coronary heart disease, peripheral
      artery disease, stroke, and renal disease. Exercise and regular physical activity are
      considered the cornerstones of prevention and management of hypertension. However,
      individuals with hypertension exhibit exercise intolerance characterized by impaired skeletal
      muscle blood flow and heightened afferent fiber sensitivity leading to an exaggerated or
      greater than normal physiologic increase in blood pressure during exercise (i.e. exercise
      pressor reflex or EPR). This imbalance between the beneficial effects of exercise and
      exercise intolerance creates an interesting paradox, the causes and consequences of which are
      poorly understood. The etiology of hypertension is undoubtedly complex, however a common
      denominator in this condition, elevated oxidative stress, may contribute to impaired muscle
      blood flow and heightened skeletal muscle afferent feedback leading to the exaggerated EPR.
      Previous work from the investigators' laboratory and others suggests that elevated oxidative
      stress associated with aging impairs muscle blood flow. Additionally, free radicals, the
      initiators of oxidative stress, can directly stimulate skeletal muscle afferent fibers
      leading to the exaggerated EPR. Importantly, the role of oxidative stress in regulating
      muscle blood flow and afferent fiber function in human hypertension has not been determined.
      Preliminary studies support a significant role of oxidative stress in impairing muscle blood
      flow and contributing to the exaggerated EPR in hypertension. With this information as
      context two aims are proposed that will systematically identify the consequences of elevated
      oxidative stress in hypertension. Specific Aim 1 will determine the consequences of oxidative
      stress by examining how elevated free radicals contribute to heightened skeletal muscle
      afferent feedback and impaired muscle blood flow during exercise in hypertension leading to
      the exaggerated EPR. Additionally, vascular endothelial cells collected from an antecubital
      vein will provide novel insight regarding the endothelium as potential source of elevated
      oxidative stress in hypertension. Specific Aim 2 will determine the effectiveness of combined
      antioxidant therapy and exercise rehabilitation in the treatment of hypertension. The overall
      goal of this proposal is to provide novel information regarding the role of oxidative stress
      as a critical regulator of cardiovascular and hemodynamic responses to exercise in
      hypertension. By identifying potential causes and consequences of oxidative stress, important
      insight will be gained facilitating the development of novel approaches and therapeutic
      strategies for the treatment of hypertension. Importantly, the practical applications tested
      in these studies (i.e. antioxidant treatment and combined exercise rehabilitation) are
      designed to identify and document effective countermeasures to aid in the treatment and
      management of hypertension allowing for the safe performance of exercise in a large number of
      Veterans.

    <description>Specific Aim 1: Determine the consequences of oxidative stress on skeletal muscle afferent feedback and muscle blood flow during exercise in hypertension. Hypothesis: Afferent feedback sensitivity, determined by passive leg movement (isolation of mechanoreceptor sensitivity) and post exercise circulatory occlusion (isolation of metaboreceptor sensitivity) will be greater in hypertension leading to the exaggerated EPR. Muscle blood flow, assessed by Doppler ultrasound during multiple exercise intensities, will be impaired in hypertension leading to exercise intolerance. Reductions in oxidative stress, achieved by an oral antioxidant treatment (Vitamins C, E and alpha lipoic acid), will reduce afferent fiber sensitivity and improve muscle blood flow in hypertension. Additionally, venous endothelial cells will express elevated markers of oxidative stress providing novel evidence that the vascular endothelium contributes to the greater oxidative stress in hypertension.</description>

Hypothesis: Acute antioxidant treatment administered prior to exercise in hypertensive patients will ameliorate the exaggerated EPR resulting in a normal and safe blood pressure response to exercise-based rehabilitation. This two-pronged approach (antioxidants and exercise training) will result in a safely achieved reduction in skeletal muscle afferent feedback facilitating improved exercise tolerance, improved muscle blood flow and ultimately reduced cardiovascular risk in this population.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A total of 72 middle-aged (40 - 60 years of age) healthy and hypertensive men and
             women will participate in these protocols after providing written informed consent.

          -  The investigators aim to include a 1 to 1 ratio of females and males in each group.

          -  Individuals diagnosed or presenting with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension (range
             140/90 to 179/109 mmHg, according to the seventh report of the Joint National
             Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High BP) may be
             eligible for this study.

          -  Blood pressure status will be assessed in triplicate in the laboratory during the
             medical exam and during a 24 hour period using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

               -  Both methods must confer hypertension for study enrollment.

          -  Other than hypertension, all hypertensive patients will be otherwise healthy and free
             of overt disease as assessed by:

               -  medical history;

               -  standard blood chemistries (chem. 7 panel),

               -  ECG at rest;

               -  limb vascular examination (ankle-brachial BP index &gt; 0.9);

               -  resting BP &gt; 140/90 mmHg; and

               -  skinfold % body fat assessment.

          -  Subjects will have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 and have plasma glucose
             concentrations &lt; 7.0 mmol/L under fasting conditions and &lt; 11.1 mmol/L at 120 minutes
             of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as defined by the American Diabetes
             Association.

          -  To reduce heterogeneity of the hypertensive subjects while maintaining a &quot;real world&quot;
             approach the following classes of drugs will be allowed;

               -  diuretics,

               -  angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,

               -  and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

          -  Healthy normotensive subjects will be matched to their hypertensive counterparts and
             will be free from overt cardiovascular disease according to the criteria described
             above.

        Inclusion/Exclusion criteria with specific reference to the exaggerated exercise pressor
        reflex:

          -  Hypertensive subjects must exhibit a 10 mmHg or greater increase in MAP at 25% of
             their workrate maximum during knee extension exercise to be included in this study.

          -  Established criteria defining a cut off for an &quot;exaggerated&quot; exercise pressor reflex
             does not exist.

          -  Therefore, the investigators have set the operational definition at a 10 mmHg or
             greater increase in MAP during 25% of workrate maximum knee extensor exercise.

          -  This 10 mmHg increase in MAP was chosen as this value closely matches the
             investigators' preliminary data (Figure 1) and previous reports while concomitantly
             corresponding to an increase in BP that is at least 2 standard deviations greater than
             the normotensive response (i.e. 6 2 (SD) mmHg increase in MAP at 25% of their workrate
             maximum).

          -  The magnitude of the exercise-induced increase in MAP will be determined during
             preliminary testing.

          -  It should be noted that the magnitude of the pressor response is graded in relation to
             exercise intensity, therefore, by establishing an inclusion criterion of 10 mmHg at
             25% of workrate maximum, the lowest intensity to be used in the proposed studies, the
             investigators have set a conservative standard for study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Candidates demonstrating dyslipidemia based on the National Cholesterol Education
             Program Guidelines of plasma total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl with LDL-cholesterol &gt; 160
             mg/dl will be excluded from participation.

          -  Hypertensive patients receiving dual or monotherapy treatment for hypertension may be
             included.

          -  Less frequently prescribed classes of drugs for hypertension (beta blockers,
             aldosterone receptor blocker, centrally acting sympatholytics, calcium channel
             blocker, direct vasodilators, renin inhibitors, and alpha blockers) will be excluded.

          -  Additionally, subjects reporting a history of myocardial infarction, unstable cardiac
             ischemia, recent cardiac catheterization, carotid artery disease, transient ischemic
             attack will be excluded.

          -  Participants must have no orthopedic limitations that would prohibit them from
             knee-extensor exercise or aerobic activity including cycle ergometry or treadmill
             exercise.

          -  Due to the age requirement of the subjects women may be either pre or post-menopausal.

          -  All pre-menopausal women will be studied during days 1 - 7 of their menstrual cycle to
             standardize the influence of female hormones.

          -  Women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) currently or in the preceding year will
             be excluded from the proposed studies due to the direct vascular effects of HRT and
             the variety of regimes employed.

          -  Participants will be made up of primarily Veterans.
