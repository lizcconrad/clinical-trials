    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well everolimus works in treating patients with
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors metastatic to the liver previously treated with surgery.
      Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving everolimus after surgery may kill any tumors cells that remain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the addition of adjuvant everolimus to the R0 or R1 surgical resection of
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases to the liver will result in an improvement in
      disease free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the addition of adjuvant everolimus to the R0 or R1 surgical resection of
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases to the liver will result in an improvement in
      overall survival.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity associated with adjuvant everolimus following resection in
      patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors to the liver.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
