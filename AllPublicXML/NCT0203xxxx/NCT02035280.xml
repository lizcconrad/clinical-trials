  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population continues to age, the prevalence of spinal deformity surgery for older
      patients is increasing. Questions regarding the suitability of these patients to undergo
      large spinal procedures and whether the outcomes merit the risks involved are not well known.

    <textblock>
      225 subjects greater than or equal 60 years of age with moderate and severe adult spinal
      deformity requiring surgical correction will be enrolled in a prospective multicenter
      international study. Spinal deformity will be defined as any coronal or sagittal plane spinal
      deformity in patients who have not undergone any previous spinal surgery (with the exception
      of prior decompression of a maximum of 2 levels) necessitating at a minimum a 5-level spinal
      fusion procedure. Standard radiographs and cross sectional imaging will be performed
      preoperatively, postoperatively, at 24 months and 5 years after surgery. Preoperative disease
      specific and general health questionnaires will be completed by all patients (EQ-5D, ODI,
      SRS-22r, NRS for back and leg pain). Follow up visits with questionnaires will be performed
      at 10 weeks (± 6 weeks), 12 months (± 2 months), 24 months (± 2 months) and 5 years (±6
      months) post-operatively. All treatment-related AEs will be documented.

      Regression analyses will be used to evaluate the association between patient demographics,
      comorbidities, treatment history, spinal deformity characteristics, surgical characteristics,
      treatment-related AEs and pre-surgical status to self-reported and radiographic outcomes
      after surgery.

    <measure>Absolute change in the Scoliosis Research Society-22 r (SRS-22r) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the absolute change in the SRS-22r total score between baseline and 24-months follow-up (FU) values in patients at age 60 or older treated with major spinal reconstruction.
The SRS-22r is a patient-reported outcome instrument and has a range from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). It contains 22 questions covering five domains: function, pain, self-image, mental health (each with 5 items), and satisfaction with treatment (2 items) and each item is scored from 1 to 5.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 12 months, 24 months, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure is the absolute change between baseline, the 24-month and the 5-year FU values.
The ODI is a patient-reported outcome measure used most commonly in patients with low back pain. It consists of 10 questions and each of the items can be scored from 0 (no disability) to 5 (maximal disability), leading to a maximum score of 50.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 12 months, 24 months, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure is the absolute change between baseline, the 24-month and 5-year FU values as measured by the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D).
The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument designed for self-completion to assess quality of life. It has 5 items with a three-point categorical response scale. A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions.</description>

    <description>The outcome measure is the absolute change between baseline,the 24-month and 5 year FU values.
Lower back and leg pain will be assessed on a visual analogue scale (NRS) which ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain).</description>

    <measure>Animal Fluency Test</measure>

    <description>The animal fluency test is a diagnostic tool that is recommended for use in clinical practice for quick assessment of cognitive impairment. The patient names as many animals as possible within a 60-second time period. Fifteen or fewer animals may indicate development of cognitive impairment.</description>
