  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Employers are increasingly looking for opportunities to motivate sedentary employees to
      become more physically active. Workplace walking programs have had mixed success and
      typically show most improvement among participants that are already fairly active at a
      baseline. The goal of this study is to determine whether a financial incentive program can
      motivate sedentary employees to increase the number of steps they walk per day to meet a
      minimum threshold.

      The primary outcome measure is the proportion of days a minimum activity of 7000 steps or
      more is achieved. Outcomes will be assessed each week for 3 months using incentives followed
      by 3 months of follow-up without incentives. Secondary outcomes will include the average
      steps walked per day.

          <title>Median physical activity in the past 7 d, MET-min</title>
          <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to calculate the number of metabolic equivalent minutes (MET-min) per participant in the past 7 days. MET-min is the physiologic measure of energy expenditure, with light-intensity activities having an MET&lt;3, moderate-intensity activities having an MET of 3 to 6, and more vigorous-intensity activities with an MET&gt;6.</description>
