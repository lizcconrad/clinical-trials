  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipodystrophies are part of a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by
      loss (lipoatrophies) and / or accumulation of fat, which usually results in a change of
      normal tissue surface. Millions of plastic and reconstructive surgeries are performed
      annually to repair soft tissue defects due to trauma, tumor resection and congenital defects.
      Surgical options for lipoatrophy, the lipodystrophy type characterized by subcutaneous
      adipose tissue atrophy, include: Transfer of autologous fat, Dermis - fat graft, Skin flaps
      and Commercially available fillers.

      Currently, the most commonly filler agent used for the lipodystrophy treatment is
      polymethylmethacrylate, considered permanent and with a history of short- and medium-term
      adverse effects. Biocompatible and temporary filler agents such as hyaluronic acid,
      polylactic acid and collagen have been used for over 25 years for cosmetic purposes and in
      lipoatrophies. More recently, the use of autologous fibroblasts proved to be efficient
      solving acne scars and enabling dermis regeneration. Studies in mice showed that the
      combination of pre - adipocytes with a biomaterial is much more effective in tissue
      reconstitution than the injection of adipose tissue only, providing volume and also
      stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation with increased production of extracellular
      matrix.

      This project aims a phase I clinical trial of a filler agent, composed of mesenchymal stem
      cells derived from autologous adipose tissue associated with hyaluronic acid.

      Open, controlled and randomized study. The intervention performed in this study will be the
      transdermal injection of the filler agent in patients undergoing elective cosmetic
      liposuction procedure, with legal age and without any of the exclusion criteria items.
      Patients will be evaluated according to the parameters for a total period of 12 months.

      Individuals in the control group will have transdermal injection of hyaluronic acid and will
      be evaluated with the same parameters used for the study group and also for the same period.

      In this study, 25 volunteers attended at Dermatologic Service of the Bonsucesso Federal
      Hospital (HFB) will be included.

      The research subjects will be evaluated preliminarily regarding inclusion and exclusion
      criteria of the study and the procedure will only be performed after the signing of the
      Informed Consent Form (ICF).

      The efficacy and safety study will be conducted following Good Laboratory and Clinics
      Practices.

      Patients who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatment groups: Test or Control.

      The first follow-up visit will occur in the first month post-procedure. Subsequent
      consultations will be held at 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure.

    <description>Only the patients selected for the Test Group will go through the procedure. The adipose tissue collection will occur in an elective surgery liposuction, in patients who meet the inclusion criteria, after signing the informed consent form. Thus, the material that would be disposed after surgery will be donated to the study.
The material for the study will be collected by the tumescent liposuction technique, which involves the removal of subcutaneous fat under local anesthesia.</description>
