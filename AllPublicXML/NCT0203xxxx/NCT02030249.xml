      The aim of this study is to investigate possible enduring effects of a standard 2-month
      weight loss program on appetite regulation, bone homeostasis and muscle strength in younger
      and older adults, as well as the impact of differences in dietary composition during weight
      maintenance.

      This sub-study consists of 2 parts:

      PART 1. Durability of changes in appetite and appetite-regulating hormones after weight loss
      in overweight or obese pre-diabetic adults: impact of diet during weight maintenance.

      A major reason for the failure of many lifestyle-based weight loss attempts is that the body
      responds to energy restriction and weight loss with a series of adaptive responses that
      prevent ongoing weight loss and promote weight regain (Sainsbury and Zhang 2010; Sainsbury
      and Zhang 2012). This 'famine reaction' includes increased appetite and alterations in
      circulating concentrations of gut-derived hormones that tend to stimulate appetite and
      promote fat accumulation. Recent evidence suggests that these alterations are sustained for
      as long as the lower body weight is maintained (Sumithran et al 2011). This finding - if
      validated in other populations - has enormous implications for clinical practice. For
      instance, if we know for certain that the weight loss-induced increase in appetite cannot be
      reversed without weight regain, or if we can identify those individuals for whom the increase
      in appetite does not subside, then multiple fruitless and heartbreaking efforts to lose
      excess weight via lifestyle interventions could be circumvented, and those individuals could
      immediately be channelled into more aggressive - albeit still imperfect - treatment options
      (i.e. long-term appetite-suppressing medications, bariatric surgery). If, on the other hand,
      we know that the increased appetite following weight loss does subside following a period of
      weight maintenance at the lower weight, or if we could identify those individuals for whom
      this is possible, then this information could be used to promote compliance with weight
      maintenance strategies after weight loss, with patient messages such as; &quot;Keeping weight off
      will be difficult in the beginning, but don't give up because it will likely become easier
      with time&quot;.

      A substantial body of research shows that a diet that is higher in protein
      (Westerterp-Plantenga et al 2004) and lower in glycaemic index (Brand-Miller et al 2002) than
      the diet that is conventionally recommended for health may help people to maintain a lower
      body weight post weight loss, and that this benefit may occur by reducing the drive to eat.
      These findings raise the possibility that a higher protein and lower glycaemic index weight
      maintenance diet could be used to reduce the intensity of the famine reaction in overweight
      or obese people after completion of weight loss diets, thereby improving their likelihood of
      keeping the weight off. While there is ample research showing the benefits of a higher
      protein diet for reducing appetite, enhancing weight loss and preserving lean body mass loss
      when applied during energy restricted weight loss programs, as recently reviewed (Soenen et
      al 2013), there is relatively little work to date about the emerging benefits of a higher
      protein diet applied during a weight maintenance program after weight loss. The importance of
      this Sub-Study (Part 1) is that it not only seeks to confirm a controversial new finding that
      has potentially enormous implications for the clinical management of overweight and obesity
      (Sumithran et al 2011), it also investigates the potential benefit of a higher protein and
      lower GI diet - applied during the weight maintenance phase after a standardized weight loss
      program - to prevent the apparently permanent increase in appetite that overweight and obese
      people have been reported in one study (Sumithran et al 2011) to experience in response to
      weight loss.

      Part 1 Hypothesis:

        -  Both overweight and obese individuals will demonstrate increases in appetite and
           corresponding changes in appetite-regulating hormones in response to a standardized low
           calorie diet weight loss program, and these effects will be normalized within 4-10
           months on a weight maintenance program in overweight but not in obese individuals.

        -  In both overweight and obese individuals, a higher protein and lower glycaemic index
           weight maintenance diet after a weight-reducing diet will improve normalisation of
           appetite and appetite-regulating hormones compared to a moderate protein and moderate
           glycaemic index weight maintenance diet.

      Part 1 Aim:

      â€¢ To determine fasting appetite and fasting circulating concentrations of appetite-regulating
      hormones (ghrelin and peptide YY) after a 2-month standardized low calorie diet in overweight
      and obese pre-diabetic adults, and to determine whether any effects are attenuated by 4 and
      10 months on one of two different weight maintenance programs differing in protein content
      and glycaemic index.

      PART 2. Effect of weight loss on bone homeostasis and muscle strength in younger and older
      overweight or obese pre-diabetic adults: impact of diet during weight maintenance on
      long-term durability of effects.

      While it is generally recognised that losing excess weight helps to prevent disease
      development in younger adults, there is some controversy as to whether weight loss programs
      are indicated for the management of overweight or obesity in older adults, and if so, at what
      body mass index such programs should be implemented (Chapman 2008). It is noteworthy that
      weight loss via voluntary or involuntary means in older adults is linked to reduced function,
      reduced quality of life and increased mortality (Chapman 2008). The reason for this
      relationship is not clear, but one possibility is that weight loss programs can lead to
      significant loss of bone and lean tissues under certain circumstances (e.g. inadequate
      dietary protein, inadequate exercise), and it is unknown if these losses are recuperated.
      Given that reductions in bone density and lean body mass are risk factors for fractures and
      falls in older adults, changes in body composition in response to weight loss efforts in
      older adults could inadvertently produce negative effects. In light of the established role
      of dietary protein in the maintenance of lean tissues such as bone and muscle in older people
      or in response to weight loss (Westerterp-Plantenga et al 2012), the PREVIEW trial offers an
      invaluable opportunity to investigate the effects of a standardised weight loss program on
      bone homeostasis and muscle function (strength) in younger and older adults, as well as the
      impact of differences in diet during weight maintenance in attenuating any such effects.

      Part 2 Hypothesis:

        -  That a 2-month standardized low calorie diet weight loss program leads to reductions in
           bone mass and muscle strength in both younger and older adults, particularly in older
           adults, and that these parameters return towards baseline values within 3 years in
           younger but not in older adults.

        -  That a higher protein weight-maintenance diet improves the restoration of bone mass and
           muscle strength after weight loss in both younger and older adults.

      Part 2 Aim:

        -  To measure bone mass, bone turnover and muscle strength in younger (25-45 year old) and
           older (55-70 year old) adults before and after a standardized 2-month weight loss
           program, as well as at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after commencement of the weight loss
           program.

        -  To compare the effects of two different weight maintenance programs differing in protein
           content on the restoration of bone homeostasis and muscle strength after a standardized
           2-month weight loss diet. The weight maintenance programs are of 10 months' duration and
           are administered immediately after the 2-month weight loss program.

    <measure>Fasting appetite</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Previous research has shown that 2 months on a weight reducing diet increases appetite in the fasting state. There is some suggestion that this diet-induced increase in appetite is sustained even after following a weight maintenance diet for 12 months. The investigators will assess fasting appetite, as measured using visual analogue scales, at 0, 2, 6 and 12 months after commencement of the 2-month standardized weight loss diet. The 6- and 12-month time points are taken after 4 and 10 months on the different weight maintenance programs. This primary outcome (fasting appetite at 12 months) will demonstrate whether the weight-loss-induced increase in fasting appetite that is anticipated at 2 months will be normalized by the 12 month time point, and whether the type of weight maintenance diet (High Protein / Low Glycaemic Index versus Moderate Protein / High Glycaemic Index) influences this.</description>

    <measure>Fasting plasma concentrations of gut-derived appetite-regulating hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Previous research has shown that 2 months on a weight reducing diet alters fasting plasma concentrations of gut-derived appetite regulating hormones in a way that would be expected to increase appetite (i.e. increased ghrelin and decreased peptide YY). There is some suggestion that this change in gut hormone concentrations is sustained even after following a weight maintenance diet for 12 months. The investigators will assess fasting plasma concentrations of gut-derived appetite-regulating hormones (ghrelin and peptide YY) at 0, 2, 6 and 12 months after commencement of the 2-month standardized weight loss diet. The 6- and 12-month time points are taken after 4 and 10 months on the 2 different weight maintenance programs. This primary outcome will demonstrate whether the weight-loss-induced increases in ghrelin and decrease in peptide YY that are anticipated at 2 months will be normalized by the 12 month time point, and whether the type of weight maintenance diet influences this.</description>

    <measure>Bone mass</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess bone mineral density and bone mineral content in the lumbar spine and hip (or wrist for people in whom arthritis interferes with the reading) via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) immediately before and after the 2-month standardized weight loss program (i.e. at 0 and 2 months). This primary outcome will help determine whether there is a difference between younger and older participants with respect to changes in bone mass with weight reduction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bone turnover</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess serum concentrations of bone turnover markers immediately before and after the 2-month standardized weight loss program (i.e. at 0 and 2 months). The bone turnover markers to be measured are serum procollagen type-I N-propeptide (P1NP, a marker of bone formation) and serum C-telopeptide of type-I collagen (CTX, a marker of bone resorption). This primary outcome will show whether there is a difference between younger and older participants with respect to changes in bone turnover with weight reduction. This primary outcome is important because DXA scanning to assess bone mass can result in artefactual results in people who are are obese or undergoing changes in body fat mass, as will be the case in this trial.</description>

    <description>Urinary N-terminal telopeptide (NTX) is a marker of bone resorption. While the investigators have selected to measure serum CTX as their marker of bone turnover (resorption), some laboratories in Australia and around the world still use NTX as a marker of bone resorption. The investigators will thus collect urine samples for the potential assay of NTX, should a journal reviewer request this data upon review of our resultant manuscript, and provided that funding is available.</description>

             assessing pre-diabetes will be used as the formal inclusion criteria, i.e. having:
             Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG): Fasting venous plasma glucose concentration 5.6 - 6.9
             mmol/l or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT): Venous Plasma glucose concentration of 7.8
             - 11.0 mmol/l at 2 h after oral administration of 75 g glucose (oral glucose tolerance
             test, OGTT), with fasting plasma glucose less than 7.0 mmol/l. Due to potential
             between-lab variation (local assessments), HbA1c is not used as an inclusion criteria
             in the screening.

          -  Informed consent required

          -  Ethnic group - No restrictions

          -  Smoking - Smoking is allowed, provided subjects have not recently (within 1 month)
             changed habits. However, smoking status is monitored throughout the study and used as
             a confounding variable.

          -  Motivation - Motivation and willingness to be randomized to any of the groups and to
             do his/hers best to follow the given protocol

          -  Other - Able to participate at CID's during normal working hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Based on interview and/or questionnaire, individuals with the following problems will be
        excluded:

          -  Medical conditions as known by the subjects: Diabetes mellitus (other than gestational
             diabetes mellitus); Significant cardiovascular disease including current angina;
             myocardial infarction or stroke within the past 6 months; heart failure; symptomatic
             peripheral vascular disease; Systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg and/or diastolic
             blood pressure above 100 mmHg whether on or off treatment for hypertension. If being
             treated, no change in drug treatment within last 3 months; Advanced chronic renal
             impairment; Significant liver disease e.g. cirrhosis (fatty liver disease allowed);
             Malignancy which is currently active or in remission for less than five years after
             last treatment (local basal and squamous cell skin cancer allowed); Active
             inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis or other disorder
             potentially causing malabsorption; Previous bariatric surgery; Chronic respiratory,
             neurological, musculoskeletal or other disorders where, in the judgement of the
             investigator, participants would have unacceptable risk or difficulty in complying
             with the protocol (e.g. physical activity program); A recent surgical procedure until
             after full convalescence (investigators judgement); Transmissible blood-borne diseases
             e.g. hepatitis B, HIV; Psychiatric illness (e.g. major depression, bipolar disorder).

          -  Medication: Use currently or within the previous 3 months of prescription medication
             that has the potential of affecting body weight or glucose metabolism such as
             glucocorticoids (but excluding inhaled and topical steroids; bronchodilators are
             allowed), psychoactive medication, epileptic medication, or weight loss medications
             (either prescription, over the counter or herbal). Low dose antidepressants are
             allowed if they, in the judgement of the investigator, do not affect weight or
             participation to the study protocol. Levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism is
             allowed if the participant has been on a stable dose for at least 3 months.

          -  Personal/Other: Engagement in competitive sports; Self-reported weight change of &gt;5 %
             (increase or decrease) within 2 months prior to screening; Special diets (e.g. vegan,
             Atkins) within 2 months prior to study start. A lacto-vegetarian diet is allowed;
             Severe food intolerance expected to interfere with the study; Regularly drinking &gt; 21
             alcoholic units/week (men), or &gt; 14 alcoholic units/week (women); Use of drugs of
             abuse within the previous 12 months; Blood donation or transfusion within the past 1
             month before baseline or CID's; Self-reported eating disorders; Pregnancy or
             lactation, including plans to become pregnant within the next 36 months; No access to
             either phone or Internet (this is necessary when being contacted by the instructor's
             during the maintenance phase); Adequate understanding of national language;
             Psychological or behavioral problems which, in the judgement of the investigator,
             would lead to difficulty in complying with the protocol.

          -  Laboratory screening: If all of the above criteria are satisfied, the participant is
             eligible for a glucose tolerance test (blood at 0 and 120 mins), and blood glucose
             concentrations are analyzed immediately (Haemocue). In addition full blood count,
             urea, and electrolytes may be analyzed as a further safety evaluation.

          -  ONLY IF the glucose tolerance test meets the entry criteria for the study, the
             remaining samples are sent to the local laboratory for a safety check, with the
             following exclusion criteria: Hemoglobin concentration below local laboratory
             reference values (i.e. anemia); Creatinine &gt;1.5 times Upper Limit of Normal (local
             laboratory reference values); Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and/or Aspartate Transaminase
             (AST) &gt;3 times the Upper Limit of Normal (local laboratory reference values); Or any
             other significant abnormality on these tests which in the investigators opinion may be
             clinically significant and require further assessment.

          -  Electrocardiography (ECG). Any abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator
             might indicate undiagnosed cardiac disease requiring further assessment (e.g.
             significant conduction disorder, arrhythmia, pathological Q waves). This is done in
             adults 55-70 years of age.

          -  After LCD phase (in adults): Failure to reach at least 8% weight reduction during the
             LCD phase. This leads to exclusion from the intervention.
