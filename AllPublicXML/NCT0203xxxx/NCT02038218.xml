  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DM-CHOC-PEN is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryl carbonate that has demonstrated
      antineoplastic activities in patients with advanced cancers - melanoma, lung, breast and
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involving the CNS during a Phase I study. These findings
      support the preclinical responses seen in mice bearing intracerebrally implanted human breast
      and GBM tumor xenografts. Toxicity was acceptable - hyperbilirubinemia (in patients with
      liver disease and/or liver metastasis). No hematological, renal, cardiovascular, behavioral
      or cognitive impairment/neurotoxicities were noted during the Phase I human trial or in
      previous pre-clinical studies.

      The drug is available for use as a soy bean oil/egg yolk lecithin/glycerin water emulsion;
      the latter continues to be chemically and biologically stable and safe.

      Patients with advanced lung, breast and melanoma cancers spread to the CNS and primary CNS
      malignancies will be eligible for enrollment and treatment, providing the required blood and
      other eligibility requirements are met. The trial will be 2-tiered - patients with liver
      involvement vs. non-liver involvement will be treated with different doses of the drug.

      The trial is open and patients are currently being enrolled and treated with the protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DM-CHOC-PEN has been selected for Phase II intravenous studies in the treatment of patients
      with advanced malignancies with central nervous system measurable disease based on the
      improved PFS and objective responses seen for patients treated during the Phase I DTI-021
      trial and the manageable toxicities noted. Melanoma, breast and lung cancers involving the
      CNS have responded to DM-CHOC-PEN in the Phase I study, thus the basis for the choice of
      tumors to be treated in the Phase II trial. Currently, the opinion is that the drug is
      penetrating the blood brain barrier (BBB) attached to rbcs and released intracerebrally in
      tumor masses in situ.

      The trial will be carefully monitored, and if a cancer type has &gt;3 confirmed responders in
      the first 18 evaluable patients (Stage -1 enrollment); accrual will be expanded for that
      tumor type with a goal of 7/43 for achieving an 80% power at the 5% level of significance
      (Stage-2 enrollment) with unacceptable response rate (P0) 0.1 and desirable response rate
      (P1) 0.25. Thus, each arm will have a 2-stage design. This will allow resources to be
      directed to the most promising areas - selection of 1 or 2 tumor types to develop via
      additional trial studies. A desirable response rate is 25% or better. The above is for each
      tumor type - lung, breast, melanoma and GBM.

      In summary, for any tumor type or treatment sub-group, a response rate of &lt;15% or a rate of
      &quot;possibly treatment-related Gr-3/4 toxicities&quot; of &gt;25% will be considered unacceptable and
      enrollment in the respective tumor type category will be discontinued.

             induced by such treatment(s); no nitrosourea type drug or ipilumimab treatments are
             permitted within the last six (6) weeks prior to enrollment. No major surgery within
             14 days of enrollment. Patients may continue to receive anti-estrogen/steroid therapy

             short QT syndrome. Patients with a history of cardiac disease must be stable.

          -  Patients must understand the nature of the study and be willing to sign an informed
             consent that complies with the investigator/DEKK-TEC policies and approved by the
             Human Investigation Review Committee. Patients must have CNS involvement - from a
             malignancy. Lung cancer may be either small cell or non-small cell.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical co-morbidities - including
             active infections, unstable uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary,
             renal, psychiatric or social conditions that could compromise the safety or compliance
             of treatment are not eligible.

          -  Concomitant chemotherapy or radiotherapy is not permitted.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females are excluded. Women of childbearing age, and their
             sexual partners, must use an effective contraception program. Males who are having
             sexual relations with women capable of child bearing must use the barrier birth
             control while on the study and for 3- months after the last dose of the study drug.

          -  Patients taking CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors are not eligible since it is not known
             whether the study drug is metabolized through this pathway. The following CYP3A4
             inhibitors/inducers are not permitted during the trial - the azole antifungal -
             fluconazole, erythromycin, phenobarbital, verapamil.
