  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast feeding is believed to be beneficial to long-term health but how these effects are
      mediated is unknown. I suggest that this may be through effects on body composition and
      metabolism.

      I will compare adipose tissue and liver fat deposition in healthy, full term breast and
      formula fed infants babies shortly after birth and around 12 weeks.
