  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to determine whether maternal xylitol consumption through regular
      chewing of xylitol gums can affect the salivary mutans streptococci (MS), dental caries, and
      dental plaque levels of their children.

      Method: Study sample included 60 mother and child pairs with high salivary mutans
      streptococcus (MS) levels. Samples were randomly divided into experimental group (30 pairs)
      and control group (30 pairs). Mothers in the experimental group received xylitol chewing gum
      treatment three times/day for three months, whereas the controls received fluoride varnish.
      Both groups received oral hygiene instructions, dietary counseling and restorative treatment.
      All children were examined after 6, 12 and 18 months from the initiation of the study to
      assess caries, plaque and salivary mutans streptococcus (MS) levels.

    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>Collection of saliva samples was carried out for microbiological screening after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months from the initiation xylitol consumption .Un stimulated saliva samples were collected from each child for salivary bacterial level screening. Saliva sampling was performed before conducting the clinical examination between 9-11 am. Children were not allowed to eat or drink for 2 hours before sampling. Saliva was collected with the pipette supplied by the dentocult (CRT) kit. (Ivoclar Vivadent, Lichtenstein). Saliva sample was not taken if the child has received antibiotics within 1 month prior the examination. Screening of stimulated saliva samples for mutans streptococcus (MS) level were carried out using the dentocult method (CRT). Findings of 105 CFU or more of MS indicates a high caries risk, whereas findings less than 105 CFU is considered low caries risk.</description>
