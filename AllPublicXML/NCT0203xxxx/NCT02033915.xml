      Suicide attempters or people with self-harm have a high percentage in seeking medical
      services before and after their suicidal or self-harm behaviour compared to general
      population. Studies revealed that apart from psychiatric services, they were more likely to
      seek help from doctors of various units (e.g. emergency departments, general medicine,
      medical-surgical units) across different healthcare systems (i.e. hospitals or district
      clinics). Besides, suicide event was possibly heard on in-patients of psychiatric or
      non-psychiatric units. People with self-harm experienced poor communication with healthcare
      personnel, and they perceived staff's lacking knowledge about suicide as serious problems. In
      Taiwan it was also found that emergency nurses and general practitioners were in need of
      improving negative attitudes and enhancing knowledge towards suicidal behaviour. From the
      point that nurses are the healthcare personnel that spend the most time with in-patients
      compared to others in the hospital, suicide risk assessment training may enhance nurses'
      attitudes and ability of risk awareness and assessment towards people with self-harm, which
      may in turn significantly increase the identification rate of the high risk group for
      suicide. Currently there is a lack of suicide training program as a reference for nursing
      education in Taiwan. The study therefore aims to strengthen suicide risk assessment ability
      among clinical nurses through interactive discussion groups. Using quasi-experimental design
      with randomized cluster sampling strategy, a case vignettes will be used for suicide risk
      assessment together with other measurements regarding suicide knowledge and attitudes for
      both experiment and control groups before and after the training course.

      Title:

      The effectiveness of interactive discussion group intervention to improve nurses' abilities
      of risk identification and assessment on people with suicide attempt or self-harm behavior

      A.Background

      Suicide has become an important issue in the public health and medical-related field in the
      past decade and has also aroused the attention of government in Taiwan. It has been one of
      the top ten cause of death since 1997 . The high percentage of people who act on suicide idea
      in different age groups pose great challenge to healthcare personnel. Clinical workers are
      first-line gatekeepers of patient health and safety. They are supposed to be willing to care
      for people with suicide risk and can be equipped with the ability to identify patients with
      suicide risk. However, the negative attitudes of medical workers towards people who have
      suicide attempt and self-harm behavior may affect the patients' intention to seek
      professional help and the nurses' quality of care for these people . At present, the
      investigators have limited nursing curriculum related to the concept of and guidance for
      suicide prevention and limited resources that guide nurses to do suicide risk assessment. Few
      information about suicide process and suicide risks are available for nurses , which may
      result in their inability to provide proper care for this group of people. If the
      investigators can improve the ability of suicide risk identification of the nurses, the
      investigators may promote nurses' confidence and change their attitudes in caring for such
      patients. Also, nurses can learn how to empathize suicidal patients, intervene at early stage
      of patients' hospitalization, and potentially build good nurse-patient relationship with
      patients under high risk for suicide. Furthermore, the investigators can refer patients to
      receive appropriate therapy and to provide adequate support to reduce their suicide attempts.
      The investigators addressed the background and importance of this study in the following
      sub-sections:

      The importance of suicide prevention throughout the process of nursing education and clinical
      training

      People with deliberate self harm behavior are the high risk group for suicide, and the
      prevalence of self-harm behavior is 10-30 times to suicide . Identification and assessment of
      suicide risk is the main target of suicide prevention. However, there are only few
      opportunities for nurses to acquire knowledge about suicide prevention in the process of
      nursing education and training. For instance, in a Nursing Department of Medical college in
      Northern Taiwan, there is only one class talking about related issue of suicide prevention
      among all the Psychiatric Nursing lectures. In general, student nurses think they are
      unfamiliar with this issue and unable to assess the patients' suicide risk. Clinical nurses
      who have more chance to care for suicide high risk group, such as those in the Emergency
      Department (ED) and psychiatric ward, may still have negative attitudes toward self-harm
      behavior. Nurses regarded suicidal behavior as selfish, wasting of social or medical
      expenses, or not worthy of showing sympathy. Moreover, they may think self-harm behavior as a
      kind of controlling behavior, calling for attention, and difficult in caring or building
      therapeutic relationship. These negative thinking and emotions are both less likely to
      promote caring quality to patients with self-harm. It was found that psychiatric nurses
      tended to use verbal communication, to inform doctors about patients' suicide risk, or to
      give close observations to prevent self-harm act or to offer a safe environment in the
      psychiatric ward. But there is a lack of concept of early prevention among clinical nurses,
      irrespective those working in the psychiatric or medical-surgical wards. Patients who suffer
      from chronic illness or in terminal stage of disease in medical wards might have more suicide
      ideations. It might be helpful to promote the ability of suicide identification and
      assessment among nurses to give better caring quality for the suicide high risk population.
      Moreover, nurses in the ED are easily encountered with the high risk (i.e. people who had
      suicide attempt or self-harm behavior before). There is still few research focusing on the
      ability of suicide risk evaluation of nurses in the ED. It was suggested that training
      courses can change the negative attitude of suicide for nurses who work in the ED, promote
      their ability of suicide risk assessment, and enhance their confidence in facing these
      patients.

      The policy of suicide prevention and gatekeeper program are forming currently by the health
      organization in Taiwan. Not only are the public playing the role of gatekeepers to indentify
      suicide risk, clinical nurses should also know how to assess suicide risk. So far the
      investigators have few courses about suicide risk assessment, and the investigators need
      further research to develop a complete content of suicide evaluation, which can be used in
      clinical training and nursing education. The investigators can provide a learning environment
      based on interactive group, and this can help improve critical thinking and problem solving
      skills. Also, using case vignette to design the discussion course (case-based curriculum) can
      help the learners understand integrated knowledge content based on clinical situation; its
      advantages include to promote the motivation of active learning, to strengthen the analysis
      skills, to enhance decision making ability, or to cultivate learners o how to correctly
      evaluate the effects on patients from social culture perspectives. At the present, nursing
      education in Taiwan is focusing on critical thinging, problem-solving, and decision making,
      and the use of group discussion can help reach the above teaching goals.

      The importance of patient safety in hospitals

      It is important to keep patient safety in the medical environment, and it is also necessary
      to provide quality of care. However, the issues of suicide and self-harm behavior have been
      neglected in hospitals, and the investigators are lacking of effective preventive
      interventions and policy. There are many topics related to patient safety in medical
      environments, including mistakes happened during the process of giving medicine, falling,
      environment safety. However, suicide behavior among inpatients has been posing the greatest
      challenge to medical personnel. According to the Taiwan Patient-Safety Reporting System
      (Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation, 2009), there were 1,613 accident events
      of hospitalized patients in 2008. General wards are the mainly location of events, in the
      categories of events, 12.0% is self-harm behavior. Although there are only 43 events of
      suicide attempt, its consequence are the most serious compared to other patient safety
      issues. Researches in the 1960s in western countries indicated that the death rate of suicide
      among hospitalized patients are 0.06~5.66 per thousand. Even suicide is a rare topic, the
      investigators cannot ignore its severity. To prevent suicide events, psychiatric ward and
      general ward should put emphasis on the prevention, the education training and communications
      between patients and nurses (Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation, 2009). For
      general medical workers, they might underestimate the formation and the effects of suicide or
      self-harm behavior. The investigators may reach the goal of suicide prevention and treating
      for self-harm behavior appropriately if clinical nurses can identify the high risk group of
      suicide effectively and follow the steps suggested in the gatekeeper program.

      The importance of suicide risk assessment

      There is a remarkable percentage seeking for medical help among patients who harmed
      themselves before committing suicide. These patients not only appeared in psychiatric
      department, but also seek medical help in different medical settings. According to a systemic
      literature review, people of self-harm behavior think they do not have good communication
      with medical workers, and most medical workers do not have idea about what self-harm behavior
      is either. This is a common problem in the medical system across different departments. The
      investigators also understand that negative attitude or knowledge do actually exist in the
      nurses of Emergency Department and doctors. Tzeng &amp; Lipson (2005) suggested that medical
      workers need to know the reasons of suicide or self-harm behavior and the kind of
      interventions that may be helpful. Cognition and attitude training like this is not usual in
      nursing education, but nurses, among the medical group, have relatively more time to stay
      with patients. So strengthen the training of suicide evaluation and identification can help
      us to know the potential group of high risk, and also provide social support and medical
      connections to reduce the formation rate of suicide and self-harm behavior.

      The reasons why the investigators need to identify and assess suicide risk

      To identify and evaluate the suicide risk is the first step in suicide prevention.
      Evaluations for factors of suicide risk (such as major depression and high risk group of
      suicide)is not often performed in clinical care, expect for the psychiatric care settings.
      However, the process of help seeking behavior could happened in the following ways such as
      self-disclosure of suicide idea and risk factors, or transferred by nurses in any department
      and start to accept further treatment. In this process, help and social support from family
      or friends can strengthen the intention to seek for help. Therefore, to identify the case
      with potential risk is the key point to start suicide prevention. Although the investigators
      don't have any research talking about suicide prevention policy in hospital now in the world,
      the awareness and identification for group with high risk, risk assessment and transfer are
      strongly recommended by many Western countries. Nurses can play the role of gatekeeper of
      suicide prevention, and identify the suicide or self-harm behavior before it occurs and
      transfer to the right association for further caring instead of providing assessment and
      protective instructions after the event.

      Based on the backgrounds, this research focuses on the ability of suicide risk identification
      and evaluation of clinical nurses in a teaching hospital of Northern Taiwan. And the
      investigators do evaluate the impact of interactive discussion group which promote the
      identification ability for nurses. The investigators expect to find out patients with high
      risk of suicide and provide appropriate interventions by improving the sensitivity of first
      line clinical professionals.

      B. Aims of the study

        -  To improve the ability of suicide risk identification and assessment on hospitalized
           patients for clinical nurses

        -  To understand the impact of using the interactive discussion group to promote the
           ability on suicide risk identification and evaluation for clinical nurses

        -  To provide evidence-based nursing education as a basis to practice the interactive
           discussion group to promote nurses' ability on suicide risk identification and
           evaluation

      C. Methods

      The study is a randomized controlled trial. The sample will be consisted of 120 people, with
      half of them allocated to the intervention group and another half allocated to the control
      group. Therefore, the sample will be distributed into experimental group and control group
      equally and randomly. After receiving approval from the Ethical Review Committee, the
      investigators will start recruiting people to attend the intervention, &quot;interactive
      discussion group&quot; (IDG), the investigators aim to discuss the concept of suicide risk
      identification and evaluation as well as investigate the impact of such an intervention. The
      investigators have developed a standardized teaching program (the IDG and suicide gatekeeper
      course for nurses) as our intervention. Moreover, before starting the intervention, the
      investigators will have three focus groups in the pilot study in order to recruit clinical
      nurses' perspectives on the issue of the study and their opinions of the study tool. Depends
      on their opinions, the investigators will revise the teaching materials and assessment tools,
      and evaluate the feasibility of putting the IDG into practice. Next, the experimental group
      will take one suicide gatekeeper course and the IDG discussion twice, and the control group
      takes one suicide gatekeeper course. The investigators will do the baseline measurement and
      outcome measurement to evaluate the effects of intervention. The research methods and
      rationale are described in details below.

      The rationale of adopting the intervention of &quot;interactive discussion group&quot; (IDG)

      Education training for nurses currently includes classroom teaching through speeches,
      film/website teaching, group discussion and practice, and classroom teaching is most popular
      one in nowadays. Materials the investigators use to teach suicide assessment such as
      interactive website which provided by Taiwan Nurses Association and books are also available
      for nurses for self-learning. Concerning the importance of discussion and evaluation of
      suicide risk, and the realization of suicide risk based on a case vignette, also the
      interactive learning between trainees and facilitators, the investigators choose using
      interactive discussion group as our teaching policy, and via the randomized controlled trial
      the investigators can evaluate the effect or research interventions.

      Standardized procedure of the interactive discussion group

      Researchers will take the interactive discussion group class for six times (8-10 persons
      every time). During the 50-60 minutes, the facilitators will guide the trainees to understand
      the case vignette and focus on the key issues to discuss, to improve the ability of suicide
      risk identification and evaluation. Two research team workers are responsible for the
      facilitators, and they are both experienced in suicide prevention and clinical works. The two
      facilitators will guide the group in a comprehensive way and standardized maneuver. The topic
      of discussion is focus on a suicide case, a 47-year-old man, who is now in hospitalization of
      medical ward. In the content the investigators can find out there are many messages and signs
      of major depression and suicide behavior. Through the discussion, the investigators guide
      nurses to realize the suicide-related factors, and teach them to identify/evaluate the
      suicide risk. 10 minutes before the group, the investigators ask the trainees to read the
      case and answer the questions. In the next 30 minutes, the investigators start problem
      discussion and use three simple, convenient tools: PHQ2, simplified health scale, SAD
      PERSONS, to do the teaching of identification and evaluation of suicide risk. In the last
      10-15 minutes, the investigators go into a conclusion, do point review and get feedback from
      trainees.

      The Research team uses the standardized material course which is authorized by the Health
      Department of Taiwan-&quot;The Gatekeeper Training Program&quot; to do our interventions. Facilitators
      are trained to use the same material and ways to teach the experimental group and control
      group in consistency. In this part, the investigators do not discuss the suicide case
      vignette, so the investigators can divide this from the group which trained by interactive
      discussion and therefore the investigators can evaluated the effect of using discussion group
      in our training.

      Research Tools

        1. The baseline measurement 1-1 Information Assessment of basic demographic variable such
           as age, sex, marriage, duration of practicing in nursing, nursing levels, working
           experience of psychiatric wards, caring experience of person they know (friends,
           colleague or neighbors) or patient who committed suicide or self-harm behavior before,
           do they accept any training related to suicide prevention in the past year.

           1-2 Suicide Case vignettes and risk assessment question Research team designed a case
           discussion depends on clinical experiences and suicide cases they had cared before. The
           investigators drafted some important questions to evaluate the ability of suicide risk
           identification and evaluation of research samples (Nurses). 8 student nurses of
           university went through this case discussion, and the investigators got a good result of
           this pilot test. Student nurses all agreed the interactive discussion with teacher and
           problem-based teaching can help them to grab the point of suicide prevention and arouse
           their learning interest.

           1-3 Assessment of the cognition and attitude to suicide behavior This scale is used in
           the survey by Health Department of Taiwan which to understand the attitude and opinion
           toward suicide and Psychiatric disease of randomized sample size in the population of
           Taiwan. And the validity of this tool was already proved.

        2. Assessment tools in the Interactive Discussion Group 2-1 Case vignette is the point in
           our interactive discussion group, please read the details in &lt;Methods&gt;.

      2-2 PHQ PHQ was originally used to evaluate the health situation of general public in
      community, and PHQ-9, a part of this scale, which used to evaluate the tendency of Major
      Depression. And the content of PHQ-9 is correlated to the 9 diagnosis items with DSM IV.
      Scholars modified a new vision of PHQ-2, and the reliability and validity is good on the
      public of Taiwan (Sensitivity: 88.0%, Specificity: 81.9%) (Lu et al., 2010). Therefore the
      investigators use the scale to train nurses to screen if there is possibility of Major
      Depression in patients. The two questions are related to the symptoms of &quot;depressed mood&quot; and
      &quot;lost of interest&quot;.

      2-3 Simplified Health Measurement Scale This scale is developed to test the general mental
      health of the public, including five question as &quot;do you feel nervous and anxious&quot;, &quot;easily
      to feel worrisome and angry&quot;, &quot;feeling depressed and sad&quot;, &quot;feeling of low self-esteem&quot; and
      &quot;bad sleeping quality&quot;. Also, the investigators ask extra question as &quot;do you have any
      suicide idea&quot;. This reliability and validity was proved by Li et al.,(2003), and it's a
      simple, convenient scale to screen out the potential depression tendency and suicide risk.
      The goal the investigators use this scale in the research is to improve the recognitions of
      nurses on Major Depression.

      2-4 SAD PERSONS-check list of suicide risk This checklist was originally designed to screen
      if a patient needs to be hospitalized by the Emergency Department staffs based on a 10-item
      suicide risk screening sheet.

      S - Sex: male A - Age( &lt;19 or &gt;45) D - Depressive symptoms P - Previous suicide
      attempt/psychiatric care E- Excessive ethanol/drug use R- Rational thinking loss, sever
      psychiatric symptoms as delusion, hallucination S - Separated/ divorce/drug use/widowed O -
      Organized or serious attempt, who had severe and objective self-harm behavior before like
      carbon monoxide poisoning, overdose medicine taking and need to be hospitalized…etc.

      N - No social support, lack of family, friends, work and religion support S - Stated future
      intent, clear plan including time, methods and location

      Each item is scored one point, with two points weighing for items that are underlined.
      Kripalani et al., (2010) suggested people who get five points or higher need to be
      hospitalized and accept further therapy. The validation of the Chinese version of the scale
      has been performed by a group of psychiatric researchers in Taiwan and is under drafting.

      Data collection procedure

        1. The target population and study sample The target population (i.e. clinical nurses) for
           the study is defined to be from a variety of ward such as Hematology, Oncology, Stroke
           and Rehabilitation where potential cases with high suicide risk may be identified. The
           investigators hypothesise that nurses who work in these wards should understand more
           about the concept of suicide prevention and suicide risk assessment. Therefore the study
           will include all clinical nurses in these wards as the target population. The sample
           size is calculated based on the suggestion in the literature, and the investigators set
           the significant level data, α = 0.05, power = 0.80. Then the investigators divide all
           study subjects into experimental group and control group randomly, and use different
           interventions to examine the effect of research.

        2. Pilot study

           The investigators design focus group courses (three times) for clinical nurses to
           understand their opinions and needs about the teaching materials of suicide risk
           identification and assessment. Also, the investigators examine the possibility of adding
           the interactive discussion group which suggested by group discussion. The investigators
           choose 6-8 nurses each time out of the study samples randomly and excluded who had
           already joined the focus group before. Location of the focus group is on the independent
           discussion room in hospital. Meanwhile, nurses who joined focus group will also be
           excluded in the later study samples (neither the experimental group nor the control
           group).

        3. The baseline measurement

           The experimental group and control group will both be administered the baseline
           measurement including the ability of suicide risk identification, attitude and
           recognition toward suicide behavior, and the ability of suicide risk assessment (the
           investigators use a case vignette and the SAD PERSONS check list). The goal of baseline
           measurement is to evaluate the difference of demographic characteristics and perceptions
           and attitude toward suicidal behaviour between the two research groups before the
           intervention.

        4. The outcome measure

      The investigators will use the score of SAD PERSONS-check list as the outcome measure in
      assessing the effect of our intervention. The reason of using this check list is because it
      is a simple and convenient tool to screen suicide risk in clinical settings, and researches
      have proofed its reliability and validity.

      Statistical analysis

      All statistic analysis of this research are based on the Intent-to-treat method, which follow
      up participants who cannot finish the whole study process (i.e. drop out from the study). The
      investigators still ask them to do the outcome measurement. All the data will be count into
      the original groups to do further analysis in order to get a conservative conclusion.
      Researchers will key-in the data the investigators will use SPSS 16.0 to do the statistical
      analysis. The significant level will be set at 0.05. Main variables and methods for analysis
      are listed below:

      Independent variables

        1. Demographic information: Basic demographic variable such as age, sex, marriage status,
           nursing practice years (continuous variable); categorical variables such as nursing
           levels recognized in the study hospital, working experience in psychiatric related
           field, caring experience of suicidal persons of their acquaintances (friends, colleague
           or neighbors) or patient who committed suicide or self-harm behavior before, training
           experiences related to suicide prevention in the past year.

        2. Variables in the baseline measurement: Attitude and cognition toward suicide (continuous
           variable), the ability of suicide risk identification and assessment (category
           variables), and SAD PERSONS-the check list of suicide risk (continuous variable).

      Outcome variables The ability to identify and evaluate the suicide risk, SAD PERSONS-the
      check list of suicide risk (continuous variable), and case analysis 1(category variable)

      Baseline comparison To make sure there is no difference at first among participants in this
      research, the investigators will compare the characteristics and basic ability of suicide
      risk. Independent t-test is used to deal with continuous variables, and Chi-square test is
      used for category variables. However, whether there is significant difference or not, the
      investigators will further analyze their suicide identification and assessment ability in
      multivariate analysis.

      Further analysis The investigators will compare the change in scores of the outcome, the
      scale of &quot;SAD PERSONS&quot;, as the continuous variables before and after the interventions. The
      investigators will also analyze the frequency and associations of the items in baseline
      measurement including the participants' working site, age, sex, education, duration of
      nursing practice, trainings of suicide risk assessment, caring experience of suicide or
      self-harm cases.

      D. Predictable Difficulties and Solutions

        1. Attendance and Participation of the interactive discussion group in Nurses According to
           the different shifts of clinical nurses, before the investigators arrange the schedule
           of interactive discussion group, the investigators will completely communicate with
           chief manager of different department and get the support of hospital administration to
           make sure that the investigators have an appropriate time for every member in the group.
           Also, researcher will remind of every member one by one to elevate the attendance and
           participation. Furthermore, all the time nurses spend on this training will be count
           into the in-service education time to arouse enforce the motivation. Besides, researcher
           will provide the research fee to every participant to promote the participation
           interest.

        2. Missing data in the questionnaire To prevent the missing data, the researchers will join
           every discussion activity to examine if there is any problem for nurses to fill out the
           questionnaire, and keyin the data individually to ensure its correctness. Moreover, the
           research assistant will key in the data twice under surveilance of the principle
           investigator during the whole procedure.

    <description>The study aims to strengthen suicide risk assessment ability among clinical nurses through training group discussions. In the group sessions the nurses will be facilitated to discuss the suicide risk factors of a case vignette and use an assessment tool, the SAD PERSONS Scale, to learn those factors. The primary outcome measures will be the correctness rate and scores the nurses ascertained in suicide risk assessment of both groups. We hypothesise that the experimental group will have higher correctness rate after the study intervention.</description>

    <description>The interactive discussion groups were held for six times (8-10 persons for each group). During the 50-60 minutes' discussion, the facilitators guided the participants to discuss a case vignette, focusing on the key issues of hospital suicide prevention, and to enhance their abilities of suicide risk identification and evaluation. Two research team members who served as facilitators led the group in a standardized manner.</description>
