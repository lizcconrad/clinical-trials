  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, observational, cohort study in patients with epilepsy. Multiple treating
      physicians will prescribe perampanel to approximately 500 patients, who then will be observed
      for approximately 52 weeks.

        Epilepsy patients prescribed adjunctive treatment in countries where perampanel has
        received marketing approval. Multiple treating physicians will prescribe perampanel to
        patients, who then will be observed for approximately 52 weeks.
