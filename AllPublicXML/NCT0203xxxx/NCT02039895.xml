    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy, Total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT), achieves a high response rate
      and is an effective treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma affecting the superficial region.
      One the most widely used TSEBT techniques consists of six dual fields initially developed at
      Stanford University. However, deviations occur from the prescription dose up to 40% and the
      surface dose inhomogeneity as much as 90% in body areas such as the perineum and eyelid.

      Helical tomotherapy (HT) has advantages in irradiating extended volumes with treatment length
      of up to 160 cm, continuously in a helical pattern without the need for field junction. Using
      HT, an image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy, to replace conventional TSEBT technique
      to increase dose delivery and decrease toxicities possibly. Recently, we published the
      possibility of helical irradiation of the total skin (HITS) by physical proving and showed
      the clinical results of HITS successfully for a woman with T cell lymphoma failure by
      chemotherapy, topic UV irradiation and local radiotherapy (RT) to overcome the surface dose
      inhomogeneity by conventional RT.

      Here, investigators will enroll the stage I-IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) of
      International Society Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL)/U.S. Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium
      (USCLC)/European Organization for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), patients who are
      candidates for TSEBT by recommendation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines
      (Version 4.2011, Mycosis fungoid/Sezary syndrome) or who are refractory or not feasible to
      the topic UV irradiation, Interferon alpha, psoralen plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy,
      and Accutane® (Isotretinoin) or chemotherapy to receive HITS to replace TSEBT. Additionally,
      we will compare the advantages and disadvantages between the plan of HT and conventional RT
      for TSEBT.

          1. The stage I-IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) of International Society Cutaneous
             Lymphomas (ISCL) and U.S. Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC)/European Organization
             for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), patients who are candidates for TSEB by
             recommendation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines (Version 4.2011,
             Mycosis fungoid/Sezary syndrome)

          2. Patients who are refractory or not feasible to the topic UV irradiation, Interferon
             alpha, psoralen plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy, and Isotretinoin or
             chemotherapy.

          3. Eligibility criteria included the following: Karnofsky status 70% or greater;
