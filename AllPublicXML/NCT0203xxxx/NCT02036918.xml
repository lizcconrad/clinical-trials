  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC) undergoing treatment with sipuleucel-T for evidence of treatment-associated immune
      activation in lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of mCRPC patients planning to undergo therapy with sipuleucel-T
      immunotherapy. Consenting patients will be randomized 3:1 between immediate sipuleucel-T
      immunotherapy followed by lymph node biopsy (the post-treatment experimental group) or
      immediate lymph node biopsy followed by sipuleucel-T immunotherapy (the pre-treatment control
      group). Peripheral blood will be collected before, during, and after treatment with
      sipuleucel-T and evaluated for evidence of sipuleucel-T induced immune activation. Lymph
      nodes collected at biopsy will also be evaluated for evidence of sipuleucel-T induced immune
      activation. Patients will be followed for 3 months for safety and 6 months for disease
      progression.

          7. A minimum of 4 weeks from any major surgery prior to registration. Coincident standard

             of the prostate

          5. Extensive prior surgery/radiation present that would render the biopsy highly complex
             and the risk of intraoperative injury high

          6. Any chronic medical condition requiring daily corticosteroids or other
             immunosuppressants

          7. Solid organ transplantation requiring immunosuppression

          8. Visceral (e.g. lung, liver) metastases

          9. Known brain metastases

         10. History of spinal cord compression

         11. Untreated/unstabilized pathologic long bone fractures

         12. Other malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer, with a ≥ 30% probability of
             recurrence within 24 months

         13. Administration of any investigational therapeutic within 30 days of registration
