      The purpose of this current prospective study is to assess the effects of body weight support
      treadmill training (BWSTT) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Training
      intervention aim at improving: quality of life, walking capability, spasticity, functions in
      every day life, bone mass density and related hematological factors. The examination
      consisted of (1) neurological classification by ASIA standard neurological classification of
      spinal cord injury working sheet, (2) spasticity evaluation of lower limbs by Modified
      Ashworth Scale, (3) walking independence evaluation by Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury
      II (WISCI II), (4) patient's quality of life perspective by World Health Quality of Life-
      BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), (5) the functional status by 10-item Modified Barthel Index, (6) bone
      mass density (BMD) by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, (7) body tissue
      consistency by full body DXA scan, (8) skeletal system health associated blood factors
      (calcitonin, osteocalcin, 25 OH vitamin D, 1,25- (OH)2 vitamin D, ostase and parathyroid
      hormone) by hematological tests. The results will be collected and evaluated using
      statistical software (i.e. SPSS).
