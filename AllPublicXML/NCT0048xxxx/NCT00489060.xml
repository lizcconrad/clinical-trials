      A trial to determine if cryoablation is as effective as radiation in the treatment of men
      with localized prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer were randomly assigned to cryoablation or
      external beam radiotherapy (median dose 68 Gy). All patients received neoadjuvant
      antiandrogen therapy. The primary endpoint was disease progression at 36 months based on a
      trifecta definition of failure: (a) radiological evidence of metastatic disease or b)
      initiation of further antineoplastic therapy or c) biochemical failure). Two definitions of
      biochemical failure were used: 1) rising PSA with a final value &gt;1.0 ng/mL and 2) rise above
      PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, disease-specific survival,
      and positive prostate biopsy at 36 months.
