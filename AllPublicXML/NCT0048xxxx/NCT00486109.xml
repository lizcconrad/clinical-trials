    <textblock>
      This study investigated wearability and usability of the I-PORT™ Injection Port (I-PORT™), a
      new disposable injection port through which prescribed medication is injected subcutaneously
      from a standard syringe or pen. Additional investigation compared subject opinion towards
      using the I-PORT™ device compared to standard injection therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             for a minimum of six (6) months

          -  Subjects must be utilizing a regimen of at least two (2)injections daily of either
             Novolin®, Humulin®, NovoLog®, Humalog® or Apidra® and no more than one (1) injection
             of Lantus® daily using a standard syringe or insulin pen

          -  Current regimen of intensified insulin therapy (defined as separate injections of
             basal and prandial insulin with at least three (3) insulin injections per day) for a
             minimum of three (3) months

          -  If medications (other than oral anti-diabetic agents) in addition to insulin are taken
             at screening, the subject must be on a stable regimen as defined by continued use of
             the same dose of each medication for a period of at least three (3) months prior to
             study enrollment

          -  Subjects must be willing to provide written informed consent

          -  History or current diagnosis of chronic diseases which in the view of the PI would
             interfere with adequate involvement in and completion of the requirements of the study

          -  Use of short term or chronic steroids within two (2) months of entry into the study or

          -  Intake of any drug or herbal preparation which, in the evaluation of the PI, may
             interfere with the interpretation of clinical study results or that is known to cause
             clinically relevant interference with insulin action, glucose utilization or ability
             to detect or recover from hypoglycemia (e.g., systemic steroids)

          -  History of known hypersensitivity to plastics or polymers

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within two (2) months prior to enrollment or
             during this study

             evidenced by creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL for females or &gt;1.8 mg/dL for males, grade III or
             IV retinopathy or severe peripheral vascular disease)

          -  Evidence of gastroparesis, orthostatic hypotension or hypoglycemia unawareness
             (autonomic neuropathy)

          -  Myocardial infarction or stroke within the preceding six (6)months

          -  Positive hepatitis B (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis C (Hep C AB)serology and/or positive HIV
             serology

          -  History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic (as evidenced by
             ALT or AST &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal), gastrointestinal, neurological or
             infectious disorders capable of altering the absorption, metabolism or elimination of
             drugs, or constituting a significant risk factor when using the study device

             with study device administration) or other reasons, which in the opinion of the PI may
