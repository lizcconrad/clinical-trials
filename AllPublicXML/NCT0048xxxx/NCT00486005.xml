      Evaluate the efficacy of nizatidine in reducing/limiting weight gain in patients with
      schizophrenia who have been under treatment with olanzapine for at least two months and
      evaluate the treatment effects on the Eating Inventory, BPRS, number of treatment, emergent
      adverse events, changes in vital signs, laboratory results and extrapyramidal effects.
