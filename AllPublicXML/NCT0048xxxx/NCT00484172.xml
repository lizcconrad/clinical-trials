      The purpose of this study is to screen a pediatric population (ages 2-8) for genes associated
      with childhood obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of childhood obesity has been growing at an epidemic rate for the past several
      years, in part due to the lack of understanding of mechanisms at a molecular level. This
      study will screen a healthy general pediatric population age 2 to 8 for potential genes
      associated with childhood obesity using whole genomic gene arrays. Patients with BMI values
      equal to or greater than the 85th percentile will be compared to patients with a BMI below or
      equal to the 15th percentile. The INSIG2 gene will be specifically studied because of its
      identification in several populations of obese subjects. The differences in gene expression
      of the 2 groups will then be used to identify new genes for investigation in childhood
      obesity.
