  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluating a new computer software package to help us acquire and interpret heart CT
      studies, which is the purpose of this research project. We plan to compare the acquiring and
      analysis of heart artery calcium scores and CT angiograms (scans of the heart arteries) with
      the new SYNGO Somaris/7 Cardiac software to our previous experience with the the existing
      Siemens software and the TeraRecon software (current software used in the Cardiovascular
      MR/CT lab). The main objective of this study is to provide information to Siemens regarding
      the ease of use and capability of the scanner's software. The goal of this study is to
      determine whether the acquisition and interpretation information with the new software
      functionally meets the guidelines specified by Siemens, and also to determine whether the
      software is equivalent or superior to previous versions we used from April 2004 to April
      2006.

      We will obtain and read CT coronary angiograms (CAT scans of the heart arteries) with the
      assistance of the new imaging software analysis package. Analysis of technical and clinical
      data will be recorded on the case report forms. This will be an observational design. We
      intend to test the results of our analyses through a Test Plan looking at Cardio
      functionality (hardware and software), System performance (reconstruction, loading,
      transferring, archiving),and System stability.

      We plan to find out the relevant effect of our clinical reading results by enrolling our
      patients in a long-term clinical outcomes database. To evaluate the presence of traditional
      coronary risk factors, a focused medical history will be requested (see attached) as well as
      access to relevant medical records to determine the presence of major adverse cardiac events.
      These will be handled in a confidential manner and will be de-identified using subject number
      and initial only to be compliant with HIPAA.

        This sutdy is taking place in a 900+ bed community setting hospital. All patients who meet
        the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked if they would like to participate when
        they arrive to the radiology department to undergo their cornary CT scan.
