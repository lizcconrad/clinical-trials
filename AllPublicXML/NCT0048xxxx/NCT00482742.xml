      The main objectives of the study are:

      To evaluate the performance and safety of the CiTop guidewire, while attempting to cross thru
      total occlusions of various dimensions and morphology.

      To compare the safety and efficacy of the CiTop guidewire with standard guidewires in terms
      of impact on the treated artery. Following operation of the CiTop device, angiography
      demonstrated successful crossing of the occlusion with no visible evidence of arterial wall
      injury, dissection, or distal embolization.

      To assess ease of operation and the level of integration of the CiTop with standard
      interventional angiography procedure: Balloon angioplasty, placement of stent.

        Clinical Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, intermittent claudication less
             than 30 meters, rest pain or tissue ischemia.(Fontain grade 3-4)

          -  Critical limb Ischemia

          -  The patient has Chronic Total Occlusion in limb arteries, aged at least 3 months.

             Heparin

          -  Visible entry point of target lesion

          -  NO cancer or other life threatening diseases or conditions

          -  NO diagnosis or suspected renal failure (2 x ULN of creatinine)

          -  Not suspected intolerance of the contrast agent

          -  NO Drug abuse or alcoholism
