      The purpose of this study is to observe patients aged 6-18 with various psychiatric diagnosis
      being treated with drugs called atypical antipsychotics to determine the effects of the drugs
      on growth, weight gain, and laboratory tests.

      Introduction: Antipsychotics have been used for many years to treat serious mental illnesses
      like schizophrenia and bipolar illness (manic depression). These older drugs carry a higher
      risk of side effects like shaking, stiffness, restlessness or uncontrolled movements. They
      may occur when the drugs are first taken, or later, after years of use. Newer drugs called
      atypical antipsychotics (ATA's) are much less likely to cause these problems. Their lack of
      these side effects and greater safety have led doctors to use them for other diseases in both
      adults and younger patients. They have proved to be helpful in aggression, impulsiveness,
      anxiety and mood swings. Unfortunately, a number of other side effects, such as weight gain,
      increased rates of diabetes and increases in cholesterol have also been identified. While a
      lot of current research into these side effects has been done in adults, there have been few
      studies with younger patients. The research so far has been brief and involved small numbers.
      This is especially important in this young and potentially vulnerable group of patients.

      Study Methods: This research will study children and teens aged 6 to 18 who are being treated
      with the newer drugs for the first time. If agreeable to the patients and their parents or
      guardians, their doctors will prescribe one of the newer drugs and will measure the effects,
      if any, on weight, blood sugar, cholesterol as well as the improvement in their condition.
      Weight, height, and blood work will be done before the drug is started, and 6 and 12 months
      after they have been on it, comparing the results with their original values. The doctor, the
      patient and the parent or guardian will rate the patients' condition at these times, as well,
      to evaluate their improvement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Atypical Antipsychotic naive patients who have agreed to take Atypical Antipsychotic

             symptoms as per their usual patient care

          -  Outpatients and inpatients

          -  A wide range of patients including those with ADHD, Tourette's disorder, anxiety,
             disruptive behavior and mood instability as well as psychosis

          -  Children and adolescents aged 6 through 18 years

          -  Both sexes

          -  Females who have reached menarche and are sexually active who agree to use adequate

          -  Guardians willing to give informed consent, if needed

          -  No initiation of or changes of doses of other psychotropic medication prescribed for
             the indication of which the atypical antipsychotic is being prescribed in the
             preceding month.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with eating disorders (this condition might affect the expected weight and
             metabolic changes anticipated with the medications)

          -  Concurrent medical conditions including diabetes or hyperlipidemia if, in the judgment
             of the treating physician, the use of atypical anti-psychotics would be
             contra-indicated. (patient safety)

          -  Substance abuse (may effect the reliability of the patients or confound weight or
             metabolic effects of the medications)

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients (patient safety)
