  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, Phase II, placebo-controlled trial adding on to a
      background of effective treatment designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of PRO95780 combined with paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab therapy in
      patients with previously untreated Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 120 patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms.
