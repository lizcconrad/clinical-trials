  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aims of this study will be to assess the difference in CFV/CFR (Coronary flow
      velocity/reserve) in diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients and to correlate CK-MB, TnI and HsCRP
      release after otherwise successful coronary stenting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-procedure CK-MB and troponin I (TnI) and HsCRP elevation, in the absence of obvious
      procedural events, is most likely caused by distal micro-thromboembolism of platelet
      aggregates and atheromatous debris causing microvascular bed obstruction. This, in turn, will
      result in lower coronary flow reserve and regional left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.
      Therefore, patients with normal CFV/CFR (coronary flow velocity/reserve) by Doppler wire and
      FFR (fractional flow reserve) by flow wire should have no peri-procedural CK-MB, TnI
      elevation as compared to patients with peri-procedural CK-MB and TnI elevation where all
      markers of microcirculation will be reduced. This observation will have a prognostic value at
      short and long-term. This study may also have clinical implications for patients with
      intra-coronary stenting and normal microvascular parameters post PCI that these patients may
      be discharged early while others may need to be monitored in-hospital for an extended period
      of time.
