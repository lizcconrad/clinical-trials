  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to learn more about follicular lymphoma and anti-cancer vaccines, we are collecting
      samples from people with this diagnosis. We then hope to make a vaccine from this tissue to
      help the immune system destroy cancer cells. We plan on keeping samples in the tissue bank
      indefinitely.

  <detailed_description>

      - The following tests and procedures will be performed: Approximately 50cc of peripheral
      blood will be drawn and stored in the tissue bank; patients who have follicular lymphoma
      cells circulating in the blood will have about 40cc's of blood drawn and stored for
      processing; patients undergoing a lymph node biopsy will have samples of the biopsy stored;
      patients having fluid drained from the abdomen or from around the lung will have some of
      their fluid saved to cell collection and processing; patients undergoing a bone marrow biopsy
      will have some of the sample stored for cell collection and processing.

    <description>Collect eligible patient samples that potentially could be used to prepare autologous cell vaccines and possibly prepare autologous tumor cell injection for vaccine induced delayed-type hypersensitiviy evaluation for the companion treatment protocol. There will be no analysis performed on this protocol, the analysis will occur on a companion vaccination protocol. Patients will be consented to this protocol separately.</description>
