  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the ability of two doses of OT-551 ophthalmic
      solution and drug-free solution to safely and effectively treat geographic atrophy associated
      with age-related macular degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) results in severe, irreversible central vision loss
      and is the leading cause of blindness in individuals older than 50 years in the western
      world. The vast majority of AMD patients have the 'dry' (non-exudative) form that is
      characterized by the presence of drusen and atrophic changes in the retinal pigment
      epithelium (RPE). Dry AMD may remain static or progress slowly to produce areas of geographic
      atrophy (GA), the advanced or late-stage form of dry AMD. GA is a severe vision-threatening
      lesion of the macula that may impair visual function, impact daily life activities, and
      result in blindness. Currently, there is no approved treatment for dry AMD or GA.
      Pre-clinical results have shown that OT-551 may protect RPE cells and photoreceptors from
      oxidative damage and block angiogenesis stimulated by VEGF and other growth factors, and
      therefore is a therapeutic candidate for treating GA.
