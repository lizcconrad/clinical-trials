    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine if telephone counseling improves the outcome for persons with
      moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are recruited from the three participating TBI Model Systems of Care at Seattle,
      Philadelphia, and Jackson. After informed consent is obtained, some information is gathered
      about the injury and information about how the subject is doing cognitively, socially, and
      emotionally. After this information is obtained and after the subject is discharged from the
      acute rehabilitation unit, the subject is randomly selected to receive either standard care
      after discharge or standard care plus the telephone counseling.

      The telephone follow-up group receives a telephone call from a research coordinator in 3-4
      days, 2, 4, 8 weeks, and 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 months after the date of injury. The
      research coordinator will work with the subject on problem-solving and self-management
      skills. In addition, the research coordinator will check in with a family member or friend
      for whom the subject has given permission to speak.

      An outcome assessment is done by telephone at 12 months and 24 months after injury.
