  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, open-label, 2-panel (Parts A and B) PET study investigating the degree
      of occupancy of dopamine 2 receptors (D2_RO) in the human brain after single oral doses of
      BL-1020 or Perphenazine (Trilafon®, hereafter called Perphenazine) in healthy male subjects.
      In Part A the D2_RO is investigated for the study compound BL-1020 and in Part B the D2_RO of
      BL-1020 is compared to the D2_RO of Perphenazine, a reference compound.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntarily signed written informed consent agreement approved by the Independent
             Ethics Committee (IEC) after explanation of the nature and objectives of the study and
             prior to any study specific procedure.

          2. Healthy male subjects between the age of 21 and 35 (inclusive).

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) (weight [kg] / (height [m] x height [m])) ≥ 18 and &lt; 29 kg/m2.

             for the last 1 month before dose administration.

          5. Good health, based upon the results of medical history, physical examination, ECG
             (without clinically significant abnormalities) and laboratory profile of both blood
             and urine, including creatinine clearance, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault

          6. Normal blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥ 95 and ≤ 149 mmHg; diastolic blood
             pressure ≥ 55 and ≤ 89 mmHg) measured after 5 minutes rest in supine position.

          7. Pulse rate of ≥ 45 and ≤ 95 beats/min measured after 5 minutes rest in supine
             position.

          8. Able to communicate well with the investigator and able to comply with the
             requirements of the entire study.

             scheduled to receive it during the study. Paracetamol is allowed, except for within 24
             hours before each PET scan.

          2. Demonstration of any active physical disease, acute or chronic.

          3. Any gastrointestinal complaints within 7 days prior to dosing day.

             gastritis or peptic ulcers), neurological (especially history of seizures disorders),
             endocrinological, immunological, psychiatric or cardiovascular disease, myopathies and
             bleeding tendency.

         10. Participation in an investigational drug study within 3 months prior to the dosing
             day.

         11. Donation of blood within 3 months prior to the dosing day.

         12. History of alcoholism or more than moderate alcohol consumption (&gt; 3 units of ethanol
             regularly per day or &gt; 21 units regularly per week).

         13. Consumption of alcohol within 48 hours prior to dose administration and/or positive
             alcohol breath test.
