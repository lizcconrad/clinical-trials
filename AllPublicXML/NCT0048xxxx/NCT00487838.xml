    <textblock>
      This study will test a new method for preventing worsening of age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) and for developing imaging methods to follow the very earliest microscopic
      changes in the disease. The macula is the part of the retina in the back of the eye that
      determines central vision. AMD can impair central vision, affecting a person's ability to
      read, drive, and carry out daily activities. Some studies suggest that cumulative exposure to
      sunlight increases the risk for progression of AMD to the late stage that is often
      characterized by poor central vision. This study will determine if wearing glasses with a
      yellow filter over one eye and a red-violet filter over the other eye when outdoors will
      decrease the rate of change of early-stage AMD in one or both eyes.

      Patients early-stage AMD who have had cataract surgery in both eyes with implanted lenses may
      be eligible for this study.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Wear the filter glasses when outdoors between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.

        -  Record the time of day and light environment when they use the glasses.

        -  Have an eye examination, pictures of the retina, and a medical history taken at the
           beginning of the study and at set intervals during the study.

      The study lasts at least 12 months and may be extended for a longer period of time....

    <textblock>
      Accumulation of the photoproduct N-retinylidene-n-retinylethaholamine (A2E) within the retina
      may be associated with the early age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Our biophysical
      model of retinal photochemistries predicts that as the lens yellows with age a spectral
      imbalance of the light reaching the retina causes steady-state A2E levels to rise in the RPE,
      which induces increasing RPE stress leading to AMD progression. If correct, this rise in A2E
      levels and the initial injury could be prevented by appropriately chosen spectral filtering
      (e.g., colored sunglasses). Autofluorescence imaging of the retina currently allows
      noninvasive mapping of total accumulated lipofuscin fluorophores within the macular retinal
      pigment epithelium (RPE) but not A2E or its precursor alone. By adding new sets of excitation
      and emission filters to existing fundus cameras and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopes,
      we propose to map individually both A2E and its precursor A2PEH2 or their fractional
      contributions to the total retinal fluorescence. By following A2E fluorescence in both eyes
      in subjects following bilateral cataract surgery and intra-ocular lens [IOL] implantation
      with early symmetric age-related maculopathy who wear our bicolored sunglasses whenever
      outdoors in the daylight, we propose to test this hypothesis while efficiently controlling
      for hidden genetic, physiological, and environmental confounding variables between subjects.
      This pilot protocol seeks to optimize recruitment of suitable subjects and the
      reproducibility of our spectral imaging and noninvasive analysis of A2E and A2PEH2 levels in
      the normal and microscopically abnormal regions of the macula. The data from this pilot study
      will be used to design a clinical study to test our hypothesis.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All eligible patients are invited to participate in this study.

        Patients will be local area residents who average greater than or equal to 2 hours outdoors
        daily, who are willing to follow the protocol of wearing our bicolor sunglasses whenever
        outdoors in daylight and to keep a log book of use and to return periodically to NIH for
        our noninvasive imaging studies.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals with signs of more advanced age-related maculopathy in either eye such as
        identifiable regions of geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization.

        Individuals with prior eye disorders (other than uncomplicated cataract surgery and early
        age-related maculopathy).

        Individuals with diabetes mellitus, current chemotherapy, or other medicines or conditions
        that may affect our ability to perform accurate autofluorescence imaging or interfere with
        follow-up visits.
