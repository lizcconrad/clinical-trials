    <textblock>
      Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a disease of young adults and can affect women of child bearing
      age. Suffers of LQTS are at risk of ventricular dysrhythmias including torsades de pointes
      and ventricular fibrillation.

      Pregnancy increases the chance that any mother may have an abnormal heart rhythm or
      arrhythmia. This chance is higher with the LQTS. There are only a few reported cases of women
      with the LQTS having a baby in the medical literature. This can make it difficult for the
      doctor caring for a pregnant woman with the long QT syndrome - especially should they need an
      anesthetic.

      We would like to study as many women who have had a baby who have the long QT syndrome to
      give us a better idea of whether there are any arrhythmias occurring at the time of delivery.

      This will be a retrospective analysis of all LQTS women managed at St. Paul's or BC Women's
      who have been pregnant in the last 5 years. These two hospitals both have a provincial role
      in the care of pregnant women, BC Women's as the designated provincial tertiary maternity
      care referral centre, and St. Paul's through its provincial PATCH clinic. Using the data from
      these two centres should capture the majority of LQTS cases in parturients in the province.
      We will search for these women from the Department of Anesthesia BC Women's consult database,
      the St. Paul's Cardiac Obstetrical Care database, and BC Women's Health Records using
      International Classification of Diseases - 10 coding for long QT. Then, after obtaining
      patient consent, review the charts collecting data using the data entry form. The cases will
      then be compared and any conclusions into the different anesthetic managements made.
