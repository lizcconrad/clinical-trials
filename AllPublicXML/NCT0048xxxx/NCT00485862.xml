  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the efficacy of the combination of sertraline plus atomoxetine with continued sertraline monotherapy in the subgroup of patients with less than a 50% reduction in baseline symptom severity after an adequate trial with sertraline monotherapy</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the effects of the combination of sertraline plus atomoxetine with continued sertraline monotherapy on cognition in patients with no or partial response after an adequate trail with sertraline alone</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the efficacy of the combination of sertraline plus atomoxetine with continued sertraline monotherapy in patients with no or partial response after an adequate trial with sertraline alone as measured by remission rates</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To test the hypotheses that patients homozygous or heterozygous for the short allele of serotonin transporter will be less responsive to sertraline than patients homozygous for the long allele</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To test the hypotheses that patients homozygous or heterozygous for the short allele of the serotonin transporter who have no or partial response to sertraline therapy will respond when atomoxetine is added to the treatment regimen</measure>
