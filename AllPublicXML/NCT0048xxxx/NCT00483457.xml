      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue and blood in the laboratory from patients with cancer
      receiving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors may help doctors understand the
      effects of EGFR inhibitor therapy in the skin.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at the effects of EGFR inhibitors in the skin of
      cancer patients.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effects of EGFR inhibitors on the EGFR pathway in the skin of cancer
           patients prior to and after receiving EGFR inhibitors (i.e., tyrosine kinase inhibitors
           and monoclonal antibodies).

        -  Compare the effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors vs monoclonal antibodies on the
           EGFR pathway in the skin of these patients.

        -  Compare changes in the EGFR pathway with grade of rash in these patients.

        -  Compare changes in EGFR pathway effectors in the skin with serum TGFα levels in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo skin punch biopsies and blood sample collection at baseline, within 1 week
      of developing skin rash, and 6 weeks after beginning treatment. Samples are analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry and western blot for phosphorylated MAP kinase, AKT, and EGF levels and
      TGFα levels. Patients also complete diagrams to indicate locations of the rash once weekly
      during the first 6 weeks of treatment.

        Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age, have the diagnosis of a malignancy for which they are
        considering therapy with an inhibitor of the EGFR pathway, have no severe underlying skin
        disorder, must not have a bleeding diathesis that would preclude safe biopsy and patients
        on coumadin must not have an INR &gt; 3.0 at time of biopsy.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of a malignancy for which therapy on or off a clinical trial with an
             inhibitor of the EGFR pathway is under consideration

               -  The therapy under consideration may be monotherapy or combined with other
                  therapies as long as other therapies do not typically cause a rash

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  INR ≤ 3.0 (for patients receiving concurrent warfarin)

          -  No severe underlying skin disorder (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis or severe
             dermatitis) that would preclude study treatment

          -  No bleeding diatheses that would preclude safe biopsy

          -  No allergy to lidocaine or similar local anesthetics

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:
