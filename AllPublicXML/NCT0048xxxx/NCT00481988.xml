      The purpose of this study is to learn about a brain stimulating procedure called transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS). In tDCS therapy, two moistened sponges are applied to the
      forehead while a small amount of electric current flows between them. These electrodes are
      placed on the head so that the electricity will pass through a region in the brain that is
      believed to contribute to depression. This study is intended to test the theory that the
      electromagnetic field created by the current may affect this region of the brain in a way
      that may improve the symptoms of depression. This may affect brain activity and function.

        <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRS,24 question version), is a standardized assessment tool for measuring severity of depression where 0 is the minimum score (no depressive symptoms) and 40 is the maximum (severe depression).I am reporting the number of participants with stable remission which is defined as an HDRS &lt; 10 for 2 weeks.</description>
