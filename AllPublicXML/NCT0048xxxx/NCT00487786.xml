    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with cancer who have failed potentially curative treatments or for
      whose disease a curative treatment does not exist.

      OGX-427 is an antisense product that inhibits expression of one of the heat shock proteins.
      Decreasing this heat shock protein (Hsp27) should result in down regulation of pathways
      implicated in cancer progression and development of resistance to treatment.

      This study is for patients with breast, prostate, ovarian, non-small cell lung (NSCL) or
      bladder cancer who have failed potentially curative treatments or for whose disease a
      curative treatment does not exist.

      OGX-427 is a second-generation ASO that inhibits expression of Hsp27. Hsp27 is one of the
      heat shock proteins. Hsp27 increases with cell stress, including cytotoxic chemotherapy,
      radiation therapy and hormone therapy and has been shown to inhibit cell death. Thus,
      decreasing Hsp27 as a cancer therapy is attractive as a therapy as it should result in down
      regulation of pathways implicated in cancer progression and development of resistance to
      treatment.

      A number of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies have demonstrated that OGX-427 has
      single-agent activity in reducing Hsp27, inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell death in
      several human cancer cell lines. OGX-427 has also demonstrated chemosensitizing activity in
      studies using cell lines and animal models in combination with several cytotoxic drugs,
      including docetaxel.

      Docetaxel (Taxotere®) has anticancer activity in breast, prostate, ovarian, non-small cell
      lung and bladder cancer. Docetaxel has been approved by Health Canada and the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of patients with breast, prostate, ovarian and non-small
      cell lung cancer.
