  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess hypothesis that efficacy of duloxetine 60mg QD is non-inferior to paroxetine 20mg QD in treating major depressive disorder as defined by DSM-IV. Primary efficacy evaluated by mean change of HAMD17 total scores from baseline to endpoint.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg QD and paroxetine 20 mg QD on anxiety symptoms associated with depression as measured by mean changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) total scores</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare efficacy of treatment with duloxetine 60 mg QD and paroxetine 20 mg QD on symptoms of depression measured by mean endpoint scale on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S) scale and the endpoint score</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare efficacy of treatment with duloxetine 60 mg QD and paroxetine 20 mg QD on symptoms of depression measured by the endpoint score on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the efficacy of treatment with duloxetine 60 mg QD and paroxetine 20 mg QD on somatic complaints of pain as measured by the Somatic Symptom Inventory Scale (SSI) and Visual Analog Scales for pain (VAS)</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg QD and paroxetine 20 mg QD as measured by response and remission rates</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the safety of duloxetine 60 mg QD and paroxetine 20 mg QD using information on treatment-emergent adverse events and other safety measures - e.g. electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory tests</measure>
