    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to document the response rate in patients affected by
      metastatic ovarian cancer, treated with NGR-hTNF plus doxorubicin. Safety will be established
      by clinical and laboratory assessment according to NCI-CTC criteria.

      This is a phase II, open-label,single arm, non-randomized study that will be conducted in
      patients affected by metastatic ovarian cancer, that will be conducted using Simon's

             than 1-year and not surgically sterilized) must practice effective contraceptive
             measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative
