  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Wallis System (interspinous process
      implant) is equivalent to total disc replacement (TDR) for the treatment of mild to moderate
      degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine at the L4-L5 level.

      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of the Wallis® System compared to commercially
      available lumbar TDR with respect to individual subject success rates at 24 months
      postoperative follow-up.

      Study participants will receive all study related test articles and surgical procedures at no
      charge. Please scroll down to the &quot;Locations&quot; section to find a doctor in your area that is
      participating in this study. If you are interested in participating in this study and do not
      see a doctor in your area, please contact Jose Naveira at jose.naveira@abbottspine.com

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-60 (inclusive) and skeletally mature.

          -  Diagnosis of mild to moderate DDD at L4-L5 as confirmed by radiography.

          -  Minimum of six months of failed conservative treatment.

          -  Pre-operative visual analog (VAS) low back pain score ≥ 40, on a scale of 100mm, with
             low back pain greater than left or right leg pain.

          -  Preoperative baseline Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of ≥ 40 on a 100 point
             scale.

          -  Physically and mentally able to comply with the protocol, including ability to read
             and complete required forms, and willing and able to adhere to the follow-up
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  Voluntarily signs the patient informed consent form.

          -  Patient is a surgical candidate for an anterior approach to the lumbar spine (&lt; 3
             abdominal surgeries).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigator believes that the L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, or L5-S1 level is symptomatic
             based upon objective evidence, e.g., radiograph, MRI, or discography.

          -  Evidence of a prior fracture or trauma to the vertebral bodies at the affected level
             and/or the spinous processes at the L4-L5 or adjacent levels.

          -  Osteoporosis or osteopenia or metabolic bone disease as confirmed by DEXA scan (T
             score &lt; -1.0). Female subjects older than 45 years of age (or post-menopausal women,
             history of oophorectomy, or family history of osteoporosis) and male subjects older
             than 55 years will undergo a pre-operative, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of
             the lumbar spine. The DEXA will be used to identify subjects with an indication of
             osteoporosis, osteopenia or metabolic bone disease. Subjects with a T-score of less
             than -1.0 will be excluded from the study.

          -  Congenital lumbar spinal stenosis.

          -  Bony lumbar stenosis.

          -  Extreme obesity, as defined by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Guidelines
             Body Mass Index (BMI &gt; 40kg/m2).

          -  A history of any surgical procedure intended to remove or alter the disc (e.g.
             discectomy, intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET) or enzymes), decompress
             (laminectomy) or fuse, either the index or adjacent levels.

          -  Prior participation in study of any investigational spinal implant or investigational
             spinal treatment.
