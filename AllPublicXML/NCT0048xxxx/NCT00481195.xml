  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if armodafinil treatment, at a dosage of
      150 mg/day, is more effective than placebo treatment as adjunctive therapy for adults who are
      experiencing a major depressive episode associated with Bipolar I Disorder and who are
      inadequately responsive to their current treatment for a current major depressive episode.

    <description>CGI-BP is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment which allows the clinician to rate the bipolar illness at various time points compared with baseline. At Screening and Baseline visits the physician rated the severity of the illness using 7 categories (1=normal through 7=very severely ill). At subsequent visits the clinician assessed the change in severity of the condition using 7 categories (1=very much improved through 7=very much worse). Subjects were considered responders if they had a rating of &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot;. The number of responders at Endpoint are presented.</description>

    <description>Patients were randomly assigned to begin oral treatment with armodafinil, which was titrated to 150 mg/day (3 tablets). Armodafinil was titrated up to the target dosage of 150 mg/day (daily dose was administered each morning). Patients began taking blinded armodafinil at a dose of 50 mg/day (1 tablet) on the day following the baseline visit. Doses were increased by 50 mg/day (1 tablet) to a dose of 100 mg/day on Day 2 and 3, and then again by 50 mg /day on day 4 for a target dose of 150 mg/day. Following titration, patients continued taking 150 mg/day of armodafinil for the duration of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate (recurrent or persistent adverse events) the study drug, 1 reduction in dosage (ie, minimum dosage 100 mg/day [2 tablets]) was allowed. The dosage could not be increased after it was decreased.</description>

          <description>Armodafinil was titrated up to the target dosage of 150 mg/day (daily dose was administered each morning). Patients began taking blinded armodafinil at a dose of 50 mg/day (1 tablet) on the day following the baseline visit. Doses were increased by 50 mg/day (1 tablet) to a dose of 100 mg/day on Day 2 and 3, and then again by 50 mg /day on day 4 for a target dose of 150 mg/day. Following titration, patients continued taking 150 mg/day of armodafinil for the duration of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate (recurrent or persistent adverse events) the study drug, 1 reduction in dosage (ie, minimum dosage 100 mg/day [2 tablets]) was allowed. The dosage could not be increased after it was decreased.</description>

        <title>The Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint (Week 8 or Last Observation After Baseline) in the 30 Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Clinician Rated (IDS C30)</title>
        <description>The IDS C30 is a standardized 30 item, clinician rated scale to assess the severity of a patient’s depressive symptoms. The scale uses the 9 symptom domains of the DSM-IV criteria to measure symptom severity. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum score of 84. The higher the score the more severe the symptoms of depression. The data presented here summarizes the change from baseline to Endpoint (either week 8 or the last observation after baseline) in the total score of the IDS-C30.</description>

Study drug was titrated up to the target dosage of 3 tablets / day (daily dose was administered each morning). Patients began taking blinded study drug at a dose of 1 tablet daily on the day following the baseline visit. Doses were increased by 1 tablet to a dose of 2 tablets/day on Day 2 and 3, and then again by 1 tablet /day on day 4 for a target dose of 3 tablets/day. Following titration, patients continued taking 3 tablets/day of study drug for the duration of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate (recurrent or persistent adverse events) the study drug, 1 reduction in dosage (ie, minimum dosage 2 tablets/day) was allowed.

          <title>Number of Patients Achieving Remission at Endpoint According to the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician-Rated (IDS-C30)</title>
          <description>The IDS C30 is a standardized 30 item, clinician rated, scale to assess the severity of a patient’s depressive symptoms. The scale uses the 9 symptom domains of the DSM-IV criteria to measure symptom severity. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum score of 84. The higher the score the more severe the symptoms of depression. The data here summarizes the number of subjects in each treatment group who achieved a remission (total score &lt;=11).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint (Week 8 or Last Observation After Baseline) on 30 Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Clinician Rated (IDS C30) Combination of Items 1-3</title>
        <description>The IDS C30 is a standardized 30 item, clinician rated, scale to assess the severity of a patient’s depressive symptoms. The scale uses the 9 symptom domains of the DSM-IV criteria to measure symptom severity. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum score of 84. The higher the score the more severe the symptoms of depression. Items 1 - 3 assess sleep onset insomnia, mid-nocturnal insomnia, and early morning insomnia respectively each on a 0 - 3 scale. The data presented here summarizes the change from baseline to Endpoint in the combined score of these three items assessing insomnia.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 on 30 Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Clinician Rated (IDS C30) - Item 4</title>
        <description>The IDS C30 is a standardized 30 item, clinician rated, scale to assess the severity of a patient’s depressive symptoms. The scale uses the 9 symptom domains of the DSM-IV criteria to measure symptom severity. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum score of 84. The higher the score the more severe the symptoms of depression. Item 4 assesses hypersomnia on a scale from 0 (sleeps no longer than 7-8 hours a night) to 3 (sleeps longer than 12 hours in 24 hour period). The data presented here summarizes the change from baseline to week 4 in the score of Item 4 assessing hypersomnia.</description>

        <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale to evaluate the overall severity of a patient's depressive symptoms, that is completed by the physician. The rating scale makes use of both observational clues as to the subject's level of depression (eg. apparent sadness) and verbal indicators of depression expressed by the patient. Each of the 10 items is graded on a 6-point scale with anchors at 2 point intervals. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with the higher number indicating more severe symptoms of depression.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale to evaluate the overall severity of a patient's depressive symptoms, that is completed by the physician. The rating scale makes use of both observational clues as to the subject's level of depression (eg. apparent sadness) and verbal indicators of depression expressed by the patient. Each of the 10 items is graded on a 6-point scale with anchors at 2 point intervals. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with the higher number indicating more severe symptoms of depression. Here we present data summarizing the difference in MADRS score from Baseline to Week 8.</description>

            <description>Armodafinil was titrated up to the target dosage of 150 mg/day (daily dose was administered each morning). Patients began taking blinded armodafinil at a dose of 50 mg/day (1 tablet) on the day following the baseline visit. Doses were increased by 50 mg/day (1 tablet) to a dose of 100 mg/day on Day 2 and 3, and then again by 50 mg /day on day 4 for a target dose of 150 mg/day. Following titration, patients continued taking 150 mg/day of armodafinil for the duration of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate (recurrent or persistent adverse events) the study drug, 1 reduction in dosage (ie, minimum dosage 100 mg/day [2 tablets]) was allowed. The dosage could not be increased after it was decreased.</description>

        <description>The Q-LES-Q-SF is an instrument designed to measure general activities of daily living. It is a patient-rated quality of life questionnaire and consists of 16 items, but only the first 14 are included in the total score. Each item is rated by the patient on a scale from 1 - 5 (1=very poor, 2=poor, 3=fair, 4=good, and 5=very good). The minimum score is 14 and the maximum score is 70, with lower scores indicating poorer quality of life.

            <description>Armodafinil was titrated up to the target dosage of 150 mg/day (daily dose was administered each morning). Patients began taking blinded armodafinil at a dose of 50 mg/day (1 tablet) on the day following the baseline visit. Doses were increased by 50 mg/day (1 tablet) to a dose of 100 mg/day on Day 2 and 3, and then again by 50 mg /day on day 4 for a target dose of 150 mg/day. Following titration, patients continued taking 150 mg/day of armodafinil for the duration of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate (recurrent or persistent adverse events) the study drug, 1 reduction in dosage (ie, minimum dosage 100 mg/day [2 tablets]) was allowed. The dosage could not be increased after it was decreased.</description>

Patients began taking blinded armodafinil at a dose of 50 mg/day (1 tablet) on the day following the baseline visit. Doses were increased by 50 mg/day (1 tablet) to a dose of 100 mg/day on Day 2 and 3, and then again by 50 mg /day on day 4 for a target dose of 150 mg/day. Following titration, patients continued taking 150 mg/day of armodafinil for the duration of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate (recurrent or persistent adverse events) the study drug, 1 reduction in dosage (ie, minimum dosage 100 mg/day [2 tablets]) was allowed. The dosage could not be increased after it was decreased.</description>

        <description>CGI-BP is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment which allows the clinician to rate the bipolar illness at various time points compared with baseline. At Screening and Baseline visits the physician rated the severity of the illness using 7 categories (1=normal through 7=very severely ill). At subsequent visits the clinician assessed the change in severity of the condition using 7 categories (1=very much improved through 7=very much worse). Subjects were considered responders if they had a rating of &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot;. The number of responders at Endpoint are presented.</description>

At Screening and Baseline visits the physician rated the severity of the illness using 7 categories (1=normal through 7=very severely ill). At subsequent visits the clinician assessed the change in severity of the condition using 7 categories (1=very much improved through 7=very much worse). Subjects were considered responders if they had a rating of &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot;. The number of responders at Week 2 are presented.</description>

            <description>Armodafinil was titrated up to the target dosage of 150 mg/day (daily dose was administered each morning). Patients began taking blinded armodafinil at a dose of 50 mg/day (1 tablet) on the day following the baseline visit. Doses were increased by 50 mg/day (1 tablet) to a dose of 100 mg/day on Day 2 and 3, and then again by 50 mg /day on day 4 for a target dose of 150 mg/day. Following titration, patients continued taking 150 mg/day of armodafinil for the duration of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate (recurrent or persistent adverse events) the study drug, 1 reduction in dosage (ie, minimum dosage 100 mg/day [2 tablets]) was allowed. The dosage could not be increased after it was decreased.</description>

        <title>The Number of Responders According to the Clinical Global Impression of Change – Bipolar Version (CGI BP) Measure of Depression at Week 8</title>
        <description>CGI-BP is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment which allows the clinician to rate the bipolar illness at various time points compared with baseline. At Screening and Baseline visits the physician rated the severity of the illness using 7 categories (1=normal through 7=very severely ill). At subsequent visits the clinician assessed the change in severity of the condition using 7 categories (1=very much improved through 7=very much worse). Subjects were considered responders if they had a rating of &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot;. The number of responders at Week 8 are presented.</description>

            <description>Armodafinil was titrated up to the target dosage of 150 mg/day (daily dose was administered each morning). Patients began taking blinded armodafinil at a dose of 50 mg/day (1 tablet) on the day following the baseline visit. Doses were increased by 50 mg/day (1 tablet) to a dose of 100 mg/day on Day 2 and 3, and then again by 50 mg /day on day 4 for a target dose of 150 mg/day. Following titration, patients continued taking 150 mg/day of armodafinil for the duration of the study. If a patient was unable to tolerate (recurrent or persistent adverse events) the study drug, 1 reduction in dosage (ie, minimum dosage 100 mg/day [2 tablets]) was allowed. The dosage could not be increased after it was decreased.</description>
