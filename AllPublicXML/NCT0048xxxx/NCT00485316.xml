      The aim of the investigators' randomized trial is to compare the short-term clinical outcome
      and survival between laparoscopic-assisted and open resection of colorectal carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987, laparoscopic surgery has been
      attempted and applied to many surgical operations. Surgeons in Hong Kong began to perform
      laparoscopic surgery for colorectal carcinoma in early 1992. Early reports of laparoscopic
      surgery for colorectal carcinoma from Hong Kong and worldwide suggested better short-term
      clinical outcomes when compared with open surgery, but there were concerns over port site
      metastases and adequacy of long-term oncological clearance. Besides, only a few randomized
      trials thus far have compared laparoscopic-assisted and open surgery for rectal carcinoma.

      The aim of our randomized trial is to compare the short-term clinical outcome and survival
      between laparoscopic-assisted and open resection of colonic and rectal carcinoma.

      Patients will undergo different types of surgery according to the location of the tumors:
      right or extended right hemicolectomy for cecal, ascending colon, or hepatic flexure tumors;
      left hemicolectomy for descending colon tumors; sigmoid colectomy for sigmoid colon tumors;
      anterior resection for rectosigmoid or upper rectal tumors; low anterior resection with total
      mesorectal excision for mid- and low rectal tumors; abdominoperineal resection for very low
      rectal tumors. Patients will be randomly allocated to laparoscopic assisted or conventional
      open surgery.

      Short-term clinical outcome and long-term survival data will be prospectively recorded and
      compared between the two treatment arms.
