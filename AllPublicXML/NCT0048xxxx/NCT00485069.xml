  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ropinirole Hydrochloride (ROP) was granted approval for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease
      (PD) on 20 October 2006.

      ROP is expected to be used for a long term in clinical practice. However, no long-term
      clinical data with ROP administered three times daily are currently available from Japanese
      patients, and the clinical experience with ROP at &gt;10mg/day is limited.

      For this reason, this study was designed as a multicenter open-label uncontrolled study.

      This study will evaluate the long-term efficacy (Japanese Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Scale (UPDRS), Awake time spent &quot;Off&quot;/&quot;On&quot;, Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage, Schwab-England
      scale, Proportion of subjects remaining in this study and Clinical Global Impression (CGI))
      and the long-term safety of ROP administered three times daily for in PD patients.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52, and FAP (up to Week 52)</time_frame>
    <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients objectively. Part III assesses motor examination on 27 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. &quot;On&quot; state is where PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. Participants with &quot;off&quot; state at baseline or without post-baseline data were not included in the ROP+L-dopa group at FAP. These participants as well as one with &quot;off&quot; state at Week 52 and those prematurely withdrawn were not included at Week 52.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>52 weeks of Treatment Phase, consisting of 4 weeks of Fixed Titration Phase and 48 weeks of Flexible Titration and Maintenance Phase, was started after 1 to 4 weeks of Screening Phase. Although the results are presented by participants with and without L-dopa, this study was a single-arm design, and L-dopa was not the investigational product.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received ropinirole hydrochloride (ROP) tablets 3 times daily. In the 4-week Fixed Titration Phase (from Week 0 as Baseline), the dose started at 0.75 milligrams (mg)/day and was increased weekly by 0.75 mg/day up to 3.0 mg/day. In the 48-week Flexible Titration and Maintenance Phase, the dose was increased by 1.5 mg/day at intervals of at least 1 week up to a maximum of 15.0 mg/day. The dose was maintained at a level without further symptomatic improvement expected. The dosing regimen of L-dopa remained unchanged from 4 weeks prior to the start of the Screening Phase throughout the study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Japanese Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III Total Score (in &quot;On&quot; State for the ROP+L-Dopa Group) at Week 52 and Final Assessment Point (FAP)</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients objectively. Part III assesses motor examination on 27 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. &quot;On&quot; state is where PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug.

        <title>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part II Total Score at Week 52 and FAP by &quot;On&quot;/&quot;Off&quot; State in the ROP+L-Dopa Group</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD patients objectively. Part II assesses activities of daily living on 13 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 52 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. &quot;On&quot; state is where PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. &quot;Off&quot; state is where PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. Percent change from baseline was calculated as (change from baseline score/baseline score) * 100; change from baseline was calculated as thescore at the observation day minus the baseline score.</description>

            <description>Participants received ROP tablets 3 times daily. In the 4-week Fixed Titration Phase (from Week 0 as Baseline), the dose started at 0.75 mg/day was increased weekly by 0.75 mg/day up to 3.0 mg/day. In the 48-week Flexible Titration and Maintenance Phase, the dose was increased by 1.5 mg/day at intervals at least 1 week up to a maximum of 15.0 mg/day. The dose was maintained at a level without further symptomatic improvement expected. Concomitant use of L-dopa was prohibited during the study.</description>

        <description>The Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale Score is measured as percentage, from 100% (Completely independent. Able to do all chores without slowness, difficulty or impairment. Essentially normal. Unaware of any difficulty) to 0% (Vegetative functions such as swallowing, bladder and bowel functions are not functioning. Bedridden).</description>

        <population>FAS. LOCF was used for the FAP data. Some participants were not included at FAP as having no post-baseline data in &quot;on&quot; state, not having &quot;off&quot; state at baseline in &quot;off&quot; state, or having no data in the corresponding state at Week 52/withdrawal. These participants as well as those prematurely withdrawn were not included at Week 52.</population>

In the 48-week Flexible Titration and Maintenance Phase, the dose was increased by 1.5 mg/day at intervals at least 1 week up to a maximum of 15.0 mg/day. The dose was maintained at a level without further symptomatic improvement expected.
