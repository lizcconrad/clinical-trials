  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab has recently been shown to improve survival when combined with chemotherapy in
      patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. Bevacizumab is usually given
      together with infusional 5-FU, which requires a central line. A central line is inconvenient
      for patients, and may increase risk of infection, and thrombosis. Furthermore, a central line
      increases resource demands for interventional radiology, chemo daycare. Capecitabine is
      administered orally, and converted to 5-FU intracellularly. Chronic administration of
      capecitabine mimics infusional 5-FU. This study is designed to evaluate whether the
      combination of irinotecan, capecitabine and bevacizumab is effective as a first-line therapy
      for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      The FOLFIRI regimen has become the standard 1st line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer
      in Canada. This regimen consists of irinotecan in combination with bolus 5-FU/leucovorin,
      followed by 46-hour infusional 5-FU every 2 weeks. It requires a central line and an infusion
      pump for delivering 5-FU, and necessitates at least 2 visits to the chemotherapy units every
      2 weeks, which not only incurs additional cost and inconvenience to patients, but also
      increases the risk of complications such as thrombosis and infection due to the central line.
      In addition, due to resources limitations, patients often have to wait several weeks for
      central line placement. The XELIRI (irinotecan and capecitabine) regimen has been in use at
      the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer since May, 2003. The choice of XELIRI over FOLFIRI was made in efforts to
      reduce demands on resources, enable patients to start therapy sooner, increase patient
      convenience and potentially reduce complications associated with central venous access. The
      regimen consists of irinotecan 250 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 PO BID from
      days 1-14 every 3 weeks. The dose was reduced to irinotecan 200 mg/m2 on day 1 and
      capecitabine 750 mg/m2 in patients &gt; 65 years old or in patients with renal impairment. So
      far, 101 patients have been treated on this regimen at PMH. Among 76 patients evaluable for
      response, there have been 34 confirmed partial responses (44.7%) and a further 18 patients
      with stable disease (23.7%), for a disease control rate of 68.4%. Furthermore, this regimen
      was well tolerated with main side effects being diarrhea and neutropenia. With availability
      of bevacizumab, 12 patients were treated with the XELIRI regimen in combination with
      bevacizumab at PMH as part of the BEAT (Bevcizumab Expanded Access Trial ) study up to
      October, 2005. Of 10 patients who were treated with 3 or more cycles of chemotherapy, there
      were 7 confirmed partial responses and 2 additional patients with stable disease. One patient
      with non-measurable but evaluable disease had marked reduction in infiltration in the sacrum.
      There were no instances of GI perforation, febrile neutropenia, or toxic death. The median
      number of cycles of treatment was 6, and 9 of 12 patients are still receiving treatment.
      There were, however, a total of 8 dose reductions of capecitabine in 6 patients, with
      majority of dose reductions as a result of hand-foot syndrome. Although these efficacy and
      toxicity data are extremely encouraging, the small number of patients limits the potential
      application of these data.Because of the encouraging preliminary results, it is necessary to
      conduct a prospective clinical study to further evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of
      irinotecan, capecitabine and bevacizumab combination (the XELIRI-A regimen) as first-line
      chemotherapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Results from this study would
      provide the scientific basis for a randomized phase III study to compare the XELIRI-A regimen
      to the IFL (FOLFIRI) + bevacizumab regimen. Furthermore, it will have practical implications
      for our centre. Compared to infusional or bolus 5-FU based regimens, the XELIRI-A regimen
      will reduce workload in the chemotherapy daycare unit and drug costs, reduce demands for
      resources such as infusion pumps and interventional radiology time, enable patients to start
      therapy sooner, and improve patient convenience.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal cancer which
             is recurrent or metastatic, and not amendable to surgical resection or radiation.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20
             mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 11.2 for
             the evaluation of measurable disease.

          -  Patients must have had no previous chemotherapy or treatment with an investigational
             agent for recurrent or metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting
             for colorectal cancer is acceptable. Prior surgery or radiotherapy for recurrent or
             metastatic disease is acceptable, however, patients must be adequately recovered from
             the effects of these treatments. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed from major surgery
             and 4 weeks must have elapsed from any radiation therapy.

          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine and irinotecan in patients &lt;18
             years of age, children are excluded from this study.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2 (or Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A).

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        hemoglobin &gt;/= 90 g/L total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x upper limit of normal AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)
        &lt;/= 2.5 x upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine
        clearance &gt;/= 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional
        normal proteinuria &lt; 2+ on dipstick patients with &gt;/= 2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick at
        baseline should undergo a 24-hour urine collection, and must have &lt;/= 1g protein / 24 hours

          -  Appropriate imaging investigations, including chest X-rays and / or CT/MRI of chest /
             abdomen / pelvis or other scans as clinically indicated to document all sites of
             disease must be performed within 28 days of study entry.

          -  The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because antiangiogenic agents as
             well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration
             of study and for a period of four weeks after cessation of study therapy. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she must inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid malignancies
             curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known metastases in the central nervous system.

          -  Any condition that does not permit compliance with the study protocol

          -  Previous history of gastrointestinal perforation, uncontrolled gastrointestinal
             bleeding, uncontrolled thromboembolism

          -  Presence of uncontrolled hypertension and / or proteinuria. Patients must have
             systolic blood pressure ≤ 150 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg, and be on
             stable blood pressure medication at the time of study entry. Patients discovered to
             have ≥ 1+ proteinuria at baseline, should undergo a 24-hour urine collection and must
             have &lt; 500 mg of protein / 24 hours.

          -  History of allergic reactions, or intolerance, attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, or bevacizumab.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded from this study because
             bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with bevacizumab,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with bevacizumab. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the agents used in this study. In
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Patients with active cardiovascular disease, i.e., unstable angina, New York Heart
             Association grade II or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring medications, or grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease. In
             addition, patients with arterial thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and cerebral
             vascular accidents (stroke / transient ischemic attach (TIA)) within 6 months prior to
             study entry will be excluded.

          -  Patients who had major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury
             within 28 days prior to the first study treatment, or anticipation of need for major
             surgical procedure during the course of the study; minor surgical procedures within 7
             days prior to study treatment start.

          -  Planned radiotherapy for underlying disease.

          -  Serious non-healing wound or ulcer.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Current or recent (within 10 days prior to study treatment start) use of full dose
             oral or intravenous anticoagulants or thrombolytic agents. Patients on low molecular
             weight heparins are allowed to participate in the study. Patients with anticoagulation
             for maintenance of patency of permanent indwelling intravenous catheters will be
             eligible. However, INR should be monitored closely if patients are taking low-dose
             coumadin for this purpose.

          -  Ongoing treatment with aspirin ( &gt; 325 mg/day) or other medications known to
             predispose to gastrointestinal ulceration.

          -  Patients who have received prior radiation therapy to &gt; 15% of bone marrow (see
             Appendix D), or standard pelvic radiation for rectal cancer.

          -  Patients with predisposing colonic or small bowel disorders in which symptoms are
             uncontrolled as indicated by pre-treatment/baseline pattern of &gt; 3 loose stools daily
             in patients without a colostomy or ileostomy. Patients with a colostomy or ileostomy
             may be entered as the investigator's discretion.

          -  Patients with partial or complete bowel obstruction, known chronic malabsorption,
             total colectomy or other major abdominal surgery that might result in substantial
             alteration in absorption of oral medications.

          -  Patients with known Gilbert's syndrome.

          -  Patients who were started on phenytoid, phenobarbital, carbamazepine or any other
             enzyme-inducing anti-convulsant drug (EIACD) within 7 days prior to the first study
             treatment or patients who are unable or unwilling to discontinue EIACD use or switch
             to a non-EIACD at least 7 days prior to the first study treatment. Concomitant use of
             gabapentin or other non-EIACDs is permitted.
