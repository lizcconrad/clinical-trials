    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the burden of RV GE. The study will focus on children
      hospitalized for severe RV GE, Children acquiring RV GE in the hospital and the household
      contacts of children hospitalized with RV GE. It is expected to enrol 500-600 subjects in the
      study. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act,
      Sep 2007.
