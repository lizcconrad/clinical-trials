      To provide safety and effectiveness information for Rapamune during the post-marketing period
      as required by Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) regulations in order to identify any
      potential drug related treatment factors in the Korean population, such as:

        1. Unknown adverse reactions, especially serious adverse reactions

        2. To assess the incidence of adverse reactions under the routine drug uses

        3. Factors that may affect the safety of the drug (e.g., proteinuria)

        4. Factors that may affect the effectiveness of the drug

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)/Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), Serious AEs (SAEs)/Serious ADRs (SADRs), Unexpected AEs/ADRs, and Unexpected SAEs/SADRs</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months (±1 month) after initiating Rapamune administration or until completion of Rapamune administration, whichever was earlier.</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs reported after the start of administration of Rapamune were considered as treatment-emergent AEs and summarized. All AEs, except for those with causal relationship to the study drug assessed as &quot;unlikely&quot;, were considered as AEs whose causal relationship to the study drug could not be excluded and classified as ADRs. Unexpected AEs/ADRs were classified by medical review with reference to the local product document and confirmed by Pfizer.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significent Abnormal Laboratory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months (±1 month) after initiating Rapamune administration or until completion of Rapamune administration, whichever was earlier.</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory test was not mandatory because this study was a non-interventional study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Biopsy-Confirmed Acute Rejection Using Banff 09 Diagnostic Categories for Renal Allograft Biopsies</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months (±1 month) after initiating Rapamune administration or at the time of completion of Rapamune administration, whichever was earlier.</time_frame>
    <description>Renal biopsy was required to confirm the diagnosis of acute rejection. However, due to the non-interventional nature of this study, biopsy could not be mandatory. The decision of whether to perform a biopsy was made at the discretion of the investigator and the result was collected if performed.</description>

    <time_frame>At 6 months (±1 month) after initiating Rapamune administration or at the time of completion of Rapamune administration, whichever was earlier.</time_frame>
    <description>Graft survival was defined as not showing graft loss at the time of evaluation.</description>
