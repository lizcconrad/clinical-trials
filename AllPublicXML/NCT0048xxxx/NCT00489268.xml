  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in 2 serial phases (dosimetry phase and effectiveness phase) to
      evaluate a balloon-based ablation device (HALO360) that delivers a pre-set amount of energy
      density (J/cm2) to barrett's tissue. The dosimetry phase evaluated the dose-response and the
      safety of delivering 6 to 12 J/cm2. The effectiveness phase used 10 J/cm2 delivered twice for
      all patients, followed by Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies at 1, 3, 6, and 12
      months. A second ablation procedure was performed if Barretts esophagus (BE) was present at 1
      or 3 months. A complete response (CR) was defined as all biopsy specimens negative for
      Barrett's Esophagus at 12 months. The effectiveness phase of the present study was extended
      to a 2.5-year follow-up. This trial incorporated an opportunity for persistent BE to be
      treated with a focal ablation device (HALO90), achieving a CR in 98.4% of patients by the
      2.5-year follow-up,the results of which were published . There is ample evidence that
      RadioFrequency Ablation (RFA) for Barrett's esophagus is effective and safe. Having
      additional follow-up (5 years) would add valuable information to the literature, thus aiding
      the physician in making patient management decisions about the appropriate follow-up interval
      after RFA.

      This study is intended to gather additional information regarding the performance of a
      bipolar balloon electrode device (HALO360) utilizing radiofrequency (RF) energy in the
      micro-layer ablation of Barrett's esophagus, a precancerous, metaplastic change in the
      esophageal lining. The device has received 510(k) clearance for specific indications,
      including the treatment of Barrett's esophagus.

      This study is conducted in two phases and is intended to further evaluate the effect of
      micro-layer ablation of Barrett's metaplasia using a 510(k) cleared, bipolar, balloon
      electrode device. Phase I (n=30) is intended to provide additional information regarding the
      effects of three randomized treatment parameters (energy settings, Joules/cm2). Phase II
      (n=70) is intended to provide additional information regarding the effects of the optimal
      technique and energy density settings (Joules/cm2) determined from the 1-month endoscopy
      results of Phase I. Phase 2 primary endpoint was histological clearance of Barrett's (%
      patients). This trial incorporated an opportunity for persistent BE to be treated with a
      focal ablation device (HALO90), at the 2.5-year follow-up, achieving a CR in 98.4% of
      patients. Having additional follow-up (5 years) would add valuable information to the
      literature, thus aiding the physician in making patient management decisions about the
      appropriate follow-up interval after RFA. This study will allow collection of 5-year
      follow-up biopsies and, thereafter, offer RFA for any subject with persistent Barrett's.

      Upon approval of the present amendment to the protocol (B-200-5 year extension) and the
      informed consent form (ICF) at each study site, subjects who participated in B-200-2.5 year
      extension and had a biopsy at 2.5 years after initial enrollment will be offered
      participation in this extension.

          <description>The HALO System is an option for eradication of the diseased epithelium of all three subclasses of Barrett's esophagus (non-dysplastic Intestinal Metaplasia (IM), Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD) and High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD). The HALO Systems include the circumferential HALO360 Ablation System and the focal HALO90. The Ablation Catheter and Energy Generator work together to deliver energy to the tissue resulting in tissue coagulation. The HALO360 System is designed for longer segment diseased tissue (2 cm or greater) or as an initial treatment to ensure all Barrett’s tissue or buried Barrett’s glands are eliminated within the zone of intestinal metaplasia. The HALO90 System is designed for short segment Barrett’s (2 cm or less) or for follow-up treatment for small Barrett’s islands and tongues. In this group, subjects were randomized to the energy density group of 6 J/cm^2. They received a dose of 6 J/cm^2 during the course of this study.</description>

          <description>The HALO System is an option for eradication of the diseased epithelium of all three subclasses of Barrett's esophagus (non-dysplastic IM, LGD and HGD. The HALO Systems include the circumferential HALO360 Ablation System and the focal HALO90. The Ablation Catheter and Energy Generator work together to deliver energy to the tissue resulting in tissue coagulation. The HALO360 System is designed for longer segment diseased tissue (2 cm or greater) or as an initial treatment to ensure all Barrett’s tissue or buried Barrett’s glands are eliminated within the zone of intestinal metaplasia. The HALO90 System is designed for short segment Barrett’s (2 cm or less) or for follow-up treatment for small Barrett’s islands and tongues. In this group, subjects were randomized to the energy density group of 6 J/cm^2. They received a dose of 6 J/cm^2 during the course of this study.</description>

The HALO360 System is designed for longer segment diseased tissue (2 cm or greater) or as an initial treatment to ensure all Barrett’s tissue or buried Barrett’s glands are eliminated within the zone of intestinal metaplasia. The HALO90 System is designed for short segment Barrett’s (2 cm or less) or for follow-up treatment for small Barrett’s islands and tongues. In this group, subjects were randomized to the energy density group of 6 J/cm^2. They received a dose of 6 J/cm^2 during the course of this study.</description>

          <description>The HALO System is an option for eradication of the diseased epithelium of all three subclasses of Barrett's esophagus (non-dysplastic IM, LGD and HGD. The HALO Systems include the circumferential HALO360 Ablation System and the focal HALO90. The Ablation Catheter and Energy Generator work together to deliver energy to the tissue resulting in tissue coagulation. The HALO360 System is designed for longer segment diseased tissue (2 cm or greater) or as an initial treatment to ensure all Barrett’s tissue or buried Barrett’s glands are eliminated within the zone of intestinal metaplasia. The HALO90 System is designed for short segment Barrett’s (2 cm or less) or for follow-up treatment for small Barrett’s islands and tongues. In this group, subjects were randomized to the energy density group of 12 J/cm^2. They received a dose of 12 J/cm^2 during the course of this study.</description>
