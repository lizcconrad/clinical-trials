    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study of a cognitive-behavioral therapy known as anger control training in
      adolescents with Tourette Syndrome and explosive, disruptive behavior. ACT is compared to
      treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study of a cognitive-behavioral, anger control training (ACT)
      in adolescents with Tourette Syndrome (TS) complicated by disruptive behavior. Disruptive
      behaviors in TS may take numerous forms including noncompliance, anger outbursts, and
      physical aggression. Anger outbursts in TS have been described as rage attacks or rage storms
      due to their high intensity and unpredictability in response to minimal provocation. Whether
      these behaviors are part of TS, related to comorbid conditions, or due to the burden of
      chronic illness is not clear. Nevertheless, these disruptive behaviors can result in
      significant functional impairment and often require clinical attention. The purpose of the
      ACT intervention is to improve the explosive and noncompliant behavior in adolescents with TS
      by enhancing affect regulation and social problem-solving skills. The treatment is based on
      anger control training which has been empirically supported for reducing aggressive behaviors
      and improving social functioning in aggressive youths. The primary outcome measures include
      the parent-rated Oppositional Defiant Scale and the Clinicians Global Improvement Score
      assessed by a clinician blind to treatment assignment.
