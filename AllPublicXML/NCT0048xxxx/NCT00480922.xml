  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a recent increase in incidence of obesity and its associated morbidities,
      including T2 DM, hypertension and hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis is a precursor to
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. The 1st reported case
      of pediatric hepatic steatosis was in 1980 and it is now affects 30-77% of overweight
      children. In addition to its association with obesity, hepatic steatosis has been associated
      with the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and post-prandial hyperglycemia. Current
      treatment of hepatic steatosis includes weight loss with a hypocaloric low fat diet. Given
      the association with insulin resistance and post-prandial hyperglycemia, adult patients with
      hepatic steatosis that does not respond to weight loss are placed on insulin sensitizing
      drugs. We hypothesize that weight loss with a diet designed to decrease insulin resistance
      and post-prandial hyperglycemia, a low glycemic load diet, will provide a safe and effective
      way to decrease hepatic fat content in the pediatric population. This hypothesis will be
      tested with a randomized control trial comparing the effect of a low fat diet with a low
      glycemic load diet.
