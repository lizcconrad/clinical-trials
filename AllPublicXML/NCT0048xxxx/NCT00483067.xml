      Primary Objectives:

        1. To determine the response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of
           patients who receive 2-CdA + Ara-C.

        2. To examine if there is any clonality in the cytokine expression of helper T cells or
           cytokine receptor expression of eosinophils.

        3. To determine the effect of 2-CdA on accumulation of Ara-C triphosphate in eosinophils.

      Before the study begins, patients will have a physical exam, blood tests, and urine tests.
      Women will have a pregnancy test. A bone marrow sample will be taken. This is done with a
      large needle. Heart tests and an MRI scan of the brain will be done if there is a suspicion
      of disease in the heart or central nervous system.

      Patients in this study must have a catheter (thin tube) placed in a vein in the arm or under
      the collarbone. This tube will be left in place throughout the study. 2-CdA (Cladribine) will
      be given through the catheter 24 hours a day on days 2 to 6. Ara-C (Cytarabine) will be given
      through the catheter over 2 hours on days 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Starting on day 9, patients will
      inject G-CSF under their skin once a day; G-CSF helps blood counts return to normal.
      Treatment will be given on an inpatient or outpatient basis. The first course is normally
      done inpatient.

      During the study, patients will have blood tests daily during the first week and every other
      day after that. Bone marrow samples will be taken on days 14, 21, and 28. Further bone marrow
      samples may be necessary to evaluate response. Heart tests and MRI scans of the brain may be
      done.

      This is an investigational study. G-CSF, 2-CdA, and Cytarabine are approved by the FDA for
      treatment of cancer. Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. Patients will be treated
      at M. D. Anderson or other centers. A total of 40 people will take part in this study. About
      1 patient every 3 months will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
