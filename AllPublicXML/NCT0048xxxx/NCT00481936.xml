      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VB6-845 and to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of VB6-845 when administered as a monotherapy IV
      infusion to patients with advanced solid tumour of epithelial origin.

      The primary study objective of this Phase 1 trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of VB6-845 and evaluate the safety and tolerability of VB6-845 when administered as a
      monotherapy intravenous (IV) infusion (over 3 hours), once weekly in 4-week cycles, to
      subjects with EpCAM positive advanced solid tumours of epithelial origin.

      Secondary objectives included evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of
      VB6-845 and assessing exploratory efficacy of VB6-845.

      Dose cohorts of 3-6 subjects with EpCAM positive advanced solid tumours of epithelial origin
      are to be entered into the study. The starting dose is defined as 1.00 mg/kg, which is 1/10
      of the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) reached in preclinical studies. Doses are to
      be escalated according to the modified Fibonacci design until 2 out of 3 or 2 out of 6
      subjects experienced a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT). The MTD is to be reached when &lt;2 out of
      6 subjects experienced a DLT. An additional 12 subjects are to be enrolled at the MTD for
      further characterization of VB6-845 at that level.

      Regardless of dose cohort, subjects are to continue to receive treatment until an
      unacceptable toxicity occurred, all lesions completely disappeared or disease progression is
      determined.

    <description>Patients will be treated with VB6-845 as a monotherapy IV infusion, once weekly in 4-week cycles. Patients will continue to receive treatment up until the treatment stopping criteria or patient withdrawal criteria are met.
Dose escalation will begin at a dose level of 1.00 mg/kg. Doses will be escalated according to the modified Fibonacci design with dose multipliers of 2.00, 1.67, 1.50, 1.40, and 1.33.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Disease Characteristics:

          -  The patient must have locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumour of epithelial
             origin for which standard therapy has failed or does not exist;

          -  The patient must have immunohistochemically-confirmed EpCAM positive disease;

        Patient Characteristics:

          -  The patient must be male or female 18 years of age or older;

          -  The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             ≤ 2 and life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          -  The patient must have adequate organ function, as defined by the protocol

          -  Female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of the study drug;

        Other:

          -  The patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an Institutional Review
             Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved informed consent document
             indicating that the patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed
             of all pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment

          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, the treatment
             plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has had treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks, or
             treatment with radiation therapy to a visceral organ, immunotherapy, biological
             therapy, or chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication

             surgically sterile, agree to use double barrier contraception, or commit to abstinence
             during the period of therapy; male patients will be required to be surgically sterile,
             use double barrier contraception, or commit to abstinence during the period of therapy

          -  The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness or social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
