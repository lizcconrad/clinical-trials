  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of protected early weightbearing (PEWB)
      compared to non-weightbearing (NWB) after surgery for an Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) on
      health related quality of life (HRQL) in the initial six week period after surgery,
      functional recovery over time, return to work and activity and complications. We hypothesized
      that PEWB following ATR repair would result in: i) improved HRQL in the initial postoperative
      period, ii), a quicker recovery of HRQL, strength and endurance, iii) earlier return to work
      and sport, and iv) no increase in complications, such as re-rupture compared to NWB.

    <textblock>
      Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) is commonly treated with open surgical repair. Following
      surgical repair, there are a variety of protocols, ranging from complete immobilization to
      immediate postoperative mobilization with early weightbearing. However, no clear consensus
      regarding the optimal postoperative rehabilitation protocol for ATRs exists. Early
      rehabilitation after ATR has been shown to be beneficial in animal and human studies. Human
      prospective studies and randomized controlled trials have shown that early postoperative
      mobilization do not pose additional risks compared to cast immobilization, with a trend
      toward a reduction in lost work days and an earlier return to sport. However, these trials
      define early postoperative mobilization differently (i.e. use different combinations of
      weightbearing and range of motion). This makes it difficult to determine which factor in the
      early rehabilitation process plays an important role in optimizing recovery. An important
      component of early rehabilitation is weightbearing.

      Comparison: Patients weightbearing in the early rehabilitation period after surgical repair
      of the Achilles tendon compared to patients non-weightbearing after the surgical repair of
      the Achilles tendon repair. With the exception of weightbearing status, both groups performed
      the same rehabilitation program.
