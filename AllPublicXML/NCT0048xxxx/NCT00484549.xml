  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a genetic disease due to an enzymatic deficit. A screening of this disease
      allows patients to benefit from an enzyme replacement therapy and prevent the occurrence of
      life threatening manifestations such as an ischemic stroke.

      The purpose of the study is to determinate the prevalence of Fabry disease in a population of
      male patients hospitalized for an ischemic stroke.

      This study, with a screening of Fabry disease, allows the patients to make a precise
      diagnosis of their ischemic stroke and to facilitate the screening of the other members at
      the facility.
