  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify acute and chronic medical conditions that are
      identifiable early in the course of critical illness that are associated with transfer to
      another health care facility (versus to home) upon hospital discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients who survive critical illness are unable to return home upon hospital discharge
      and require prolonged or permanent care in other health care facilities. It would be useful
      to clinicians, researchers, patients, and patients' families to be able to identify early in
      the course of critical illness those patients who are at increased risk for this outcome.
      Currently, few data exist regarding the risk factors for this outcome. This study examines a
      cohort of survivors of critical illness to identify factors associated with transfer to
      another health care facility upon hospital discharge.
