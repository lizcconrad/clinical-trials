          -  Patients must have laboratory results showing no significant abnormalities
             (significant would include laboratory deviations requiring acute medical intervention
             or further medical evaluation)

          -  Patients must be of normal intelligence as assessed by the investigator (that is,
             without a general impairment of intelligence and likely, in the investigator's

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who weigh less than 22 kg or more than 70 kg at study entry

             pervasive developmental disorder

          -  Patients with a history of any seizure disorder (other than febrile seizures) or prior
             EEG abnormalities related to epilepsy, or patients who have taken (or are currently
             taking) anticonvulsants for seizure control

          -  Patients with a history of severe allergies to more than one class of medication, or
             multiple adverse drug reactions
