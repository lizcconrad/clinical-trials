          -  Patients must be considered, by the investigator, to be clinically agitated and
             appropriate candidates for treatment with IM medication. Investigator must believe
             that it is safe to administer IM olanzapine and IM comparator to the patients with
             respect to the safety profile of these drugs (including the anticholinergic properties
             of Olanzapine IM or the comparator agent)

          -  Subjects' illness must not, in the opinion of the investigator, be caused by substance
             abuse

          -  Patient must be hospitalized during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation (treatment with study drug) in a Lilly sponsored intra-muscular
             olanzapine clinical trial

          -  Serious, unstable illnesses such that death is anticipated within 1 year or intensive
             care unit hospitalization for the disease is anticipated within 6 months

          -  Have a known diagnosis of dementia of any type, as defined in the DSM-IV or DSM-IV-TR

          -  Documented history of allergic reaction to study medication(s)
