      Providing extended pain relief without the use of indwelling catheters is the basis for
      developing SKY0402. A formulation of bupivacaine, given as a single injection after surgery,
      that could provide adequate, continuous, and extended pain relief would greatly simplify
      postoperative pain management, reduce the need for repeated administration, and minimize
      break-through episodes of pain.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult Caucasian men or non-pregnant, non-lactating women between 18 and 40
             years of age, inclusive.

          2. Healthy as judged by responsible physician with no clinically significant abnormality
             identified on the medical and laboratory evaluation, including 12-lead ECG and vital
             signs.

          3. Non-smoker in the previous 3 months.

          4. Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI within the range 19-29 kg/m2,
             inclusive.

          5. At screening and Run-in period each ECG should have:

               -  Consistent sinus rhythm, (i.e. if greater than or equal to 2 ECGs are not sinusal
                  at different time points the volunteer should not be included),

               -  No clinically significant conduction disorder,

               -  PR between 120 and 230 ms,

               -  HR less than or equal to 100 beats/min and greater than or equal to 40 beats/min,

               -  QRS &lt; 120 ms,

               -  QT intervals that can be consistently analysed,

               -  QTcB less than or equal to 430 ms for males,

               -  QTcB less than or equal to 450 ms for females

             If there are outlying values in the ECGs, the consistency of these values should be
             confirmed as follows:

               -  If HR is between 40 and 44 bpm (inclusive) in 2 ECGs (of one triplicate) on more
                  than one time point during Run-in, subject should not be selected. Conversely,
                  this means that if HR is between 40 and 44 bpm at screening and/or on just one
                  time-point-triplicate during Run-in, the volunteer can be selected.

               -  If HR &lt; 40 bpm on a single occasion at screening or in Run-in period, subject
                  should not be selected,

               -  If PR interval is consistently out-of-range (&lt; 120 or &gt; 230 ms) during Run-in
                  period, i.e. in 2 out of 3 ECGs at one time point or in one ECG at more than one
                  time point, the cardiologist needs to perform a manual measurement of this value.
                  If the manual measurement confirms that PR is out-of-range, the volunteer must
                  not be selected.

               -  If QRS is consistently &gt;120 ms during run-in period, i.e. in 2 ECGs of a
                  triplicate or in 2 ECGs from 2 different time-points, the cardiologist needs to
                  perform a manual measurement of this value. If the manual measurement confirms
                  the QRS is out-of-range, the volunteer must not be selected.

               -  If QTcB is out of range (QTcB &gt;430 ms for males or &gt;450 ms for females, or
                  repeated demonstration of a QTcB interval &gt;440 ms for females) even on a single
                  occasion, it should be checked whether the heart rate is constant. If the HR is
                  not constant and if the increase in QTcB is clearly due to hysteresis (e.g. on
                  the immediate repeated ECG with consistent HR the QTcB is back to normal), then
                  the volunteer can be selected. If the HR is constant and the QTcB is still
                  out-of-range, the cardiologist needs to perform a manual measurement and
                  calculation of the QTcB. If the QTcB is normal on manual measurement, the
                  volunteer can be selected. If the QTcB is abnormal on manual measurement without
                  acceptable cause, the volunteer must not be selected, even if the QTcB is
                  outlying on one single ECG.

             The final decision to include / not include a volunteer based on protocol ECG criteria
             lies with the cardiologist assessing the Run-in ECGs.

          6. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study.

          7. The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions,
             and protocol-stated restrictions.

          8. A female subject may be entered into the study if she is:

               -  Post-menopausal female defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 2 years
                  with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. appropriate age and history of
                  vasomotor symptoms. However; if indicated, this should be confirmed by estradiol
                  and FSH levels consistent with menopause (according to local laboratory ranges).

               -  Pre-menopausal females with a documented hysterectomy (medical report
                  verification) and/or bilateral oophorectomy. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
                  only acceptable when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
                  follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Females of childbearing potential must use one of the following methods of
                  contraception:

                    -  Surgical sterilisation (tubal ligation)

                    -  use oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone, or subdermal implants

                    -  use double barrier method consisting of spermicide in addition to using a
                       condom, or having another form of contraception such as an intrauterine
