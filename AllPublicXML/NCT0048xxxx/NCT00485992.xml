  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Children's) is collaborating with Child Health Corporation
      of America (CHCA) in the nationwide effort to reduce catheter related blood stream infections
      (BSIs). &quot;As well as the human cost, central venous catheter related bloodstream infections
      significantly inflate hospital costs, mainly through increased length of stay in hospital,
      particularly in intensive care&quot; (Jones, 2006).

      The Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) is participating in this initiative by implementing
      the BSI &quot;Bundles&quot; per the CHCA guidelines. BSI &quot;bundles&quot; are a group of patient care
      practices designed to reduce BSI infection rates with implementation in patient care areas.
      The bundles include recommendations for central line maintenance including line insertion,
      dressing changes, line accesses, and monitoring for medical necessity. These bundles were
      implemented on January 16, 2006, when the BSI rate in the CICU had peaked at 18.2 (rate of
      infections per 1000 catheter days). The BSI rates historically for the past two years have
      been highly variable (see attached graph for data from Jan. 04 through Oct. 06). The target
      goal is to maintain a rate below 3.7 which has only been realized twice since the January BSI
      bundle implementation.

      Current practice for the care of central lines outlined in the BSI Bundles is based on the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines published in 2002. These
      guidelines included important changes to practice involving the use of chlorhexidine (CHG)
      containing products for improved infection prevention. CHG solutions are currently available
      as either 2% or 3.15% chlorhexidine gluconate in a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution.

      The Primary Aim is to determine if CHG is effective as an antiseptic wipe for accessing lines
      to draw blood and administer medications. Compare the effectiveness of CHG containing alcohol
      wipes (3.15% CHG/70% isopropyl alcohol) to plain alcohol in order to determine best practice
      for the CICU.

      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Children's) is collaborating with Child Health Corporation

      (BSIs).

      The Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) is participating in this initiative by implementing
      the BSI &quot;Bundles&quot; per the CHCA guidelines. BSI &quot;bundles&quot; are a group of patient care
      practices designed to reduce BSI infection rates with implementation in patient care areas.

      Multiple risk factors are assumed to contribute to the high risk and rate of infection in the
      CICU patient population.

      Many risk factors cannot be controlled, such as patient age, weight, diagnosis, etc. Hence
      the controllable risk factors are the focus for reducing BSI rates, primarily related to the
      care of central lines. This is the main focus of the BSI Bundles which are aimed at reducing
      the risks associated with the utilization of central lines.

      The primary aim is to determine if CHG is effective as an antiseptic wipe for accessing lines
      to draw blood and administer medications. Compare the effectiveness of CHG containing alcohol
      wipes (3.15% CHG/70% isopropyl alcohol) to plain alcohol in order to determine best practice
      for the CICU.

      The secondary aim is to reduce BSI rates in the CICU patient population, improving patient
      care outcomes and reducing costs of hospitalization by the resulting reduction and prevention
      of expected BSIs.
