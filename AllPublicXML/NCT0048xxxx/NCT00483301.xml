  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of Carboplatin and
      ABI-007 (Abraxane) in combination with Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) on Melanoma.

      The primary objective of this phase II multicenter trial is to:

      Measure the response rate (RR) of this combination and schedule in patients with metastatic
      melanoma

      The secondary objectives are to:

      Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in this patient population

      Determine the 1-year and median PFS of patients treated according to protocol

      Determine overall survival (OS)

      STUDY DESIGN

      This will be a Phase II study single arm study with a two-stage design with a maximum sample
      size of 43 patients, 18 in the first stage and 25 in the second stage.

      Study duration: A minimum yearly accrual of 10-15 patients/institution is expected.
      Therefore, to reach the first stage, the study will take 1.2 to 1.8 years with one
      institution, 0.6 to 0.9 years with 2 institutions, and 0.4 to 0.6 years with 3. If the study
      continues to full accrual to 43 patients, completion will take 2.9 to 4.3 years with one
      institution, 1.4 to 2.2 years with two and 0.96 to 1.43 years with three institutions.
