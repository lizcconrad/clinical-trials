      Researchers want to find out if a drug called Cipro® XR (ciprofloxacin extended-release) can
      help people with a complicated urinary tract infection caused by a kind of bacteria called
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study doctor will give Cipro XR to some people to see if it is
      safe and works to treat complicated urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. The study doctor will also gather information about using Cipro XR to treat
      complicated urinary tract infections caused by other bacteria. About 500 people with
      complicated urinary tract infections who are 18 years old and older will join this study.
      Cipro XR is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      complicated urinary tract infections and acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (inflammation of
      the kidney). The dose of Cipro XR used in this study (1000 mg a day for 7 to 14 days), has
      been shown to be safe and effective. This study is being done to gather more information on
      using this dose of Cipro XR for complicated urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, as well as by other bacteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or non-pregnant women, 18 years of age or older with a suspected complicated
             urinary tract infection with an onset of symptoms 72 hours or less prior to study
             entry

          -  Patients must present with a least one sign or symptom of a lower UTI (dysuria,
             urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain) or for spinal cord injury patients if such
             symptoms are not present, at least one of the following: fever (T &gt; 38º C or 100.4º F
             orally), onset of urinary incontinence, increased spasticity, autonomic hyperreflexia,
             increased sweating, or cloudy and odorous urine.

          -  Patients must have at least one of the underlying conditions

                  urological anatomic abnormalities

               -  Patients must have pyuria prior to enrollment (within 48 hours) defined as &gt; 10
                  leukocytes/mm3 in unspun urine by hemocytometer or &gt; 5 leukocytes/hpf in
                  resuspended sediment of centrifuged urine

               -  Patients must have one clean-catch, midstream urine culture or culture from
                  catheter (obtained using sterile technique, not from a Foley bag) that was
                  obtained within 48 hours of enrollment and had a positive results:

                       causative pathogen

                    2. If more than 1 pathogen is identified, each should be present at a colony
