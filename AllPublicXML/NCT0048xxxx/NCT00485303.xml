  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate in
      participants with advanced prostate cancer (a disease in which cells in the prostate gland
      become abnormal and start to grow uncontrollably, forming tumors).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm,
      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to evaluate the anti-tumor activities and safety of abiraterone acetate in
      participants with prostate cancer who have failed androgen deprivation and docetaxel-based
      chemotherapy. Abiraterone acetate oral tablet will be administered as a total dose of 1000
      milligram (mg) orally (by mouth) once daily after an overnight fast and
      prednisone/prednisolone will be administered as 5 mg oral tablet twice daily. Participants
      will be enrolled and treated up to 12 cycles (or longer, if they have not progressed and
      continue to benefit from treatment). The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening (14 days),
      Open-label Treatment; and follow-up (up to 60 months). Participants will be evaluated
      primarily for prostate specific antigen response according to Prostate Specific Antigen
      Working Group (PSAWG) criteria. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each cycle (of 28 days each) up to Cycle 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA response was evaluated according to Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criterion, which is, greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in PSA from Baseline during the study, which would be subsequently confirmed by a measurement that is at least 4 or more weeks after initial documentation of PSA response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate-Specific Antigen Based Progression-free Survival (PSA-PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA-PFS is defined as time to first PSA failure (that is, two consecutive increases in PSA of 50 percent and greater than or equal to 5 nanogram per milliliter, as per Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group [PSAWG] criterion) or death or the start of secondary anti-tumor therapy, whichever occurs first. If a PSA progression or death does not occur, subject will be censored at the last PSA evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7 and 10, and thereafter every third cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RAD-PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months until death or up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the interval from the date of the first dose of abiraterone acetate to the date of death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Radiographic Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7 and 10, and thereafter every third cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with radiographic objective response is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall response based on reconciled radiographic disease assessment according to RECIST Version 1.0. The CR is disappearance of all lesions. The PR is at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to PSA Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 of Cycle 1, thereafter Day 1 of each cycle up to end of study (60 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The time interval from first dose of abiraterone acetate to the date of PSA progression as defined by the Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criteria. If a PSA progression does not occur, subject will be censored at the last PSA evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Radiographic Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7 and 10, and thereafter every third cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to radiographic progression is defined as the time from first dose until the first radiographic progression date that was confirmed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shift From Baseline in Number of Participants With Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>ECOG performance status score ranges from 0 to 5 where 0=fully active, perform all pre-disease activities without restriction. 1=restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory, carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, 2=ambulatory, capable of self-care, unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than (&gt;) 50 percent of waking hours, 3=capable of limited self-care, confined to bed or chair &gt;50 percent of waking hours, 4=completely disabled, not capable of any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair and 5=dead.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7 and 10, and thereafter every third cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit was defined as an observation of at least 1 of the following: PSA response by PSAWG criteria; radiographic response by RECIST criteria; stable disease by RECIST criteria lasting 6 months; or improvement by at least 1 unit in ECOG performance status.</description>
