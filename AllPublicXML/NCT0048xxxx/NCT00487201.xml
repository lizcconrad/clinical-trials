      Background and Study Aims: Biliary strictures are a major cause of morbidity following liver
      transplantation with an overall incidence between 10 and 30 %. Up to now biliary strictures
      were dilated subsequently one to three plastic stents with a diameter of eight to ten F were
      inserted. In general, stents were exchanged in two to three months intervals over one year.
      In the present prospective controlled study, efficacy and complication rates of balloon
      dilation have been compared with dilation plus stenting.

      Patients and Methods: XY patients with high-grade biliary strictures (anastomotic and
      non-anastomotic) were enrolled in this prospective study in random order. X patients were
      treated by endoscopic balloon dilatation and Y by balloon dilatation plus plastic stent
      placement in six to eight weeks intervals. The primary end point was permanent opening of the
      biliary obstruction of 12 months. Number of endoscopic interventions and complications of the
      procedures were monitored.

      Endoscopic treatment was performed by experienced endoscopists who had each performed more
      than 1000 ERCP procedures. The procedure was performed with the patient under general
      anesthesia with propofol. A stenosis was considered to be present if the cholangiogram showed
      strictures with a narrowing of the anastomosis or the proximal donor duct site of the
      anastomosis and incomplete distal runoff of the contrast agent.

      The patients were divided into two groups: 1) balloon dilatation of the stricture, 2) balloon
      dilatation plus plastic stent placement.

      In both groups, endoscopic treatment of the patients comprised sphincterotomy, consecutive
      dilation of stenosis up to 10 F, removement of occluding material from choledochus duct using
      a balloon catheter if necessary, and repetitive balloon dilatation of the anastomosis
      stricture or of the non-anastomotic proximal donor duct stricture to 18 F at the first
      intervention and to 24 F in the following interventions.

      The second group of the patients were additionally treated by large-diameter (10 F) plastic
      stent placement after balloon dilatation. This procedure was repeated in 6 - 8 weeks
      intervals in both groups.
