  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a collaborative study by the National Cancer Institute, Columbia University, and the
      Southern Urals Biophysics Institute in Russia. It will examine the relationship of
      differences in certain genes to the development of chromosomal abnormalities in workers at
      the Mayak nuclear production plant in Ozyorsk, Russia. This population was exposed to higher
      radiation doses from external and internal sources than those received by their counterparts
      in other countries or considered permissible today. If a risk relationship is found between
      genetic differences and chromosome abnormalities, the information might be useful in studies
      designed to examine how high radiation exposures cause cancer.

      Radiation-exposed Mayak workers employed from 1948 to 1972 in the three Ozyorsk plants
      directly related to nuclear weapons production may be eligible for this study. They must have
      remained local residents in the area and estimates of their external and internal radiation
      exposures must be available.

      Participants provide a blood sample for genetic studies and answer a questionnaire that
      includes demographic information and information about their family health history, history
      of benign tumors, if any, and history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Additional
      information is collected from patients' medical records.

      Greater understanding of the role of individual variation in response to radiation exposure
      might clarify the inconsistent relationship between radiation dose, intermediate markers of
      induced DNA damage, and subsequent cancer risk. REB proposes to collaborate with Columbia
      University and the Southern Urals Biophysics Institute to elucidate the contribution of
      germline genetic variation to the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in a cohort of Russian
      nuclear workers with notable and atypical radiation exposures. Our collaborators are
      utilizing a new biodosimetry method, termed mBAND, to measure intra-chromosomal aberrations,
      a potentially useful biomarker of exposure to high linear energy transfer radiation such as
      plutonium. In addition, they will assess inter-chromosomal aberrations using mFISH
      (multicolor fluorescent insitu hybridization). As factors other than radiation dose may
      influence aberration frequency, REB proposes to add to this DOE-funded study an investigation
      of germline genetic variation in DNA repair and other genes in relation to aberration risk.
      Mayak nuclear workers (n = approximately 350) employed from 1948-72 will receive a short
      questionnaire and have a blood sample drawn while receiving routine annual medical exams.
      Germline genotype will be assessed as a risk factor for chromosome aberration frequency. In
      this study, we have the opportunity to address scientific questions regarding radiation
      carcinogenesis mechanisms at relatively little cost in a population with rare, higher dose
      exposures.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - EXPOSED POPULATION:

        Individuals eligible to be included in the 'exposed' population include all those employed
        from 1948-1972 in the three plants directly related to nuclear-weapon production (nuclear
        reactor, radiochemical production plant, plutonium production plant), who have remained
        local residents, and who have estimates of their external gamma dose and internal plutonium
        exposure.

        Some eligible workers did not have any plutonium exposure, but are still eligible to be
        included in the exposed sample due to their external radiation exposure.

        All participants are required to be cancer-free at the time of enrollment.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - EXPOSED POPULATION:

        Individuals who have a medical history of radiation therapy or a blood transfusion within
        the previous year will be excluded.

        As the sample size would not be adequate to examine their risk separately, Tartars and
        Bashkirs will not be included in the study.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - COMPARISON GROUP:

        The comparison population will be drawn from current and former workers in the auxiliary
        plants (water treatment facility and mechanical repair plant) at the Mayak facility.

        Included will be a stratified random sample of these workers who were employed from
        1948-1972, who have remained local residents, and who have estimates of their external
        gamma dose.

        Individuals selected will be frequency-matched according to age (5 year age groups) and
        gender to the exposed worker population.
