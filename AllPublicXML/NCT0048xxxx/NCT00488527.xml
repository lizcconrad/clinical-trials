  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficiency of Lantus plus combined oral hypoglycaemic agents in terms of
      respondents percentage. The respondent is defined as the person achieving a value in the
      final determination of HbA1c &lt; 7% as its absolute value and/or a decreasing in the final
      value of HbA1c of more than 12% compared with the initial value (final HbA1c vs. initial
      HbA1c).

      Describe the glycemia levels and body weight change in the two response groups, (respondents
      and non-respondents).

      Describe the adverse events Evaluate the safety of using the medication according to the
      incidence and relevance of the hypoglycemia events, (symptomatic, diurnal, nocturnal,
      severe).

      Estimate the intra-patient variability of the fasting glycemia

    <description>Patients will begin with a fixed, subcutaneous dose of insulin glargine, (10 U), in its commercial presentation, which will be adjusted week by week, according to the values of the glycemia when fasting (FBG), adding 2, 4, 6 or 8 units of insulin glargine over the following twelve weeks, during which the therapeutic objective should be attained, namely the glucose goal during fasting of 100 mg/dl (&lt;6.0 mmol/L), and the active treatment is to be continued for three more months.</description>
