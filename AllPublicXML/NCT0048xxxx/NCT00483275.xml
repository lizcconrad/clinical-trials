      Objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a multimodal therapy on the basis of
      current guidelines on fall prevention consisting of a 12-months intervention with
      Alfacalcidol and calcium, patient education and a mobility program in a group of patients 65
      years of age or older with an impaired renal function in comparison to a group receiving
      usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of falling increases with age. An impaired renal function is an additional risk
      factor. Guidelines and systematic reviews suggest, that multimodal interventions are most
      likely to control this risk. This study evaluates, if patients at high risk for falls will
      benefit from a multimodal intervention simple and feasible enough to be transferred into
      general practice. Participants will be randomized either into an intervention group or a
      control group receiving usual care.

      The multimodal intervention consists of:

        -  medication: Participants receive 1µg Alfacalcidol and 500mg Calcium daily

        -  mobility program: strength, balance and gait training twice a week for one hour

        -  patient education: a single meeting with teaching lessons on risk factors for falling
           and modes of fall prevention followed by an evaluation of the individual fall risk and
           corresponding recommendations to reduce it
