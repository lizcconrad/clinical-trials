      Background: Polyamines are essential compounds in all mammalian tissues. If tissue
      spermidine/spermine levels, however, dramatically decrease, the cellular survival is severely
      endangered. Transgenic animals, where the homeostasis of cellular polyamines can be disturbed
      and tissue spermidine/spermine levels are decreased, acute pancreatitis evolves, indicating
      pancreas to be one of the most vulnerable organs for tissue polyamine catabolism. On the
      other hand, our own data suggests that also in other models of acute experimental
      pancreatitis pancreatic polyamines are changed depending on the severity of pancreatitis in
      such a way that the more severe pancreatitis the lower are the pancreatic polyamine levels.
      Minor changes were observed also in rats undergoing sham operation only. In addition of
      pancreatic enzymes, inflammatory mediators are also involved in the pathophysiology of the
      disease. CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and Procalcitonin are useful in predicting the severity of
      the disease, combination of IL-6 and IL-10 at admission can predict organ failure with
      sensitivity of 95 %, specificity of 88 %.

      Hypothesis: Similar to experimental pancreatitis, blood polyamine changes are associated with
      acute pancreatitis also in the man. These changes are dependent on the severity of
      pancreatitis, but not on the etiology of pancreatitis. The changes are specific to acute
      pancreatitis compared with other intra-abdominal emergencies. The changes observed return to
      baseline during recovery. Furthermore, we assume that blood polyamine negatively correlates
      with IL-6, IL-8, and procalcitonin, and positively with IL-10.
