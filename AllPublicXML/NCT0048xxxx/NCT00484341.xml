    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to document the preliminary antitumor activity of two
      doses of NGR-hTNF administered either alone or in combination with doxorubicin in locally
      advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients untreated or previously treated
      with one or more prior systemic regimen.

      Considering the safety/toxicity profile of NGR-hTNF characterized by mild-to-moderate
      constitutional symptoms when given either every three weeks or weekly both at low (0.8
      µg/m^2) and high dose (45 µg/m^2); the reversibility of these adverse events generally
      occurring only during the infusion time; the absence of overlapping toxicities with
      chemotherapeutic agents; and the safety and preliminary antitumor activity observed in phase
      Ib trial with doxorubicin, seems justified to evaluate in a randomized 4-arm phase II trial
      the preliminary antitumor activity of two doses of NGR-hTNF (0.8 µg/m^2 and 45 µg/m^2)
      administered weekly either alone or in combination with a standard dose of doxorubicin (60
      mg/m^2 every three weeks).
