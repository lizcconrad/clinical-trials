    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the safety of single doses and multiple doses of
      Finafloxacin hydrochloride in healthy volunteers. The level of Finafloxacin hydrochloride
      will be measured in the subjects blood and urine. One part of the study will assess if
      Finafloxacin hydrochloride eradicates Helicobacter pylori, a stomach bacteria. Another part
      of the study will assess the activity of the drug in urine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New antibiotics are needed due to the increasing resistance of bacteria to existing
      antibiotics. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacteria of the stomach and has been shown
      to cause peptic ulcers and is implicated in gastric cancer. Up to 40% of the population has
      H. pylori. Current treatments used to eradicate H. pylori are a combination of a number of
      drugs including antibiotics and drugs which reduce the acid in the stomach. These treatments
      are complicated and some H. pylori is resistant to the antibiotics used.

      This study is the first use of Finafloxacin hydrochloride in man and will examine its safety
      and make a preliminary study of its effectiveness as a single agent in eradicating H. pylori.
      The urine of subjects will also be used to test its effectiveness in killing the bacteria
      which cause urinary tract infections.
