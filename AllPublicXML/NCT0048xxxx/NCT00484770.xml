  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that, in patients with advanced heart failure, an outpatient fluid
      management strategy guided by BNP levels and clinical targets will lead to fewer days
      hospitalized or dead over a 3-month period compared to an outpatient fluid management
      strategy using clinical targets alone.

      STARBRITE will test the hypothesis that a defined fluid management strategy, tailored to
      specific symptoms and physiological targets, will improve morbidity and mortality in the
      advanced heart failure population. Individual targets for each patient will be based on the
      outcome of the index hospitalization, during which therapy is adjusted to optimize clinical
      status, blood pressure, and renal function. Identifying a standard fluid management strategy
      may be an important way to limit the complications of diuretic therapy and the duration of
      hospitalization for these patients. In addition, a standard approach may provide objective
      criteria that can be used to systematically deliver care in many types of clinical settings.

      In this study, patients will be randomized to two strategies of outpatient fluid management:
      1) the Congestion Score Strategy and, 2) the BNP Strategy.
