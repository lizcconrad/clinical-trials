    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to document the safety of the combination (escalation
      doses of NGR-hTNF, from 0.2 mcg/sqm to 1.6 mcg/sqm , with a fixed dose of cisplatin, 80
      mg/sqm). Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to
      National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC ).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study that will be conducted
      in sequential cohorts of patients. Three patients per each cohort are planned.

      Patients, with advanced or metastatic solid tumor not amenable of standard therapy will be
      enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ≥18 years with advanced or metastatic solid tumor not amenable to any

                  patient

               -  Adequate baseline bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, defined as follows:

               -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L
