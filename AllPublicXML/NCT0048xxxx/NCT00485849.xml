      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and effectiveness of
      atomoxetine in the treatment of attention problems, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in
      children with ASD, and secondarily, to evaluate the possible response to atomoxetine on the
      core symptoms of ASD
