      The DEScover Registry is designed to observe the results of using Drug Eluting Stents (DES)
      in patients in a real-world setting. The stents being observed are not investigational, that
      is, they have been approved for use in the general population.

      The D.E.S.cover Registry is a prospective, multi-center, observational study. Consecutive
      patients undergoing PCI procedures will be asked to consent to participate in this study. For
      these patients, baseline, clinical and angiographic characteristics, as well as certain
      procedural and clinical events will be recorded using standardized case report forms.
      Outcomes will be assessed during hospitalization and at one, six and twelve months after
      discharge. Depending on results from the first year of follow-up, the study may be extended
      with an additional one or two years of follow-up.

      The strategy for achieving the scientific objectives of the Registry is to document actual,
      real-world PCI practice and outcomes. Accordingly, the D.E.S.cover Registry does not specify
      treatment protocols, require any particular assignment of patients to treatment protocols, or
      in any other way require participating physicians to alter their practice patterns.
      Participating physicians are instructed to continue to treat all patients according to their
      own best clinical judgment, but to submit information on the parameters and outcomes of this
      treatment to the D.E.S.cover Registry database.
