  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate biopsy is usually conducted transrectal, ultrasonography guided. Since the area is
      not sterile, infection can be induced during the procedure.

      Prophylaxis antibiotic against gram-negative bacteria decreased significantly the amount of
      infections. Quinolones are considered preferred treatment but there is already an increase in
      resistance rates. TMP-SMX can not be used empirically due to a high percent of resistant
      uropathogens. One of the options is aminoglycosides, especially gentamicin. Advantages: very
      low resistance rate in the community, high concentration is urinary tract, slow clearance, no
      resistance developed under treatment, chip and with very few side effects.

      Prostate biopsy is usually conducted as an ambulatory transrectal needle aspiration,
      ultrasonography guided. The area is not sterile, with high concentration of gram-negative and
      anaerobic pathogens, infection can be induced during the procedure to the urinary tract, and
      even cause bacteremia.

      Prior studies concluded that prophylaxis antibiotic against gram-negative bacteria decreased
      significantly the amount of infections and hence it is accepted to give prophylaxis
      antibiotics which will cover especially gram-negative bacteria. Other studies show decrease
      in infections percent in patients that received prophylaxis opposed to those who did not,
      from 5-30% to less than 1%. Yet, there was no significant difference between those who
      received one dose and those who were treated for 3-5 days. Quinolones are considered
      preferred treatment since they can be given orally, but there is already an increase in
      resistance rates. TMP-SMX can not be used empirically due to a high percent of resistant
      uropathogens. One of the options is aminoglycosides, especially gentamicin. Advantages: very
      low resistance rate in the community, high concentration is urinary tract, slow clearance, no
      resistance developed under treatment, chip and with very few side effects.
