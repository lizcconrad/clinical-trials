  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate a new technique for prevention of sternal wound
      infection consisting of local application of collagen-gentamicin in addition to routine i.v.
      antibiotic prophylaxis.

      The technique has been evaluated in a previous randomised study. The aim of the present study
      is to evaluate the technique after it has been introduced in clinical practise to monitor the
      bacterial antibiotic susceptibility and to verify that the suggested reduction in sternal
      wound infection still exits.

    <textblock>
      A new technique for prevention of sternal wound infections after cardiac surgery is studied.
      Local application directly in the surgical wound of aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin)
      bound to collagen reduced the incidence of wound infection with more than 50 % in a previous
      prospective randomised trial.

      As the technique has been introduced in clinical practise two questions need to be monitored:

        -  Are there signs of change in the bacteria that cause the wound infections with a shift
           over time towards more gentamicin resistant agents?

        -  Is the effect of the prophylaxis still comparable to that which was seen in the previous
           study?

      Furthermore, results from the previous study indicated that the effect of the local
      antibiotic was better when combined with an extra rigid sternal wound infection, defined as
      at least one extra steel wire for sternal fixation.

      The study is conducted at those two Swedish cardiothoracic surgery centers where it was first
      studied. There are thus two objectives of the study: first to analyze the microbiologic
      findings of the sternal wound infections that occur, and secondly to monitor the incidence of
      sternal wound infection (especially deep infections) when the local collagen-gentamicin
      prophylaxis is used in daily routine in combination with a specific surgical technique for
      optimization of the strength of sternal fixation.

    <description>Use of local CollagenGentamicin and enhanced sternal fixation according to the Clinical routine introduced 4 years earlier as a result of a previous RCT on 2000 patients. In that sense these patients did not receive any intervention but just the standard treatment introduced 4 years earlier.
The aim of the study was to PROSPECTIVELY include a defined number of patients to compare their complication rate with that from aControl Group of patients från a previous RCT to verify that the effect of the treatment was stable over time.
As the study did not include any intervention compared to the present standard treatment at that time ethical approval was Exempt.</description>
