    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of nasal carbon
      dioxide for the treatment of pain and other symptoms related to temporomandibular disorders
      (TMD). Approximately 115 men and women ages 18 to 70 years old who have a history consistent
      with TMD-related pain for at least 3 months and meet all other eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled in this study. There may be up to two (2) visits to the clinic, screening and
      treatment. Screening and treatment may occur on the same day.
