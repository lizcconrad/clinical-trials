Items related to the assessment of objective akathisia, subjective awareness of restlessness, and distress related to restlessness are rated using various 4-point (0 - 3) scales. A global assessment of akathisia is rated using a 6-point (0=Absent, 1=Questionable akathisia, 2=Mild akathisia, 3=Moderate akathisia, 4=Marked akathisia, 5=Severe akathisia) scale. The total score range is from 0 to 14 with a higher score indicating more severe akathisia.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Last Observation After Baseline in Composite Score on the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery</title>
        <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The composite score combines the individual scores of the 10 tests and scores them on a normative scale to derive a T-score, where the mean is 50 and a standard deviation is 10 for the composite. The data here represents the change from baseline to last observation after baseline in Composite T-Score.</description>

If any part of the composite score was missing then the composite score was set to missing. Summary statistics are provided for the observed data only, missing data was not estimated.</population>

        <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The composite score combines the individual scores of the 10 tests and scores them on a normative scale to derive a T-score, where the mean is 50 and a standard deviation is 10 for the composite. The data here represent the mean change in composite T-score from baseline to 4 weeks.</description>

The data here represent the mean change in Attention/Vigilance Domain T-score from baseline to last observation after baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 or Last Observation After Baseline in the Social Cognition Domain of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery</title>
          <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The Domain score combines the individual test scores of the Domain and scores them on a normative scale to derive a T-score, (mean is 50 and standard deviation is 10) for the composite. The data here represent the mean change in Social Cognition Domain T-score from baseline to last observation after baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 or Last Observation After Baseline in the Letter-Number Span (LNS) Test of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery</title>
          <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The LNS is a component of the Working Memory Domain scored on a normative scale to derive a T-score, (mean is 50 and standard deviation is 10). The data here represent the mean change in LNS T-score from baseline to last observation after baseline.</description>

        <description>WCST is an instrument administered electronically to assess abstract reasoning and ability to alter problem solving strategies. Patients are given 64 response cards and 4 stimulus cards and asked to match each stimulus card to 1 pile of response cards. The patient is not told how to match the cards, only &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; to each placement. Examiner may change matching rules during the test. Perseveration errors occur when subject repeats the same error no matter how many times they are told the placement is wrong. The change from baseline in number of perseveration errors was assessed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 or Last Observation After Baseline in the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST) - Categories Completed</title>
        <description>WCST is an instrument administered electronically to assess abstract reasoning and ability to alter problem solving strategies. Patients are given 64 response cards and 4 stimulus cards and asked to match each stimulus card to 1 pile of response cards. The patient is not told how to match the cards, only &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; to each placement. Examiner may change matching rules (sorting categories) during the test at which time the subject must alter their sorting category. The change from baseline in number of sorting categories achieved was assessed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The BARS is a 4-item clinician-rated scale to measure the presence and severity of drug-induced akathisia. Items related to the assessment of objective akathisia, subjective awareness of restlessness, and distress related to restlessness are rated using various 4-point (0 - 3) scales. A global assessment of akathisia is rated using a 6-point (0=Absent, 1=Questionable akathisia, 2=Mild akathisia, 3=Moderate akathisia, 4=Marked akathisia, 5=Severe akathisia) scale. The total score range is from 0 to 14 with a higher score indicating more severe akathisia.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint (Week 4 or Last Observation After Baseline) in the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) Interviewer Total Scores</title>
        <description>The SCoRS is an 18-item interview based assessment covering all the cognitive domains in the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery except social cognition. It is administered separately to the patient and an informant (family or friend) who are asked to rate the patient's level of difficulty in performing various cognitive functions on a 4-point scale (higher rating = greater impairment). They also complete a global assessment of cognitive function on a 1-10 scale. The interviewer factors in their own assessment on both the 18-items (Total Score) and the global assessment for the final score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 or Last Observation After Baseline in the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) Interviewer Global Rating</title>
        <description>The SCoRS is an 18-item interview based assessment covering all the cognitive domains in the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery except social cognition. It is administered separately to the patient and an informant (family or friend) who are asked to rate the patient's level of difficulty in performing various cognitive functions on a 4-point scale (higher rating = greater impairment). They also complete a global assessment of cognitive function on a 1-10 scale. The interviewer factors in their own assessment on both the 18-items (Total Score) and the global assessment for the final score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) Interviewer Global Rating</title>
        <description>The SCoRS is an 18-item interview based assessment covering all the cognitive domains in the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery except social cognition. It is administered separately to the patient and an informant (family or friend) who are asked to rate the patient's level of difficulty in performing various cognitive functions on a 4-point scale (higher rating = greater impairment). They also complete a global assessment of cognitive function on a 1-10 scale. The interviewer factors in their own assessment on both the 18-items (Total Score) and the global assessment for the final score.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The CGI-S was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2 and Week 4.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 or Last Observation After Baseline in Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) Total Scores</title>
        <description>SANS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It contains 25 items in 5 domains: affective flattening/blunting, alogia, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, attentional impairment. Items in a domain assess symptoms and a global item assesses the overall severity of the domain. Each item is scored on a 6-point severity scale(0=Not at all, 1=questionable decrease, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, 5=severe). The total scale ranges from 0-125. Data presented here represents change in total score from Baseline to Endpoint.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 2 in Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) Total Scores</title>
        <description>SANS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It contains 25 items in 5 domains: affective flattening/blunting, alogia, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, attentional impairment. Items in a domain assess symptoms and a global item assesses the overall severity of the domain. Each item is scored on a 6-point severity scale(0=Not at all, 1=questionable decrease, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, 5=severe). The total scale ranges from 0-125. Data presented here represents change in total score from Baseline to Week 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 or Last Observation After Baseline in the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Negative Scale Score</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms (eg. delusions, hallucinations), 7 items measure negative symptoms (eg. blunted affect, social withdrawal), 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale (eg. anxiety, motor retardation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. The Negative Scale score ranges from 7 to 49. The data here represents the change in Negative Rating Scale from Baseline to Endpoint.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Negative Scale Score</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms (eg. delusions, hallucinations), 7 items measure negative symptoms (eg. blunted affect, social withdrawal), 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale (eg. anxiety, motor retardation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. The Negative Scale score ranges from 7 to 49. The data here represents the change in Negative Rating Scale from Baseline to Week 4.</description>

        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms (eg. delusions, hallucinations), 7 items measure negative symptoms (eg. blunted affect, social withdrawal), 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale (eg. anxiety, motor retardation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. The Total score ranges from 7 to 210.

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score</title>
          <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms (eg. delusions, hallucinations), 7 items measure negative symptoms (eg. blunted affect, social withdrawal), 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale (eg. anxiety, motor retardation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. The Total score ranges from 7 to 210. The data here represents the change in Total score from Baseline to Week 4.</description>

The CGI-S was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2 and Week 4. Data is presented representing the number of subjects who rated each CGI-S score at week 1.</description>

        <title>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Week 1</title>
        <description>The PGIC is a patient-rated scale of the change in disease severity. The PGIC uses the following 7 categories and scoring assignments: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse. The number of subjects who rated each category at Week 1 is presented here.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Ratings at Baseline</title>
        <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The CGI-S was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2 and Week 4. Data is presented representing the number of subjects who rated each CGI-S score at Baseline.</description>
