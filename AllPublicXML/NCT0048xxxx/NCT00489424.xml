  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of acetaminophen or fluvastatin in reducing the rate of
      occurrence and the severity of post dose symptoms that may occur during the 3 day period
      following a zoledronic acid infusion in post menopausal women with low bone mass.

    <description>Clinically significant increase in oral body temperature or used rescue medication ibuprofen &gt;= 1 time during the 3-day period after i.v. infusion of zoledronic acid 5 mg. A clinically significant increase in body temperature was defined as an increase of at least 1 degree Celsius from baseline and a mean oral body temperature reading of at least 38.5 degrees Celsius occurring at least once during the 3-day treatment period.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Patients With a Major Increase (Worsening) in Severity of Questionnaire Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>A major increase (worsening) in severity was defined as an increase in severity of 2 units or more from baseline at least once during the 3 days immediately following i.v. infusion of zoledronic acid 5 mg. The severity of the symptom was evaluated using a 4-point categorical scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients Reporting Severe Questionnaire Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>A severe questionnaire symptom was defined as experiencing a severe specified symptom (feeling feverish, experiencing headaches, having aches and pains of muscles and joints) at least once post-baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Measurement of Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Effect on severity of symptoms following i.v. infusion of zoledronic acid 5 mg. The VAS is a 100-mm linear visual analog scale (0 = no symptoms to 100 = severe symptoms). The baseline VAS measurement was defined as the VAS measurement recorded prior to the infusion.</description>
