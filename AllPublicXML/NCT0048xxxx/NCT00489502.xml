  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to common CVD diseases associated from obesity, medical providers are in a position to
      provide assistance. However, less than 10% of all patients receive any weight loss advice
      from physicians. Perceived barriers to weight loss counseling include lack of self-control of
      their patients and belief that recommendation is futile, lack of medical training in
      nutrition, exercise, and obesity management, and lack of insurance reimbursement. Though many
      barriers are prevalent, research has demonstrated a positive effect with medical advice on
      the number of obese individuals attempting to lose weight. Analyzing data from the 1996
      Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, researchers found, when advised to lose weight by
      a physician, 78% of overweight patients reported attempting to lose weight. However, if their
      physician did not discuss weight loss, only 33% of patients within the same BMI category
      attempted to do so 7. From this information, physicians or allied health staff that provide
      brief counseling (5-10 minute) along with medical technology that provides basic nutrition
      assessment might have a positive impact on the number CVD patients that are obese attempting
      to lose weight.

      HYPOTHESIS: Will a medical specialty clinic focused on cardiovascular medicine successfully
      be able to implement the MedGem device for assessment of basic nutritional needs along with
      providing “brief” patient education into the medical practice without a house dietitian.

      PRIMARY AIMS

        1. Can medical staff and/or support staff provide REE assessments (15-minutes) and brief
           patient education (5-15 minutes) as part of the clinic’s operations?

        2. Will a third-party payer compensate the Medical Specialty Clinic for the diagnostic
           procedure CPT Code 94690 for obese patients diagnosed with hypertension (401.1-9,
           402.10-11, &amp; 402.90-91), hypercholesterolemia (272.1), and/or hyperlipdemia (272.2)?

      SECONDARY AIMS

        1. Does self-efficacy increase from REE assessments?

        2. Do patients adopt healthy eating (Calorie Reduction and Fat Reduction)following REE
           assessments?
