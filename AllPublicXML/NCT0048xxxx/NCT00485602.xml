    <textblock>
      The trial is aimed to investigate an orthodontic treatment with a new
      removable-part-time-wearing appliance, based on &quot;High-Tech&quot; technology.

      The appliance should be wear only 12-14 hours a day, and is made of a single silicone
      aligner, made specifically for the patient, using 3-D screening technology of the patient's
      malocclusion. The aligner has a designed pathway &quot;built-in&quot; for the tooth to move, from the
      original position of the malocclusion to the &quot;end point&quot; - the correct position.

      The force system, that is needed in order to generate tooth movement, is produced by tiny
      air-balloons which are incorporated in the aligner.

      The study hypothesis is, that an orthodontic treatment can be done successfully with this
      part-time wearing appliance.

      The appliance include:

        -  silicone aligner (made specifically for the patient.

        -  simple air pump to blow air in the tiny balloons.

      The patient is guided to wear the appliance 12-14 hours a day, after filling air in the
      balloons, under the doctor's instructions.

      Clinical examination for follow-up will be done every 4 weeks.
