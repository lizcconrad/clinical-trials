      This study valuates the safety and efficacy of treatment with 3% Diclofenac Nano-Emulsion
      Cream versus Placebo in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, parallel
      treatment study. A total of 126 subjects will be randomized to receive either
      3%-Diclofenac-NE cream or a placebo cream respectively. Following screening and a washout
      period from previous treatments subjects will be enrolled and will self-apply the study
      medication. During the study, subjects will apply 3%-Diclofenac-NE or placebo cream three
      times daily for 28 days and complete a home-diary. Subjects will visit the clinic at
      mid-treatment for a follow up examination and again for a final examination at the end of
      treatment.
