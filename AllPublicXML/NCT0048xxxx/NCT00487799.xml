          -  Dyspnea at rest as assessed by the subject not more than 1 hour prior to

               1. Prior medical history of CHF (eg, prior hospitalization for CHF or left
                  ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%, as determined by transthoracic
                  echocardiography at the time of screening or previously determined and documented
                  in the patient's chart as follows):

                    -  Within the previous 12 months in subjects with stable symptoms.

               2. Clinical evidence (at screening) of heart failure, including abnormal jugular
                  venous pressure (JVP) (eg, &gt;8 cm above the clavicle, assessed at 45°angle), rales
                  or crackles more than a third above bases, or 2+ lower extremity edema.

          -  On optimal background therapy for ADHF (as determined by the investigator); subjects
             are required to have received, at a minimum, at least 1 hour of oxygen supplementation
             and at least one dose of IV furosemide at a minimum dose of 40 mg with the last bolus
             being delivered &gt;2 hours before study drug administration is initiated (or another
             diuretic at a comparable dose; eg, 2 mg bumetanide or 20 mg torsemide, with the last
             bolus being delivered &gt;4 hours before study drug administration is initiated.

          -  If subject received IV opiate, the last dose must have been &gt;3 hours before
             administration of study drug.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to being
             randomized in the study. Women and men of reproductive potential will agree to utilize
             effective contraception during the entire treatment period and for 1 month after
             receiving the last dose of ularitide or placebo.

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated
             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (in accordance
             with national and local subject privacy regulations).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any subject will be ineligible for this study if any one of the following criteria is met:

          -  Breathing rate &lt;18 breaths per minute (measured during 60 seconds).

             A SBP &lt;90 mmHg in two successive measurements within 30 minutes before randomization.
             (Subjects on baseline IV inotropes or vasodilators must be on a stable dose for ³3
             hours prior to randomization.)

          -  BNP &lt;400 pg/mL or NT?pro-BNP &lt;1200 pg/mL anytime from initial presentation to hospital

          -  Significant acute or chronic respiratory disorder (eg, severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease) or primary pulmonary hypertension with baseline dyspnea that may
             interfere with the ability to interpret dyspnea assessments or hemodynamic
             measurements.

          -  Terminal illness other than CHF with expected survival &lt;180 days.
