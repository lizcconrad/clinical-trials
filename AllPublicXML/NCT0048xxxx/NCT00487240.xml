  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of insulin lispro protamine
      suspension (ILPS) as compared to insulin detemir as basal insulin combined with mealtime
      insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. A gatekeeper strategy will be employed for
      sequentially testing the secondary objectives.

      Phase 3b, randomized, multicenter, multinational, open-label, two-arm, active control,
      parallel study to determine safety, efficacy, and noninferiority of basal analog insulin
      lispro protamine suspension (ILPS, also referred to as NPL [neutral protamine Hagedorn]),
      injected two times a day, compared with basal analog insulin detemir, injected two times a
      day, as measured by change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline (Visit 2) to 32 weeks in
      adult patients with type 1 diabetes when used in combination with bolus insulin lispro,
      injected three times a day.

    <description>The summary statistics represents the mean of all subjects. Change from baseline is calculated for each individual subject for the specific visit and then the &quot;mean change from baseline&quot; is calculated by averaging out for all subjects. [Sum over all (i) {A1c at Week 8 for Subject(i) minus A1c Baseline for Subject (i)}/Total Subjects]. Therefore, for example, the Change from Baseline is not equal to the difference of Mean A1c for Week 8 minus Mean A1c for baseline.</description>

    <description>Glycemic variability was measured by standard deviation (SD) value of fasting blood glucose as measured by intra-patient glycemic variability (determined by the 7-point self-monitored blood glucose [SMBG] profiles at endpoint); mean value (M-value), which was the mean of the intra-days self-monitored blood glucose values, and by the mean of daily difference (MODD), which was the mean of the between-days self-monitored blood glucose values.</description>

Severe: An episode with symptoms consistent with neuroglycopenia in which the patient requires the assistance of another person; associated with either a blood glucose level of &lt;2.8 mmol/L (&lt;50 mg/dL) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, glucagon, or intravenous glucose.</description>
