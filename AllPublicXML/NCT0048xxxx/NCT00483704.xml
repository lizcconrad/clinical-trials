  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of telcagepant (MK-0974) in
      acute treatment of multiple migraine attacks with or without aura. Primary hypotheses of this
      study are that telcagepant is superior to placebo, as measured by the proportion of
      participants who have pain freedom, pain relief, pain freedom consistency, pain relief
      consistency, and absence of photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at 2 hours post-dose.
