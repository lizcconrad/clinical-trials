  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare two therapeutical strategies concerning the combination
      therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin) in naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C of
      genotype 1. &quot;Reference&quot; strategy corresponding to standards of care recommended by the French
      consensus conference versus &quot;Test&quot; strategy corresponding to adaptation strategy of ribavirin
      dose during the first week according to AUC (area under the curve) of ribavirin plasmatic
      concentration after the first intake (Day 0) of 600 mg
