      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of supplementation with ProAlgaZyme (a
      novel fermentation product of a freshwater algae ecosystem) vs. placebo on Metabolic Syndrome
      and indicators of cardiovascular health including: body weight and fat, blood lipids,
      inflammatory markers such as hsCRP, blood pressure and fasting blood glucose.

      Metabolic syndrome, a set of symptoms strongly associated with increased risk for both
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes, is generally linked to obesity and has become a serious
      problem in many industrialized countries. Agents that aid in weight loss or help to normalize
      blood lipids or inflammation may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome and therefore, reduce
      the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This study is a single-center, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel design, to evaluate the effects of ProAlgaZyme (4 fl. oz. daily)
      on metabolic syndrome and markers of cardiovascular health including blood lipids,
      inflammatory markers and anthropometric measurements.
