      This research is to test the effectiveness and toxicity of both Ifosfamide and Doxorubicin.
      It also aims to explore the relationship between EBV DNA and clinical response in patients
      with advanced naso-pharyngeal cancer which has been previously treated with chemotherapy.

      Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC) is one of the common cancer in Southeast Asia. In this region NPC
      is associated with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) chronic infection with EBV DNA identifiable in
      almost all the NPC tumors and patient's serum at the time of diagnosis. Chinese, especially
      cantonese has the highest incidence. Only about 30% of patients presents early disease and
      has a good treatment outcome (80% cure for stage I disease and 70% for stage II by
      radiation).

      This research is to test the effectiveness and toxicity of both Ifosfamide and Doxorubicin.
      It also aims to explore the relationship between EBV DNA and clinical response in patients
      with advanced naso-pharyngeal cancer which has been previously treated with chemotherapy.

      Investigators believe EBV infection is necessary to cause NPC and that EBV DNA levels in the
      blood may directly relate to the total size of the tumor. Because NPC patients in this
      situation have a poor outlook, we design this study to evaluate the combination of Ifosfamide
      and doxorubicin for further treatment. While this combination of medicines has been used in
      many other forms of cancer, it has not been tested in patients with NPC.
