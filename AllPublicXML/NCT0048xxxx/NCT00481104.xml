             as bulimia.

          -  Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are ineligible unless anti-diabetic medication
             was not deemed necessary by the investigator and fasting (venous or arterialized
             capillary full blood from finger or ear) blood glucose &gt; 6.1 mmol/l at screening.
             Re-test is allowed if first measure is above inclusion value. The corresponding
             exclusion criteria for plasma glucose is 7.0 mmol/l

          -  Patients known to abuse or to be dependent on any drug, including alcohol (weekly

             mL/min estimated by central laboratory using Cockcroft and Gault formula,
             respectively)

          -  Known untreated hypercholesterolaemia (&gt; 7 mmol/l). Patients with well regulated
             cholesterol using drugs for hypercholesterolaemia are allowed inclusion

          -  Patients who suffer from hyperthyroid disease are not allowed in the study, even
             though they may be well treated by drugs

          -  Patients, who have recently diagnosed, not yet stable hypothyroid disease are not
             allowed in the study

          -  Patients who suffer from longstanding stable hypothyroid disease, well treated
             substitution are allowed to be included including hypothyroidism as a sequelae to
             definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism by surgery or radioactive iodine

          -  Malabsorptive intestinal disorders that can be assumed to affect the absorption of
             tesofensine

          -  Special diets (e.g., vegetarian, Atkins)

          -  Patients planning major changes in physical activity during the study to an extent
             that may interfere with the study outcome, as judged by the investigator

          -  Surgically treated obesity

          -  Patients with systemic infections or inflammatory diseases

          -  History or presence of significant cardiovascular disease such as heart failure,
             ischemic heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attacks

          -  Significant abnormalities on the ECG. according to the investigators opinion.
             Additional exclusionary ECG values: QTcB &gt; 480 milliseconds (ms) in females and &gt;450
             ms in males, PR interval &gt; 240 ms, QRS interval &gt; 120 ms

          -  Hypotension (i.e. supine systolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg) and/or symptomatic orthostatic
             hypotension (clinical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension associated with a decline ≥
             20 mm Hg in systolic BP at one minute after standing compared with the previous supine
             systolic BP obtained after 5 minutes of quiet rest) at screening visit
