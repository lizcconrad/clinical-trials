      Patients who have heart failure and have electrical evidence of delay in the contraction of
      the left ventricle on an ECG tracing of the heart are eligible for biventricular pacing.
      Recent work has suggested that patients with heart failure who do not have electrical
      evidence of conduction delay (normal QRS) may benefit from biventricular pacing. The reliance
      on ECGs to determine the presence of dyssynchrony is widespread, although the ECG alone is
      not 100% sensitive and specific. ECG criteria for de-synchrony in heart failure patients are
      estimated to pick up only 30% of patients with dyssynchrony, and results in patients missing
      out on a potentially important treatment advance.

      We would like to study patients with heart failure who have normal ventricular activation on
      their ECGs to see whether we can predict those patients who will respond to biventricular
      pacing.

      AIMS and Objectives A randomised controlled clinical trial

      Primary objective

      â€¢ Improvements in 6-min walking distance

      Secondary objectives Determine

        1. Symptomatic improvement in quality of life, using the Minnesota Living with Heart
           Failure questionnaire

        2. Change in NT pro-BNP and echocardiographic parameters of LV function

        3. Does MRI Dyssynchrony Index (CMR-TSI) predicts responders.

        4. Morbidity and Mortality using CARE-HF definitions

        5. Packer combined clinical composite score

      Study Design A pilot randomised controlled clinical trial 60 patients. The biventricular
      pacemaker with be optimized for both A-V delay and V-V delay.

      Subject Selection Source - Patients attending Good Hope Hospital, Sandwell Hospital Centres
      involved - 2 Eligible Participants - 60 patients with heart failure and narrow QRS.

      Inclusion Criteria Sinus rhythm Symptomatic heart failure - NYHA class III or IV ECG QRS
      duration less than 120 milliseconds LV ejection fraction of less than 35% on echocardiography
      using Simpsons technique.

      Able to give informed consent

      Exclusion Criteria Age below 18 Current or planned pregnancy Patient refusal Ventricular
      tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation Current or recent (within last 30 days) involvement
      in other studies Requires implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) according to NICE
      criteria for implantation (England and Wales)

      Definition of clinical response:- 20% improvement in 6 minute walk distance or any
      improvement from 0

      Definition of echocardiographic response:- 15% or greater decrease in left ventricular end
      systolic volume

      Follow up 6 weeks and 6 monthly thereafter. Interim results at 6 months. Analysis of results,
      echocardiograms, MRI and BNP will be blind Walk distance to be measured by unblinded observer
      and by pedometer.

      Randomisation:

      Numbered envelopes will be prepared by sponsor (Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust) and
      kept from researchers. After informed consent, the patient will be enrolled and the
      technician will draw the result.

      This trial was known as the Birmingham biventricular pacing in patients unselected for
      dyssynchrony (BIPIDS).
