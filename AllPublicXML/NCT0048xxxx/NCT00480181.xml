  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nabilone (Cesamet) when used as an
      adjunctive agent with gabapentin (Neurontin) provides significantly improved pain relief over
      gabapentin alone for the management of neuropathic pain in MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain syndromes, which occur due to damage to central and/or peripheral nerve
      axons, are often more difficult to manage and are commonly refractory to the conventional
      analgesia approach described by the World Health Organization, including NSAIDs and narcotic
      agents. These pain syndromes are often described by symptoms of burning, stabbing, crawling,
      shock-like, numbness and/or tingling, and can be quite concerning to the patient, especially
      when there is an inadequate response to treatment. It has been estimated that the prevalence
      of chronic pain in MS ranges anywhere from 30-90%, placing it as the second worst
      disease-induced symptom experienced by this patient population.

      The pathophysiologic causes of this pain syndrome are complex and multifaceted, with no one
      specific link attributed to the pain response. Due to the complexity of neuropathic pain -
      which is only partially understood at best - it may be necessary in many cases to treat the
      source of the pain with more than one agent in order to address the many different
      contributors to this pain process. More thorough review of how the currently available agents
      for NPP work together would provide clinicians with safety and efficacy data which would aid
      in providing optimal pain management.
