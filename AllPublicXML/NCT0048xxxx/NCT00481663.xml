  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study of different doses of MK-0431 in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There
      have been 3 extensions to the base study (Extension 1: up to Week 52, Extension 2: up to Week
      106, and Extension 3: up to Week 158). The primary hypothesis for the study is that In
      participants with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control, after 12 weeks of
      treatment, a dose-response will be seen across once-daily doses of MK-0431 in lowering
      hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c).

Participants were eligible for rescue with pioglitazone 30 mg (or rosiglitazone in countries where pioglitazone was not licensed) if they met the following criteria: from Week 16 and during the second extension: FPG consistently &gt;240 mg/dL (repeated and confirmed within 3 to 7 days); from Week 52 up to (not including) Week 70: HbA1C &gt;8%; from Week 70 up to (not including) Visit 21/Week 106: HbA1C &gt;7.5% (Extension 2). Participants placed on rescue therapy with pioglitazone (rosiglitazone where pioglitazone is not available) in the first or second extensions were not eligible for enrollment in the third extension. Rescue therapy was not available in the third extension.</description>
