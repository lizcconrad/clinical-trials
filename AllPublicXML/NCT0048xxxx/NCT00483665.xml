    <textblock>
      After endovascular treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, lifelong imaging follow-up is
      needed to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. One parameter in this follow-up is
      endoleak, which is leakage of blood into the aneurysm sac. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the value of magnetic resonance imaging using Vasovist as a contrast agent for
      the detection of endoleaks.

    <textblock>
      After endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, life-long follow-up is needed to monitor
      the effectiveness of exclusion of the aneurysm sac from blood flow. For this reason, aneurysm
      diameter and the presence of endoleaks is evaluated with computed tomographic (CT)
      angiography yearly after Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the value of magnetic resonance imaging using
      Vasovist as a contrast agent for the detection of endoleaks.

      The advantages of magnetic resonance imaging with respect to CTA are no use of ionizing
      radiation, use of less nephrotoxic contrast agents.
