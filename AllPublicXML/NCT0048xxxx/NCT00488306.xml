  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In light of tigecycline's activity against these resistant bacteria, tigecycline may
      represent a viable new therapy for complicated intra-abdominal infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tigecycline to treat complicated intra-abdominal
      infections in hospitalized patients. Both the clinical response profile and the
      microbiological response profile will be assessed. The primary endpoint will be clinical
      response within the microbiological evaluable population at the test-of-cure assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized male or female patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must be a candidate for or have had a laparotomy, or laparoscopy of an
             intra-abdominal abscess.

          -  Patients with a complicated intra-abdominal infection such as:

               -  an intra-abdominal abscess;

               -  an intra-abdominal abscess (including liver and spleen) that develops in a
                  post-operative patient after receiving &gt; 48 hours and less than or equal to 5
                  days of a non-study antibiotic. An intra-abdominal culture must be obtained from
                  the infected site.

               -  appendicitis complicated by perforation (grossly visible) and abscess and/or
                  periappendiceal abscess;

               -  perforated diverticulitis complicated by abscess formation or fecal
                  contamination;

               -  complicated cholecystitis with evidence of perforation or empyema;

               -  perforation of the large or small intestine with abscess, or fecal contamination;

               -  purulent peritonitis or peritonitis associated with fecal contamination;

               -  gastric or duodenal ulcer perforation with symptoms lasting at least 24 hours
                  prior to operation;

               -  traumatic bowel perforation with symptoms lasting at least 12 hours prior to
                  operation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would preclude an evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated
             course of therapy or follow-up visits could be completed.

          -  Active or treated leukemia or systemic malignancy that required treatment with
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy or antineoplastic therapy within the
             past 3 months, or any metastatic malignancy to the abdomen with life expectancy less
             than 6 months.

          -  Anticipated length of antibiotic therapy less than 5 days.
