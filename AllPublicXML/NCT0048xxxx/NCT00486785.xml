      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the sexual function improvement from baseline to the end of treatment (Week 24
           or premature withdrawal (PW)) with XATRAL 10mg OD.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the association between Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) severity and
           sexual disorders,

        -  To compare the improvement in sexual function, urinary symptoms and Quality of Life
           among the different regions,

        -  To correlate MSHQ (Male Sexual Health Questionnaire) and IIEF-5 (the 5-Item version of
           the International Index of Erectile Function),

        -  To assess the onset of action of XATRAL 10mg OD,

        -  To assess the peak flow rate improvement (Qmax),

        -  To assess the safety and the tolerability of XATRAL 10mg OD.
