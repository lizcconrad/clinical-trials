      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of TC for Arthritis on physical
      function, pain, and stiffness in older adults with knee/hip OA. Two hypotheses were tested:

        1. Individuals in the TC group will demonstrate greater improvements in physical function
           compared to control group participants.

        2. Individuals in the TC group will demonstrate greater decreases in pain and stiffness
           compared to control group participants.

      Exercise is considered a vital component of osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. T’ai Chi (TC) is a
      unique exercise intervention with low-velocity movements. Few studies have addressed the
      effects of TC on arthritis symptoms and function. TC for Arthritis was modified specifically
      for people with OA and consists of a standardized set of forms.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-dose TC for Arthritis on
      physical function, pain, and stiffness in individuals with OA.

      Twenty-seven older adults with OA (mean age-81.3 years) completed an 8 week non-randomized
      controlled pre-post test quasi-experimental design study of TC for Arthritis. Physical
      function, pain, and stiffness were measured at baseline and 8 weeks for the TC and control
      groups using the WOMAC™ 3.1 Index. Qualitative data from interviews and participant
      observations were analyzed in order to understand the participants’ expectations and
      experiences with TC.
