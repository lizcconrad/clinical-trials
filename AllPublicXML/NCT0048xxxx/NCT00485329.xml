    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to evaluate DermastreamTM - EnzystreamTM system safety, tolerability
      and efficacy, as a potent method for debridement of nonhealing lower extremity chronic venous
      ulcers patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose
      escalating, three patient-group study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DermaStream™ -
      EnzyStream™ System in non-healing lower extremity chronic venous ulcers patients. The
      DermaStream™ - EnzyStream™ System will be evaluated during continues streaming of 3 different
      doses of EnzystreamTM (papain based) solution given in an escalating order (15,000, 30,000
      and 60,000 papain USP units/ml) up to 5 consecutive treatment days. Each treatment session
      lasts for 6 hours. This study is a Multi center trial. It is anticipated that three (3) sites
      will enroll subjects into this study. Overall, forty eight (48) patients will be recruited,
      and randomly allocated to placebo or EnzyStream™ treatment in each study dose group prior to
      EnzyStream™ administration. The ratio of drug to placebo treated patients will be 4;1, namely
      12 patients will be administered with EnzyStream™ solution and 4 patients will be placebo
      treated in each of the three respective EnzyStream™ dose groups. Treatment will start with
      the lowest dose (15,000 papain USP units/ml) administered over a 6 hour period followed with
      saline wash for an additional half an hour. The treatment dose will be increased to the next
      highest dose, for the next patients group only following safety analysis, and the procedure
      will be repeated.

      The treatment period will be followed by a 3 month follow up period. During the follow up
      period patients will be observed for every 2 weeks during the first month and once a month
      (every 20 days) during the 2 additional months (allowing a time window of ± 3 days).
