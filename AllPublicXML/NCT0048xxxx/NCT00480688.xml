      To assess the immunogenicity of M. bovis BCG, given intrademally in the standard dose used in
      clinical practice and to measure the development of the immune response in the first six
      months after administration. M. bovis BCG is a fully licensed vaccine that has been in
      routine clinical use for the last 50 years. It is the most widely administered vaccine in the
      world today and has an excellent safety record.

      Volunteers for the study will be recruited through advertisements. Each volunteer will have
      received an information sheet concerning the study and will have agreed to participate in
      writing.

      Volunteers will be given at least 48 hours between reading the information leaflet and
      agreeing to participate. Female volunteers will have a pregnancy test prior to enrollment.
      Volunteers will give signed consent for their GPâ€™s to be notified about their participation
      in the trial. The GP will be faxed a letter on the day of screening and asked to reply if
      they know of a reason why the volunteer should not take part. The signed consent form will
      also be faxed with the letter.
