  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization is a traumatic event for the patient and his family at any age nevertheless
      in the older age. One of its consequences is the difficulty to resume previous activity of
      daily living especially in older (over 75 years) patients. Sub acute completes the acute
      phase of the hospitalization and its main purpose is to improve the patient's functional
      status and quality of life. There are not enough clinical trails to proof this assumption.
      The purpose of our study is to compare the outcome of acute and sub-acute hospitalization
      programs by a randomized controlled prospective intervention study. Outcome measures will
      comprise activity of daily living, functional status, re-hospitalization and utilization of
      medical services following the hospitalization.Study hypothesis is that sub-acute
      hospitalization will improve outcomes and will cost less.
