             on assessment scales;

          4. Subjects willing to discontinue all medication starting from the signing of the
             informed consent and during the study phases (allowed exceptions noted in Section

          5. Men or women aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years;

          7. YMRS total score ≤ 12 for 2 consecutive visits (to be assessed at Week 5 and/or Week6
             prior entry into double-blind treatment phase).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for
             the entire study period and for up to four weeks after completion of the study.

          6. Subjects considered treatment refractory for manic symptoms; (Note: if a subject has
             failed ≥ 2 antimanic treatments, e.g., antipsychotic, lithium, valproate or
             carbamazepine at therapeutic dose and duration, exclusive of the current episode,
             obtain permission from the Otsuka medical monitor to include the subject)

          7. Subjects previously nonresponsive to aripiprazole for manic symptoms;

             condition has been stabilized with medications for at least the past three months;
             (Note: Subjects with an abnormal thyroid function test may be retested prior to the
             start of study medication. Subjects with an abnormal thyroid function test at
             screening will not be eligible for the study, unless permission is obtained from
             Otsuka);

         11. Subjects who have a history or evidence of a medical condition that would expose them
             to an undue risk of a significant adverse event or interfere with assessments of
             safety or efficacy during the course of the trial, including but not limited to
             hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine (e.g., Addison's Disease),

               -  Creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL

               -  QTc &gt; 475 msec

         14. Subjects with a recent antipsychotic use who have a CPK ≥ 550 IU (Otsuka should be
             contacted to discuss any elevated CPK levels);

             the course of the study (Note: Group and supportive therapy is allowed, if part of the
             subject's ongoing treatment. Individual psychotherapy is allowed if the subject has
             consistently received psychotherapy for at least 3 months prior to the study and will
             continue during the study);

         20. ECT treatment within the current episode or within two months prior to the study;

         21. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness must
