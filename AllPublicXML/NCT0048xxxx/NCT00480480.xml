      Context: This is the first multi-site randomized controlled study of the effectiveness of a
      group treatment for war-exposed adolescents delivered in-country within a public school
      system.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a trauma/grief-focused group treatment program in
      reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and traumatic grief in
      war-exposed Bosnian youths attending 10 secondary schools located in Central Bosnia.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial conducted during the 2000-2001 school year, with
      4-month follow-up, compared group treatment to a psychoeducation/skill-based school milieu
      intervention.

      Setting and Participants: Students attending 10 Bosnian secondary schools exposed to severe
      trauma, traumatic loss, and severe adversity, reporting severe persisting symptoms of PTSD,
      depression, or traumatic grief, and functional impairment.

      Intervention: Students were randomly assigned to either 17-session Trauma and Grief Component
      Therapy (n=71), or a school milieu intervention (n=73), both conducted by trained school
      counselors.
