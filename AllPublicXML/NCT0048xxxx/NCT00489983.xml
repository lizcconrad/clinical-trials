      This study is for elderly patients who haven't been given prior chemotherapy or for patients
      who cannot be treated with platinum based chemotherapy. The patients who are eligible for
      this study will have been diagnosed with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
      The patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment options: single agent
      pemetrexed or single agent pemetrexed with single agent gemcitabine following right after the
      pemetrexed treatment.
