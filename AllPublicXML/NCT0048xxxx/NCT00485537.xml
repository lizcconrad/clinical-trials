  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cycles with GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist were compared and main outcome measures were the
      number of oocytes retrieved, injected and fertilized, embryos transferred, and clinical
      pregnancy and miscarriage rates, were analized.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      160 women were equally divided between a GnRH antagonist protocol (Group 1) versus a GnRH
      agonist protocol (Group 2) in ICSI cycles. The trial was conducted between September 2005 and
      December 2006. The mean age in both groups was 32 (range 22-40). The main outcome measures
      were the number of oocytes retrieved, injected and fertilized, embryos transferred, and
      clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates.
