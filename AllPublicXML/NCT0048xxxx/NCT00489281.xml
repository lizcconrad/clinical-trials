      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and
      total-body irradiation before a donor bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of
      abnormal cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's
      stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may
      help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and
      platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against
      the body's normal cells. Giving sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop
      this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
      together with total-body irradiation followed by a donor bone marrow transplant works in
      treating patients with sickle cell anemia and other blood disorders.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the transplant-related mortality and progression-free survival of patients
           with severe hemoglobinopathies receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning comprising
           fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation followed by
           partially HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplantation from first-degree relatives or
           HLA-matched donors.

        -  Characterize donor hematopoietic chimerism at 30, 60, and 180 days after transplantation
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days
           -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -6 and -5. Patients also undergo
           total-body irradiation on day -1.

        -  Bone marrow transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on
           day 0. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3 and 4.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive sirolimus orally daily on days
           5-365 and oral mycophenolate mofetil 3 times a day on days 5-35.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
