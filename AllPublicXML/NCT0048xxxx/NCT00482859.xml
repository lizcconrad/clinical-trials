      diagnosed with Fibromyalgia syndrome.

    <textblock>
      At least 50 women over 18 years of age are invited to volunteer in this study. Sleep quality
      and problems with sleep will be described using several kinds of measures. Questionnaires on
      sleep and Fibromyalgia will be completed by the volunteer. In addition, the volunteer will
      complete a sleep diary for at least 7 days and wear an Actiwatch (a wrist watch like device
      that measures sleep). At completion of the study, participants will be provided a print out
      of their sleep obtained from the Actiwatch.

      Participants may not be in the study if they work night shift (11 pm - 7 am) or have been
      diagnosed with a condition called sleep apnea.

      Participants need not live in Kentucky to participate in this study.
