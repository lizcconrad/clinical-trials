  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of rimonabant on the energy
      intake (kcal/day/meal) from ad-libitum high-fat dinner (primary endpoint), pre- and
      post-ingestive responses, and the hedonic evaluation of food, and its effect on food choice,
      cravings and feelings of control.

      The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of rimonabant on body weight with or
      without hypocaloric diet and its clinical and laboratory safety.
