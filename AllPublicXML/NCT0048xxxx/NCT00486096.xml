  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many children undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease have had prior operations.
      Re-operative sternotomy carries with it the risk of cardiac injury and the need for emergent
      peripheral cannulation.

      Our first aim is to demonstrate that peripheral arterial cannulation may be lifesaving in
      cases of complicated sternal re-entry in children and that angio-catheters can be utilized
      when vessels are too small for standard cannulas.

      Our secondary aim is to present a case report of successful femoral cannulation in a 5 kg
      child.

      In children, many of the standard operative sites are either occluded, stenosed, or too small
      for the smallest manufactured cannulas. In these instances, it may be feasible to utilize
      angio-catheters for arterial access until central cannulation can be achieved safely. In an
      in vitro model, we have simulated a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and arterial cannulation
      with angio-catheters.

      It appears that angio-catheters may be used with acceptable flow hemodynamics for blood
      vessels too small for standard cannulas.

      We have performed this successfully in a 5 kg child.

      We have completed the cardiopulmonary bypass model and are ready to submit the hemodynamic
      data. We would like to submit to a national meeting and hopefully for publication thereafter.
