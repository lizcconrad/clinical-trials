    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia and sickle cell thalassemia are frequent diseases among the israeli arab
      population. The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical characteristics of the
      patients in one arab village and the laboratory characteristics in the carriers of this gene
      based in the screening for pregnant women that is carried out in the population of northern
      Israel.

      The results can be useful in order to institute universal screening for sickle cell anemia in
      northern Israel.
