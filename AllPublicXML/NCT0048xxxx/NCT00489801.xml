  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as effective as comprehensive centre-based
      cardiac rehabilitation in patients older than 65 years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participation in cardiac rehabilitation is known to reduce mortality and morbidity and
      increase health related quality of life. However, participation rate are low among elderly
      cardiac patients with coronary heart disease. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation could be an
      attractive alternative to the centre-based programmes but studies investigating the effect of
      these programmes are limited and even less is known about the effect among the elderly.
