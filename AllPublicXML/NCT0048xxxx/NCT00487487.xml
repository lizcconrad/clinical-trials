    <textblock>
      Post-Poliomyelitis Syndrome (PPS) is the term describing the new problems affecting polio
      survivors many years after recovery from paralytic polio. Among the symptoms, fatigue is one
      of the most frequent and debilitating. In addition to physical incapacitation, the fatigue of
      PPS also affects mental function. The term “brain fatigue” is usually used by patients to
      express problems on the areas of attention, concentration, memory and clear thinking.
      Unfortunately, little is known about cognitive fatigue of PPS patients. This study is meant
      to examine if mental impairment is present in PPS patients and, if so, how it interferes on
      the self-function of patients. Patients will undergo an interview, clinical and neurological
      evaluation, and a battery of screening laboratory tests to make sure they are eligible for
      the study. Patients who qualify will undergo neuropsychometric tests in order to assay
      performance in the main areas of cognitive functioning. Through this organized approach we
      expect to be able to determine if mental fatigue is a significant problem affecting polio
      survivors, what areas are most affected, and how it may interfere with daily living.
