      Glargine treatment can improve the clinical features in Cystic Fibrosis patients affected by
      glucose derangements

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of glargine treatment on BMI, lung function, acute pulmonary
      infections and HbA1c in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with different glucose derangements,
      eighty-seven patients were screened for glucose derangements with fasting hyperglycaemia or
      abnormalities at the oral glucose tolerance test. They were classified on the basis of a
      “gluco-score” ranging 0-5. Patients with gluco-score &gt; 1 were treated with glargine. We
      report on the results of the first 20 patients who completed 12 months of treatment. BMI
      z-score, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), number of acute lung infections
      in the previous year and HbA1c were the study outcomes.
