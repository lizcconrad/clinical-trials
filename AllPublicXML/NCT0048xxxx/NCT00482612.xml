  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if esmirtazapine (Org 50081) is a safe and
      effective treatment for insomnia. It was anticipated that esmirtazapine would increase mean
      Total Sleep Time (TST) as recorded in sleep diaries relative to placebo.

    <measure>Average Total Sleep Time (TST) as Recorded Daily in the Sleep Diary During the 14-day In-treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>TST was defined as the total amount of time (measured in minutes) that was actually spent sleeping the previous night as recorded daily in the participant's sleep diary. TST values over the 14-day active treatment period were averaged for each participant, and average TST was then reported by treatment arm. For participants with missing data, the average of the nights for which TST data were present was used in the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Average Sleep Latency (SL) as Recorded Daily in the Sleep Diary During the 14-day In-treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>SL was defined as the duration of time measured in minutes that it took a participant to fall asleep as recorded daily in the participant's sleep diary. SL values over the 14-day active treatment period were averaged for each participant, and average SL was then reported by treatment arm. For participants with missing data, the average of the nights for which TST data were present were used in the analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE) During the 14-day In-treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of participants with an AE during the 14-day In-treatment Period was tallied for each treatment arm. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Discontinued From Study Treatment Due to an AE During the 14-day In-Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of participants discontinuing from study treatment due to experiencing an AE was tallied for each treatment arm. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>Esmirtazapine maleate was provided as tablets for oral use containing either 1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 mg of active compound. In addition, tablets contain the following excipients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, maize starch (United States Pharmacopeia [USP] name: corn starch), magnesium stearate, and lactose monohydrate.

        <title>Number of Participants Who Discontinued From Study Treatment Due to an AE During the 14-day In-Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The total number of participants discontinuing from study treatment due to experiencing an AE was tallied for each treatment arm. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
