    <textblock>
      To provide safety and effectiveness information of BeneFIX during the post-marketing period
      as required by Korea FDA regulations, to identify any potential drug related treatment
      factors in Korean population including:

      1) Unknown adverse reactions, especially serious adverse reactions; 2) Changes in the
      incidences of adverse reactions under the routine drug uses.

      3) Factors that may affect the safety of the drug 4) Factors that may affect the

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed according to severity; mild (not causing any significant problem, dose adjustment not required), moderate (caused problem that does not interfere significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, dose adjustment needed due to adverse event) and severe (caused problem that interferes significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, study drug stopped due to adverse event).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. After an onset of an AE, relevant actions were undertaken on the study drug or the participant. Actions related to study drug included: dosage reduced, dosage increased, stopped temporarily or permanently, no action taken; actions related to participants included: withdrawal from the study, concomitant medication, no action taken or any other as per physician's discretion.</description>

    <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Seriousness of an AE was assessed under the criteria of serious adverse event (SAE). An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Outcome in Response to Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>

Outcome of an AE was assessed based on response to a question 'Is the adverse event still present?' as 'yes', 'unknown' or 'no-resolved'.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) by Relationship</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AE: untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug without regard to causal relationship. All causalities and drug-related AEs reported. Drug-related AEs based on physician's discretion: certain (AE after drug intake, not explained by other drugs, reaction on drug cessation [DC], relapse on re-intake of drug), probable/likely (AE after drug intake, not explained by other drugs, reaction on DC, no information on re-intake), possible (AE after drug intake, explained by other drugs, no information on DC), unlikely (not related to drug intake time, explained by other drugs).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Unexpected Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was calculated as the number of bleeds requiring administration of BeneFIX (for on-demand therapy and surgery), divided by total period of bleeding multiplied by 365.25. Total period of bleeding is the number of days on treatment for prophylaxis purpose and on-demand therapy and surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
