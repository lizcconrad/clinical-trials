        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetes Mellitus 1st type, with НbA1c level in the range of ≥ 6,5 - &lt;=11%, receiving
             the regimen of multiple injections of insulin during one year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active proliferative diabetic retinopathy connected with focal or panretinal
             photocoagulation or vitrectomy carried out within 6 months before visit 1, or any
             unstable (quickly progressive) form of retinopathy, which may need in surgical
             intervention (including laser photocoagulation) during study

          -  Diabetes Mellitus of the 2nd type

          -  Patients transmitted pancreatectomy

          -  Patients transmitted transplantation of pancreas or islet cells

          -  Probable therapy by means of products not approved by study minutes during the study

          -  Anamnestic indications of convulsive disorders

          -  Allergic reaction on insulin or any filler of preparation Apidra (glulisine)

          -  Clinical serious diseases of cardiovascular system, liver, nervous system, endocrine
             system, oncologic diseases or other serious system diseases, which complicate keeping
             of minutes or interpretation of study results, and, at the investigator's opinion,
             impede the safe participation of patients in study

          -  Drug addiction or alcoholism

          -  Disturbance of liver functions confirmed with the increase of ALT or AST activity up
             to the level twice as high as the upper standard limit (these indications may not be
             single)

          -  Disturbance of functions of kidneys confirmed with the level of creatinine in serum
             that is more than 177 mµmol/l at visit 1 (this indication may not be single)

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding
