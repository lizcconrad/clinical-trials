      This study is designed to determine if the following are true. When protein requirements
      exceed metabolic requirements, blood urea nitrogen(BUN) levels will rise. Elevated BUN levels
      in the absence of renal failure, hepatic failure, or GI bleeding, will be correlated with
      improved nitrogen balance and inversely correlated with infection rates, days of mechanical
      ventilation, ICU days, and total hospital days.

      The purpose of this study is threefold. First, to determine if a correlation exists between
      BUN and nitrogen balance in the context of hyperproteic nutrition administration. Creatinine
      clearance will also be followed to determine if there is any harmful effect to the kidney
      secondary to an elevated BUN. Secondly, to determine if there is a difference in hospital
      acquired infection rate, ventilator days, ICU days, and hospital stay between the current
      nutrition standard at Penn State Hershey Medical Center and a hyperproteic nutrition
      protocol. Thirdly, to determine the accuracy of at least three calculated creatinine
      clearance formulae when compared to a measured creatinine clearance.
