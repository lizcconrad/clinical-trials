      Experimental design overview The proposed project is a prospective experimental study design.
      Children (age &lt;15) suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that their
      Parents willing to participate in the study will be tested with well-established measuring
      techniques of Balance control before and 1 hour after taking of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) in
      the movement and Rehabilitation Laboratory at BGU. An automated algorithm will be used to
      extract standardized stabilogram-diffusion parameters from each of the COP data sets
      collected during quiet standing. These parameters include diffusion coefficients, critical
      displacement, critical time and scaling exponents for both lateral and anterior-posterior
      sway directions (Collins &amp; De Luca, 1993). For each of the conditions (before and 1 hour
      after the use of Ritalin) in three task conditions single task; dual task (concentrating and
      identifying specific music); and just Listening to a relaxing music. Participants will be
      required to stand on the platform 10 times for 30 s. For each trial, they will be instructed
      to sway as little as possible.
