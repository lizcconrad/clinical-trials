  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, avian influenza (AI) has become a major health concern. The development
      of a safe and effective vaccine against H5N1 infection is important. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the safety of a new AI vaccine in healthy adults.

    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization, the current pandemic risk associated with avian
      influenza H5N1 infection is serious, as an increasing number of humans are infected.
      Currently, H5N1 influenza transmission occurs in humans when they are exposed through direct
      contact to infected poultry or surfaces and objects contaminated by infected poultry feces. A
      pandemic occurs when a new influenza subtype emerges that infects humans, causes serious
      illness, and spreads easily among humans. The development of a safe and effective vaccine is
      necessary, should a pandemic occur. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of a live, attenuated A1 virus vaccine, H5N1 (6-2) AA ca Recombinant (A/Hong
      Kong/213/2003 x A/AnnArbor/6/60 ca).

      This study will last approximately 16 weeks. Participation in this study includes a hospital
      stay in an isolation unit at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. All participants will
      receive two doses of vaccine in nasal spray form, at study entry and sometime between 4 and 8
      weeks after initial vaccination. Participants will be admitted to the isolation unit 2 days
      prior to each vaccination. A targeted physical exam will occur daily following each
      vaccination until discharge. Participants will not be discharged until nasal washes are
      negative. Vital signs measurement will be done at least twice daily for the duration of the
      inpatient stay. A follow-up outpatient visit will occur approximately 4 weeks following each
      vaccination. Blood and urine collection will occur at selected timepoints throughout the
      study.
