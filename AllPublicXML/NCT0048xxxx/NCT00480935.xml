      Study Hypothesis: Patients with local renal cell carcinoma who are treated neoadjuvantly with
      Sutent may show a radiologic response to the study drug (Sutent).

      The study is looking at the neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) administration of Sutent in patients
      with localized kidney cancer. The purpose of this research is also to evaluate both the
      safety and effectiveness of Sutent in this patient population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sutent will be given at 50 mg once daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 1 week rest
      period. The dosage may change during the cycle due to possible drug toxicities. The
      nephrectomy will then take place following a one-week washout period. After surgery, patients
      will have follow-up visits at 6 weeks and 3 months. Patients will be followed for 3 years
      after completions to assess late toxicities, time to progression and progression-free
      survival.
