      This project will attempt to validate the utilization of a stable isotope kinetic biomarker
      (KineMarkerTM) as a predictive test for disease progression in early stage chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

    <textblock>
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in the western world, is
      characterized by a pathological expansion of leukemic B cells. The clinical course of CLL is
      remarkably heterogeneous; some patients have relatively aggressive disease requiring early
      treatment, others have highly indolent disease that does not require current anti-leukemia
      therapy until many years after diagnosis. Current staging systems have not been able to
      predict which patients in early or intermediate risk stages will undergo disease progression
      and which will undergo an indolent course. Universal treatment of all patients with early
      stage disease has been shown to be more harmful than beneficial. As such, early
      identification of patients who will have more aggressive disease soon after diagnosis has
      been a major goal in CLL research.

      In response to this need for a reliable prognostic marker, KineMed is investigating the use
      of CLL kinetics as a biomarker for subsequent disease progression. This test assesses B-Cell
      kinetics directly through an in vivo kinetic measurement of tumor DNA synthesis and
      catabolism by combining 2H2O labeling and state of the art analytic instrumentation.
