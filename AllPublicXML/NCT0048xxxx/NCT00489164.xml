      The main objective of this study is to assess in-stent late lumen loss in diabetic patients
      with de novo native coronary lesions using the sirolimus-eluting Bx VELOCITYÃ¤ stent as
      compared to the Bx VELOCITY balloon-expandable stent.

             treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemics by medical history. (Undocumented or
             newly diagnosed diabetics must have fasting plasma glucose of &gt;/= 126 mg/dl or a 2h
             post-load value in the OGTT &gt;/=200 mg/dl, confirmed on alternate days);

          3. Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must plan to
             be on accepted method of contraception for 6 months after time of enrollment;

             Classification B&amp;C, I-II-III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia;

          5. Treatment of lesions in native coronary arteries requiring a maximum of three stents
             per patient. Multi-vessel treatment is permissible. Additional stents may be used for
             procedural complications such as dissections. Patients with additional lesions can be
             included only if the other lesions are not considered clinically significant and do
             not require treatment;

          6. Target lesion is &gt;/=2.25 and &lt;/=3.0 in diameter (visual estimate);

          7. Individual lesions are &gt;/=10 mm to &lt;/= 32 mm in length located in a native coronary
             artery;

          8. Target lesions are de novo lesions in native coronary vessels;

          9. Acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG);

             is approved by the local Institutional Review Board.

             total CK&gt;2 times normal within the preceding 24 hours and the CK and CK-MB enzymes
             remains above normal at the time of treatment;

          2. Unprotected left main coronary disease with 50% stenosis;

          3. Significant (&gt;/=50%) stenoses proximal or distal to the target lesion that might
             require revascularization or impede runoff;

          4. Patients admitted for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis &gt;/= 2 times in the past six
             months (Brittle Diabetics);

         14. Target lesion has excessive tortuosity unsuitable for stent delivery and deployment;

         15. Pretreatment with devices other than balloon angioplasty (direct stenting is not
             allowed);

         16. Target lesion involves bifurcation including a side branch &gt;/=2.5mm in diameter
             (either stenosis of both main vessel and major branch or stenosis of just major
             branch) that would require side branch stenting which is likely to occur if side
             branch is diseased and intended to be stented;

         17. Previous brachytherapy of target vessel;

         18. Recipient of heart transplant;

         19. Patient with a life expectancy less than 12 months;

         20. Known allergies to aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) and ticlopidine (Ticlid),
             heparin, stainless steel, contrast agent or sirolimus, that cannot be medically
             managed;

         21. Any significant medical condition which in the investigator's opinion may interfere
             with the patient's optimal participation in the study;

         22. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study;

         23. Treatment with Metformin (glucophage) within 48 hours of angiogram.
