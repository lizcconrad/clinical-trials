      This postmarketing surveillance study will evaluate the safety profile of Prevenar in Indian
      children.

      Prevenar is indicated for active immunization of infants and children from 6 weeks of age
      through 9 years of age against invasive disease (including meningitis, bacteraemic pneumonia,
      bacteraemia, sepsis) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and
      23F.

      Prevenar has been marketed in India since June 2006. The Board of Health in India has given
      restricted permission to import and market Prevenar. The present study is a post-approval
      regulatory commitment to the Board of Health in India.

      This is an observational study and the protocol for the study has been approved by the Board
      of Health.
