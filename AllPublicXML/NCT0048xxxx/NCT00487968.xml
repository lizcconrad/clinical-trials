      Based on a need for a pediatric formulation of eltrombopag for the treatment of pediatric
      thrombocytopenia, this study will help determine the best tasting pediatric formulation of
      eltrombopag. Healthy adult volunteers who are able to taste bitterness and who do not have a
      high sensitivity to bitterness will be enrolled. The subjects will evaluate different
      formulations and rate them based on the bitterness and effectiveness of sweetners. The
      outcome of this study will help support a decision for a new pediatric formulation of
      eltrombopag.
