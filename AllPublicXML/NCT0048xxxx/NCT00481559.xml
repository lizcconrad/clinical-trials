  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is for the treatment of toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (&gt;1 micromole
      per liter) in patients with delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This treatment protocol will be available on a cost recovery basis to IRB-approved
      Investigators treating an eligible patient at any site in the US. In order to continue to
      make Voraxaze™ available following FDA approval and prior to being commercially available.
      Protherics needs to charge for the product, so there will be a cost to obtain Voraxaze™ under
      the Open-Label Treatment Protocol. Protherics is permitted under the FDA regulations (21 CFR
      312.8) to charge for Voraxaze, to recover those costs associated with its manufacture,
      research and development, and handling, but do not include other commercial costs (profit).

      Patient eligibility is based on MTX concentrations and laboratory values obtained per
      standard of care. Once an Investigator identifies a potential patient, he/she will contact
      the Voraxaze central call center (1-877-398-9829) to receive information regarding drug
      shipment. Eligible patients will have routine demographic, MTX, and Voraxaze therapy
      information collected.

      Each patient will receive a single dose of Voraxaze 50 Units/kg in a bolus intravenous
      injection over 5 minutes. In addition to Voraxaze, patients will continue to receive standard
      of care treatment including leucovorin therapy, and supportive care such as hydration,
      alkalinization of urine and, if necessary, hemoperfusion/dialysis.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients of any age who are experiencing delayed MTX clearance due to
             impaired renal function will be eligible to receive Voraxaze if the have toxic plasma
             MTX concentrations (&gt;1 micromole per liter).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Voraxaze is not indicated for use in patients who exhibit the expected clearance of
             MTX (plasma MTX concentrations within 2 standard deviations of the mean MTX excretion
             curve specific for the dose of MTX administered) or those with normal or mildly
             impaired renal function because of the potential risk of sub therapeutic exposure to
             MTX.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to Voraxaze (glucarpidase, carboxypeptidases)

        Patients intolerant to lactose in food (e.g., dairy products) can still receive Voraxaze.
