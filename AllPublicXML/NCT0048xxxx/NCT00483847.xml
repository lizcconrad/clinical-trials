      The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence and pattern of serious
      infections, malignancies, and other serious adverse events (SAEs) in participants with
      multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with TYSABRI (natalizumab).

      The TYSABRI Global Observational Program in Safety for Rest of World (TYGRIS - ROW)is a
      safety observational cohort program designed to obtain long-term safety data in multiple
      sclerosis (MS) participants treated with TYSABRI in a clinical practice setting in countries
      other than the United States and Canada.

      The Prescribing Physician will collect participant information at routine clinic visits
      (using standard data collection tools) at approximately 6-month intervals for 5 years from
      the first TYSABRI infusion.
