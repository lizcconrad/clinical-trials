    <textblock>
      We investigated, whether abdominal hot compresses effect hepatic blood flow. Our hypothesis
      was, that the hot compresses might either by local vasomotor-reflex or by decreasing the tone
      of the sympathetic nerve system increase hepatic blood flow.

      Abdominal hot compresses are traditionally used by patients with liver diseases as self help.
      This study investigated the effect of abdominal hot compresses on hepatic blood flow measured
      by elimination of indocyanine green (ICG), a non-toxic green dye. It was presumed, that
      abdominal hot compresses increase hepatic blood flow either by local vasomotor-reflex or by
      decreasing the tone of the sympathetic nerve system.

      In healthy volunteers ICG elimination was measured with and without hot compress at two
      investigations in a weekly interval. At each investigation ICG was injected as bolus after a
      rest period of 10 minutes. After the injection blood was taken in regular intervals for
      analysis of ICG concentration over a period of 40 minutes and half life was calculated.

      The time interval between the investigations was 8 days, the sequence was randomly assigned.
