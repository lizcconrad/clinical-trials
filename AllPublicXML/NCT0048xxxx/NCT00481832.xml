    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to develop an alternative treatment for patients with poor risk
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This trial uses a combination of high dose chemotherapy with stem
      cell transplant using the patient's own cells. This is followed with non-myeloablative
      transplant using stem cells from a related or unrelated donor to try and generate an
      anti-lymphoma response from the new immune system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients with recurrent or primary refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are treated
      with second-line chemotherapy (usually 2-3 courses) for the purpose of cytoreduction and to
      establish sensitivity to chemotherapy. Thereafter, peripheral blood progenitor cells are
      mobilized with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony stimulating factor, apheresed and
      cryopreserved. The standard high dose regimen consists of augmented carmustine, etoposide and
      cyclophosphamide. Unfortunately, there are subgroups of patients with poor outcomes using
      autologous transplantation including those with transformed lymphoma as well as patients who
      do not attain a minimal disease state due to chemoresistant disease.

      These groups of patients have limited disease control and survival with standard chemotherapy
      regimens, and although they often have excellent cytoreduction with the high-dose
      chemotherapy regimen, relapse remains the primary cause of treatment failure. The current
      trial utilizes a similar approach that has been taken with patients with multiple myeloma,
      who appear to benefit from an allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effect, using a combined
      autologous and non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant regimen to reduce transplant-related
      complications. Eligible patients will be treated with high-dose chemotherapy using BCNU,
      etoposide and cyclophosphamide with autologous hematopoietic cell support as a method of
      cytoreduction. Approximately 60-120 days after the autologous transplant, patients will
      receive an allogeneic transplant using a preparative regimen of total lymphoid irradiation
      and anti-thymocyte globulin in an attempt to develop a graft-versus-lymphoma effect.

             are eligible. Patients with a prior malignancy treated &lt; 5 years ago but have a life

          <description>A transplant regimen that conditions the subjects using total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and anti-thymocyte globulin(ATG) which will reduce acute graft-vs-host disease to negligible rates while maintaining the anti-tumor graft vs lymphoma GvL benefit. Along with TLI/ATG regiment; Solumedrol will be used as pre-medication and anti-emetic for any side effects. For stem cell mobilization, participants will be given either B Cell NLH or T Cell NHL. Before the filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBPC infusion: acetaminophen, diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone will also be given as another set of pre-medications. BCNU, Etoposide, and Cyclophosphamide will be used as a preparative regimen. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil will be administered as an immunosuppressant after transplantation. Lastly, rituximab will be infused at the end of the transplantation regimen.</description>

          <title>T &amp; B Cell Mobilization Auto &amp; Allo HCT</title>
          <description>A transplant regimen that conditions the subjects using total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and anti-thymocyte globulin(ATG) which will reduce acute graft-vs-host disease to negligible rates while maintaining the anti-tumor graft vs lymphoma GvL benefit. Along with TLI/ATG regiment; Solumedrol will be used as pre-medication and anti-emetic for any side effects. For stem cell mobilization, participants will be given either B Cell NLH or T Cell NHL. Before the filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBPC infusion: acetaminophen, diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone will also be given as another set of pre-medications. BCNU, Etoposide, and Cyclophosphamide will be used as a preparative regimen. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil will be administered as an immunosuppressant after transplantation. Lastly, rituximab will be infused at the end of the transplantation regimen.</description>
