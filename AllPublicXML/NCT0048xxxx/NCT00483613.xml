      -  Daily stress can worsens the clinical course of lupus.

        -  Objective: to determine the efficacy of the stress management therapy in a group of
           patients with lupus.

        -  45 patients with lupus and high daily stress participated in this clinical trial.

        -  Two groups resulted: a control group (CG) that received the usual care and a therapy
           group (TG) that received a cognitive behavioral therapy.

        -  The therapy consisted of ten consecutive weekly sessions.

        -  The measured variables were psychological, clinical, immunological and quality of life.
           At the basal moment and after 3, 9 and 15 months.

        -  Statistical analysis showed a significant reduction in the levels of depression, anxiety
           and daily stress in the therapy group, compared to the usual care group, a significant
           improvement in quality of life, improvements in the reported symptoms (cardiovascular,
           respiratory, cutaneous and musculoskeletal.

      Stress, especially daily stress, worsens the lupus symptoms perceived by the patients. Our
      objective was to determine the efficacy of the Meichenbaum stress management therapy for
      dealing with high daily stress in a group of patients with lupus.

      We designed a randomized clinical trial in which 45 patients with lupus and daily stress
      participated. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: a) a
      control group (CG) that received the usual care and b) a therapy group (TG) that received a
      cognitive behavioral type therapy, performed by a group of 3 psychologists. Both groups were
      similar with regard to their sociodemographic, clinical, immunological, psychological aspects
      at the basal moment. The therapy consisted of ten consecutive weekly sessions. Psychological
      and emotional, clinical, immunological variables and quality of life were evaluated at the
      basal moment and after 3, 9 and 15 months.

      The between-groups analysis showed a significant reduction in the levels of depression,
      anxiety and daily stress in the TG, compared to the CG, throughout the entire follow-up
      period, as well as a significant improvement in quality of life. The results also showed
      improvements in the reported symptoms (cardiovascular, respiratory, cutaneous and
      musculoskeletal) in the patients from the TG, who showed significant differences with regard
      to their basal level and in comparison with CG patients. This study shows the efficacy of the
      Meichenbaum stress management therapy in patients with lupus and high daily stress, as it
      significantly reduces the incidence of psychological disorders related to suffering from
      lupus, and it significantly improves and maintains their quality of life, in spite of the
      absence of a significant reduction in the illness activity index.
