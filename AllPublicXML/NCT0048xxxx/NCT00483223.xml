  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to :

        -  Determine how effective cisplatin or carboplatin is in slowing the time it takes for ER
           negative (estrogen-receptor-negative), PR negative (progesterone receptor-negative),
           HER2 negative (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) breast cancer to progress.
           Cisplatin and carboplatin are anti-cancer chemotherapy drugs that stop cancer cells from
           growing abnormally and is used to treat other cancers.

        -  Evaluate a new biomarker to help determine which breast cancers are most likely to
           respond to cisplatin chemotherapy

      The hypothesis is that Triple Negative metastatic breast cancer may be particularly sensitive
      to platinum, and that a subgroup of those patients may have a marker in their tumors that
      predicts response.

      This study is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate cisplatin/carboplatin as first or second
      line therapy in metastatic triple negative (ER negative, PR negative, Her2 Negative) breast
      cancer and to evaluate the expression of p63/p73 as a biomarker to predict response.

        -  Participants will be given a cisplatin or carboplatin infusion intravenously on the
           first day of each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle will last 3 weeks. Treating
           physician will select agent up to 41 patients in each cohort. Final primary endpoint
           analysis will use combined cis/carbo results.

        -  During all treatment cycles participants will have a physical exam (including weight and
           vital signs) and they will be asked general questions about their health and any
           medications they may be taking, as well as specific questions about any side effects
           they may be experiencing while receiving study treatment.

        -  During every treatment cycle participants will have standard blood tests to check blood
           counts, liver and kidney function, and a blood marker for you particular type of cancer.

        -  CT scans will be taken of the participants tumor every 2 to 3 cycles to assess the
           response of the tumor to cisplatin.

        -  Participants will be in this study for as long as they tolerate the study treatment and
           their disease does not get any worse.

        -  Participants will be required to have a sample of their original tumor sent to
           Massachusetts General Hospital for correlative studies, or a sample from a metastatic
           diagnostic biopsy.

        -  Patients with accessible tumor will be asked to provide an optional metastatic tumor
           biopsy for correlative studies.

    <description>Objective response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR]+ partial response [PR]) by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors).
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD (longest diameter) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions</description>

    <measure>Response Rate Categorized by p63/p73 Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate categorized by pre-specified ΔNp63/TAp73 expression ratio cutoff in the primary tumors from this patient cohort as a bio-marker to predict response to cisplatin or carboplatin. Response is defined as partial or completed response as determined by RECIST. Expression ratio was measured using quantitative RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction).</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate Categorized by Subgroup</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants achieving an objective response (as determined by RECIST) categorized by treatment cohort and whether the treatment was first or second line treatment. First line treatment means that the drug used was the first drug used for the treatment of the primary cancer. Second line treatment means that a first line treatment failed to produce the desired response, so a new drug was used for treatment.</description>

          <title>Stage at initial diagnosis of breast cancer</title>
          <description>This describes the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis according to the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) Version 7. Generally, stage 1 is a cancer that is less than 2 cm and lymph node negative, stage 2 is a tumor between 2-5 cm and/or 1-3 lymph nodes positive, and stage 3 is a tumor with more than 3 lymph nodes positive or a tumor invading the skin. Stage 4 indicates that the cancer has spread into distant parts of the body. In general, lower stage cancers have a better prognosis, and higher stage cancers are more advanced.</description>
