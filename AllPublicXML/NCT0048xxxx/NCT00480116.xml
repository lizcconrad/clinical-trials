  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study vaccine has been developed for use in pre-dialysis/ haemodialysis patients and
      immuno-compromised individuals who could have or had a sub-optimal response following
      vaccination for hepatitis B with currently available commercial vaccines (target population).
      This study will aim to confirm in a clinical setting the consistency of production of three
      lots of the vaccine.

      Double-blind, randomised, single centre study with three groups receiving three different
      lots of Henogen's adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine according to 0, 1 months schedule. Blood
