  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will address the question of whether early application of the Non-pneumatic
      Anti-Shock Garment (NASG) at the Satellite Health Facility (SHF) level before transport to a
      Referral Hospital (RH) will decrease maternal mortality and morbidity. The available evidence
      indicates that the NASG substantially decreases blood loss, but there is no evidence that its
      application will reduce extreme adverse outcomes. It is also not known if possible side
      effects associated with NASG use might outweigh potential benefits. This study would
      rigorously test the effectiveness of the NASG using an experimental design with adequate
      power to detect statistically significant decreases in morbidity and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of NASG
      application as a first-aid device at the SHFs before transfer to Referral Hospitals (RHs).

      The first step will include start-up activities and formative data collection, including
      facility staff training in data collection, how to collect blood in the closed-end blood
      collection drape, and in an evidence-based standardized clinical protocol for obstetric
      hemorrhage prevention and hemorrhage and shock management. Next will be a period of baseline
      data collection at the RHs and SHFs, during which clinical and demographic data will be
      collected from women diagnosed with obstetric hemorrhage and shock. After this baseline data
      collection period, we will introduce the study intervention, initially at the RHs and then at
      SHFs.

      The intervention will include: review of study protocol differences between baseline and the
      NASG-intervention phases, provision of the NASG, detailed training on the use of NASG for
      health care providers and staff, as well as on-site support and supervision for use of the
      NASG. After the RH providers are fully trained and have become proficient in NASG use, SHFs
      will be randomized into 19 intervention and 19 control facilities. Intervention SHFs will
      receive the NASG training described above, while control SHFs will receive a refresher
      training on the topics included in the baseline training.

      The final step will be three years of NASG-intervention data collection at the RHs and the
      SHFs on women diagnosed with obstetric hemorrhage and shock on the same outcomes collected in
      the baseline period. A total of approximately 2,340 women from the SHFs will be included in
      the NASG-intervention data collection phase of the cluster randomized trial: 1,170 women in
      the intervention group and 1,170 women in the control group.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        To participate in these study activities, women must be willing and able to participate, be
        able to sign or mark a consent form, and speak one of the languages into which the consent
        form has been translated, including English, Nyanja, and Bemba in Zambia, and English,
        Shona and Ndebele in Zimbabwe.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or postpartum and experiencing obstetric hemorrhage with 2 of
             the following 3:

        blood loss &gt; 500 mL (at SHF, 1000 mL at RH) SBP &lt;100 mm Hg pulse &gt;100 bpm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absolute exclusion criteria include: current viable third trimester intrauterine
             pregnancy that can be delivered in the next 20 minutes after hemorrhage begins and/or
             current bleeding sites above the diaphragm. Relative exclusion criteria include: a
             history or current clinical evidence of mitral stenosis or congestive heart failure
             (CHF). These must be relative contraindications that will be assessed at the time of
             hemorrhage and clinical judgment will need to be utilized to evaluate each case
             individually. Thus if the patient can be transported and delivered rapidly and is
             suspected or known to have valvular heart disease, she will be excluded from the
             study. In other cases, depending on the severity of the hemorrhage, if the patient is
             dyspneic in the NASG, at the SHF level, the NASG will be loosened, if that does not
             result in relief, the NASG will be removed. If the patients at the RH have decreasing
             oxygen saturation levels as demonstrated by pulse oximeter, the NASG will be loosened,
             if that does not result in relief, the NASG will be removed.

        Women suffering obstetric hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock who have no detectable vital
        signs (non palpable pulse and BP) at the time of their arrival at the RH are ineligible for
        enrolment in the study (&quot;non-resuscitable&quot;) if: 1) the woman does not respond to
        resuscitation attempts after 30 minutes and 2) more than three hours have elapsed between
        the start of hemorrhage and the beginning of her treatment. (As this is a clinical
        intervention of a potentially life saving device, the study clinicians should try the NASG
        on any patient if they feel it may resuscitate her; however, if the woman meets the
        criteria above they are ineligible for having their data entered into the study.)
