  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left myocardial infarction (MI), has a negative impact of long term morbidity and mortality.
      Even in patients treated successfully by angioplasty in the acute phase of infarct, the
      remodelling is observed in approximately 30% of cases. It is important to predict the
      occurrence of this phenomenon in the early phase after MI for the selection of patients who
      could eventually benefit from new therapeutic approach as for example cell replacement
      therapy. It has been advocated that stem cells coronary injections should be performed
      between the 5th and 10th day after an acute event. We hypothesise that a low dose dobutamine
      gated Tc-99m-mibi SPECT performed on 5th-6th day after reperfused acute MI can predict left
      ventricular remodelling and serve as a method to screen patients who could benefit from cell
      replacement therapy.

      All patients will be evaluated by ce-MRI during the initial hospital stay (5th - 6th day) and
      at 6-month follow-up. Left ventricular remodelling will be defined as an end-diastolic volume
      increase of &gt;20% between the two exams. A low dose dobutamine gated Tc-99m-mibi SPECT will be
      also performed on 5th-6th day. Differences in the infarct size and severity as well as the
      residual inotrope reserve in the infarct area are expected between groups with and without
      remodelling.
