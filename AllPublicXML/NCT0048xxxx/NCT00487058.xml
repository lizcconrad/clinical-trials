  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the tolerability, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of gimatecan in
      Japanese patients. Gimatecan is administered orally twice per week, every 28 days, to adult
      patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed despite standard therapy or for whom
      standard systemic therapy dose not exist.
