  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to intensively characterize the immune response, particularly
      the T-cell response, to a three-dose regimen of an adenovirus-based HIV-1 vaccine in
      HIV-uninfected adults.

      This study will look for relationships among the immune responses induced by MRKAd5 HIV-1
      gag/pol/nef vaccine. The study will also determine if the T cells that respond to different
      vaccine epitopes have correspondingly different functional profiles. The study will evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimen as well.

      This study will last 60 weeks. All enrolled participants will receive vaccinations at Weeks
      0, 4, and 26. There will be between 8 and 20 study visits including the screening visit,
      depending on the site location. A physical exam, interview, and blood collection will occur
      at most or all visits. All participants will undergo leukapheresis approximately 4 weeks
      after their last vaccination and at Week 52. Medical history, an HIV test, a pregnancy test,
      and HIV and risk reduction counseling will occur at selected visits. Additional blood
      collection is now occurring in this study to collect more information about the relationship
      between the immune response and efficacy to the vaccine.
