  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine behavioral and functional brain changes occuring as a
      result of cognitive remediation training in patients with schizophrenia. Extension and
      specificity of related changes will also be examined.

    <description>Patients in the cognitive REM condition attended up to 25 h of training in small groups over 4-6 weeks based on the approach to cognitive remediation described by Wexler and Bell (2005). Patients performed tasks designed to train attention and memory from the battery available within a computerized software package (CogPack Marker Software). This training protocol has been shown to improve memory and executive functioning in patients with schizophrenia (Sartory et al, 2005) and tasks chosen were designed to produce improved working memory and attention capacity in the treated group. In addition, patients in the REM group trained on the word N-back one to two times a week and on N-back tasks using a variety of other stimuli (such as faces) one to two times a week to support the generalization of working memory improvements.</description>

    <description>Patients in the CBSST group also attended up to 25 h of treatment but followed a manualized group therapy protocol (Granholm et al, 2005) using cognitive and behavioral therapy methods to increase patients' skills in symptom recognition, communication, problem solving, and relapse prevention. In both conditions, the facilitators interacted with the clients throughout small group (B4 patients) sessions: in the REM group, this mostly involved brief one-on-one discussions regarding task performance; in the CBSST condition, this interaction was in the context of the group milieu.</description>
