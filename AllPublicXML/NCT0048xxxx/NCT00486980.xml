          -  A Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) performed on an adequate specimen collected from an
             anterior nasal swab. A negative initial RAT may be repeated within one hour of
             obtaining a negative result.

          -  Presence of fever at time of screening of ≥38.0 ºC (≥100.4 ºF) taken orally, or ≥38.5
             ºC (≥101.2 ºF) taken rectally. For subjects with a positive RAT at the time of
             screening, a subject self-report of a history of fever or feverishness within the 24
             hours prior to screening will also qualify for enrollment in the absence of documented

             asthma

          -  History of congestive heart failure requiring daily pharmacotherapy with symptoms
             consistent with New York Heart Association Class IV functional status within the past
             12 months

          -  History of chronic renal impairment requiring hemodialysis and/or known or suspected
             to have moderate or severe renal impairment (actual or estimated creatinine clearance
             &lt;50 mL/min)

          -  Current clinical evidence of active bacterial infection at any body site that requires
             therapy with oral or systemic antibiotics

          -  Presence of immunocompromised status due to chronic illness, previous organ
             transplant, or use of immunosuppressive medical therapy

          -  Current treatment for active viral hepatitis C
