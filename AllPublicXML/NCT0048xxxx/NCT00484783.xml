  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NOTES access is safe and feasible in the controlled human setting and comparable to
      standard-of-care surgical techniques. NOTES exploration of the abdomen provides adequate
      visualization comparable to laparoscopy.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining peritoneal
      cavity access from natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) during combined
      laparoscopic-endoscopic foregut surgery. Post-operative course will be compared with a
      historical chart-review control group of patients undergoing standard laparoscopic foregut
      and urologic surgery.

      The study group will be compiled by open enrollment for male and female adult subjects
      scheduled for combined laparoscopic-endoscopic surgery of the stomach, abdominal esophagus,
      prostate, bladder, proximal small intestine or who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
      historical chart-review control group will be randomly chosen from patients from 2003-2006
      having undergone combined laparoscopic-endoscopic surgery of the foregut, prostate, or
      bladder and as determined by CPT coding.

      The purpose of the study is to determine if NOTES access and abdominal exploration is
      feasible, safe, offers comparable visualization to laparoscopy in a controlled human setting.

    <description>Patients will have the standard laparoscopic procedure and the NOTES procedure will be added. The surgical procedure will require two operating teams: one led by a laparoscopic surgeon, the other by an endoscopic surgeon. During the usual course of the surgery, the flexible endoscope will be passed through the mouth urethra top gain access to the peritoneal cavity.</description>
