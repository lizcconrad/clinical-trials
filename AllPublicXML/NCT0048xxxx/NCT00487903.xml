      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate various commercially available ultrasound
      systems and to identify imaging parameters to be used with these systems (along with the
      contrast agent PB127) as well as to further evaluate the safety of PB127.

          2. Patients (≥ 18 years old) with known or suspected CAD, scheduled for or undergone
             clinically indicated coronary angiography within 28 days prior to or following Study
             Day 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to provide written informed consent

          2. Women who are pregnant or lactating

               2. Ultrasound contrast agents (including PB127 and excipients)

               3. Blood, blood products, albumin, egg whites, or protein

          4. Use of caffeine or xanthine containing products within the 24 hours prior to PB127
             administration on Study Day 1

          5. Previous exposure to PB127

          6. Inadequate echocardiographic windows

          7. Heart transplant

          8. Known right to left shunt, including atrial septal defect

          9. History of CABG

         10. Current uncontrolled ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia,
             or atrial flutter

         11. Pacemaker or defibrillator

         12. Unstable angina grade CCS Class IV severity with ongoing symptoms and/or ongoing
             infusion of IV nitroglycerin

         13. Second degree or greater heart block

         14. Hypertension (SPB &gt;200 and/or DBP &gt;110 mmHg on two consecutive readings within 1 hour
             prior to PB127 administration)

         15. Hypotension (SPB &lt;90 mmHg on two consecutive readings within 1 hour prior to PB127
             administration)

         16. Severe aortic stenosis (&gt;100 mmHg peak transvalvar gradient or &lt;0.6 cm2 estimated
             valve area)

         17. Pulmonary edema within the 7 days prior to Study Day 1

         18. Resting oxygen saturation of less than 90%

         19. Q wave MI within the 7 days prior to Study Day 1

         20. PTCA within the 28 days prior to Study Day 1

         21. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchospastic airway disease which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, is significant enough to contraindicate dipyridamole

         22. Known history of severe pulmonary hypertension characterized by estimated pulmonary
             artery systolic pressure of &gt;50 mmHg

         23. Liver disease, characterized by or including one or more of the following

               1. Elevated total bilirubin &gt;upper limit of normal

               2. Currently elevated hepatic enzymes &gt;3X upper limit of normal

         24. Medical conditions or other circumstances that would significantly decrease the
             chances of obtaining reliable data or achieving the study objectives (i.e., drug
             dependence, psychiatric disorder, dementia, or associated illness); extenuating
             circumstances or medical conditions that make it unlikely that a patient can complete
             the clinical trial or follow up evaluations; or other reasons for expected poor
             compliance with the clinical investigator's instructions
