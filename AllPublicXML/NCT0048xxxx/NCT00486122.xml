      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that atomoxetine administered orally,
      once a day, at doses up to 1.4 mg/kg/day for approximately 6 weeks given in the morning is
      superior to placebo in children with ADHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have ADHD that meets disease diagnostic criteria as defined by
             DSM-IV-Revised

          -  Males or females who are at least 6 years old and no more than 12 years old prior to
             visit 2

          -  Patients must be able to swallow capsules

          -  Patients must be of normal intelligence in the judgment of the investigator. Normal
             intelligence is defined as being without evidence of significant general intellectual
             deficit and expected to achieve a score of 70 or more if formal IQ testing were
             administered.

          -  Laboratory results must show no significant abnormalities (significance is defined as
             laboratory values requiring acute medical intervention, indicating a serious medical
             illness, or requiring further medical evaluation in the judgment of the investigator)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who weigh less than 20 kg or greater than 65 kg at study entry (visit 1)

          -  Patients who have a documented history of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder, or
             psychosis

          -  Patients who have documented autism, Asperger's syndrome, or pervasive developmental
             disorder.

          -  Other comorbid psychiatric disorders are not excluded provided that the diagnosis of
             ADHD predates the comorbid disorder, and that the ADHD symptoms are the primary source
             of impairment for the patient

          -  Patients taking any antipsychotic medication during the 4 weeks prior to visit 1 are
             not eligible.
