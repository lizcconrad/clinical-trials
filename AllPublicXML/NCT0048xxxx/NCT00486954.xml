    <description>The Common Terminology Criteria for Advere Events (CTCAE) is a descriptive terminology that can be used for AE reporting. Grade (G) refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade (G) refers to the severity of the AE: G 1, mild AE; G 2, moderate AE; G 3, severe AE; G 4, life-threatening/disabling AE; G 5, death related to the AE.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-STO22 is a 22-item, self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 scales and 4 single items to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues related to dysphagia, eating restrictions, reflux, and abdominal pain, as well as specific symptoms that may occur during chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Scores are averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. For the symptom scales and items, a high score is equivalent to worse or more symptoms. In the functional scales, however, a high score is equivalent to better function.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-STO22 is a 22-item, self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 scales and 4 single items to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues related to dysphagia, eating restrictions, reflux, and abdominal pain, as well as specific symptoms that may occur during chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Scores are averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. For the symptom scales and items, a high score is equivalent to worse or more symptoms. In the functional scales, however, a high score is equivalent to better function.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study consisted of a Pilot part and a Randomized part. The Pilot part and the Randomized part had two separate participant (par.) populations. The study period of the Randomized part was from 31 March 2008 to 5 January 2012 (cut-off date for efficacy). Follow-up was conducted until 30 October 2012 (cut-off date for safety analysis).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In the Pilot part, par. were enrolled in this study based on their gastrectomy status: non-gastrectomy (intact stomach), partial gastrectomy (gastrectomy with pylorus preserved), and gastrectomy (pylorus removed). However, no par. with partial gastrectomy were enrolled. In the Randomized part, par. were randomized to two treatment arms.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants with non-gastrectomy (intact stomach) received 1500 milligrams (mg) of oral lapatinib once daily throughout the study duration (lapatinib was not administered on Day 1 of the first cycle). Participants received a paclitaxel 1-hour intravenous infusion weekly for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle at 80 mg per square meters (m^2).</description>

          <description>Participants with partial gastrectomy (which includes preservation of the pylorus) received 1500 mg of oral lapatinib once daily throughout the study duration (lapatinib was not administered on Day 1 of the first cycle). Participants received a paclitaxel 1-hour intravenous infusion weekly for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle at 80 mg/m^2. Partial gastrectomy (pylorus preserved) is very rare population in Japan. As a result, no such participants were recruited into this cohort.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in the Pilot Part of the Study</title>
        <description>DLTs consisted of only drug-related toxicities (neurologic and non-neurologic DLTs). A neurologic DLT was defined as grade 3/4 clinically significant peripheral motor and/or sensitive neuropathy. Non-neurologic DLTs mainly included the following: grade 3/4 clinically significant non-hematological toxicity (except nausea), grade 4 neutropenia lasting &gt;=7 days, thrombocytopenia (&lt;=25000 cells per cubic millimeter), inability to begin next treatment within 2 weeks of scheduled dosing due to unresolved toxicity, treatment delay (due to toxicity) of &gt;5 days, for Days 8 or 15 of weekly paclitaxel.</description>

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item, self-reporting questionnaire assessing 15 domains (5 functional scales [physical/role/emotional/cognitive/social]; 9 symptom scales [fatigue/nausea and vomiting/pain/dyspnea/insomnia/appetite loss/constipation/diarrhea/financial difficulties]; GHS/QOL scale). Participants assessed most statements on a 4-point scale (1, not at all; 4, very much); two questions used a 7-item scale (1, poor; 7, excellent). Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. A high score indicates both a high/healthy level of functioning and a high level of symptoms/problems.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Cognitive Functioning Score at the End of Therapy in the Randomized Part of the Study</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item, self-reporting questionnaire assessing 15 domains (5 functional scales [physical/role/emotional/cognitive/social]; 9 symptom scales [fatigue/nausea and vomiting/pain/dyspnea/insomnia/appetite loss/constipation/diarrhea/financial difficulties]; GHS/QOL scale). Participants assessed most statements on a 4-point scale (1, not at all; 4, very much); two questions used a 7-item scale (1, poor; 7, excellent). Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. A high score indicates both a high/healthy level of functioning and a high level of symptoms/problems.</description>

          <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item, self-reporting questionnaire assessing 15 domains (5 functional scales [physical/role/emotional/cognitive/social]; 9 symptom scales [fatigue/nausea and vomiting/pain/dyspnea/insomnia/appetite loss/constipation/diarrhea/financial difficulties]; GHS/QOL scale). Participants assessed most statements on a 4-point scale (1, not at all; 4, very much); two questions used a 7-item scale (1, poor; 7, excellent). Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. A high score indicates both a high/healthy level of functioning and a high level of symptoms/problems.</description>

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-STO22 is a 22-item, self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 scales and 4 single items to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues related to dysphagia, eating restrictions, reflux, and abdominal pain, as well as specific symptoms that may occur during chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Scores are averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. For the symptom scales and items, a high score is equivalent to worse or more symptoms. In the functional scales, however, a high score is equivalent to better function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-STO22 Taste Scale Score at the End of Therapy in the Randomized Part of the Study</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ-STO22 is a 22-item, self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 scales and 4 single items to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues related to dysphagia, eating restrictions, reflux, and abdominal pain, as well as specific symptoms that may occur during chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Scores are averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. For the symptom scales and items, a high score is equivalent to worse or more symptoms. In the functional scales, however, a high score is equivalent to better function.</description>
