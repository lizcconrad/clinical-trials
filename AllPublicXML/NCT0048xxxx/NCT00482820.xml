  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies show that children with high levels of anxiety tend to pay more attention to
      threatening stimulus in the environment. They tend to attend to these stimuli and have
      difficulty to disengage from them. These attention biases enhance and maintain the level of
      anxiety. The aim of this study is to test a method of therapeutically intervention which
      focuses on shifting these attentional biases, with the use of a computer game which was
      designed to train the child to focus his/her attention away from the threatening stimuli and
      to focus on natural or positive stimuli. We will recruit 160 children with ongoing anxiety
      disorders who seek treatment. We will first assess threat-related attention bias and anxiety
      symptoms using structured psychiatric interviews and questionnaires. We will then randomly
      assign these children to one of four conditions: training to avoid threatening stimuli and
      attend to neutral stimuli; control placebo-training for threat-neutral stimuli; training to
      attend to positive stimuli and avoid neutral stimuli; and, control placebo-training for
      positive-neutral stimuli. Upon completion of training we will again assess attention bias and
      anxiety.

      Two sets of predictions will be tested, one set concerns the effects of training on
      attention, and the other concerns the effects of training on anxiety. In terms of training
      effects on attention, we hypothesize that children with anxiety disorders can be trained to
      either avoid threat or attend to positive stimuli. In terms of training effects on anxiety
      symptoms, we hypothesize that the experimental training sessions will produce greater
      reduction in symptoms of anxiety than the placebo-control training sessions.
