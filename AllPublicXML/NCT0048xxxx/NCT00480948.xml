  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of infant formula having proportion
      of palmitate in the sn-2 position comparable to human milk in Chinese term infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In human breast milk, and in most infant formulas more than 98% of this milk fat is in the
      form of triglycerides, which contain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids esterified to
      glycerol. Fatty acids in human milk-fat have a highly specific positional distribution on the
      glycerol backbone and this specific configuration is known to have a major contribution to
      the efficacy of this nutrient absorption.

      Palmitic acid (C16:0), the major saturated fatty acid, is predominantly esterified to the
      sn-2 (β) position of the triglyceride in human milk. In contrast, palmitic acid in standard
      infant formulas is esterified to the sn-1 and sn-3 positions.

      Infants fed with high sn-2 palmitic acid formula had softer stools, less constipation and
      better calcium absorption as compared to standard infant formula.

      InFat™ is structured triglyceride fat ingredient with high levels of palmitic acid at sn-2
      position.

      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that feeding Chinese term infants, with
      formula having proportion of palmitate in the sn-2 position comparable to human milk, reduces
      calcium-soaps formation.
