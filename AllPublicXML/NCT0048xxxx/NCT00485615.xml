    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an enteric-coated, eicosapentaenoic
      acid-concentrated fish oil in the treatment of social phobia. A secondary objective is to
      determine if treatment outcome is related to plasma phospholipid essential fatty acid status,
      niacin skin flush and measures of lipid/protein peroxidation.

      Subjects meeting criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder, will receive enteric-coated,
      eicosapentaenoic acid-concentrated fish oil (O3mega+Joy) for 12 weeks of treatment for social
      phobia. A secondary objective is to determine if treatment outcome is related to changes in
      plasma phospholipid essential fatty acid status, niacin skin flush and measures of
      lipid/protein change.
