  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the relative lack of information regarding the risks associated with repeat sternotomy
      in the pediatric patient population, a preliminary screen of the Children's Cardiothoracic
      Surgery Database was performed to determine how many repeat sternotomies have been performed
      at this institution within the last 4 years. A total of 1281 repeat sternotomies were
      identified during this time period.

      We propose a retrospective review of the indications, potential risk factors, and short-term
      outcomes for these procedures. These data would allow a multivariable regression analysis to
      identify risk factors associated with adverse events during repeat sternotomy.

      Median sternotomy is the most common approach for cardiac surgery in adults and children.
      While the initial sternotomy is rarely associated with adverse events, the risks associated
      with repeated sternotomies for subsequent reoperations may be higher. This increased risk is
      primarily due to adhesions securing cardiac structures to the sternum, thus placing those
      structures at risk for injury during sternal re-entry. There have been several large studies
      examining the frequency and impact of adverse events during repeat sternotomy in adults.
      Roselli and colleagues from the Cleveland Clinic reviewed 1853 consecutive repeat
      sternotomies and found a 6.8% incidence of serious adverse events. 1 This study can be
      contrasted against the report of O'Brien and colleagues which reviewed the results of 546
      repeat sternotomies performed over 21 years in Brisbane, Australia with only 9 (1.6%) minor
      cardiac injuries and no major adverse events. 2

      The pediatric cardiac surgical field is somewhat different from the adult realm in that
      re-operations are more common, either due to planned, staged palliation requiring multiple
      operations or the expected failure of implanted conduits and valves which subsequently
      require replacement. However, while the incidence of repeat sternotomy is higher in the
      pediatric population, the overall number of patients is considerably smaller, so there has
      been a relative dearth of information in the literature regarding the risks and outcomes
      associated with repeat sternotomy. The largest series reported was published by Russell and
      colleagues in 1998 and included only 192 repeat sternotomies performed on 165 patients. 3 The
      authors reported a 5.2% incidence of cardiac laceration with selective utilization of
      femoro-femoral bypass to decompress the heart during repeat sternotomy for &quot;higher risk&quot;
      patients.

    <description>This study will be a retrospective medical record review evaluating preoperative and intraoperative variables associated with repeat sternotomy as risk factors for adverse events. Short-term outcomes including ventilator time, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, blood product utilization, and transfusions will be analyzed to determine the effect of adverse events.</description>

        The study population for this retrospective chart review will be all patients, under 21
        years of age who have undergone a repeat sternotomy at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at
        Egleston between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2006. A repeat sternotomy is defined as
        having been performed more than a month after the most recent previous sternotomy.
