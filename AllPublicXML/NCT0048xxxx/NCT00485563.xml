      This is a Phase 2 clinical trial to collect data on tumor responses produced by folate-hapten
      conjugate therapy (vaccination with EC90 [KLH-FITC] and GPI-0100 adjuvant followed by
      treatment with EC17 (folate-FITC) in combination with low-dose cytokines in patients with
      progressive metastatic renal cell carcinoma. All patients will undergo imaging with the
      investigational imaging agent 99mTc-EC20 (FolateScan) during the screening period to confirm
      eligibility for the treatment portion of the clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale: This is a Phase 2 study of folate-hapten conjugate therapy in combination with
      low-doses of the cytokines Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Interferon-alpha (INF-alpha).
      Folate-hapten conjugate treatment consists of subcutaneous vaccinations with EC90, a compound
      designed to elicit an immune response (antibodies) to a dye called fluorescein (FITC), in
      combination with GPI-0100 adjuvant (a drug intended to improve antibody production).
      Vaccination is followed by treatment with EC17, a drug made by linking folate (a vitamin)
      with FITC. Experimental evidence has shown that the folate receptor is over-expressed in many
      human cancers, including renal cell carcinoma. It is expected that EC17 will attach to cancer
      cells through the folate receptor and that antibodies to FITC will recognize the cancer cell
      and mark it for destruction by the body's immune system. Two drugs, IL-2 and IFN-alpha, will
      be administered at low doses in combination with EC17 in order to boost the immune response.
      During the screening period, all potential patients will undergo imaging with 99mTc-EC20 (a
      technetium-based, folate- linked radiopharmaceutical [EC20]) for the purpose of identifying
      patients whose tumors express the folate receptor; the target of folate-hapten conjugate
      therapy. Prior to receiving EC90/GPI-0100 and EC17 therapy, patients must exhibit at least
      one tumor lesion that displays adequate uptake of 99mTc-EC20 during the imaging procedure.
