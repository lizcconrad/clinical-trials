  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We seek to determine if the use of the SafeSeal(TM) topical hemostasis patch is associated
      with reductions in time to hemostasis and time to ambulation compared to standard manual
      compression after arterial sheath removal following percutaneous coronary and peripheral
      intervention. We further seek to assess the safety of the SafeSeal patch compared to manual
      compression.

    <textblock>
      A variety of topical hemostasis pads containing procoagulant materials are currently
      available to accelerate hemostasis after removal of the arterial introducer sheath following
      coronary and peripheral arterial angioplasty procedures. The effectiveness and safety of
      these pads, however, remains poorly understood. A total of 150 patients undergoing coronary
      or peripheral vascular angioplasty through a 6 French arterial sheath will be randomized to
      sheath removal using manual compression alone or manual compression combined with use of the
      SafeSeal(TM) hemostasis patch. Sheaths will be removed at an activated clotting time (ACT) of
      &lt;250 seconds, and patients will be kept at bedrest for 2 hours after hemostasis is achieved.
      The primary endpoint will be time to hemostasis. Secondary endpoints witll include time to
      ambulation and frequency of bleeding complications.
