      -  Measure the mid-facial volumetric correction from SCULPTRA treatment, using
           three-dimensional digital surface imaging

        -  Determine the mean change from baseline in facial contour deficiency as measured by the
           Dermik Nasolabial Photo-numeric Scale

        -  Correlate volumetric correction with clinical improvement as measured by the Dermik
           Nasolabial Photo-numeric Scale

        -  Correlate the mean volumetric change in mid-facial treatment area with the amount of
           product used

        -  Evaluate subject and investigator global assessment of improvement and subject treatment
           satisfaction at the end of treatment

        -  Obtain photographs pre- and post-treatment for the purpose of providing a subject visual
           aid during the course of treatment

        -  Collect safety data

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must sign a statement of informed consent.

          -  Subjects must be 18-75 years of age, of any race or gender.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             prior to the first treatment with the product and must use an acceptable form of birth
             control throughout the study (e.g., oral/systemic contraceptives, an intrauterine
             device (IUD) or Norplant starting at least 28 days prior to study entry and throughout
             the study).

          -  Subjects must display signs of facial contour deficiencies in the area of the
             nasolabial folds [nasolabial fold scores greater than or equal to 2 (bilaterally) on
             the Dermik Nasolabial Photo-numeric Scale.

          -  Subjects must be a suitable candidate for SCULPTRA treatment.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand the requirements of the study and be willing to
             comply with the study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with an allergy to any of the constituents of the product.

          -  Subjects with a known history of keloids or bleeding disorders.

             the study timeframe, or who are nursing.

          -  Subjects with significant facial hair (e.g. mustaches, beards, etc.)

          -  Subjects with an active inflammatory process or infection in the area to be treated
             (skin eruptions such as cysts, pimples, rashes, cancerous/pre-cancerous lesions, or
             any other active skin disease in the treatment area).

          -  Subjects who plan to undergo major facial surgery [e.g., rhinoplasty (with or without
             implant), facelift, congenital defect repair, etc.] during the course of the study.

          -  Subjects who have used or plan to use exclusionary medications/treatments.
