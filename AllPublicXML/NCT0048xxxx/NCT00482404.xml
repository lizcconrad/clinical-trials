    <textblock>
      This trial tests the hypothesis that increasing nonverbal affection in romantic relationships
      will improve blood lipid parameters (total cholesterol, high and low density lipoproteins,
      triglycerides), blood glucose, and immune parameters (C-reactive protein and antibodies to
      latent Epstein-Barr virus). 52 healthy cohabiting romantic couples took part. In half of the
      couples, one partner increased the frequency of romantic kissing with the other partner
      during the six-week trial. The other couples received no such instruction. Blood tests
      performed before and after the trial were used to assess the health outcomes.
