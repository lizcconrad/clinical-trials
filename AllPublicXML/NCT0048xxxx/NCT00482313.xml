      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Prolonged Release (PR) OROS
      methylphenidate in fixed dosage as compared to placebo, and the effectiveness of flexible
      dosage Prolonged Release (PR) OROS methylphenidate in Swedish adult male prison inmates with
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An initial randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel group trial for 5 weeks is followed by an open-label extension
      for maximum 47 weeks, comprising altogether 52 weeks of treatment. A follow-up is carried out
      12 and 36 months post-study, respectively.

             mood disorder, bipolar disorder, acute OCD.

             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias or structural heart abnormalities.

          -  Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, reboxetine, duloxetine.

          -  Use of alpha-2-receptor agonists, neuroleptics, theophylline, coumarin anticoagulants
             or anticonvulsants.

          -  Liver or renal insufficiency. Subjects with hepatitis C without liver insufficiency
             donÂ´t have to be excluded as long as liver enzymes are followed through the study.

          -  Lactose intolerance.
