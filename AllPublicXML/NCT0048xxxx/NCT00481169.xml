      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TSE-424 (bazedoxifene acetate), an
      investigational drug, is safe and effective in the prevention of osteoporosis in
      postmenopausal women.

      Primary objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of TSE-424 (bazedoxifene
      acetate), an investigational drug, in comparison with those of placebo and raloxifene in
      preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

      Secondary objective: To evaluate the effect of TSE-424 (bazedoxifene acetate), an
      investigational drug, in comparison with that of placebo and raloxifene on endometrium,
      metabolic parameters, vasomotor symptoms, adverse events, and quality of life. Samples will
      be collected for population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.
