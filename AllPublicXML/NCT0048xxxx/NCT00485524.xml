  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality after neonatal cardiac repair remains significant, and neonates who have undergone
      operative repair of congenital heart disease may experience sudden and unexpected demise.
      Most of these deaths occur within the first 72 hours and have been attributed to poor
      systemic cardiac output. The literature currently does not define an early and reliable
      predictor of poor post-operative outcome in children with congenital heart disease who have
      recently undergone surgery.

      The investigator wishes to perform a retrospective chart review to independently define the
      predictive values of both NIRS score and serial serum lactate levels in the setting of early
      post-operative morbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The retrospective data will be collected on the NIRS score and serum levels within the first
      72 hours, in the pediatric cardiac population that is less than one month of age requiring
      intra-operative cardiopulmonary bypass. This information will be reviewed from medical charts
      between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2005 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Egleston
      Hospital. We predict approximately 1000 charts will be reviewed.

      The investigator wishes to evaluate the relationship of those levels with cardiac diagnosis,
      operation performed, post-operative course and outcome; poor outcome defined as initiation of
      ECMO or death.

      The investigator then wishes to compare the predictive values of NIRS score and serial serum
      lactate levels in the above setting to assess their respective efficacies in post-operative
      cardiac intensive care. The investigator will collect the following information from the
      medical record:

      Laboratory: NIRS Indices, serum pH, lactic acid, Co-ox, CBC, Chemistry) Diagnosis Surgical
      Procedure Incidence of re-operation Length of ICU Stay Length of Hospital Stay Complications
      Length of Ventilation (how many days on the ventilator) Medications Cross Clamp Time Bypass
      Time Echocardiogram data Cardiac Catheterization Data Vital Signs Monitored Hemodynamic
      Measures Final outcome (discharged versus ECMO or death)

      Demographic data will be summarized for all subjects. For each patient summary statistics
      will include the mean, standard deviation, frequency distribution, minimum, maximum and
      range.

      The investigator wishes to perform a retrospective chart review to independently define the
      predictive values of both NIRS score and serial serum lactate levels in the setting of early
      post-operative morbidity.
