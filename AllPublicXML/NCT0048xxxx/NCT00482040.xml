      The purpose of this study is to evaluate four different nasal continuous pressure systems,
      which are usually applied on our neonatal intensive care unit, with regard of their effect on
      bradycardia and desaturations in preterm infants.

      BACKGROUND:

      Apnea of prematurity (AOP) is a common problem in preterm infants. Nasal respiratory support
      using either Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation
      (IMV) are, among others, widely used treatments. Which of the different systems is the most
      efficient, however, is unclear.

      OBJECTIVE:

      Efficiency of different CPAP systems on reducing the cumulative percentage of bradycardia and
      desaturation in preterm infants.

      METHODS:

      In a prospective, randomized, cross-over trial 32 preterm infants Infants will randomly
      allocated to receive nasal CPAP delivered by one of the following sys-tems: (1) a
      conventional IMV-System (Stephanie, Stephan GmbH, Germany with PIP 15 cmH2O, RR 10/min)
      delivering CPAP via short binasal prongs (Hudson RCI, USA); (2) the Infant-Flow-System (EME
      Ltd, Great Britain) with CPAP delivery via short binasal prongs; (3) the
      Infant-Flow-AdvanceTM-System used in the pressure assist mode with PIP 10 cmH2O, RR 10/min;
      and (4) a nasal underwater bubble CPAP with application via binasal prongs (Hudson RCI, USA).

      All systems will be adjusted to achieve an approximate PEEP of 6 cm H2O. Each study lasts 24
      hours, during which chest wall and abdominal movements, SaO2, tcPCO2, ECG, esopha-gus
      pressure and CPAP-/IMV-pressure will be recorded continuously. Infants will be studied in
      room air in a 15° head tilt prone position while being treated with caffeine (3mg/kg/d).

      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE Cumulative percentage of bradycardia (heart rate &lt;80/min) and
      desaturation (SaO2 &lt;80%) per hour.
