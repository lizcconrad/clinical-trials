      Study Objectives:

        1. To document the safe and effective application of the F.T.M. Arm Training Program using
           the SaeboFlex to an inpatient post stroke rehabilitation population.

        2. To compare functional improvements in hand and UE use achieved with the F.T.M. program
           as compared to generally applied therapeutic treatment approaches.

        3. To develop recommendations for an inpatient retraining protocol that could then be
           evaluated in a multi-center trial.

        4. To document the retention of UE and hand improvements after SaeboFlex training is
           discontinued as well as the carry over of these gains into daily function after therapy
           has been discontinued.

      Therapeutic interventions for the recovery of hand function after a neurological injury have
      historically been very limited. A significant body of research now supports the use of an
      upper extremity retraining approach for functional recovery after neurological injury. Few
      therapeutic approaches offer any intervention specifically focused on grasp and release
      retraining. In an effort to address this deficit, the SaeboFlex dynamic hand orthosis was
      developed by occupational therapists. The F.T.M. Arm Training Program has been safely used by
      hundreds of occupational and physical therapists on over one thousand patients in outpatient
      neurological rehabilitation over the past two years. It is currently an accepted modality of
      treatment for the management of hand paresis in the acquired brain injury population. During
      that time, two factors, other than the severity of the initial injury, were identified as
      having a significant affect on the outcomes achieved in treatment. They are learned non-use
      and soft tissue shortening of the finger flexors. All treatment delivered to the subjects
      that partake in this study will be clinical care and the only research component of this
      study will be the assessment of outcomes. The purpose of this study is to explore the proper
      treatment dosage and treatment protocol for the application of the F.T.M. Program to the
      inpatient post stroke rehabilitation population. Additionally, information on functional
      outcome measures will be collected and compared to a matched control group that undergoes the
      standard therapeutic protocol.
