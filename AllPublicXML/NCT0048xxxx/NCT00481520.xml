        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from the subject or the subject`s
             legally authorized representative (LAR) or next of kin (if applicable), in accordance
             with the local regulations. The subject`s caregiver must also consent to participate
             in the study.

          2. Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's Disease according to National Institute of
             Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related
             Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.

          3. Men and postmenopausal or surgically sterile women aged from 50 to 90 inclusive.
             Postmenopausal women must have had 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Surgically
             sterile women are defined as having a hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy
             [oophorectomy], or bilateral tubal ligation. Men who are sexually active will need to
             agree to use a form of contraception that is satisfactory as per the investigator.

          4. Able to participate in all scheduled evaluations with a high probability of completing
             all required procedures and neuropsychological tests.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Significant neurological disease other than Alzheimer's disease, which may affect
             cognition (eg, epilepsy, Parkinson disease).

          2. Current diagnosis of a major depressive disorder or other major psychiatric symptom
             according to the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
             Fourth Edition Text Version (DSM-IV-TR).

          3. Current clinically significant systemic illness, which is likely to deteriorate or
             affect the subject's safety, influence cognitive assessment or ability to complete the
             study.

          4. Any clinically important deviation from normal limits in physical and neurological
             examination, vital signs, on electrocardiogram (ECG) or clinical laboratory test
             results that could compromise the study or be detrimental to the subject.
