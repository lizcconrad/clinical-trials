  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with an extremely poor prognosis. It is the forth
      leading cause of cancer-related fatalities, with an estimated one-year and five-year survival
      rate of 21% and 5%, respectively. Despite recent progress, the median survival time is 6-10
      months for patients with locally advanced disease and 3-6 months for metastatic disease (1).
      The anti-metabolite gemcitabine has become the standard chemotherapy for locally advanced and
      metastatic pancreatic cancer, after demonstrating an improved rate of clinical benefit
      response and an overall survival advantage over 5-FU (2). In addition to its clinical
      effectiveness gemcitabine has a manageable toxicity profile, making it an attractive agent to
      investigate in combination with newer agents. Series of phase III trials were conducted
      examining the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine and a second cytotoxic agent,
      including 5-FU, cisplatin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. These gemcitabine doublets
      demonstrated no survival advantage over single-agent gemcitabine (3-6). However, the
      rationale for continuing to study gemcitabine-based combinations remains compelling.

      Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a natural compound derived from the rhizome of Curcuma Longa,
      an East Indian plant, commonly called turmeric. It has been shown to possess potent
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, for which it has a long history of dietary
      use as a food additive. Curcumin has also a potent anti-proliferative effects against a
      variety of cancer cell lines in vitro, which stem from its ability to modulate many
      intracellular signal transduction pathways (7). Human phase I-II studies found curcumin to be
      safe, and indicated no dose-limiting toxicity when taken by mouth at doses up to 10 g/day (8,
      9). This data, together with the dismal therapeutic options available for pancreatic cancer
      patients, suggest that curcumin warrants investigation in this setting. Investigators from MD
      Anderson Cancer Center and Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, have recently initiated,
      separately, a phase II study of single agent Curcumin in patients with pancreatic cancer
      (10).

      One of the lessons learned from cancer research in recent decades is that combination
      strategies can provide dramatic improvement in a therapy’s safety and efficacy over
      mono-therapeutic regiments, especially if the combined drugs differ in their mode of action.
      In a recent paper that was accepted for publication we demonstrated, in vitro, the mechanism,
      clinical importance and implications of a novel combinatorial therapy, of celecoxib and
      curcumin, that was discovered in our lab, in inhibiting the growth of several pancreatic cell
      lines. P-34 (expressing high levels of COX -2), MiaPaca (Expressing low levels of COX-2) and
      Panc-1 (no expression of COX -2) cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of
      celecoxib (0-40µM), curcumin (0-20µM) and their combination. In P-34 cells, curcumin
      synergistically potentiated the inhibitory effect of celecoxib on cell growth. The growth
      inhibition was associated with inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis.

      These experiments further demonstrate, for the first time, that the combination effect is
      correlated with synergistic augmentation of apoptosis and involves down-regulation of COX-2
      protein.

      The present study evaluates gemcitabine in combination with curcumin and celecoxib for
      patients with pancreatic cancer.
