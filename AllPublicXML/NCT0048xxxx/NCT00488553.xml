      Primary Objectives:

        1. To enroll and obtain, through questionnaires, risk factor information on all study
           participants to develop detailed demographic, epidemiologic and behavioral profiles.

        2. To assess the influence of relevant epidemiologic covariates such as age, gender,
           smoking and family history of cancer on the panel of susceptibility biomarkers.

        3. To evaluate the role of genomic instability in development of lymphomas.

      This study will include individuals diagnosed with lymphoma and individuals with no history
      of cancer. Half of the participants in this study will have lymphoma, and half will have no
      history of cancer. Information from both groups will be compared to help researchers try to
      learn which factors may lead to the development of lymphoma.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire at M.
      D. Anderson. In this questionnaire, you will be asked about your demographics (such as your
      age, sex, etc.), certain environmental exposures (such as pollution), your medical history,
      family history, diet, and your past and present smoking and alcohol use habits. This
      questionnaire should take about 50 minutes to complete.

      You will also have about 2 Â½ tablespoons of blood drawn for special tests. These tests will
      look for any biologic factors (such as changes in your DNA) that may be linked to lymphoma.
      You will not be informed of the results of any of the testing done with your blood samples.

      Your participation will be over in this study once your blood has been drawn.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 800 participants will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

      Subjects will also provide 30 cc of blood. The blood will be genotyped, and the genotype and
      epidemiological data will be used to evaluate the role of genomic instability (baseline and
      induced) in the development of lymphomas.
