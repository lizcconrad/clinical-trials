  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans have a higher prevalence of vascular disease than Caucasians. Vascular
      disease can lead to heart attacks, strokes and even amputations. Insulin, a hormone which is
      secreted by the pancreas, affects not only glucose and fat metabolism but also vascular
      disease. Impairment of insulin s ability to remove glucose from the circulation is known as
      insulin resistance. To overcome insulin resistance the pancreas secretes extra insulin. These
      high levels of insulin affect circulating triglyceride levels by both promoting production of
      triglyceride by the liver and interfering with clearance of triglyceride from the
      circulation. Triglyceride in turn contributes to the development of vascular disease by
      causing both inflammation and hypercoagulability.

      Surprisingly African Americans are more insulin resistant and have a higher rate of vascular
      disease than Caucasians but have lower triglyceride levels. Because of the high rate of
      vascular diseases in African Americans, our aim is to determine if the adverse effects of
      triglyceride occur at a lower level in African Americans than Caucasians. To achieve this
      goal we will determine if there are differences in the effect of a meal on triglyceride
      levels and vascular function in a representative cohort of African American and Caucasian
      women.

      For this study we will enroll 96 women (48 African American and 48 Caucasian women). We are
      recruiting women because ethnic differences in triglyceride are even greater in women than
      men. We are enrolling women between the ages of 18 and 65 years. The study will involve
      several outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center. The first visit will be a screening to
      determine eligibility. At the second visit a test to measure insulin resistance will be
      performed. This test is called a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. The
      third visit will be for the test meal. Before and at 2, 4 and 6 hours after the meal, blood
      will be drawn and vascular function measured. Vascular function is determined by taking blood
      pressure and then measuring blood flow in the arm with ultrasound. It is possible that
      individual differences in diet could affect the results of the vascular study on the day of
      the test meal. Therefore for 7 days prior to the test meal, the NIH Clinical Center will
      provide to each participant all their meals in the form of either trays or meals in a box.
      These meals will be consistent with the typical American diet and be 33% fat, 15% protein and
      52% carbohydrate. In designing these meals, the dietician will take into account individual
      food preferences.

      This study is being performed in collaboration with the Harvard School of Public Health, the
      University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Indiana University. Therefore some blood
      drawn during Visits 2 and 3 will be sent coded, without personal identifiers, to each
      institution for analyses.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        African American Women: Individuals will be considered to be African American if they
        self-identify as African American and were born in the United States. Further they must
        describe both parents as being African American.

        Caucasian Women: Individuals will be considered to be Caucasian if they self-identify as
        Caucasian.

        Healthy Volunteers: The potential enrollee must self identify as a normal volunteer and
        have this confirmed by having at the screening visit a normal complete blood count,
        glucose, BUN creatinine, liver and thyroid panel.

        Age between 18 and 65 years: This age range is chosen because TG levels across the lifespan
        from early adulthood through to postmenopausal status. Weare using 65 years of age as a
        conventional upper limit. In addition, 65 years of age has been used as an age category
        cut-off by National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Our goal is to detect ethnic
        differences in the pathways that allow vascular disease to develop. Enrolling women between
        the ages of 18 and 65 years, maximizes our ability to detect differences in mechanism of
        action that are truly secondary to ethnicity.

        Weight less than 136 kg (300 lbs): This weight restriction is necessitated by the
        limitations of the DXA scanner. The DXA platform cannot accommodate subjects who weigh more
        than 136 kg.

        BMI between 20 and 45 kg/m2: Women in both ethnic groups will be recruited across BMI
        nonobese and obese categories. Therefore we will enroll approximately equal numbers of
        women from each ethnic group in both BMI categories BMI between 20 and 30 kg/m(2) and BMI
        between 30 and 45 kg/m(2).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Refusal to agree to use barrier contraception: The DXA scan and CT scan should not be
        performed if the participant is pregnant. In addition, TG levels are directly affected by
        pregnancy. Even though we will perform pregnancy tests within 7 days of each visit, we also
        require that the subject agree to abstinence or barrier contraception throughout the study.

        Medications which affect parameters under investigation: Examples include corticosteroids,
        oral contraceptives, hypoglycemic (oral or injection), hypolipidemic, antihypertensive and
        antipsychotic agents. Oral contraceptives, in particular, are exclusion criteria because
        the estrogen component of oral contraceptives increase TG levels and would therefore
        obscure the effect of the test meal on TG levels.

        Medical Conditions which affect parameters under investigation: Examples include diabetes,
        thyroid disease, liver disease, pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome.

        Hispanics: The relationship between TG and insulin resistance in Hispanic White women is
        midway between African American and Caucasian women. Therefore in this initial study to be
        able to determine the maximum ethnic difference in the relationship between TG and insulin
        resistance, we will enroll in this protocol study women who self-identify as African
        American and Caucasian and not enroll women who self-identify as Hispanic.
