  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW273225 is in development for epilepsy and bipolar disorder and can affect women of child
      bearing potential. A clear understanding of the potential interaction between oral
      contraceptives and GW273225 is therefore important for clinical investigation of GW273225 in
      a large number of patients. This study will investigate whether there is any effect of
      GW273225 upon the components of combined oral contraceptive, and also whether taking oral
      contraceptives affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GW273225.

      26 healthy female subjects, aged 18-45 years will take an oral contraceptive (150ug
      levonorgestrel and 30ug ethinylestrdiol; The study will include a screening period, two
      cycles on oral contraceptive with GW273225 at 25 mg once per day administered from the start
      of the second COC cycle for 47 days. There will be a follow-up visit 14-21 days later.

    <description>All subjects will receive the treatment sequence ABC where A=combined oral contraceptive pill (COC), B=COC plus GW273225 and C=GW273225. COC will be administered in two cycles that is, cycle 1 (Days 1-21) and cycle 2 (Days 29-49) of the study. The cycles will be separated by a 7 day washout period. GW273225 will be administered at a dose of one 25 milligram tablet once daily on Days 29-75 of the study.</description>
