  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with newly diagnosed breast cancer anticipating breast-conserving surgery are enrolled
      into the study and will undergo both high-resolution positron emission mammographic (PEM)
      imaging and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast(s). The purpose
      of this study is to determine changes in surgical management resulting from PEM or MRI
      imaging as compared to conventional imaging and to determine if the changes were appropriate
      with histopathology as gold standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast compression and/or immobilization during positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging
      has been called positron emission mammography, or &quot;PEM,&quot; and the device used to perform the
      scan has been called a PEM Scanner. This protocol is designed as a prospective multi-center
      clinical trial to evaluate the role of high resolution PEM, used in combination with the
      radiotracer 2-[F-18]- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), in pre-surgical planning in women with newly
      diagnosed breast cancer who are considered candidates for breast conserving surgery (i.e.
      lumpectomy) after full workup with mammography, clinical breast exam, and additional US as
      would normally be performed. Participants will undergo both contrast enhanced MRI and PEM
      imaging. In order to control for potential bias in interpretation of the second examination
      (i.e. PEM or MRI), the order of interpretation of these examinations will be randomly
      assigned at study entry.The primary objective of the study is to determine changes in
      surgical management resulting from PEM or MRI or both, separately and in conjunction with
      conventional imaging and to determine whether these changes were appropriate (i.e. to excise
      malignancy) or inappropriate (e.g. wider excision or mastectomy for what proved to be benign
      disease).
