  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day compared to 1.2 mg/kg/day in patients with peak plasma atomoxetine concentration levels no higher than 800 ng/mL as assessed by AEs elicited during open-ended questioning</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients who are at least 6 years of age and not more than 16 years of age at Visit
             1

          -  Patients must meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD (any subtype)

          -  Patients must have laboratory results showing no significant abnormalities
             (significant would include laboratory deviations requiring acute medical intervention
             or further medical evaluation)

          -  Patients must be of normal intelligence as assessed by the investigator (that is,
             without a general impairment of intelligence and likely, in the investigator's
             judgment, to achieve a score of greater than or equal to 70 on an IQ test)

          -  Patients must be able to swallow capsules

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who weigh less than 25 kg or greater than 70 kg at study entry

          -  Patients with current or past Bipolar I or II disorder, psychosis, autism, Asperger's
             syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder

          -  Patients with a history of any seizure disorder (other than febrile seizures) or
             patients who have taken (or are currently taking) anticonvulsants for seizure control

          -  Patients with a history of severe allergies to more than 1 class of medications or
             multiple adverse drug reactions

          -  Patients with cardiovascular disease or other conditions that could be aggravated by
             an increased heart rate or increased blood pressure
