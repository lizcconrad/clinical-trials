        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have clearly documented HIV infection, determined by the presence of HIV confirmed by
             one of the following: Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, HIV culture, polymerase
             chain reaction (PCR) amplification, branched DNA (bDNA) signal amplification or the
             presence of p24 antigen. These tests may have been performed at any time in the past,
             but the results must be available for review by Serono prior to entry into the study.

          2. Have evidence of AIDS wasting, with at least one of the following:

               -  Documented unintentional weight loss of at least 10%, or

               -  In the absence of unintentional weight loss of 10%, weight less than 90% of ideal
                  body weight (Metropolitan Height and Weight Tables), or

               -  In the absence of unintentional weight loss of 10%, body mass index &lt; 20 kg/m².

          3. Be at least 18 years of age.

          4. Be receiving at least 90% of estimated caloric requirement on current nutritional
             regimen, according to a formal nutritional analysis.

          5. Meet the following laboratory testing criteria at the week -4 visit (pre study
             screening):

               -  AST, ALT, and amylase &lt; 3 times the upper limit of normal.

               -  Fasting triglyceride level &lt; 500 mg/dl (or &lt;5.64 mmol/l).

               -  Fasting glucose &lt; 110 mg/dl (or &lt; 6.1mmol/l).

          6. Be taking an antiretroviral medication that is approved or available under a Treatment
             IND (in the US) or a temporary approval (outside the US).

               -  The subject must have been on the antiretroviral therapy for at least 8 weeks
                  prior to study Day 1.

               -  The subject must agree not to change the antiviral regimen during the 12 weeks of
                  study drug administration (unless medically mandated).

          7. Be capable of completing all required study activities and assessments (including all
             required exercise performance tests).

          8. Understand and sign an informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical history of the following:

               -  Pancreatitis.

               -  Carpal tunnel syndrome (unless resolved by surgical release).

               -  Glucose intolerance [for the purpose of this protocol defined as fasting blood
                  glucose ≥ 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l), or 2 hour/random blood glucose ≥ 140 mg/dl (7.8
                  mg/dl)].

               -  Angina pectoris.

               -  Coronary artery disease.

               -  Any disorder associated with moderate to severe edema (e.g., cirrhosis,

               -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to growth hormone.

          2. Any of the following medical conditions:

               -  Active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection.

               -  Any active malignancy, except for localized cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (fewer
                  than 10 lesions, none of which exceeds 2 cm in size, not on active therapy).

               -  A central nervous system (CNS) mass, or CNS process associated with active
                  neurological findings.

               -  Chronic diarrhea (defined as 6 or more liquid stools per day).

               -  Unstable or untreated hypertension.

          3. Patients with acute critical illnesses in intensive care units due to complications
             following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or with acute
             respiratory failure.

          4. Either of the following aspects of the medical regimen in the 30 days prior to study
             entry (60 days prior to receiving study drug):

               -  New systemic therapy for opportunistic infection.

               -  New therapy for wasting, including parenteral or oral hyperalimentation, tube
                  feeding, anabolic or progestational agents, or appetite stimulants.

          5. Prior radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapy.

          6. Use of glucocorticoids within the past six months or growth hormone within the past
             year.

          7. An untreated or suspected serious systemic infection, or persistent fever &gt; 101°F (or
             38.5°C) during the 30 days prior to study entry.

          8. Evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, obstruction, or malabsorption as
             determined by the Investigator.

          9. Active substance abuse which would prevent informed consent or compliance with study
             activities.

         10. Dementia which would preclude the patient from giving informed consent or complying
             with the requirements of this protocol.
