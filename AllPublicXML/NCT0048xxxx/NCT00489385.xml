    <textblock>
      This study will determine if Albumin-linked interferon (Albinterferon alfa-2b) every 2 weeks
      is safe and tolerated by patients infected by both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is a new medication developed for HCV. It may help the
      immune system fight infections, especially those caused by viruses. Albinterferon alfa-2b
      appears quite similar to other interferons, in side effects and action in controlling HCV.

      Patients ages 18 and older who are infected with HCV genotype 1, are HIV positive, are
      infected with HCV, and have evidence of HCV-induced liver disease; and who are not pregnant
      or breast feeding may be eligible for this study. Many visits to NIH over a 76-week period
      are required. There will be collection of blood and urine, pregnancy test, and tests of HCV
      in the blood. A liver biopsy is required before start of the study if patients have not had
      one within 1 year. Another is done at the end of 72 weeks. An eye exam is done before start
      of the study and repeated later. An optional procedure called automated pheresis is done at
      the study beginning. Researchers can study patients' immunity to control HCV. Blood is drawn
      through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine to separate the desired blood
      component. Remaining blood is returned to the patient.

      Patients will receive Albinterferon alfa-2b at a dose of 900 mcg every 2 weeks for 48 weeks,
      by injection under the skin. Ribavirin is given at 1,000 mg or 1,200 mg by mouth twice daily,
      depending on a patient's weight. Side effects of Albinterferon alfa-2b are fatigue, headache,
      joint and muscle pain, and sleeplessness. The major side effect of ribavirin is anemia.
      Visits ranging from week 3 to 44 will determine the safety of Albinterferon alfa-2b and
      ribavirin and to see effects on reducing the HCV viral load. For weeks 48, 52, 56, 64, 72,
      and 76, patients will return for a clinic visit and blood tests. At week 72, an abdominal
      ultrasound and liver biopsy are done. Week 76 includes discussion of biopsy results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C infection occurs in one-third of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
      individuals. Liver disease has become more significant among subjects coinfected with HIV and
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). Several studies have shown that coinfected individuals develop
      earlier and more severe liver disease. Pegylated interferon alpha with ribavirin (RBV) has
      become the therapy of choice for HCV among people with HCV alone. However, pegylated
      interferon with RBV therapy for HIV/HCV coinfected subjects results in only modest cure
      rates. This is an open-label, non-randomized prospective trial to assess safety and
      tolerability of Alb-IFN (interferon alpha genetically fused to human serum albumin) 900 mcg
      every 2 weeks (Q2w) with daily RBV among HIV/HCV coinfected individuals. Twenty-five subjects
      who are infected with both HIV and HCV and who also have evidence of chronic hepatitis, but
      who are na ve to anti-HCV treatment, will receive Alb-IFN 900 mcg Q2w together with a
      standard daily dose of RBV for 48 weeks. These subjects will be monitored for Alb-IFN serum
      concentration level, HCV viral load, HIV viral load, and CD4 counts, and will undergo a
      baseline liver biopsy and another optional liver biopsy at the end of 72 weeks. The results
      of the study will enable us to better delineate the efficacy of Alb-IFN in suppressing the
      hepatitis C virus in HIV/HCV coinfected subjects. This will be important given the current
      low cure rate of HCV among HIV coinfected individuals.
