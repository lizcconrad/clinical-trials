      RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor
      and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as tamoxifen and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sunitinib together with
      tamoxifen and cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving sunitinib
      together with tamoxifen and cisplatin works in treating patients with high-risk ocular
      melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of adjuvant sunitinib malate, tamoxifen citrate, and cisplatin on
           disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with high-risk ocular melanoma
           who have undergone primary therapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-21, oral tamoxifen citrate twice
      daily on days 1-7, and cisplatin IV on days 2 and 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years.
