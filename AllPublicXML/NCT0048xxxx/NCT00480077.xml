  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed with a Control Arm in order to adequately study the effect of early
      intervention triggered by the OptiVol® Alert and/or SentryCheck™ Monitor/PatientLook™
      Indicator and evaluation using OptiVol® Fluid Status Monitoring with Cardiac Compass.
      OptiVol® Fluid Status Monitoring with Cardiac Compass features are available in the per
      Clinical Investigational Plan specified Medtronic products (CRT, CRT-D and ICD devices)
