  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of rimonabant compared to placebo on weight
      loss over a period of 6 months when prescribed with a mild hypocaloric diet in obese patients
      with binge eating disorder.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to assess the effect of rimonabant on the number of binge episodes per week, to assess
           the effect of rimonabant on eating behavior using the Binge Eating Scale (BES) and Three
           Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ),

        -  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rimonabant over a period of 6 months.
