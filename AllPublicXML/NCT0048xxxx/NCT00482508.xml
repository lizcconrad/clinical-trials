      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with omalizumab
      plus current asthma therapy in patients who participated in and successfully completed the
      treatment period of study CIGE025IA04E1. Patients who participated in CIGE025IA04E1 were
      perceived by both the patient and the investigator to have benefited from receiving treatment
      with omalizumab plus current asthma therapy according to best medical practice
