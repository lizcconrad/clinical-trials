             levels of MEDI-545 or anti-MEDI-545 antibodies (positive at &gt; 1:10 serum dilution) in
             serum at screening;

             randomization/entry: hydroxychloroquine &gt; 600 mg/day, mycophenolate mofetil &gt; 3
             g/day,methotrexate &gt; 25 mg/week, azathioprine &gt; 3 mg/kg/day, or any dose of
             cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, or thalidomide;

          -  Have received leflunomide &gt;20 mg/day in the 6 months prior to Study Day 0;

          -  Have received fluctuating doses of antimalarials, mycophenolate mofetil,
