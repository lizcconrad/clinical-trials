  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This case series study follows on a terminated randomised clinical trial in a nearby location
      of Uganda, in which the combination of eflornithine + nifurtimox showed very promising
      efficacy and safety. The study's purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this
      combination in a larger group of late-stage Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)
      patients.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Because of unexpectedly reduced disease prevalence in the study area, a pragmatic decision was
    taken to terminate recruitment in March 2003.
