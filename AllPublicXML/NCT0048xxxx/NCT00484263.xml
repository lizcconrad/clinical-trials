  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the daily inhalation of nebulised
      hypertonic saline (6%) will decrease the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations and increase
      the quality of life for people with non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a disabling, chronic respiratory condition which significantly impacts on
      the quality of life of patients who present with chronic sputum production and respiratory
      infections. The occurrence of pulmonary infections is a strong predictor of morbidity and
      mortality in this group of people so the primary goal of treatment is to prevent infections
      caused by the presence of sputum in their lungs.

      Physiotherapy is a major aspect of their management and focuses on teaching appropriate
      airways clearance techniques. Traditionally, the physiotherapy management of sputum retention
      due to bronchiectasis has included the active cycle of breathing technique which has been
      demonstrated to enhance airways clearance. For some patients, this treatment is not adequate.
      The use of nebulised hypertonic saline has been used for patients with cystic fibrosis and
      has been demonstrated to improve sputum removal and lung function.

      The aim of this project is to determine the long term effect of the daily inhalation of
      hypertonic saline on respiratory infections, quality of life, lung function and hospital
      admissions in patients with non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Hypertonic saline has been
      shown to be beneficial as a once only treatment in this patient group, but its' long term
      effects have not been studied.

      Participants will be randomised to two groups - those receiving hypertonic saline (6%) and
      those receiving isotonic saline (0.9%) - and will be blinded to the treatment that they are
      receiving. They will be given nebuliser equipment and will be instructed how and when to
      inhale their medication.

      Objective measures will be taken by a blinded assessor before the commencement of the project
      and then at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post commencement.
