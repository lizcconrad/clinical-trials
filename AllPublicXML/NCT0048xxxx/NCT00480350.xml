  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is a growing problem in Israel with over 4000 known patients who are either
      infected with the virus or have developed AIDS. Patients are usually followed for years until
      they develop an increase in their viral load (HIV-1 RNA) or their CD4 + cells decline. At
      this point, patients are usually treated with Highly Active, Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART).
      The mainstay of response to such treatment is the lowering of viral load and increase in CD4+
      cells. Food supplements for HIV patients have been given in several studies, with
      controversial results. A meta-analysis published recently [1] assessed whether micronutrient
      supplements are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in adults and children with HIV
      infection. They recommended supporting the current WHO recommendations to promote and support
      adequate dietary intake of micronutrients wherever possible. We expect to enroll 140 subjects
      in this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Seventy subjects will be enrolled
      in the rice-supplement arm and 70 subjects in the control group, which will receive
      supplemental, flavored dextrose to their current medical treatment. The treatment duration is
      24 weeks with follow-up at 36 weeks from enrollment. The target population is HIV-1 infected
      individuals who may be either on anti-retroviral therapy or not on therapy. Subjects must be
      with either CD4+ cells are &lt;500 cells/mm3, or HIV plasma RNA level is &gt; 5000 copies/ml. The
      primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of food supplementation versus a
      flavored-dextrose supplement with respect to increment of patient CD4+ cell count from
      baseline at 24 weeks, or virological response defined as lowering of plasma HIV-1 RNA and
      immunologic response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with documented HIV-1 infection

          -  Male and female ages &gt; 18 years old

          -  Subjects who have given informed consent

          -  Subjects may either receive or not receive antiretroviral therapy at the time of
             enrollment

          -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA higher than 5000 copies/ml

          -  OR

          -  Patient CD4+ cell count less than 500 cells/mm3

          -  Patients who can comply with protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients incapable of oral intake

          -  Patients who are allergic to rice

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Active drug abuse which, in the opinion of the investigator, is expected to interfere
             with the subject's ability to adhere to the study procedures

          -  Active, clinically-significant disease or life-threatening disease that would
             compromise the subject's safety or outcome of the study

          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             compromise the subject's safety or adherence to the trial protocol

          -  Patients who have started their anti-HIV treatment within less than 3 months from
             inclusion in the study. However, patients who have changed anti-HIV medication but
             have initiated therapy more than 3 months before inclusion will be eligible for the
             study.
