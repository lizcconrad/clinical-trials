      This study will investigate the clinical efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of ACZ885, administered intravenously and subcutaneously to patients
      with NALP3 mutations whose clinical symptoms are either untreated or insufficiently treated
      and require medical intervention.

             week prior to the screening visit. Steroid therapy may be tapered during treatment
             with ACZ885 at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Parents' or legal guardian's written informed consent (patient's informed consent for
