      Women with Advanced Ovarian Cancer (AOC) suffer from severe sexual side effects from
      treatment. The prevalence of the sexual issues is not known.

      The degree to which these sexual side effects is affected by treatment is also not known, as
      the literature in this area focuses on post-treatment analysis.

      Specific Aim #1 (Quantitative Phase): To determine the prevalence and types of sexual
      difficulties using self-report questionnaires in women about to receive treatment for Stage
      III or IV Ovarian Cancer at the BCCA and over time, and to correlate these symptoms with
      degree of cancer symptoms, well-being, depressive symptoms, and relationship satisfaction

      Hypothesis 1a: Compared to baseline pre-treatment data, and to existing data for women with
      early-stage gynaecologic cancer, rates of sexual difficulties will be significantly higher
      and frequency of sexual intercourse will be significantly lower in women with advanced
      ovarian cancer. We hypothesize that difficulties specifically in the domains of sexual
      desire, sexual distress, and genital pain will be the most common types of sexual dysfunction
      to characterize women with advanced ovarian cancer.

      Hypothesis 1b: We hypothesize that the degree of sexual symptoms will be significantly
      greater at 3 months and 10 months post-treatment than compared to pre-treatment, and that
      sexual difficulties may be significantly greater at 3 months post-treatment than at 10-months
      post-treatment.

      Hypothesis 1c: We hypothesize that degree of sexual difficulty and sexual distress will be
      significantly correlated with (a) overall well-being; (b) depressive symptoms; and (c)
      relationship satisfaction.

      Hypothesis 1d: As an exploratory analysis, we will investigate the relationship of ovarian
      cancer-related variables (i.e., type of treatment, duration of treatment, number of
      medications), and demographic variables (i.e., age, relationship duration, education) on each
      of the hypotheses in 1a - 1c.
