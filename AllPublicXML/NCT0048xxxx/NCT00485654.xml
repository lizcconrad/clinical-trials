  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heterotaxy syndrome is a heterogeneous disease that is the result of a failure of normal
      right-left lateralization of the abdominal and thoracic organs during development. The major
      clinical manifestations include intestinal malrotation, functional asplenia and complex
      cyanotic heart disease.

      Hypothesis: There exists a yet, un-recognized, racial distribution in heterotaxy syndrome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The exact etiology of heterotaxy is unknown, but presumed to be multifactorial. While
      candidate genes have been suggested, no common gene has proven responsible for this
      constellation of lesions. Various modes of inheritance have been described. Though there are
      reports of familial occurrences, no reports of racial/ethnic predominance exist. We,
      therefore, propose to examine the racial/ethnic distribution of heterotaxy syndrome with
      congenital heart disease in patients treated at this institution. In addition, the
      investigators will determine if race/ethnicity is a factor in clinical outcomes.

      Aim 1: To determine any pattern of racial/ethnic predominance within a cohort of patients
      with heterotaxy syndrome with congenital heart disease.

      Aim 2: To correlate race/ethnicity with disparities in morbidity and mortality in patients
      with heterotaxy syndrome with congenital heart disease.

      This study will be a retrospective, chart review of approximately 90 - 100 medical charts,
      conducted on the Egleston campus of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Charts reviewed will
      cover a period between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2005.

      Data to be collected includes: DOB, diagnosis, surgical procedure, surgical outcome,
      survival, length of hospitalization, repeat surgical intervention, incidence of
      hospitalization, length of inotropic support, ventilator time, infection rate, insurance
      provider, list of antibiotics and zip code of residence at initial admission. In addition to
      the above information, data to be extracted from the medical chart of a decedent will include
      age at death, cause of death, laboratory data at time of death and autopsy results.
