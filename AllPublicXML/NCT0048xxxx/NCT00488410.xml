      Patients showing a normal value of SDI (&lt; or + 8%) will randomly be assigned to CRT in &quot;ON&quot;
      or &quot;OFF&quot;mode at one month after implantation. In any case of emergency, an automated rescue
      mode is included in the device for the patients in &quot;OFF&quot; mode.

      Patients with a pathological SDI (&gt; 8%) will as usually be treated by CRT and will serve as
      control group. The study duration for each patient included in the trial is 6 months.
      Patients showing a decreased NYHA score by at least one class and an absence of major
      cardiovascular event during the period will be considered as &quot;good responders&quot;. The
      otherswill be considered as &quot;no responders&quot;.

      Based on this composite clinical score, the percentage of good responders in each group at 6
      months is the primary endpoint of the study.

      Main secondary endpoints :

        -  Evaluation of the left ventricular function

        -  Exercice capacity

        -  Serious adverse events'frequency

        -  Quality of life (SF36)

        -  Diagnostic and prognostic value of the &quot;Brain Natriuretic Peptide&quot;(NT pro BNP)evolution.
