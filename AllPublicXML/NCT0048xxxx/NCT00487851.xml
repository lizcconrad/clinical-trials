      Randomized study comparing endoscopic stent insertion strategy versus double-bypass surgery
      in non-resectable periampullary cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experience shows that patients with advanced periampullary cancer suffer not only from
      jaundice but in 25 -30% of cases also duodenal stricture with nausea, vomiting and
      nutritional difficulties. Ten years ago, the only palliative treatment for these patients was
      a bypass operation for bile flow and intestinal passage. This operation was often associated
      with a high morbidity. Developments in endoscopic treatments allow palliation with lower
      morbidity. However, stent treatment is not free of problems like stent dysfunction. During
      the last ten years, anesthesia and surgical techniques have developed which allow lower
      postoperative morbidity compared to earlier treatments. A total of 70 patients were
      randomized to surgery with hepaticojejunostomy on Roux loop and gastrojejunostomy or
      endoscopic treatment with self-expanding metallic stent in the bile duct and so-called
      duodenal stent. Based on the inclusion of 70 patients, we expected a 20% difference in some
      of the primary variables with a power of 80%.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a locally advanced periampullary neoplastic process with extrahepatic
             bile duct obstruction.

          -  The patient tumor burden and general condition should be such that treatment related
             morbidity and mortality is calculated as &quot;reasonable&quot; and both treatment strategies
             are considered &quot;applicable&quot;.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non consent.

          -  The patients' general condition will not tolerate either treatment (strategy).

          -  Previous laparotomy or laparoscopy.

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 3 months.

          -  Inability to participate (language, social, etc.)
