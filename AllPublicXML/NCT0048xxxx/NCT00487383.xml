  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the role of certain areas of the brain in blepharospasm, a type of
      dystonia (abnormality of movement and muscle tone) that causes unwanted or uncontrollable
      blinking or closing of the eyelids. The study will compare brain activity in healthy
      volunteers and in people with blepharospasm to find differences in the brain that may lead to
      better treatments for dystonia.

      Healthy volunteers and people with blepharospasm who are 18 years of age and older may be
      eligible for this study. All candidates are screened with a medical history. People with
      blepharospasm also have a physical examination and blepharospasm rating.

      Participants undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electromyography (EMG) in
      two 4-hour sessions, separated by 1 to 7 days.

      TMS

      A wire coil is held on the subject s scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the
      coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may
      feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in muscles of the
      face, arm or leg. During the stimulation, subjects may be asked to tense certain muscles
      slightly or perform other simple actions. Repetitive TMS involves repeated magnetic pulses
      delivered in short bursts of impulses. Subjects receive 60 pulses per minute over 15 minutes.

      EMG

      Surface EMG is done during TMS to measure the electrical activity of muscles. For this test,
      electrodes (small metal disks) are filled with a conductive gel and taped to the skin of the
      face.

      Objective

      Besides alterations in the basal ganglia, substantial evidence identifies cerebellar
      dysfunction as a possible cause for dystonia. Pathophysiological findings suggest that the
      cerebellar influence on the primary motor cortex is modified in patients with different forms
      of dystonia. The objective of this study is to find out whether this cerebellar influence
      plays a role in dystonic disorders.

      Study population

      20 patients with blepharospasm, 20 patients with focal hand dystonia, 20 patients with DYT-1
      Primary generalized dystonia and 60 healthy volunteers age and sex matched.

      Design

      Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be performed at rest and during
      tonic activation of the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI). The conditioning stimulus (CS)
      will be applied to the ipsilateral cerebellum using different intensities and will precede
      the test stimulus by intervals from 3 to 10 ms, respectively. The test stimulus (TS) will be
      applied over the motor hot spot of FDI in the primary motor cortex.

      Outcome measures

      The primary outcome measure will be the motor evoked potential (MEP) in FDI after a
      conditioning cerebellar stimulus in relation to the unconditioned MEP size. Each different
      patient group will be compared separately to the age- and sex-matched healthy controls and
      between each other. Secondary outcome parameters will be the influence of different
      interstimulus intervals and different stimulation intensities of the conditioning stimulus on
      the MEP.
