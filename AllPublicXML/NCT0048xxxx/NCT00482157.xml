  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the diagnosis of prostate cancer, many men alter their lifestyle or diet or use various
      supplements in an attempt to retard the growth of their cancer. While there is limited data
      on the use of diet and supplements to alter the risk of prostate cancer, even less is known
      regarding the ability of diet or supplements to alter progression. For men who have elected
      active surveillance, the investigators propose to investigate the ability of vitamin D to
      retard the growth of prostate cancer.

      Men will be randomized to each of two arms for a total of 24 subjects: calcitriol alone
      (DN101, 45 micrograms once weekly) or placebo. Baseline laboratory assays, including serum
      PSA, serum and urine calcium and creatinine, will be performed and the EPIC questionnaire
      (expanded prostate cancer index composite, validated HRQOL tool for prostate cancer patients)
      will be completed. Patients will also undergo prostate needle biopsy [4 cores taken under
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance] to establish baseline levels of gene expression.
      Follow-up at the end of 2 weeks (just prior to the third dose) will include a history and
      physical, and a repeat of all baseline blood and urine tests. Follow-up at 3 months will
      include a history and physical, repeating all blood and urine tests, and the EPIC
      questionnaire. At 6 months, in addition to the history and physical, blood and urine tests,
      and the EPIC questionnaire, a TRUS-guided prostate needle biopsy will be performed. This will
      be a standard 12-core scheme and 4 of these cores will be used for laboratory analysis. Renal
      ultrasounds will again be performed on men in the calcitriol arms to look for stones.
      Patients who show no evidence of clinical progression will be offered to remain on study, in
      their designated treatment arm, for an additional 6 months. Any patient exhibiting clinical
      progression at any time will be withdrawn from the study and offered standard treatment
      options. For patients remaining on study at 12 months, an end-of-study biopsy will be
      requested (12-core scheme with 4 cores used for laboratory analysis)
