  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the combined effects of fosamprenavir 700mg BID + ritonavir 100mg BID +
      standardized dose of methadone, on plasma total and unbound methadone enantiomer
      pharmacokinetics (PK), opiate pharmacodynamic (PD) measures, and safety. The effect of
      methadone on plasma amprenavir PK will also be assessed by comparison to historical control
      data.

        Able to give written informed consent prior to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a clinically significant abnormality identified on the screening medical
             or laboratory evaluation, including 12-lead ECG.

        Subject has any preexisting condition which could interfere with the absorption,
        metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs.

        Subject currently has or has a history of decompensated liver disease (i.e., ascites,
        esophageal or rectal varices, hepatic encephalopathy) or current evidence of active
        hepatitis (AST or ALT &gt; 2.5x ULN).

        Subject has evidence of liver impairment at screening (i.e., INR &gt; 1.7, total bilirubin
        &gt;2.0 mg/dL, albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL).

        Subject has inadequate venous access. Subject has a history of any hypersensitivity
        reaction to any component of FPV, APV, RTV, or to any drug chemically related to FPV, APV,
        or RTV.
