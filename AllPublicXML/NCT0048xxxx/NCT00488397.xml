        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant causative isolate (no duplicates) - The isolate must meet the
             laboratory criteria of &quot;significant pathogen&quot; and be considered the &quot;probable
             causative agent&quot; of a hospital or community acquired infection.

          -  Sources - All body sites are acceptable clinical sources for isolates to be included
             in this study (Intra-abdominal infection, tracheal secretion/bronchoalveolar lavage,
             blood culture, wound smear). However, no more than 10 % of all isolates can come from
             urine cultures.

          -  Within study group - Only isolates defined by the protocol are to be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Limited isolates from sources - No more than 10 % of all isolates from this study will
             be derived from urine cultures.

          -  No banked or stored isolates.

          -  No duplicate isolates - Only one isolate per patient is permitted.

          -  Outside study group - Any isolate other than those defined by protocol.
