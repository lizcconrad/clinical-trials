      The goal of this psychosocial research study is to collect information on patients with one
      of the above-mentioned low-grade tumors. Researchers want to maintain these patients'
      information in a research database to help learn and better understand these tumor types and
      to help develop better treatments for them.

      This is an investigational study. There will be no cost for participating in this research
      study. Up to 2000 patients from MD Anderson will take part in this study.

      Low-grade tumors of female organs are considered rare. Because of this, doctors do not know
      the best treatment for these kinds of tumors. Researchers want to learn more about patients'
      experience with these types of cancer to help find ways to develop better therapies to treat
      them.

      If you agree to take part in this study, information about your type of cancer, the type of
      treatment you had or are having, and details about your follow-up care will be entered into a
      research database. These data will be collected from patients seen at MD Anderson since
      January, 1950. This information will serve as a basis for research studies about patients
      with low-grade ovarian tumors.

      Your data will mostly come from your MD Anderson medical record. However, information may
      also be requested from you, your local doctor, or an outside hospital. Information collected
      from sources other than MD Anderson will be included in your MD Anderson medical record as
      well as entered into this study's database.

      Information may be directly collected from you, if there are additional questions not
      provided in your medical records, if your information is not complete, or if your information
      collected from other sources does not match what is in your MD Anderson medical record.

      To help ensure confidentiality, the database will be password-protected with access strictly
      limited to study staff.

      This research database will be updated at least once a year to include information about your
      current treatment and/or follow-up care. This information is usually collected from your MD
      Anderson medical record, or it may be necessary to contact you directly. This information
      will be collected indefinitely. If you wish to end your participation in this study, you may
      request that your data remain in the database or that your information be deleted from the
      database.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 2000 patients from MD Anderson will take part in this
      study.
