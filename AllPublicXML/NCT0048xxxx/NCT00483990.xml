  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of repeated
      application of PSD502 to the glans penis in healthy male volunteers

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, placebo-controlled repeat dose
      study in a minimum of 8 circumcised and 8 uncircumcised healthy male volunteers. Subjects
      will attend 2 study visits, of which 1 will be a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and the other, a
      consecutive 21-day treatment visit (Visit 2; Days 1-21) which commences no more than 14 days
      after the Screening visit. Subjects will reside in the phase I unit throughout the treatment
      period. The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be up to 5 weeks.

      Subjects are stratified based on whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised and within
      each stratified group subjects are randomized to PSD502 (lidocaine prilocaine spray) or
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio.

      Procedures during the 21 day treatment period include: visual examination of the glans penis,
      blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis of lidocaine and prilocaine, swabbing of
      the glans penis for residual PSD502, vital signs and 12-lead ECG, adverse event enquiries and
      collection of concomitant medications. Subjects are discharged from the clinic on Day 21
      following a safety evaluation.

             Investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a significant medical condition that would preclude further study
             participation, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Currently taking, or has taken within the 2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, any
             concomitant medication that could confound interpretation of the safety data PSD502

          -  Suffering from an STD, or is positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection.

          -  Safety testing abnormalities at the Screening Visit, in particular liver function
             tests, that are indicative of a medical condition and that would preclude further
             participation, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Significant abnormality of the glans penis that would preclude interpretation of the
             examination of the glans, or that could be worsened by use of PSD502.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year prior to the Screening visit.

          -  Known drug sensitivity to amide-type local anesthetics.

          -  Use of an investigational (non-registered drug within 30 days of the Screening Visit.

          -  Unlikely to understand or be able to comply with study procedures, for any reason, in
             the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  History of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PD)deficiency or use of medications
             that would increase susceptibility to methemoglobinemia (e.g. anti-malarial agents).
