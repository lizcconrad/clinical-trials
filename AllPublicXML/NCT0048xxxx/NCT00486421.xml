      RATIONALE: Rituximab and prednisone may increase the number of platelets in patients with
      immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving rituximab
      together with prednisone works as first-line therapy in treating patients with immune
      thrombocytopenic purpura.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of rituximab, when administered with standard prednisone
           treatment, in maintaining a platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm³ at 6 months without further
           therapies (e.g., splenectomy or other salvage therapies) in patients with immune
           thrombocytopenic purpura.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to platelet recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of platelet recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess efficacy of this regimen in preventing spontaneous bleeding events in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral prednisone once daily on days
      1-14 followed by a taper to day 56. Treatment is administered in the absence of disease
      relapse or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)

               -  Diagnosis must be made according to American Society of Hematology diagnostic
                  guidelines by a member of Mayo Rochester's Division of Hematology/Oncology within
                  the past year

               -  ITP must be confirmed by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in all patients ≥ 60
                  years of age*

                    -  Bone marrow studies performed outside Mayo must be reviewed by a Mayo
                       hematopathologist to confirm diagnosis and exclude evidence of other
                       hematologic disorders NOTE: *Bone marrow evaluation is discretionary for all
                       other patients

          -  Requires treatment, as defined by 1 of the following parameters:

               -  Platelet count ≤ 30,000/mm³

               -  Platelet count ≤ 50,000/mm³ with episodic bleeding (i.e., spontaneous or with
                  minimal trauma) requiring treatment

          -  No concurrent diagnosis of a condition known to cause secondary immune (or nonimmune)
             thrombocytopenia, including, but not limited to, any of the following:

               -  Rheumatological conditions, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or
                  mixed connective tissue disorder

             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk for treatment
             complications

          -  Able to take a proton-pump inhibitor while on corticosteroids

          -  No unresolved or incompletely treated infection within the past 14 days
