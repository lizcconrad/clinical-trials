  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of morbidity in western society, and an infrequent complication of
      cardiac surgery. The majority of thromboembolic strokes arise from the left atrium, in
      particular the left atrial appendage. This study aims to assess the short-term effects of
      left atrial appendage ligation in terms of postoperative clinical and biochemical parameters;
      and the long-term effects of left atrial appendage ligation in terms of stroke incidence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation, the left atrial appendage is the origin
      of at least 90% of all left atrial clots, and the resulting systemic emboli cause
      approximately 25% of all strokes. The stroke rate in patients with atrial fibrillation older
      than 75 years of age is 8.1% per year with one clinical risk factor and is 12% per year at
      any age in clinical trial populations with a history of prior thromboembolism. Three-year
      stroke rates in elderly nursing home patients not anticoagulated are in excess of 50% (Atrial
      Fibrillation Investigators 1994). Anticoagulation is oftentimes withheld due to the
      perception of excessive risk in case of a fall; even when anticoagulation is prescribed, it
      is well known that therapeutic levels are not always maintained.

      Left atrial appendage obliteration is commonly performed in a variety of cardiac surgical
      operations. There have been animal studies and theoretical arguments which demonstrate the
      importance of the atrial appendage in its role to support cardiac output and blood pressure,
      and modulate thirst and hypercoagulability (Stollberger 2003); however this has been poorly
      studied and documented in humans in the available literature. BNP and ANP have been shown to
      increase proportionately with left atrial appendage dysfunction, as have von Willebrands
      Factor, D-Dimer, and thrombin-antithrombin III complex (Igarashi 2001).

      To date, there is not a single randomized controlled trial with adequate follow-up to assess
      the short- and long-term clinical effectiveness of concurrent prophylactic LAA ligation. This
      trial will fill that void.
