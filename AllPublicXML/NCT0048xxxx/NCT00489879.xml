      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cellular phone based health care system is
      effective in the treatment of diabetes and hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes care is facilitated by a patient's being engaged in a self-management program with
      the advice and counsel of physicians, but many diabetic patients can not receive the
      continous monitoing and advice from his physician in their every day life. It is very
      difficult to keep up life style modification in their real life.

      Few studies have examined the effects of cellular phone based intervention that provide an
      interactive component daily. Our goal is to test the hypothesis that diabetes and
      hypertension management using cellular phone based health care system would result in
      significant improvement of blood glucose and blood pressure level.
