  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI is a powerful imaging tool used for the precise study of brain morphology (morphometric
      study, tissue study, study of connectivity).

      Isotopic examinations by Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPET) and Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) are used to explore cerebral perfusion metabolism (99mTc- ECD SPET and 18FDG
      PET), as well as dopaminergic neurotransmission (123I FP-CIT SPET, DATSCAN®).

      These examinations routinely contribute to the clinical diagnosis and surveillance of many
      neurological pathologies (dementias, Parkinson syndromes, epilepsies, concussions, vascular
      pathology, brain tumors, etc.).

      As a result of the original morphological and functional information they provide, these
      examinations are being increasingly included in clinical research protocols involving the
      brain.

      The absolute or relative quantification of anomalies observed, however, can be obtained only
      after comparison to a database of normal subjects.

      The creation of these databases is currently limited by their cost and strictly single center
      nature (physical characteristics of each center's MRI, gamma cameras and PET scanner).

      The aim of this multidisciplinary study is to constitute a standardized database of multimode
      neural imaging (SPET, PET and MRI) to be able to objectively quantify anomalies observed in
      patients, at the scale of a group or an individual, for the diagnosis and surveillance of
      neurological diseases.

      Participants will be paid €350. 60 healthy subjects between 20 and 80 years of age (30 men
      and 30 women) will be recruited over 3 years. 4 examinations will be programmed over 2 days
      (one cerebral MRI, on 18FDG PET, one 99mTc-ECD SPET and one DATSCAN®).

      The strictly single center character of this study is explained by the variability of the
      physical characteristics of the imaging equipment used (MRI, SPET and PET scan) inherent to
      each center.
