  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A histologically confirmed diagnosis of a recurrent/progressive primary WHO grade IV
             malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma). Patients with recurrent
             disease whose diagnostic pathology confirmed WHO grade IV malignant glioma
             (glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma) will not need re-biopsy. Patients with prior
             low-grade glioma are eligible if histologic assessment demonstrates transformation to
             WHO grade IV malignant glioma. Pathology must be confirmed at Duke University Medical
             Center

          2. Male or female, aged greater than or equal to 18 years.

          3. An interval of at least 2 weeks between prior surgical resection (if conducted) or any
             major surgery or 4 weeks between prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy (except
             nitrosoureas which require 6 weeks) and enrollment in this protocol unless there is
             unequivocal evidence of tumor progression and the patient has recovered from
             toxicities associated with those therapies. However, patients treated with
             chemotherapeutic agents such as VP-16 who would normally be retreated after shorter
             intervals (e.g. 21 days on, 7 days off schedule) may be treated at the usual starting
             time even if less than 4 weeks from the last prior dose of chemotherapy.

          4. Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 70%.

          5. Hematocrit &gt; 29%, absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500 cells/*L, platelets &gt; 100,000
             cells/*L.

          6. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN), serum glutamic oxaloacetic
             transaminase &lt; 2.5 X ULN; and bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times ULN.

          7. Signed informed consent form and authorization for use and disclosure of protected
             health information approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to patient
             entry.

          8. If sexually active, patients must use contraceptive measures for the duration of the
             treatments and for 4 weeks following end of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current, active systemic bleeding or excessive risk of bleeding as defined by the
             following: stroke within the previous 6 months, history of central nervous system or
             intraocular bleed, history of septic endocarditis or evidence of intratumor hemorrhage
             on pretreatment diagnostic imaging, except for stable post operative grade 1
             hemorrhage.

          2. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or adults of reproductive potential
             not employing an effective method of birth control. (Women of childbearing potential
             must have a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to administration of study
             medication).

          3. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e. uncontrolled diabetes,
             congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months, poorly controlled
             hypertension, history of labile hypertension, history of poor compliance with
             antihypertensive regimen, chronic renal disease, or active uncontrolled infection)
             that could compromise participation in the study.

          4. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of study medication (i.e. ulcerative disease,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, bowel obstruction, or
             inability to swallow the liquid).

          5. Requirement for therapy with coumadin (warfarin sodium).

          6. Patient is &lt; 1 year free of another primary malignancy except if the other primary
             malignancy is not currently clinically significant or requiring active intervention,
             or if other primary malignancy is a basal cell skin cancer or a cervical carcinoma in
             situ. Existence of any other malignant disease is not allowed.

          7. Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol.

          8. Grade 2 or greater peripheral sensory neuropathy
