  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether tapentadol (CG5503) prolonged-release (PR)
      tablets at doses of 100-250 mg twice daily provide a better pain relief in patients with
      moderate to severe chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee than a placebo (a
      medication without active substance). In addition the tolerability of CG5503 PR will be
      assessed. One third of the patients will receive CG5503 and one third will receive placebo.
      For further comparison one third of the patients will receive oxycodone controlled release
      (CR) at doses of 20-50 mg twice daily which is an active approved pain medication. Please
      note that tapentadol ER (Extended Release) and tapentadol PR (Prolonged Release) are
      identical and used interchangeably. This is due to United States of America and European
      naming conventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to patients by chance), double-blind (neither
      patient nor investigator knows which patient gets which study medication, i.e. CG5503,
      placebo, oxycodone), placebo and active control study. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of orally administered tapentadol (CG5503) prolonged-release (PR) at
      doses of 100-250 mg (base) twice daily in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study will consist of five periods: screening (to assess
      eligibility), washout (3-7 days with determination of a baseline pain intensity), titration
      (of dose over 3 weeks to the optimal individual level), maintenance (investigational drug
      intake for 12 weeks with adjustments allowed), and follow-up (2 weeks after end of
      treatment). The study hypothesis is that the study drug will be more effective than placebo
      in reducing patients' pain intensity. The secondary objectives include the collection of
      pharmacokinetic (related to how the body absorbs, distributes, changes and excretes the drug)
      information for dose verification. The efficacy objectives will be assessed by comparing the
      baseline pain level to the pain level during the maintenance period. This will be done by
      looking at the patients' pain diary information (electronic diaries).

    <measure>Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12 of the Maintenance Period</time_frame>
    <description>The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of symptoms of constipation. Participants are asked &quot;How severe have each of these symptoms been in the last two weeks?&quot; e.g. &quot;Pain in your stomach&quot;. There are 3 subscales: 4 questions on Abdominal symptoms, 3 on rectal symptoms and 5 on stool symptoms. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). If the changes in the overall or subscale scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation.</description>

          <description>Drug: Matching Placebo (twice daily)
The starting dose of placebo was matched with the active treatment arms taken twice daily for the first 3 days. The dose was then increased to match the active treatments for at least 4 days. Thereafter, during the titration and maintenance phase participants were allowed to increase the dose every 3 days as in the active treatment arms. Dose decreases were allowed without time restrictions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of the Average Pain Intensity Overall in the 12-week Maintenance Period of the Daily Pain Intensity on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).</title>
        <description>For this twice daily pain assessment, the participants were required to indicate the level of pain experienced over the previous 12 hours on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The lower the value the less pain in the treatment group. Negative values indicate a reduction in pain.</description>

        <title>EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D) Health Status Index Outcome Over Time</title>
        <description>The participant scored the EuroQol-5. This is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead. The positive values indicate that during the study the health status improved.</description>

          <title>EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D) Health Status Index Outcome Over Time</title>
          <description>The participant scored the EuroQol-5. This is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead. The positive values indicate that during the study the health status improved.</description>

        <title>Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) Over Time</title>
        <description>The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of symptoms of constipation. Participants are asked &quot;How severe have each of these symptoms been in the last two weeks?&quot; e.g. &quot;Pain in your stomach&quot;. There are 3 subscales: 4 questions on Abdominal symptoms, 3 on rectal symptoms and 5 on stool symptoms. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). If the changes in the overall or subscale scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation.</description>

The starting dose was oxycodone CR 10 mg twice daily for 3 days. The dose was then increased to 20 mg oxycodone CR twice daily for at least 4 days. Thereafter, during the titration and maintenance phase participants were allowed to increase the dose every 3 days. Dose decreases were allowed without time restrictions. Oxycodone doses were thus 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 mg twice a day (BID) were dosed by participants during 15 weeks (3 weeks titration and 12 weeks maintenance).</description>
