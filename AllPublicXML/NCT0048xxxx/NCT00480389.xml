  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if preoperative administration of Sorafenib reduces the
      size of the primary kidney tumour in patients with metastatic disease undergoing
      cytoreductive surgery.

      The study will also assess the safety of preoperative Sorafenib.

      The study drug, Sorafenib, will be given to patients preoperatively for 12 weeks. After a 1
      week washout period the patient will then have their nephrectomy (kidney removed).
      Approximately 6 weeks following their nephrectomy, patients will resume on study drug until
      disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, non-randomized, open label one arm pilot study of Sorafenib 400 mg
      twice daily given for 12 weeks preoperatively in patients with advanced metastatic kidney
      cancer scheduled for cytoreductive surgery. Patients will be fully staged for disease
      progression with Brain MRI, CT, whole body Bone Scans, Kidney ultrasound and biopsy.
      Additionally, patients' cardiac status will be evaluated pre-enrolment with an ECG and MUGA
      Scan. Once enrolled into the study, patients will have clinic visits on weeks 2, 8 and 12 for
      monitoring visits with vital signs and adverse event recording plus blood evaluations for
      hematology and chemistry. Patients will be called on weeks 3,5,6,7,9,10 and 11 to determine
      any changes in health status. Surgery will occur at week 13, after a one week washout from
      study drug. Patients will resume on study drug 6 weeks post operatively (or later, if wound
      is not completely healed). Patients will continue on study drug and will be monitored every 4
      weeks until disease progression, as determined by bone imaging and CT.

    <description>All patients on study will be accrued to this arm. Sorafenib (200 mg tablets x 2) will be administered orally twice a day for 12 weeks (full daily dose of 800 mg). Patient visits for safety will be conducted at least every 4 weeks. Sorafenib dose reductions for drug-related toxicity will be applied based on considerable prior clinical experience. Surgery will be performed at the completion of the 13th week, allowing for a one-week &quot;washout&quot; period. Sorafenib will be continued post operatively (around 6 weeks post surgery or when complete wound healing has occurred) until patient progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</description>

    <description>Starting dose: 400 mg (2x200mg tablets) BID (total= 800mg/day) taken orally. The dose can be adjusted as per investigator if required due to toxicity (ex. 200mg BID, 200mg QD). Study drug is taken for 12 weeks preoperatively. Patients restart on study drug 6 weeks postoperatively and continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</description>
