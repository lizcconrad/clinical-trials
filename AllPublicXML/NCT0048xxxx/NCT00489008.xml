  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
      can help to control NSCLC. The safety of SBRT will also be studied.

      Objectives:

      To assess therapeutic efficacy and toxicities of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for
      patients with medically inoperable stage I (T1-2, N0,M0), selective stage II (chest wall T3,
      N0M0) or isolated peripheral lung recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Primary goal: Improve 2 years progression free survival at the treated primary tumor site.

      Secondary goals:

        1. Improve disease free survival, disease specific survival and overall survival at 2
           years.

        2. Decrease grade 3 and above acute and/or chronic toxicities.

        3. Collect blood for future biomarkers study

      Stereotactic body radiotherapy is designed to provide an image guided, more focused, dose
      escalated radiotherapy over a shorter time frame (1 week rather than 7 weeks) than
      conventional radiation therapy. The goal of SBRT is to improve tumor control while reducing
      the side effects.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive daily SBRT for 4
      days in a row over a 45 minute time period. During the treatment, you will lie still on a
      table for about 45 minutes per day in the same position. The machine will deliver the dose
      according to the plan developed by the doctor and the dose will be controlled by a computer.

      During the treatment, you will be seen by a doctor and research nurse once a week to evaluate
      possible side effects. A physical exam and a medical history will be done at these visits.

      You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects
      occur.

      You will have a follow-up visit 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy to check for side
      effects. You will continue to have follow-up visits that will decrease in frequency over
      time. You will have imaging tests (chest CT or positron emission computed tomography (PET)
      scan) and routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons) at these follow-up visits.

      This is an investigational study. SBRT is FDA approved for the treatment of lung cancer.
      About 138 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             cancer is eligible if primary cancers have been cured or stable with life expectance

             cytologically as NSCLC without evidence of lymph node or mediastinal involvement
             (clinical stage T1-2, chest wall involvement T3, N0M0) and not eligible for cohort 1
             and recurrent disease as defined in Cohort 2. This includes NSCLC happens within 5
             years after initial definitive treatment of prior NSCLC, and/or is located in the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any tumor involving main bronchus, major vessels, heart, esophagus, trachea, carina,
             spinal cord.

          2. Any tumor that causes collapsed lobe of lung.

          3. Any tumor with malignant pleural effusion.

          4. Direct evidence of hilar, mediastinal lymph node or distant metastasis based on
             staging work up.
