  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-eluting stents have been shown to decrease restenosis, but were associated with an
      increased rate of death, as compared with bare-metal stents. Recently, thiazolidinediones
      effectively reduced restenosis and the risk of repeat target vessel revascularization. We
      conducted a study to compare the performance of a drug-eluting stent with that of a
      bare-metal stent with pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus.

      The study is a prospective cohort trial involving 38 type 2 diabetic patients referred for
      coronary stenting who were assigned to either the sirolimus-eluting stent group or the
      pioglitazone group. Quantitative coronary angiography will be performed at study entry and at
      six months follow-up to evaluate in-stent late luminal loss and the percentage of the luminal
      diameter and the rate of restenosis. We also analyze major adverse cardiac events at 12
      months.
