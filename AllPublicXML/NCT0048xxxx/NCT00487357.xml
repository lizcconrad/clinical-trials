      This research project is for the parents of study participants in the &quot;Predictors of Smoking
      in Mexican American Youth,&quot; also known as the MATCh study.

      This research project has three objectives.

      These include:

        1. collecting data on your health behaviors. Researchers are interested in this information
           because your health behaviors may influence your children's health behavior;

        2. learning about the types of interventions that would be of most use and interest to you
           and your family; and

        3. learning about the most convenient and useful way in which these interventions would be
           delivered.

      Researchers are interested in knowing about the types of interventions that would benefit you
      and your family because they would like to design future intervention studies that meet your
      needs and the needs others in your community.
