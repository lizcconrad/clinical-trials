        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Migraine Specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire for Adolescents (MSQ-A) Score at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12</title>
        <description>The MSQ-A consists of 14 items measuring how migraines affect QOL: Role Function (RF)-Restrictive (items 1-7) and RF-Preventative (items 8-11), examining the degree to which performance of daily activities is limited or interrupted, respectively, by migraine; RF-Emotional (items 12-14, examining frustration/helplessness due to migraine). Dimensions (dim.) are scored independently. The 14 items are reverse coded onto a 1-6 scale; dim. are then created by summing specific item scores and transforming raw total score onto a 0-100 scale. For each dim., higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Migraine Specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire for Adolescents (MSQ-A) Score at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12</title>
          <description>The MSQ-A consists of 14 items measuring how migraines affect QOL: Role Function (RF)-Restrictive (items 1-7) and RF-Preventative (items 8-11), examining the degree to which performance of daily activities is limited or interrupted, respectively, by migraine; RF-Emotional (items 12-14, examining frustration/helplessness due to migraine). Dimensions (dim.) are scored independently. The 14 items are reverse coded onto a 1-6 scale; dim. are then created by summing specific item scores and transforming raw total score onto a 0-100 scale. For each dim., higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Categorized by Response to Each of the 3 Global Satisfaction Questions From the Patient Perception Migraine Questionaire–Revised (PPMQ-R) at Month 12</title>
        <description>The PPMQ-R is a fully validated 32-item questionnaire assessing participant satisfaction with acute migraine medication and includes 3 questions that assess satisfaction with respect to efficacy, side effects, and overall satisfaction (i.e., How effective the medication is overall, side effects of the medication, overall satisfaction with the medication). Each item is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from “very satisfied” (1) to “very dissatisfied” (7).</description>

        <population>Enrolled Population: all participants entered into the trial and dispensed the Combination Tablet, regardless of whether they ever took the Combination Tablet. Due to data collection and/or assignment of a collected assessment to a visit, the number of participants analyzed at a given visit could vary.</population>
