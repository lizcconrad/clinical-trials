  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label study is to evaluate the long-term (6-month) safety and
      tolerability of extended-release paliperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, given in flexible
      dosages to adolescents with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month, open-label study (the patient, investigator, and sponsor know the study
      drug and dosage being taken by the patient) of the safety and tolerability of flexible-dose
      (1.5 to 12mg per day), extended-release (ER) paliperidone in adolescents with a diagnosis of
      schizophrenia. Patients who have completed study R076477PSZ3001 or who discontinued from that
      study because of lack of efficacy but completed a minimum of 21 days of the study may enter
      this study. Patients may also enter this study directly without participating in
      R076477PSZ3001. This study consists of a 21-day screening and washout phase (to discontinue
      and &quot;wash out&quot; any medication not allowed in the study), an open-label treatment phase of up
      to 26 weeks during which all patients will take oral paliperidone ER every day, and a
      post-treatment phase consisting of a follow-up visit completed 1 week after a patient has
      received the final dose of paliperidone ER. The study, including the screening and
      posttreatment phase, will last approximately 30 weeks. Screening and washout may be conducted
      while a patient is either an inpatient or an outpatient. Safety will be assessed by
      laboratory measurements (chemistry, liver function tests, hematology, hormone, lipid
      assessments, prolactin [blinded], urinalysis, and urine drug screens); body weight, height,
      and waist circumference measurements; ECGs; and physical examinations (including Tanner
      staging). The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale
      (BARS), and Simpson Angus Rating Scale (SAS) will be used to assess extrapyramidal symptoms
      (EPS) and dyskinesias. Adverse events will be monitored including psychiatric adverse events
      of interest (i.e., suicide and related phenomena, homicidal ideation, depressed mood, and
      worsening of psychosis) that may be associated with paliperidone ER in this population. The
      primary aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term (6-month) safety and tolerability of
      paliperidone ER in adolescents with schizophrenia. As exploratory secondary aims, the study
      will assess the effect of paliperidone ER on the long-term symptoms of schizophrenia as
      measured by the changes in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS)
      scores, the global improvement in severity of illness as measured by the Clinical Global
      Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale, the benefits in psychological, social, and school
      functioning as measured by the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), the changes in
      multiple domains of cognitive functioning measured by the modified Measurements and Treatment
      Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) assessment battery, and the effect
      on sleep as measured by the sleep Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patients begin the study at 6.0
      mg/day of oral paliperidone ER. If a higher dosage is needed, the dosage will be increased
      (in increments of 3 mg/day not more frequently than once every 5 days) to 12 mg/day. If the
      6.0 mg/day dosage is not well tolerated, the dosage may be decreased (not more frequently
      than once every 5 days) to 3.0 mg/day or 1.5 mg/day. Patients will be dosed for up to 6
      months.

    <description>Neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed using the 30-item PANSS scale. PANSS scale provides a total score (sum of scores of all 30 items) and scores for 3 subscales, ie, positive (7 items), negative (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items) subscales. Each item is scored on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). Positive Factor Score (range: 8 to 56): sum of select scores from positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales. Negative Factor Score (range: 7 to 49): sum of select scores from negative and general psychopathology subscales. Disorganized Thoughts Factor Score (range: 7 to 49): sum of select scores from positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales. Uncontrolled Hostility/Excitement Factor Score (range: 4 to 28): sum of select scores from positive and general psychopathology subscales. Anxiety/Depression Factor Score (range: 4 to 28): sum of select scores from general psychopathology subscale. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study evaluated the long-term (2 year) safety and tolerability of paliperidone extended release (ER) in adolescent patients with schizophrenia. This study was conducted from 27 June 2007 to 18 July 2012 at 55 centers in 10 countries. A total of 400 patients received at least 1 dose of the study drug and were included in the safety analysis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients enrolled in this study came from 3 different sources: patients who enrolled directly, patients who were randomly assigned to placebo in the R076477PSZ3001 (NCT00518323) study, and patients who were randomly assigned to paliperidone ER in the R076477PSZ3001 (NCT00518323) study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Patients in this group were previously assigned to placebo in the R076477PSZ3001 (NCT00518323) study. They started with an oral dose of 6 mg tablets daily, regardless of prior treatment assignment in R076477PSZ3001 (NCT00518323). The initial 6 mg daily dose was increased in increments of 3 mg, not more frequently than once every 5 days until the maximum dose of 12 mg daily was reached. If 12 mg was not well tolerated, then the dose could be reduced down to 9 mg daily. Alternatively the dose could be decreased to 3 mg or 1.5 mg daily, if the initial 6 mg dose was not well tolerated.</description>

Alternatively the dose could be decreased to 3 mg or 1.5 mg daily, if the initial 6 mg dose was not well tolerated.</description>

        <title>Change From Open-label Baseline to Open-label Endpoint in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Scores - Last Observation Carried Forward</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104 or the last post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
        <population>The open-label intent-to-treat analysis set was used for the efficacy analyses. All enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of open-label study drug and had both the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline assessment in the open-label phase were included in this analysis set.</population>

        <description>Neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed using the 30-item PANSS scale. PANSS scale provides a total score (sum of scores of all 30 items) and scores for 3 subscales, ie, positive (7 items), negative (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items) subscales. Each item is scored on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). Positive Factor Score (range: 8 to 56): sum of select scores from positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales. Negative Factor Score (range: 7 to 49): sum of select scores from negative and general psychopathology subscales. Disorganized Thoughts Factor Score (range: 7 to 49): sum of select scores from positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales. Uncontrolled Hostility/Excitement Factor Score (range: 4 to 28): sum of select scores from positive and general psychopathology subscales. Anxiety/Depression Factor Score (range: 4 to 28): sum of select scores from general psychopathology subscale. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <description>The CGAS is a 100 point rating scale which measures the psychological, social, and school functioning for children 6 to 17 years of age. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the impairment level of general functioning (poor to superior functioning). Higher scores denote better functioning.</description>

They started with an oral dose of 6 mg tablets daily, regardless of prior treatment assignment in R076477PSZ3001 (NCT00518323). The initial 6 mg daily dose was increased in increments of 3 mg, not more frequently than once every 5 days until the maximum dose of 12 mg daily was reached. If 12 mg was not well tolerated, then the dose could be reduced down to 9 mg daily. Alternatively the dose could be decreased to 3 mg or 1.5 mg daily, if the initial 6 mg dose was not well tolerated.</description>

        <description>Sleep VAS is a self administered scale that rates the quality of sleep and daytime drowsiness. Participants make a mark on a line to represent how well they have slept in the previous 7 days (“very badly” to “very well”) and how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days (“not at all” to “all the time”). The score for each item ranges from 0 to 100 mm. For quality of sleep, a score of 0 indicates “Very badly” and a score of 100 indicates “Very well.” For daytime drowsiness, a score of 0 indicates “Not at all” and a score of 100 indicates “All the time.” Improvement of the condition is indicated by the positive change for the quality of sleep and the negative change for the daytime drowsiness.</description>

        <title>Change From Open-label Baseline to Open-label Endpoint in the Sleep Visual Analog Scale (VAS): Daytime Drowsiness - Last Observation Carried Forward</title>
        <description>Sleep VAS is a self administered scale that rates the quality of sleep and daytime drowsiness. Participants make a mark on a line to represent how well they have slept in the previous 7 days (“very badly” to “very well”) and how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days (“not at all” to “all the time”). The score for each item ranges from 0 to 100 mm. For quality of sleep, a score of 0 indicates “Very badly” and a score of 100 indicates “Very well.” For daytime drowsiness, a score of 0 indicates “Not at all” and a score of 100 indicates “All the time.” Improvement of the condition is indicated by the positive change for the quality of sleep and the negative change for the daytime drowsiness.</description>

        <population>The open-label intent-to-treat analysis set was used for the efficacy analyses.

            <description>Patients in this group were previously assigned to placebo in the R076477PSZ3001 (NCT00518323) study. They started with an oral dose of 6 mg tablets daily, regardless of prior treatment assignment in R076477PSZ3001 (NCT00518323). The initial 6 mg daily dose was increased in increments of 3 mg, not more frequently than once every 5 days until the maximum dose of 12 mg daily was reached. If 12 mg was not well tolerated, then the dose could be reduced down to 9 mg daily. Alternatively the dose could be decreased to 3 mg or 1.5 mg daily, if the initial 6 mg dose was not well tolerated.</description>
