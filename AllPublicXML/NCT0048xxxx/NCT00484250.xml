    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder which causes local
      irritation,discomfort and subsequent poor dentition and discomfort in eating . Various
      treatments have been suggested for OLP but their results are unsatisfactory .Despite the fact
      that steroids have been the main therapeutic choice for many years,some researches have been
      done regarding the efficacy of other medication such as metronidazole and doxycycline.The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether metronidazole and doxycycline are effective in
      the treatment of oral lichen planus and to compare their efficacy with each other.
