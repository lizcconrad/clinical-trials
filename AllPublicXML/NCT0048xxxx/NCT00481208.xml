      Diurnal fluctuations of intraocular pressure (IOP) and peripapillary retinal blood flow may
      have distinctive patterns in medically well-controlled open-angle glaucoma patients. In the
      results, we found a unique pattern, 'Latent asymmetric IOP', defined as the IOP which differs
      between the eyes only when placed in the supine position. Unique effects of this latent
      asymmetric IOP on Visual field and diurnal IOP fluctuations were studied.

      Diurnal fluctuations of intraocular pressure (IOP) and peripapillary retinal blood flow have
      been implicated to be one of the important factors to affect visual field progression.
      However, there was no study to investigate them in medically well-controlled open-angle
      glaucoma patients. So we want to find the unique patterns.

      Study 1. Subjects : Patients with medically well controlled open angle glaucoma Method : IOP
      and peripapillary retinal blood flow were measured for 24 hours. The relationship between the
      two were studied.

      Study 2. Of the patients enrolled in study 1 , those on the same medical regimen for both
      eyes were analyzed for the presence of a latent asymmetric IOP and it's influence and
      association with visual field and diurnal IOP fluctuation.
