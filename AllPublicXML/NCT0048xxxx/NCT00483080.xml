      The main objective of the trial is to document the progression free survival (PFS) in
      advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with NGR-hTNF as single agent.
      Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to NCI-CTC
      criteria.

      This is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized study that will be conducted in patients
      affected by advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), previously treated with
      fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based regimens, that will be conducted using
      Simon's two-stage design method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt;18 years affected by advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC),
             previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based regimens,
             but not more than three lines of therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy following definitive
             management of the primary lesion in the colon or rectum is allowed and will not be
             counted as a line of therapy

               -  ECOG Performance status 0 - 1

               -  Patients in progression disease at study entry, CT documented

               -  Adequate baseline bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, defined as follows:

          -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  AST and/or ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN in absence of liver metastases

          -  AST and/or ALT &lt; 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  Absence of any conditions in which hypervolemia and its consequences (e.g.
                  increased stroke volume, elevated blood pressure) or hemodilution could represent
                  a risk for the patient (reference appendix &quot;Technical data sheet human albumin&quot;)

               -  Normal cardiac function and absence of uncontrolled hypertension

               -  Patients must give written informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than three lines of chemotherapy (except biological agents)

          -  Concurrent anticancer therapy

          -  Patients may not receive any other investigational agents while on study

          -  Clinical signs of CNS involvement

          -  Patients with active or uncontrolled systemic disease/infections or with serious
             illness or medical conditions, which is incompatible with the protocol

          -  Known hypersensitivity/allergic reaction to human albumin preparations or to any of
             the excipients

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol

          -  Pregnancy or lactation. Patients - both males and females - with reproductive
             potential (i.e.menopausal for less than 1-year and not surgically sterilized) must
             practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing
             potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior
             to registration
