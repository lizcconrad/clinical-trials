    <textblock>
      Relationships between altered prefrontal cortical dopamine, norepinephrine and some cognitive
      impairments of schizophrenia supports and approach for pharmacological remediation of
      cognitive symptoms through manipulations of prefrontal cortical dopamine and norepinephrine.
      Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor, produces a widespread increase
      in brain norepinephrine and a secondary and selective increase in prefrontal dopamine. Given
      this, we are evaluating atomoxetine's cognitive effects in a pilot placebo controlled trial
      in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, an fMRI investigation was undertaken to assess the
      neural mechanisms underlying the cognitive effects of atomoxetine.

      Participants carrying a diagnosis of schizophrenia and receiving treatment with one of the
      following antipsychotic medications are eleigible for participation: risperidone, olanzapine,
      quetiapine, aripirazole. Following consent, participants will be observed for 4 weeks to
      ensure stability of their symptoms. Following this, there will be baseline assessments of
      symptom severity, cognitive ability, functional ability and an fMRI scan. Following this,
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with 40 mg of atomoxetine or
      placebo daily during a double-blind parallel designed four week treatment period, following
      which the dose of atomoxetine will be increased to 40 mg twice day (or matching placebo) for
      an additional 4 weeks. The cognitive assessment battery and MRI will be repeated following 8
      weeks of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will be males and females between the ages of 18 and 65

          2. In good general medical health

          3. For patient subjects, a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, any subtype

          4. Currently in remission or with stable, unchanging residual symptoms

          5. Receiving treatment with olanzapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, or quetiapine as their
             antipsychotic medication at a stable dose for a minimum of eight weeks.

          6. Able to complete neurocognitive tests

          7. Able to give informed consent. All subjects will be required to have at least an 8th
             grade reading level and/or a full-scale IQ of at least 85 as assessed by the Wide
             Range Achievement Test (WRAT).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recent history (within previous year) of serious suicide, homicide, or physical
             violence, or current suicidal or homicidal thoughts

          2. Any axis I DSM-IV diagnosis in addition to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
             except substance abuse in remission

          3. History of severe head trauma, neurological disorder, or medical illness which may
             contribute to the subjects' psychiatric symptoms or cognitive impairment

          4. Medical illness which requires taking any medication that has CNS activity which is
             known to impair cognition.

          5. Untreated or unstable hypertension.

          6. Coronary artery disease.

          7. Receiving concomitant anticholinergic drugs, antidepressants or mood stabilizers. If
             patient subjects are receiving benzodiazepines, they must be short or intermediate
             acting (e.g. alprazolam, lorazepam) and must be held 48 hours prior to cognitive
             testing

          8. Unable to give informed consent
