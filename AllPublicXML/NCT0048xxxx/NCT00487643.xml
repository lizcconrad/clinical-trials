  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: to build a library of normal tear lacritin values by collecting tears from normal
      adult human subjects and to develop a non-invasive clinical assay for lacritin. Such an assay
      will provide more sensitive indicators of eye disease for clinicians and determine if a
      particular therapy, such as recombinant lacritin drops, is of benefit.

    <intervention_name>Tear Collection</intervention_name>
    <description>The tear sample will be collected from the left eye of each subject. Subjects wearing contact lenses will be instructed to remove their lenses and wait at least 5 minutes before proceeding with the tear collection procedure. The patient will then be instructed to sit with eyes gently closed for two minutes after instilling one (1) drop of 0.5% proparacaine on the cornea and conjunctiva. Tear collection was accomplished by using a polyester fiber rod wick. This wick will be placed in contact with the tear fluid at the lower cul-de-sac for a minimum time to obtain fluid without irritating the subject's eye approx. for 3 to 5 minutes.</description>
