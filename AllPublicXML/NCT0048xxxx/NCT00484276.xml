    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to document the progression free survival (PFS) in
      advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma patients treated with NGR-hTNF as
      single agent.

      Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to NCI-CTC
      criteria.

      This is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized study that will be conducted in patients
      affected by advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma previously treated with no
      more than one systemic therapeutic regimen , that will be conducted using Simon's two-stage
      design method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt;18 years affected by malignant pleural mesothelioma previously treated with
             no more than one systemic therapeutic regimen

          -  Histologically or cytological confirmed malignant pleural mesothelioma of any of the
             following subtype: epithelial, sarcomatous, mixed

          -  Prior intrapleural cytotoxic agents including bleomycin not considered systemic
             chemotherapy

          -  ECOG Performance status 0 - 2

          -  Adequate baseline bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, defined as follows:

               -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L

               -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  AST and/or ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN in absence of liver metastasis

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  Absence of any conditions in which hypervolemia and its consequences (e.g. increased
             stroke volume, elevated blood pressure) or haemodilution could represent a risk for
             the patient (take as reference &quot;Technical data sheet human albumin&quot; specifically used
             in Pharmacy Department for NGR-hTNF dilution)

          -  Patients may have had prior therapy providing the following conditions are met:

               -  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy: wash-out period of 28 days

               -  Surgery: wash-out period of 14 days

          -  Normal cardiac function and absence of uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Patients must give written informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent anticancer therapy

          -  Patients may not receive any other investigational agents while on study

          -  Clinical signs of CNS involvement

          -  Patients with active or uncontrolled systemic disease/infections or with serious
             illness or medical conditions, which is incompatible with the protocol

          -  Known hypersensitivity/allergic reaction to human albumin preparations or to any of
             the excipients

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol

          -  Pregnancy or lactation. Patients - both males and females - with reproductive
             potential (i.e. menopausal for less than 1-year and not surgically sterilized) must
             practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing
             potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior
             to registration
