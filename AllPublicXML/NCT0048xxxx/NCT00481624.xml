  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a better, more convenient way to improve anemia results
      by increasing the amount of medication given at 3 week intervals. Researchers want to know if
      giving a higher dose of Procrit® and intravenous (IV) iron once every 3 weeks would give
      better results in treating anemia without the need for more office visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are more than 170,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer in the United States each
      year and many will develop anemia (iron deficiency) during the course of treatment. Anemia is
      associated with poor quality of life and treatment delays for advanced lung cancer. The
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia is with iron. Iron is an essential mineral used in red
      blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron is necessary to make hemoglobin, a key
      element in red blood cells.

      The FDA has approved Procrit® (epoetin alfa) to treat anemia in people with non-myeloid (bone
      marrow) malignancies. Procrit® is a man-made, injectable drug for treating anemia and it
      encourages red cell production. While the administration of intravenous iron therapy,
      injected into veins through an IV, did increase the response rate of Procrit® in a previous
      study, researchers want to find out the best amount of drug to use and the best time to
      administer Procrit®, along with ferric gluconate, (Ferrlecit®), added for lack of iron.

    <description>One (1) injection of Procrit®, by needle, inserted just under the skin;
125 mg of ferric gluconate (an iron injection product), through an IV injection into a vein.
These injections will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. Both will be administered every 3 weeks for a total of 4 cycles, unless the study doctor decides that a change in the amount of Procrit® and iron is necessary once the hemoglobin level rises or is above a certain amount.
In addition to Procrit® and the intravenous iron, the subject will also receive platinum-containing chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles as per standard of care for their lung cancer treatment. Radiation therapy will be allowed during this regimen if it is part of the subject's treatment plan.</description>
