    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to document the progression free survival (PFS) in
      advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with NGR-hTNF as single
      agent.

      Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to NCI-CTC
      criteria

      This is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized study that will be conducted in patients
      affected by advanced or metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with no
      more than one systemic therapeutic regimen, that will be conducted using Simon's two-stage
      design method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt;18 years affected by advanced or metastatic HCC previously treated with no
             more than one systemic therapeutic regimen

          -  Histologically confirmed HCC not amenable to curative surgery

          -  Child-Pugh scale class A

          -  ECOG Performance status 0 - 1

          -  Patients in progression disease at study entry CT documented

          -  Adequate baseline bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, defined as follows:

               -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Absence of any conditions in which hypervolaemia and its consequences (e.g. increased
             stroke volume, elevated blood pressure) or haemodilution could represent a risk for
             the patient (reference appendix &quot;Technical data sheet human albumin&quot;)

          -  Normal cardiac function and absence of uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Patients must give written informed consent

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score &gt;7)

          -  Concurrent anticancer therapy

          -  Clinical signs of CNS involvement

          -  Patients with active or uncontrolled systemic disease/infections or with serious
             illness or medical conditions, which is incompatible with the protocol

          -  Known hypersensitivity/allergic reaction to human albumin preparations or to any of
             the excipients

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially

             potential (i.e. menopausal for less than 1-year and not surgically sterilized) must
             practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing
             potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior
