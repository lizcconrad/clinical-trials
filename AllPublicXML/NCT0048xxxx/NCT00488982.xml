  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, randomized Phase II study of intermittent chemotherapy with and without
      GM-CSF. All patients will receive six 21-day cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on Day 2 of each
      cycle and 5 mg prednisone twice a day on Days 1-21. Following six cycles of chemotherapy,
      eligible subjects will be randomized to no maintenance therapy or to maintenance GM-CSF
      therapy. The GM-CSF group dose schedule will be 250 mcg/m2 SQ daily Days 15-28 every 28 days.
      Patients in both groups will continue until disease progression at which time GM-CSF will be
      discontinued and chemotherapy will again be administered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age over 18 years

          3. Progressive metastatic prostate cancer

          4. Castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/ml) must be maintained

          5. Prior hormonal therapy or medications :

             Patients who are receiving an anti-androgen, secondary hormonal therapy (i.e.
             ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, megestrol acetate, diethylstilbestrol), 5-alpha
             reductase inhibitor (i.e. finasteride (Proscar), dutasteride (Avodart)) or herbal
             prostate medication (i.e. saw palmetto, PC-SPES, PC-PLUS) must discontinue the drug by
             the date of initiation of chemotherapy on study

          6. ≥ 4 weeks since major surgery and fully recovered

          7. ≥ 4 weeks since any prior radiation with any toxicity attributable to radiation
             resolved to ≤grade 1

          8. ≥ 8 weeks since the last dose of strontium or samarium

          9. Sexually active patients must agree to use adequate contraception

         10. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%

         11. Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks

         12. Required initial laboratory values Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/ul Platelets &gt;

        AST AND ALT AND alkaline phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility In
        determining eligibility, the more abnormal of the 2 values (AST or ALT should be used. An
        abnormal alkaline phosphatase must be attributed to liver dysfunction and not metastatic
        bone involvement (i.e elevated GGTP or evidence of liver metastases)

        Inclusion criteria for late enrolling patients:
