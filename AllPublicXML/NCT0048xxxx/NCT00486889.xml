    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a
      critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the
      body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures
      called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates
      and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their
      normal function. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term growth and
      development of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease with alglucosidase alfa before 1
      year of age. Patients will be followed for 10-year period.
