  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing hypophysectomy through transsphenoidal approach, preventing cough
      during anesthetic emergence is important to avoid hemorrhage and cerebrospinal fluid leakage.
      Previous reports demonstrated that administration of remifentanil during anesthetic emergence
      could reduce the incidence and severity of cough during anesthetic emergence. Therefore, the
      objective of this study is to determine EC95 of remifentanil for preventing cough during
      anesthetic emergence in patients undergoing hypophysectomy with transsphenoidal approach.

    <description>A given effect site concentration of remifentanil would be administered to subjects using TCI system. According to biased coin design, the given concentration of remifentanil is determined according to success or failure of just previously enrolled patient. If the former patient did not cough during anesthetic emergence at a given concentration (success), the next patient will be randomly allocated into the same concentration of remifentanil with 18/19 of probability or the lower concentration of remifentanil by 0.4 ng/ml with 1/19 of probability. If the former patient coughed during anesthetic emergence (failure), the next will be automatically allocated into the higher concentration of remifentanil by 0.4 ng/ml.</description>
