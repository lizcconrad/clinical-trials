  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical gap in the knowledge on how to implement effective interventions for
      renal transplant recipients (RTRs) to improve immunosuppressant therapy (IST) adherence and
      clinical outcomes. The objectives of this project were to address this gap through: (1)
      designing, implementing, and evaluating a patient-specific behavioral contract intervention
      to improve RTRs' IST adherence rates (contracts are written, signed agreements between the
      RTR and healthcare provider in which the RTR agrees to be adherent to IST according to
      mutually agreed upon criteria); and (2) measuring the effects of IST adherence on RTRs'
      health-related quality of life (HQoL) and healthcare utilizations and costs. The primary
      hypothesis was that at one year post trial enrollment, RTRs who establish behavioral
      contracts with healthcare professionals will be more adherent than those who do not establish
      behavioral contracts and subsequently will have greater HQoL and lower healthcare
      utilizations and costs. Once it is better understood how to implement effective IST adherence
      intervention programs, clinicians will have a valuable tool to promote therapeutic success,
      improve HQoL, and reduce healthcare utilizations and costs. Therefore, we pursued the
      following Specific Aims: (1) determine the effectiveness of an IST adherence contract-based
      intervention on IST adherence; (2) determine the relationship between IST adherence, the
      intervention, and RTRs' HQoL; and (3) determine the influence of IST adherence and the
      intervention on RTRs' healthcare utilizations/costs. To achieve the Specific Aims, a
      randomized controlled trial of the patient-specific behavioral contract-based intervention
      was conducted, and data regarding adherence, HQoL, and healthcare utilizations/costs were
      collected over a 12-month period for each RTR study participant and analyzed. This project
      will promote healthy lives, increase well-being, and reduce burden of illness and disparity
      among adult RTRs by providing data regarding an adherence intervention and the impact of IST
      adherence and the behavioral contract intervention on RTRs' health and economic outcomes and
      HQoL. Collectively, this new knowledge will provide critical steps toward optimizing RTRs'
      graft maintenance, productivity, and HQoL, while decreasing graft rejection, return to
      dialysis, morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

    <description>Immunosuppressant therapy adherence as measured by pharmacy refill records. Adherence was calculated quarterly for one year by using the number of days between prescription (IST) refills. If the total number of days between refills was less than or equal to the total days' supply of IST, the participant's adherence rate was 1.0, or 100%. If the number of days between refills was greater than the days' supply, the adherence rate was calculated as follows:
1 - [(Days Between Refills - Total Days Supply)/Days Between Refills] = Adherence Rate for Quarterly Time Period
At the end of the 12-month study period, the quarterly adherence rates were averaged to produce an overall adherence rate for the study period.</description>

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life (HQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a multi-attribute, preference-based HQoL instrument. Considered a global HQoL measure, the EQ-5D is a descriptive system that classifies respondents into one of 243 distinct health states based on five dimensions (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has three levels, reflecting &quot;no problems,&quot; &quot;some problems,&quot; and &quot;extreme problems.&quot; A scoring function assigns a value (EQ-5DIndex score) to self-reported health states from a set of preference weights that have been empirically derived. The EQ-5D's total scale (preference value) range is from 0 to 1.0. On this scale, the preference value of 1.0 represents perfect health and 0.0 represents death. Preference values less than 0 are possible, but not reflected on the scale, and reflect health states that the U.S. population consider worse than death.</description>

    <measure>Days in Hospital</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We used a standardized patient reporting approach to collect direct healthcare utilizations data, including days in hospital. A brief healthcare screening questionnaire was administered to both the intervention and control groups on a monthly basis during the one-year study period. Monthly recall periods were chosen to minimize bias and forgetfulness. The questionnaire collected the number of times each month a participant utilized a direct medical service, specifically, days in hospital, emergency department (ED) visit, outpatient visit (clinic, physician office), and home healthcare visit.
Analysis compared proportion of each group who had at least one day in hospital during the 12-month study period.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>RTRs were enrolled between January 2010 and September 2011 and followed for one year (the study or intervention period). All active participants completed the study by September 2012; however, refill records were collected for three months following the end of the study period to calculate a follow-up (post-intervention) adherence rate.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Inclusion criteria: (a) at least 21 years of age; (b) at least one year post-transplant to allow for stabilization of the prescribed IST regimen; (c) receive an immunosuppressant regimen that contains oral tacrolimus or cyclosporine; and (d) obtain their IST from Avella for at least one year prior to study enrollment and during the study period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Intervention Group</title>
          <description>Behavioral contract intervention.
Each participant in the intervention group met with the study pharmacist to negotiate and sign an immunosuppressant therapy (IST) adherence contract at baseline. Each intervention participant met with the study pharmacist at 3-, 6-, and 9-months post-enrollment to review his or her contract, discuss progress toward reaching the contract's goal of achieving the highest possible IST adherence, update terms of the contract if needed, and re-sign the contract for the next three-month period. At the 12-month post-enrollment meeting, the contract was terminated.
The contract included: (a) motivation(s) for achieving adherence; (b) barriers that may interfere with achieving adherence and possible solutions to overcome barriers; (c) social support available such as a significant other who may assist in following the dosing schedule; (d) tools/strategies to follow the dosing schedule; and (e) possible consequences of nonadherence</description>

        <title>Comparison of Average Immunosuppressant Therapy Adherence for 12-month Study Period</title>
        <description>Immunosuppressant therapy adherence as measured by pharmacy refill records. Adherence was calculated quarterly for one year by using the number of days between prescription (IST) refills. If the total number of days between refills was less than or equal to the total days’ supply of IST, the participant’s adherence rate was 1.0, or 100%. If the number of days between refills was greater than the days’ supply, the adherence rate was calculated as follows:
1 – [(Days Between Refills – Total Days Supply)/Days Between Refills] = Adherence Rate for Quarterly Time Period
At the end of the 12-month study period, the quarterly adherence rates were averaged to produce an overall adherence rate for the study period.</description>

            <groups_desc>We projected mean composite adherence rate for all participants to be approximately 80% ± 15. We anticipated at least 10% increase in intervention group adherence at end of intervention. To have 80% power to detect expected difference of 10% at the 2-tailed 5% significance level, sample size needed to be at least 36 RTRs per group. We took a conservative approach, in combination with anticipated attrition over the course of study, and increased enrollment.</groups_desc>

        <title>Health-related Quality of Life (HQoL)</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a multi-attribute, preference-based HQoL instrument. Considered a global HQoL measure, the EQ-5D is a descriptive system that classifies respondents into one of 243 distinct health states based on five dimensions (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has three levels, reflecting “no problems,” “some problems,” and “extreme problems.” A scoring function assigns a value (EQ-5DIndex score) to self-reported health states from a set of preference weights that have been empirically derived. The EQ-5D's total scale (preference value) range is from 0 to 1.0. On this scale, the preference value of 1.0 represents perfect health and 0.0 represents death. Preference values less than 0 are possible, but not reflected on the scale, and reflect health states that the U.S. population consider worse than death.</description>

        <title>Days in Hospital</title>
        <description>We used a standardized patient reporting approach to collect direct healthcare utilizations data, including days in hospital. A brief healthcare screening questionnaire was administered to both the intervention and control groups on a monthly basis during the one-year study period. Monthly recall periods were chosen to minimize bias and forgetfulness. The questionnaire collected the number of times each month a participant utilized a direct medical service, specifically, days in hospital, emergency department (ED) visit, outpatient visit (clinic, physician office), and home healthcare visit.
Analysis compared proportion of each group who had at least one day in hospital during the 12-month study period.</description>
