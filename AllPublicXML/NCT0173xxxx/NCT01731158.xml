  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, open label, randomized multicenter phase-II study to evaluate
      progression free survival (PFS) in 2nd line treatment in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic clear-cell renal cell cancer (cc-RCC) receiving everolimus (arm A) in comparison
      to a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) (arm B). Following 2nd line treatment, patients will be
      switched to a TKI in arm A and everolimus in arm B. All patients will receive bevacizumab as
      standardized first-line treatment.

      Another key element of the study is the analysis of predictive biomarkers, which will be
      performed in serum and tumor tissue, respectively. Serum samples will be collected at
      prespecified timepoints throughout the study and analysed by SELDI-TOF-MS and DIGE. Candidate
      proteins are thought to predict therapeutic outcome and candidates are subject for target
      validation by Western Blot or ELISA. In addition, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
      tumor tissue will be collected prospectively and analysed for micro RNA (miRNA). Candidate
      miRNAs that predict therapeutic outcome will be validated by quantitative RT-PCR.
      Furthermore, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) will be generated from blood drawings during
      routine visits. The primary objective is to correlate the marker profile defined from the
      FFPE tissue with the profile obtained from CTCs in order to validate expression based markers
      ant their change during different treatment lines.
