  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of midazolam with morphine in patients with severe acute pain is a routine
      practice in the management of pre- and post-operative patients but has not been evaluated in
      pre-hospital setting. The investigators aim to evaluate the co-analgesic effect of midazolam
      in the pre-hospital management of traumatic patients with severe acute pain.

      In a multicenter prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, the
      investigators would like to compare the analgesic effect and safety of the intravenous
      morphine 0.10 mg/kg and midazolam 0.04 mg/kg with the intravenous morphine 0.10 mg/kg and
      placebo in pre-hospital traumatic adults. Assessment will be done at the baseline using a
      validated numeric rating scale (NRS).

      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with a pain score less than or equal
      to 3 after 20 minutes. The secondary outcomes will be in between-group comparison of: the
      treatment safety, pain score every 5 minutes during 30 minutes and the total morphine dose
      required until obtaining a pain score less than or equal to 3.

      Patient will be included in pre-hospital setting. They must have an acute pain NRS greater
      than or equal to 6 from a traumatic origin. The participation of the study for each patient
      will be the time of the pre-hospital setting. The study will stop when the patient arrives at
      the hospital.

      Patient will be randomized after obtaining an informed consent. Then, the nurse will
      administered intravenous morphine 0.10 mg/kg and midazolam 0.04 mg/kg or intravenous morphine
      0.10 mg/kg and placebo.

      Only the nurse will be aware of the treatment received by the patient. Every 5 minutes, life
      constants and pain score will be recorded on the case report form.

      Assessment will be done at the baseline using a validated numeric rating scale. The primary
      outcome will be the proportion of patients with a pain score less than or equal to 3 after 20
      minutes. The secondary outcomes will be in between-group comparison of: the treatment safety,
      pain score every 5 minutes during 30 minutes and the total morphine dose required until
      obtaining a pain score less than or equal to 3.
