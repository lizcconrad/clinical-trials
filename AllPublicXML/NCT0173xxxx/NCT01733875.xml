      To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single oral
      dose of CC-220 and to explore the effect of food on the bioavailability of CC-220 in healthy
      subjects

    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study to be conducted at a single study center. Part 1 is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose study. During the course of Part 1, each
      subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase and a
      follow-up visit. There will be a total of 7 cohorts, each of which consists of a different
      dose level, with 8 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6 subjects will receive a dose of
      CC-220 and 2 subjects will receive placebo depending on the randomization schedule. A single
      dose will be administered to each subject. This study design allows safety and tolerability
      data to be gathered in a stepwise fashion. Administration of study drug at the next higher
      dose level will not begin until the safety and tolerability of the preceding dose have been
      evaluated and deemed acceptable by the investigator and sponsor's medical monitor. Part 2 is
      an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-way crossover study. During the course of Part 2, each
      subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase in each study period, a
      treatment phase in each study period and a follow-up visit. A total of 10 subjects will
      receive a single dose of 1 mg CC-220 in each of 2 study periods, once without food and once
      with food, depending on the treatment sequence to which they are randomized. The CC-220 dose
      in each study period will be separated by a washout of 11 to 14 days.
