  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about some of the unusual chemicals (called
      oligosaccharides) that can occur naturally as a result of processes in the body. Researchers
      want to look at how these chemicals change with time and how they change between different
      patients with MPSIVA. These unusual chemicals were recently discovered in the urine from
      patients with MPSIVA. The investigators would like to study these chemicals before a specific
      enzyme replacement therapy is used. If the investigators understand how these chemicals
      change, the investigators may be able to use them to monitor this condition in the near
      future as well as help doctors know whether certain therapies work well in their patients.

      This is not a clinical trial and there is no outcome measurement. The biomarkers in this
      study are oligosaccharides that secreted in the urine from patients with MPSIVa. In this
      study, we will try to define the variability of these oligosaccharides in the same patient at
      different time points, including different month of a year and different collections during
      the day as well as variations of these oligosaccharide in different affected patients.
