  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of increased availability of healthy food
      and drink during working hours on reaction time and well-being in physicians and nursing
      staff.

      Hospital medical staff often works long and hectic hours, without adequate meal or rest
      breaks in order to provide 24-hour care. This is a concern, as not only the staff's
      well-being is important to the individual welfare, but it is also vital to the quality and
      safety of the care their patients receive. The investigators believe that by focusing on
      physicians and nursing staffs nutrition the investigators will see a positive effect on staff
      performance and well-being - and thus ultimately possibly on patient safety.

      Hypothesis: The provision of healthy lunch and snack meal during working hours for a period
      of 4 weeks will improve reaction time and well-being compared to habitual diet in physicians,
      nurses and nursing assistants.

      The study is designed as a randomised controlled 2 x 4 weeks cross-over trial, initiated with
      a 1-week run-in period. The study sample will consist of 60 volunteer physicians, nurses and
      nursing assistants from Herlev University Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. A healthy lunch
      and snack meal meeting the current danish diet recommendations will be delivered daily during
      all working days in the intervention period. During the control period, the participants are
      requested to maintain their habitual dietary intake at work. Reaction time will be assessed
      by reaction time test Go/No-Go, a subtest of Test-battery for Attention Performance. Changes
      in mood will be measured by the Profile of Mood State questionnaire. In addition, dietary
      intake, level of physical activity and palatability of the intervention diet will be
      registered.
