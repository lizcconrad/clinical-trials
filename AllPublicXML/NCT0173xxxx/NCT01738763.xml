  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the acute effects of increasing doses of pinitol on
      glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and to evaluate the absorption of pinitol after
      consumption of an oral nutritive pinitol-enriched beverage in healthy subjects.

    <measure>Dose-response curves to assess the change in glucose and insulin concentration after an oral ingestion of different doses of pinitol with respect to the corresponding placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject attended the Endocrinology Service in the morning after 12-hour overnight fasting. Blood sample was collected in vacutainer serum separator tubes at baseline (minute 0; while still fasting), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after consumption of the tested product placebo or pinitol-enriched beverage. Glucose concentrations were measured by means of enzymatic assay in an autoanalyzer. Insulin concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</description>

    <description>Plasma pinitol analysis blood samples were collected into vacutainers containing lithium heparin at baseline, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after consumption of the tested product placebo or pinitol-enriched beverage. Pinitol concentration was determined by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry</description>

    <description>Each subject completed two 1-day trials separated by a 1-week interval. The subjects were randomized by alternation method to belong to the group of low, intermediate or high dose, containing 2.5, 4.0 or 6.0 g of pinitol, respectively. Each subject was newly randomized (1:1) and cross-over into one of two groups: one that received the pinitol-enriched beverage, and the other a placebo beverage. In this way, each dose and its corresponding placebo were studied in 10 normoglycaemic subjects.</description>

    <description>Three doses of Fruit Up® (diluted with mineral water to a final volume of 330 ml) were evaluated, and were equivalent to an intake of 2.5, 4.0 and 6.0 g of pinitol. The placebo beverage contained equal amounts of non-polyol carbohydrates with similar macronutrient composition and energy intake as that those obtained through the pinitol beverage, but excluding pinitol.</description>
