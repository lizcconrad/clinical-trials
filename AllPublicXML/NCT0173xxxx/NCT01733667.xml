  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of MediENT to MeroPack
      after FESS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MediENT is designed to minimize lateralization of the middle turbinate, which can cause
      scarring and obstruction of key sinus openings after endoscopic sinus surgery.
