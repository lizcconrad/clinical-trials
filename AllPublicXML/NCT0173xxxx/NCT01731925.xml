      Sunitinib may provide an opportunity for a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
      subjects with neuroendocrine tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the exception of surgery for localized disease, there is presently a lack of available
      therapies with proven survival benefit for patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET).
      Available treatment options for unresectable disease include the use of somatostatin analogs,
      which may relieve symptoms related to hormonal hypersecretion. The efficacy of cytotoxic
      chemotherapy in patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors is also limited. Combinations of
      either streptozocin and cyclophosphamide, or streptozocin and 5-fluorouracil, appear to be
      inactive, and both regimens are associated with substantial toxicity.

      Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are implicated in deregulated/ autocrine proliferation and
      survival of solid and hematologic cancer cells. Sunitinib malate is an orally administered
      small molecule that inhibits the tyrosine kinase enzymatic activities of the receptors for
      VEGF and PDGF, and also blocks signalling through the KIT, FLT3 and RET pathways.

      Therefore, sunitinib malate may provide an opportunity for a novel therapeutic strategy for
      the treatment of subjects with NET.

             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
