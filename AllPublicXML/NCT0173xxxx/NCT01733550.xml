    <description>Patients eye pressure measurement with both devices.
Home ICare measurement by study nurse compared to Home ICare by patient compared to Goldmann ATO by study nurse (once for every patient)
4 times daily: measurement Goldmann ATO (by resident in ophthalmology) and home Icare (by patient)on same moment</description>

    <measure>Patient Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day hospitalisation</time_frame>
    <description>The comfort of the patients will be checked with both methods (home iCare and goldmann applanation tonometry) and look if the patient has a preference for one of them. Pain and discomfort were scaled from 0 to 5 (0 = none,1-2 = slight, 3-4 = moderate, 5 = severe) for both tonometers, and patients were asked which tonometer they preferred.</description>
