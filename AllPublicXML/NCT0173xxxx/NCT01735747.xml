  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, we will treat newly diagnosed PCNSL with temozolomide, nedaplatin, vincristine
      (TNV) as the replacement of high-dose methotrexate to combine with concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy. Our objective was to assess our treatment strategies' availability based
      on response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), median PFS, and toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The best reported outcomes of PCNSL treatment are high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy
      combined with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Despite aggressive therapy, however,
      nearly 50% of patients will relapse within 24 months of diagnosis. Furthermore, the
      application of high-dose methotrexate-based regimen is complex, needing be hydrated,
      alkalified and detoxified, and treatment-related toxicity mortality is severe[3,4]. In an
      attempt to improve upon these poor results and reduce treatment-related side effects, we will
      treat about 15-20 PCNSL patients with temozolomide concurrent chemoradiotherapy at the outset
      and then adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 cycles with temozolomide, nedaplatin, vincristine, as
      part of front-line therapy. Our objective is to assess our treatment strategies' availability
      based on response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), median PFS, and toxicity.

    <description>The newly diagnosed PCNSL patients will be given concurrent temozolomide (75mg/m2, orally) daily during WBRT. Then, the TNV regimen will be given after four weeks. TNV regimen consisted of temozolomide (200mg/m2 orally, days 1-5), nedaplatin (80mg/m2 i.v., day 1), vincristine (1.4mg/m2 i.v., day 1). Each cycle was 4 weeks and a maximum of six cycles were applied.</description>
