    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well bevacizumab with or without radiation therapy
      works in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing
      substances to them. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation
      directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is
      not yet know whether bevacizumab is more effective with or without radiation therapy in
      treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish an improvement in overall survival in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients
      receiving bevacizumab and re-irradiation compared with patients receiving bevacizumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate and compare the rate of objective response in patients with measurable
      disease.

      II. To estimate and compare the 6-month progression-free survival rate. III. To estimate and
      compare progression-free survival. IV. To estimate and compare the rate of treatment adverse
      events. V. To estimate and compare the rate of grade 3+ acute or delayed central nervous
      system (CNS) toxicity.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab as patients in arm I and undergo radiation therapy using
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy
      (3D-CRT), or proton beam radiation therapy (RT) 5 days a week for 2 weeks.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma or variants (gliosarcoma, giant
             cell glioblastoma etc); patients will be eligible if the original histology was
             lower-grade glioma and a subsequent diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made

          -  Patients who did not have recent surgery for their glioblastoma must have shown
             unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by contrast-enhanced magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan (or computed tomography [CT] scan for patients with
             non-compatible devices) CT scan within 21 days prior to registration.

             * Note: Patients who did have surgery with a post-operative contrast-enhance scan
             falling outside the 5 week window prior to registration, must have a repeat MRI scan
             (or CT scan for patients with non-compatible devices) within 21 days prior to
             registration.

          -  Patients also must have passed an interval of 6 months or greater between completion
             of prior radiotherapy and registration; if patients have not passed an interval of at
             least 6 months, they may still be eligible if they meet one or more of the following
             criteria:

               -  New areas of tumor outside the original radiotherapy fields as determined by the
                  investigator, or

               -  Histologic confirmation of tumor through biopsy or resection, or

               -  Nuclear medicine imaging, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, or MR perfusion
                  imaging consistent with true progressive disease, rather than radiation necrosis
                  obtained within 28 days of registration AND an interval of at least 90 days
                  between completion of radiotherapy and registration

          -  Patients unable to undergo MR imaging because of non-compatible devices can be
             enrolled provided CT scans are obtained and are of sufficient quality; patients
             without non-compatible devices may not use CT scans performed to meet this requirement

          -  Prior history of standard dose CNS radiation of 60 Gy in 30 fractions or 59.4 Gy in
             1.8 Gy fractions, or equivalent or lower doses

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with non-standard radiation therapy (RT)
             dose and fractionation, interstitial brachytherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, etc.
             are eligible

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy, and there must
             be a minimum time of 28 days prior to registration from the administration of any
             investigational agent or prior cytotoxic therapy with the following exceptions:

               -  14 days from administration of vincristine

               -  42 days from administration of nitrosoureas

               -  21 days from administration of procarbazine

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of their glioblastoma (within 5 weeks prior
             to registration) must have recovered from the effects of surgery; for CNS related core
             or needle biopsies, a minimum of 7 days must have elapsed prior to registration

          -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent glioblastoma is not mandated for
             eligibility into the study; to best assess the extent of residual disease
             post-operatively, a post-operative or intra-operative MRI scan (or CT scan for
             patients with non-compatible devices) must be performed prior to registration and
             should be within 96 hours post surgery (although 24 hours would be optimum)

          -  History/physical examination, including neurologic examination, within 14 days prior
             to registration

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 60 within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Complete blood count (CBC)/differential obtained within 14 days prior to registration,
             with adequate bone marrow function

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500 cells/mm^3

          -  Platelets &gt;= 75,000 cells/mm^3

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dl (Note: the use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve
             hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 9.0 g/dl is acceptable)

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =&lt;
             2.5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.8 mg/dL

          -  Urine protein creatinine (UPC) ratio &gt;= 1.0 within 14 days prior to registration OR
             urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt;= 2+ (patients discovered to have &gt;= 2+ proteinuria on
             dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24-hour urine collection and must
             demonstrate =&lt; 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible)

               -  Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24-hour urine protein
                  excretion; a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1
                  gm; UPC ratio is calculated using one of the following formulas:

                    -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine]: if both protein and creatinine are
                       reported in mg/dL

                    -  [(urine protein) x 0.088]/[urine creatinine]: if urine creatinine is
                       reported in mmol/L

          -  Patients must not be pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or breast feeding; pregnancy
             test must be done within 14 days prior to registration; effective contraception (men
             and women) must be used in patients of child-bearing potential while on trial and for
             6 months after

             heparin) must meet both of the following criteria:

               -  No active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding
                  (e.g., tumor involving major vessels or known varices)

               -  In-range international normalized ratio (INR) (usually between 2 and 3) on a
                  stable dose of oral anticoagulant or on a stable dose of low molecular weight
                  heparin, within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Patient must be able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within
                  the last 6 months prior to registration

               -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to
                  registration

               -  Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, history of aortic
                  dissection) or clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time

               -  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease
                  Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that human
                  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is not required for entry into this
                  protocol; the need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary
                  because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly
                  immunosuppressive; protocol specific requirements may also exclude
