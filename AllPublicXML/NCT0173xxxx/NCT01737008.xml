  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of the drug dacomitinib with radiotherapy, with or without
      chemotherapy, in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

      Dacomitinib is an oral drug, which is found to be active in SCCHN patients, blocks a receptor
      called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). By blocking signals for cancer cells to
      grow, it is believed to stop or slow the growth of tumor cells.

      The dose escalation phase will find the best dose as well as determine the safety of
      dacomitinib when given with radiotherapy and with or without chemotherapy.The dose expansion
      phase will further test the best dose determined in the dose escalation phase for response
      rate.

      This is a phase 1 study of the investigational drug, dacomitinib, with radiotherapy and with
      or without chemotherapy in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck (SCCHN).

      There are proteins found on the surface of cells called receptors that receive signals and
      send signals to the cell to grow or to die. Dacomitinib is an oral drug that blocks a
      receptor called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is found to be too active
      in SCCHN patients. By blocking the signals for the cancer cells to grow, it is believed to
      stop or slow the growth of tumor cells. The treatment of SCCHN usually includes chemotherapy
      and radiation.

      The primary objectives of this study will have two phases: a dose escalation phase and a dose
      expansion phase. The dose escalation phase will find the best dose as well as determine the
      safety of dacomitinib when given with radiotherapy and with or without chemotherapy.The dose
      expansion phase will further test the best dose determined in the dose escalation phase for
      safety and response rate.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of the combination
      therapies, and to provide preliminary survival data.
