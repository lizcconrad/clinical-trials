  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was the radiographic and clinical comparison of Algipore with
      decalcified freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) in the open maxillary sinus lift technique
      using piezoelectric instruments.

    <textblock>
      Vertical and horizontal bone resorption of the alveolar ridge are common in edentulous jaws.
      In the distal area of the maxilla, an adequate bone volume is often lacking because of the
      proximity of the sinus cavities to crestal bone. Sinus floor augmentation is an established
      way of increasing the height and volume of bone in the posterior region of the maxilla, which
      increase the stability of dental implants. For this purpose various materials, including auto
      grafts, allografts, alloplasts, and xenografts have been used.

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and 9 months radiographs were scanned with an Agfa scanner at 1200 dpi with a 12-bit grayscale and stored in JPEG format. Changes in bone height were calculated in each case. Two reference points, one at the lowest part of the ridge crest and the other at the highest part of sinus floor, were selected in two radiographs (baseline and after 9 months) and their distance was calculated in 0.1mm scale using computer.</description>

    <description>A crestal incision was made on the mucosa of the edentulous ridge. The flap was elevated carefully and extended labially to expose the bone. A vertical releasing incision was made in the mesial end of the flap as needed. The mucoperiosteal flap was extended to expose the alveolar ridge and the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. Then, a window was prepared using the piezoelectric device (Mectron, Italy); the Schneiderian membrane was then elevated conservatively according to the technique described by Vercellotti (2001).
The sinus membrane was meticulously detached and pushed superiorly to allow for the placement of bone graft material.</description>
