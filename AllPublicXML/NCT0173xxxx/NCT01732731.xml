  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine if early exposure to intensive, short-term
      locomotor treadmill training (LT) in young children with neuromotor impairment will help
      develop walking skills earlier, decrease the amount of outside assistance needed (such as a
      walker or crutches) as compared to children with neuromotor impairment who receive
      traditional physical therapy intervention.
