      The aims of this study were to

        1. investigate what measures were taken when common bile duct stones (CBDS) were found
           intraoperatively in Sweden during the period May 2005 to December 2009 by using data
           from this population-based nationwide registry, and

        2. analyze the outcome in terms of complications and success rates of bile duct clearance
           in relation to various stone sizes and interventions used. In order to further
           characterize the natural course of CBDS of various sizes, particular interest was
           focused on patients with positive findings where no peroperative measures to clear the
           bile ducts were taken or planned postoperatively.
