    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with
      low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able
      to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate, in terms of late toxicity, the safety of stereotactic radiation therapy using
      the proposed fractionation schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate, in terms of acute toxicity, the safety of stereotactic radiation therapy
      using the proposed fractionation schedule.

      II. To determine stereotactic treatment efficacy through biochemical failure (Phoenix
      criteria).

      III. To determine the protocol completion rate. IV. To describe patient-reported outcomes
      using International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and EPIC Urinary and Bowel Assessment
      questionnaires.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard daily fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) over 7-8.5 weeks.

    <description>International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite urinary Assessment (EPIC) urinary and bowel assessments will be used to collect patient-reported outcomes.
IIEF is a widely used instrument for the evaluation of male sexual function. It is has been recommended as tool for clinical trials of erectile dysfunction and for diagnostic evaluation of erectile dysfunction severity. 15 questions 1=very low (worst) to 5=very high (best).
The EPIC urinary and bowel assessments are comprehensive instruments designed to evaluate urinary and bowel symptoms, thereby providing a unique tool for assessment of quality of life issues important in prostate cancer management. 9 questions 0=no problem to 5=big problem</description>
