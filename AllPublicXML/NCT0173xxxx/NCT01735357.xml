  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether supplementation with oils enriched with
      long chain n-3 PUFA, either EPA or DHA, had a differential effect on platelet, endothelial
      and vascular function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relatively few studies have made a head-to-head comparison of DHA (22:6n-3) with EPA
      (20:5n-3). The understanding of this differential effect may be of great interest in
      populations with low EPA intake such as vegetarians, who may choose to supplement their
      dietary intake of long-chain n-3 PUFA in the form of DHA-rich algal oil.

      This study aimed to investigate the effect of supplementation with oils rich in either EPA or
      DHA (3g/day, 6 weeks) in healthy young males on platelet, endothelial and vascular function,
      as well as other CVD risk factors. The primary outcomes were platelet monocyte aggregates and
      endothelial progenitor cells - novel markers of platelet and endothelial function, measured
      by flow cytometry, Secondary outcomes included capillary density, measured by capillaroscopy
      to assess changes in microvascular function, pulse wave analysis, digital volume pulse and
      ambulatory blood pressure. Other secondary outcomes included lipid profiles (TAG,
      cholesterol, NEFA), glycaemic control (HOMA, QUICKI) and oxidative stress (isoprostane). The
      omega-3 index (erythrocyte EPA+DHA) was used as a marker of compliance.

    <measure>Platelet Monocyte Aggregates (PMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The endothelium plays a vital role in the regulation of blood flow, thrombosis and inflammation. Endothelium-derived anti-adhesive and anti-aggregant substances, including prostacyclin and nitric oxide, are known to inhibit platelet activation. Endothelial dysfunction or vessel wall injury lead to the activation of platelets, of which platelet-monocyte-aggregates (PMA) are a sensitive marker, and were shown to inversely correlate with markers of EF in patients with stable CHD. The measurement of PMA by flow cytometry is a method which reduces ex vivo platelet activation to its minimum and is believed to represent platelet activation in vivo.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endothelial Progenitor Cell (EPC) counts</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EPCs are a subgroup of circulating progenitor cells that are recruited from the bone marrow to repair the injured vasculature. They have been associated with a reduced CVD risk and may serve as markers of endothelial function because they represent a greater capacity for the endothelium to repair itself. Two populations of EPCs were measured by flow cytometry, described as 'early EPC' (KDR+/CD34+/CD133+) and 'late EPCs' (KDR+/CD34+/CD31+).</description>

    <measure>Capillary density</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Capillary rarefaction has been associated to CVD risk factors such as hypertension, smoking and obesity. The cutaneous circulation has emerged as an accessible and representative vascular bed to look at microvascular dysfunction. Capillary density was measured by a Capiscope (kk technologies)</description>

    <measure>Arterial stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse wave analysis (PWA) was used to measure indices of arterial stiffness, including peripheral and central augmentation index, as well as central systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Digital volume pulse (DVP) was used to measure reflection and stiffness indices.</description>
