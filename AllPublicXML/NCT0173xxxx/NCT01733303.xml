  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a prevalent health concern among older adults and is associated with an
      increased risk of falls that can cause fracture, injury or mortality. Identifying the factors
      related to falls occurring within this population is essential for the development of
      effective regimes for fall prevention. Studies have shown that muscle quality and good
      posture alignments are critical for balance control in older adults. People are diagnosed
      with osteoporosis often combining with muscles weakness, and increased spine kyphosis leading
      vertebral, fractures and poor balance control, even falls. Therefore, improving muscle
      quality, strengthening weak muscles and correcting postural alignment are essential elements
      for fracture and fall prevention in older adults with osteoporosis. The long-term objectives
      of this work are to prevent fracture and fall in older adults with osteoporosis by improving
      the function of degenerative muscles using exercise training.

    <description>Participants are allocated to the exercise group will commence the personalized core training exercise with EMG biofeedback based on their testing results in muscle quality. The program will run for 3 months with patients attending for one hour three times a week. The age-matched control group will maintain their usual daily life activities without any specific instruction. The exercise training will be run by an experienced physiotherapist, who will encourage patients individually to progress at their own pace.</description>
