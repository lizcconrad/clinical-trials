  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of sugar sweetened beverages on the
      fat metabolism of healthy young men. It is well known that consumption of beverages sweetened
      with fructose is associated with different health risks such as type 2 diabetes. The present
      study has been designed to dissect differences in the metabolic pathways of fructose and
      glucose, but also metabolic adaptations during fructose, glucose and sucrose diets. During a
      period of seven weeks subjects will consume either fructose, glucose or sucrose sweetened
      beverages or continue their usual drinking habits. During these seven weeks there will be
      different metabolic investigations using stable isotope tracers. First, the rate of lipolysis
      and beta-oxidation will be determined. Second, the rates of fatty acid synthesis will be
      measured. During all examinations there will also be substrate- and energy-utilization
      measurements by indirect calorimetry, blood analysis and morphometric measurements. Based on
      the literature main hypotheses are: Fructose enhances de novo lipogenesis postprandially and
      also in the fasting state significantly more than glucose by enhanced expression of lipogenic
      enzymes. Fructose decreases beta oxidation via downregulation of oxidative enzymes.

    <description>Measurement of lipogenesis is based on i. v. administration of stable isotope labelled acetate (1,2-13C-acetate). 13C incorporation into palmitate is quantified by mass-spectrometry. 13C incorporation correlates to the rate of fatty acid synthesis.</description>
