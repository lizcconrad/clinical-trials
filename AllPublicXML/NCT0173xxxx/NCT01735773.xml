  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to study the effect of prohepcidin levels on hematologic parameters
      and inflammatory markers in non-diabetic uremic patients. The investigators selected three
      groups of patients: Hemodialysis group, peritoneal dialysis group and the group with stage 4
      chronic kidney disease. A control group was formed from healthy volunteers also. Each group
      has been planned to be formed of about 25 patients. Diabetic patients were excluded.
      Prohepcidin, hsCRP, IL-6, fibrinogen have been planned to be studied besides other routine
      biochemical analysis including hematological ones.
