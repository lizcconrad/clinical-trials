    <textblock>
      The distal tibio-fibular joint ( DTFJ) be an integral part of the ankle and its injury makes
      all the gravity, forecast and complexity of ankle fracture treatment. It's classically
      described and known by radiological point of view, but in static incidence and from
      anatomical studies. To our knowledge the dynamic dimension and its modelling is missing. Our
      study will use high spatial-resolution MRI acquisition to obtain the best possible definition
      of DTFJ but especially it will be associated with MRI acquisition in movement, using typical
      fast sequences &quot; TrueFISP &quot; and &quot;FLASH&quot; which will allow a precise modelling of joint
      physiological movements and biomechanics on healthy subjects by a not invasive method. This
      analysis will be made on a simple movement of flexion and extension, the other possible
      movements of the ankle being blocked what corresponds to the clinical situation of an
      osteosynthesis ankle immobilized in post-operative by a dynamic rehabilitation shoe Axmed ®
      It will be associated an&quot;effort test &quot; with the reproduction of subjected joint of a load
      with MRI joint movement control This test will be made with an ankle fixed to 90 ° of flexion
      what reproduces the post-operative clinical situationThe meditative data will be associated
      with an anatomical biomechanical study of ankles presenting a syndesmosis injury repaired
      according to the classic protocol using in our department, by comparing them with the data of
      the literature to optimize techniques repair of this joint. Indeed there is not gold standard
      surgical technique Main PurposeTo understand, observe, analyze and quantify the joint
      movement during a simple movement of ankle extension and flexion, and during a simulation of
      axial load miming walk fixed to 90 ° as in post-operative. Secondary purpose - Modelling the
      DTFJ- Modify the post-operative care with hypothesis that load does not lead abnormal
      movement in DTFJ with an ankle fixed to 90 ° ( post-operative clinical condition). - Validate
      our technique of repair of this joint by comparing the data MRI with anatomical mechanical
      tests
