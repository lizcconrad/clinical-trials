  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and can be classified into several distinctive
      subgroups. Triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) is defined by lack of estrogen(ER),
      progesterone(PR) immunoreactivity and lack of human epidermal receptor-2(HER2)
      overexpression. TNBC comprises around 15% of all breast cancer and is characterized by its
      aggressive clinical behavior and insensitivity toward available targeted treatment strategies
      such as endocrine and anti-HER2 therapies.Although TNBC is sensitive to chemotherapy,early
      relapse with metastatic disease is common and the prognosis is poor. Development Of novel
      treatment strategies is,therefore,needed and the study of other potential targets in
      TNBC,like tyrosine kinase receptors,is a topic of interest.

      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that
      encoded by cell erythroblastosis virus oncogene B1(C-erbB1) and belongs to the
      HER/Erythroblastosis virus oncogene B(ErbB) family. By several signal pathways,EGFR regulates
      cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, invasion,and angiogenesis,and serves as a
      poor prognostic factor.EGFR is overexpressed in a variety of malignancies including TNBC.Gene
      expression profiling and immunohistochemical studies have indicated that 40 to 60% of TNBCs
      exhibit EGFR expression and gene amplification was found in 18% of this subgroup,but EGFR
      mutation was rare in TNBC.

      By far,the role of gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI),in the metastatic TNBC
      has not been identified. Most clinical trials about EGFR TKIs in the breast cancer have one
      or more limitations including:1) the study population had received heavily pretreatment;
      2)the enrolled patients included several subgroups of breast cancer; 3)the expression of EGFR
      was not clear in the enrolled patients.

      Here, the investigators launch a prospective clinical trial, and about 50 patients with
      triple-negative,EGFR positive metastatic breast cancer that have received at least second
      line therapy will be enrolled. these patients will be treated with gefitinib, the toxicity
      and effects of gefitinib will be recorded prospectively to evaluate the role of gefitinib in
      the metastatic TNBC.
