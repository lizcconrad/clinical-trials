  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim in this study was to quantify the difference in cisatracurium and sufentanil
      consumption, and its recovery period, when patients are under balanced general anesthesia
      with 1% sevoflurane and patients under only sevoflurane general anesthesia, using a closed
      loop computer control infusion. Investigators further investigated this effect on its
      recovery period and sufentanyl consumption.

    <textblock>
      156 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II were
      assigned to three groups. The patients were all on schedule for elective general surgery
      under general anesthesia with duration of at two to four hours. All patients were induced
      with Etomidate (0.2mg/kg), Midazolam (0.05-0.1mg/kg), Sufentanil (0.3-0.5µg/kg) and a bolus
      dose of Cisatracurium (0.15mg/kg). Patients were aged between 20 and 65. The maintenance of
      anesthesia in each group varies as follows: Patients in Group 1 were all maintained with
      Total Intravenous Anesthesia, Group 2 with Sevoflurane at 1% and propofol infusion, Group 3
      with only sevoflurane. Muscle paralysis is maintained using a closed-loop computer gated
      infusion of Cisatracurium which kept T1 &lt;1% by giving increasing the infusion rate
      intra-operatively when required. Analgesia was maintained by intermittent bolus dose of 10-20
      µg of Sufentanil.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cisatracurium consumption rate.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements were done intraoperatively. Investigators obtained data from the closed loop computer system, from which the intra-operative consumption of cisatracurium were obtained from each patient. Data were collected only during surgery. Each patient had different cisatracurium consumption rate, and the mean consumption rate of the patients within the same group were calculated, and compared with the means from the other groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of Means of Recovery Index.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post operative.</time_frame>
    <description>Recovery Index was the time for the Train-Of-Four ratio (TOF) to increase from 25% to 75%. The TOF ratio was recorded every minute till it reached 90%. Time taken for each patient was from 5 to 25 minutes. Investigators compared the average recovery index of patients from each group.</description>

    <measure>Sufentanil Consumption.</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements were done intraoperatively, from which the intra-operative consumption of sufentanil were obtained from each patient. Data were collected only during surgery. Investigators compared the average sufentanil consumption between between groups.</description>
