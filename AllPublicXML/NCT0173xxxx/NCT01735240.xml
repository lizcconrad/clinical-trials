  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to compare the change of the AZD5069 Pharmacokinetic profile
      when administered with ketoconazole. Subjects will be treated first with AZD5069 only
      followed by a washout period before starting with the combined treatment (both ketoconazole
      and AZD5069).
