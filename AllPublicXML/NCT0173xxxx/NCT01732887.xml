  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we are testing computer-based brain fitness exercises. The games are designed
      to improve people's cognitive abilities brain functions, like memory, concentration, and
      ability to do two things at once. We are testing whether this cognitive training brain
      exercises will improve understanding of spoken sentences speech comprehension in people who
      use cochlear implant and/or hearing aids. We predict that cognitive training will improve
      speech comprehension in cochlear implant and/or hearing aid users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aural rehabilitation is a life long process in spite of advanced innovative implant
      technology. Existing standard therapy is inadequate for some people, because even after years
      of surgery many implant users does not obtain significant benefits, like improved
      understanding of spoken sentences. In many cases it seems that the speech comprehension
      deficits are linked to particular cognitive functions in cochlear implant users, including
      memory and attention. In this study we will test whether a computer-based set of &quot;cognitive
      fitness&quot; or &quot;brain training&quot; games designed to improve memory and attention will help
      cochlear implant and hearing aid users to understand speech better.

      Cochlear implant and hearing aid users will complete 10 weeks of computer-based cognitive
      training on their home computers. Half of participants will do this training immediately
      after being enrolled in the study; the other half will receive the training beginning 10
      weeks after they are enrolled. Speech comprehension and cognitive abilities will be assessed
      at baseline, 10, 20 and 30 weeks in all participants.

    <description>It is a method of assessing the brain-functions of a person using computerized non-linguistic tests by touch screen technology making it rapid and safe. It has been widely used globally to assess brain-functions in more than 100 disorders. More than 700 articles have been published using CANTABeclipse by over 500 academic institutions or industry researchers in 60 different countries. Tasks are performed by touch screen technology. It assesses brain-functions such as planning, problem solving, working memory etc.</description>

    <description>After the initial baseline evaluation, the immediate treatment group participants will receive individualized multi-domain cognitive training and standard of care. Cognitive training includes at least 1/2 hour per session, 3 days per week, throughout the 10 week interval. After 10 weeks of cognitive fitness training, participants in this group will switch to a 20 week &quot;no intervention&quot; period where they receive only standard of care treatment.</description>

Starting in week 11, participants in this arm will receive individualized multi-domain cognitive training and standard of care. Cognitive training includes at least 1/2 hour per session, 3 days per week, throughout the 10 week interval. After 10 weeks of cognitive fitness training, participants will go for another 10 weeks with only standard of care treatment.</description>
