    <textblock>
      The Methodist Hospital Neurological Institute is conducting a clinical trial for patients
      suffering from Metastatic brain tumors. The objective for this study is to evaluate the
      safety and feasibility of a MRI-guided laser thermal therapy during a real-time MRI guidance
      for the treatment of brain metastasis.

      Patient will undergo laser therapy using the MRI scan to plan the treatment and ensure proper
      placement of the laser within the tumor. The tumor will then be heated by the laser and
      monitored by study physicians through the real-time MRI to see and control temperatures in
      the tissue. One in place, the thermal laser will then surgically remove the lesions. After
      the procedure, post treatment MR images will thenbe acquired for the determination of the
      effective treatment region.

      This is a study for evaluating the feasibility and safety of MR-guided laser thermal ablation
      of treatment-resistant brain tumors using the Visualase® Thermal Therapy System (Manufactured
      by BioTex, Inc., Houston, TX). The Visualase system is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation
      in a number of surgical specialties including Neurosurgery (see appendix for documentation).
      Patients with intracranial brain tumors measuring 3 cm or smaller in largest diameter that
      have failed any conventional therapy (surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain
      radiotherapy) are eligible.

      The target tissue containing the tumor will undergo MRI-guided laser induced thermal therapy.
      MR imaging is used to define the treatment volume as well as plan and verify placement of the
      applicator. The extent of ablation is quantitatively monitored and displayed during delivery
      using real-time, MR temperature imaging. MR temperature imaging will also be used to monitor
      and control the temperature of adjacent tissues. Treatment will be automatically stopped if
      the MR temperature feedback system reports the temperature in the adjacent tissue has risen
      above a preset threshold. Treatment can be manually stopped by the neurosurgeon monitoring
      the treatment in real-time at any point during the procedure by simply turning off the power
      to the laser from the Visualase® system console. After laser delivery, MR images can be used
      to verify the extent of treatment and plan a therapy delivery if necessary.
