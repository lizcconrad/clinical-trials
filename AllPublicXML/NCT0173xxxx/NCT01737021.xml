      1. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an information based intervention
           delivered to parents following their child's admission to paediatric intensive care;

        2. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the study design and procedures;

        3. Explore the effects of the intervention on parent and child psychological outcomes 3-6
           months post discharge from PICU;

        4. Explore the effects of parental stress experienced during PICU admission on the
           effectiveness of the intervention;

        5. To provide data that, combined with results from other studies, could inform the sample
           size for a future multi-site RCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most children are now expected to make a complete medical recovery following admission to
      PICU. However, research suggests that some children will go on to develop psychological
      difficulties, such as problems with emotions, behaviour, and learning. In addition, parents
      themselves may suffer with emotional difficulties. Although the follow-up of survivors is
      recommended, there are currently no specific guidelines in place. Intervention in the early
      stages of recovery could help families pull through without long lasting after-effects.

    <description>Feasibility success criteria have been defined a priori for the intervention and study design. There are six feasibility criteria related to the intervention, covering aspects of the timing of the intervention, compliance, and evaluation. There are also six feasibility criteria related to the study design, covering recruitment rate; participation rate; acceptability of procedures; attrition rate; and the time-scale of data collection.
Dependent on the number of criteria successfully met, the following classification will be used:
0-2/6 criteria met - Stop; intervention and/or study design not feasible.
3-4/6 criteria met - Continue with modifications; feasible intervention and/or study design with modifications.
5/6 criteria met - Continue without modifications, but monitor closely; feasible intervention and/or study design with close monitoring.
6/6 criteria met - Continue without modifications; feasible intervention and/or study design as is.</description>
