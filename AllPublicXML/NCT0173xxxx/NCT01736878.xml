  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of his study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sorafenib versus placebo
      in subjects with locally advanced medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The primary study objective
      is to compare the Progression-free Survival (PFS) of the Sorafenib treatment group with the
      placebo treatment group in patients with advanced MTC.
