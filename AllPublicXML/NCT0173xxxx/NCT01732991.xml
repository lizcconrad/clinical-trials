  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PVP by Greenlight laser 180W is becoming a potential therapeutic alternative in the
      treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) as recommended.

      The PVP creates a prostatic box after the vaporization of the prostatic tissue of BPH. The
      underlying prostatic tissue is the site of an ischemic necrosis secondary to the thermal
      effects of proximity of the PVP. We intend to measure by prostatic MRI and contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound the necrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The laser PVP with an optical fiber firing side carries out a vaporization of next prostatic
      tissue and a necrosis of underlying prostatic tissue which corresponds to a postoperative
      inflammatory area.

      One of the side effects of this technique is the irritative syndrome which may involve
      urinary frequency, urgency or burning urination in approximately 10 to 20% at 1 month.

      The current literature does report neither the analysis of the underlying inflammatory
      necrotic area in prostatic vaporized tissue, nor the analysis of the urinary irritative signs
      post-laser PVP.

      Progresses in the field of functional ultrasound imaging allow us to consider a study of
      evolution of the underlying necrotic area devoid of micro-vascularisation under effect of PVP
      laser. The parallel with results of MRI (radiological technique most referenced) during the
      same period would help to support the experimental results of prostatic contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound.
