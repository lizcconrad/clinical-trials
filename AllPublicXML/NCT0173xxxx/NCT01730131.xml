      Background:

      - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a severe viral infection of the brain.
      It is caused by JC virus. Many people have this virus in their bodies all their life, but it
      is usually kept in check by their immune system. If the immune system does not work right
      because of a disease or medication, the virus becomes active and can damage cells in the
      brain. Not much is known about PML or how it affects the immune system. Researchers want to
      study people with PML to better understand the natural history of the disease.

      Objectives:

      - To study the natural history of PML.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 2 years of age who have PML.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and imaging
           studies.

        -  Participants will have several visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical
           Center. There will be an initial visit, monthly visits for the next 6 months, a 12-month
           visit, and possible visits afterward.

        -  At the initial visit, participants will give blood, urine, and spinal fluid samples.
           They will also have neurological tests and imaging studies of the brain.

        -  For the next five visits, participants will give blood and urine samples. They will also
           have neurological tests and imaging studies of the brain.

        -  The 6-month and 12-month visits will repeat the tests from the initial visit.

        -  Other optional procedures include bone marrow samples and skin biopsies. Additional
           blood tests and imaging studies may be performed.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      The objective of this study is to examine the natural course of progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a devastating, demyelinating neurological disease affecting
      the brain of patients with a compromised immune system. It is caused by reactivation of JC
      virus (JCV), a small DNA virus that infects the majority of the population without clinical
      significance. There are currently no treatments available for PML.

      We plan to study patients with suspected or confirmed PML with different underlying
      conditions including patients on immune-modulatory therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS),
      rheumatologic diseases or other autoimmune diseases, as well as patients with HIV infection
      or other conditions leading to a compromised immune system. Patients will be seen at defined
      time points during their disease course and detailed assessments will be performed to collect
      clinical and imaging data. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will also be collected at
      these time points to evaluate the behavior and biology of the JCV and the patients immune
      responses to the infection. These tests will lead to a better understanding of the
      pathophysiology of PML and the course of this disease in different patient groups.

      Specifically, this detailed characterization will be used to help identify:

        1. Clinical and/or imaging features pathognomonic of PML that may aid in earlier diagnosis
           and intervention

        2. Clinical imaging and/or laboratory features of the disease course that is predictive of
           clinical outcomes

      This information will be integrated to develop a clinically relevant, disease-specific
      assessment scale of PML, which is currently not available. Such a scale would be a useful
      tool for the clinical management of patients (i.e., for development of standards of care), as
      well as for clinical trial design and interpretation.

      The long-term objectives of this study are to improve the understanding of the disease course
      and underlying pathophysiology, to identify subgroups with different prognosis and/or
      susceptibility to interventions, and to help identify therapeutic targets and/or intervention
      strategies. Equally important, these efforts will allow development of a repository of
      cryopreserved biological samples that will be used for validation of candidate biomarkers in
      future studies; this data and biological bank will be made available to outside laboratories.
