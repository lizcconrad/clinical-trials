      This is an open label study of everolimus in children with recurrent or progressive low-grade
      glioma. All patients will receive everolimus at a dose of 5 mg/m2/dose daily. An adaptive
      Simon two-stage design for phase 2 studies of targeted therapies will be used to assess the
      efficacy primary objective. The proposed treatment with everolimus will be deemed not worthy
      of further investigation in this patient population if the true PFS at 6-months (PFS6) is
      less than 50%. If in the first stage, with a combined sample size of 25, there is preliminary
      evidence to suggest efficacy of everolimus is restricted to patients with PI3K/AKT/mTOR
      activation as measured by p-S6 positivity, a total of 45 patients will be enrolled and the
      design will have 81% statistical power to detect a true disease stabilization rate ≥70%. If
      in the first stage there is preliminary evidence to suggest efficacy of everolimus is
      independent of PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, a total of 65 patients will be enrolled and the
      design will have &gt;95% statistical power to detect a true disease stabilization rate ≥70%.

                  accurately measured in at least two dimensions on MRI.

               -  Patients may have had treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) for any number
                  of relapses prior to this recurrence.

               -  Patients must have received their last dose of myelosuppressive anticancer
                  chemotherapy at least three (3) weeks prior to study registration or at least six

                  biological agent &gt; 7 days prior to study entry.

        For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration,
        this period should be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to
        occur. This should be discussed with the study chair.

          -  If patients received prior monoclonal antibody treatment, at least three half-lives
             must be elapsed by the time of treatment initiation. These patients should also be

             primary tumor or other sites &gt;12 weeks (3 months) prior to registration.

             --Age ≥3 and ≤21 years.

          -  Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of
             everolimus in patients &lt;3 years of age, these young children are excluded from this
             study.

               -  Life expectancy of greater than 8 weeks.

               -  Patients must be able to swallow pills.

                  of ≥ 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dL) before starting therapy. Eligibility
                  level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.

               -  INR ≤1.5. (Anticoagulation is allowed if target INR ≤ 1.5 on a stable dose of
                  warfarin or on a stable dose of LMW heparin for &gt;2 weeks at time of
                  randomization).

               -  Patients must have adequate liver function (SGPT/ALT ≤ 2.5 times ULN and

               -  Patients must have adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times
                  institutional ULN for age or GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73 m2) before starting therapy.

               -  Patients must have cholesterol level &lt;350 mg/dL and triglycerides &lt; 400 mg/dL
                  before starting therapy. In case one or both of these are exceeded, the patient
                  can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication
                  and documentation of cholesterol &lt; 350mg/dL and triglycerides &lt; 400mg/dl before
                  start of therapy.

               -  Patients must have normal pulmonary function testing for age based on pulse
                  oximetry.

               -  The effects of everolimus on the developing human fetus at the recommended
                  therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because everolimus are known to
                  be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
                  adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
                  prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
                  should inform her treating physician immediately.

               -  Female patients of child bearing potential must not be breastfeeding or pregnant
                  as evidenced by a negative pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving concomitant medication that may interfere with study outcome. For
             example, patients cannot be on enzyme inducing anticonvulsants like phenytoin.

          -  Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week
             of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received
             attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,
             BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines

          -  Hepatitis B/C blood test must be done at screening for all patients. Patients who test
             positive for Hepatitis C antibodies and the Hepatitis B antigen are ineligible.

          -  A known history of HIV seropositivity. HIV-positive patients on combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
             interactions with everolimus. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another
             immunosuppressive agent. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.

          -  Patients may not have therapy for this recurrence (including radiation).

          -  Patients who do not have measurable disease on MRI.

          -  Patients who have been previously treated with an mTOR inhibitor.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycins (e.g.
             sirolimus, temsirolimus).

          -  Patients receiving any other concurrent anticancer or investigational therapy.

          -  Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness that would
             compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of everolimus (e.g., ulcerative disease,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel
             resection.

          -  Patients with inability to return for follow-up visits to assess toxicity to therapy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy
             for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.

        Note: A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done
        at screening for all patients. HBV DNA and HCV RNA PCR testing are required at screening
        for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors and/or confirmation
        of prior HBV/HCV infection.
