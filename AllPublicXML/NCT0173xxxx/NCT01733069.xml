  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to establish the performance characteristics of the AC2
      (APTIMA Combo 2) Assay on the PANTHER System for the sample types cleared for use on the
      TIGRIS and DTS (Direct Tube Sampling) Systems and to demonstrate the repeatability and
      reproducibility of the AC2 Assay on the PANTHER System.

      The results of this protocol AC2PS-US11-001 (NCT01733069) are based on samples collected from
      protocol ACTPS-US10-001(NCT01358799).

      The registration for NCT01358799 was withdrawn because the samples were not tested under
      protocol ACTPS-US10-001, instead they were tested under the protocol registered here
      AC2PS-US11-001 (NCT01733069).

      4 specimens will be collected from each female subject in the following order: 1 first-catch
      urine specimen, 1 vaginal swab specimen (patient or clinician-collected), 1 cervical specimen
      (using a broomlike collection device or a brush/spatula combination), and 1 endocervical swab
      specimen. An additional cervical specimen may be collected from female subjects for other
      clinical trial purposes or research studies. Up to 2 specimens will be collected from each
      male subject in the following order: 1 urethral swab specimen and 1 first-catch urine
      specimen

        Inclusion Criteria:

        •The subject is at least 14 years of age at the time of informed consent and is sexually
        active

          -  The subject reports symptoms consistent with a suspected STD (sexually transmitted
             disease) such as abnormal discharge, genital itching, pain/discomfort during sexual
             intercourse or urination, and/or lower abdominal discomfort.

          -  If the subject is asymptomatic, the subject is known to be partners with, or a contact
             of, a person with a confirmed or suspected STD(s), is undergoing screening evaluation
             for a possible STD(s), and/or is scheduled for a routine exam that may include a
             pelvic exam

          -  The subject and/or legally authorized representative is willing to undergo the
             informed consent process prior to study participation (a minor will need the
             documented consent of his/her parent or legal guardian, unless the site has an IRB
             (institutional review board) approved waiver for parental consent for minors)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        •A potential subject will be ineligible for clinical trial enrollment if the subject,
        clinician, or medical record reports any of the following:

          -  The subject took antibiotic medications within the last 21 days

          -  The subject is underage (as defined by the IRB (institutional review board) or state
             law), without the documented consent of her/his parent or legal guardian (exception:
             sites that have an IRBapproved waiver for parental consent for minors)

          -  The subject is determined by the investigator to be medically unsuitable for
             participation in this study (eg, medical history of concurrent illness that could
             result in an unacceptable risk to the subject) Concurrent participation in other
             clinical study(ies) may be acceptable, with approval by the investigator and sponsor.
