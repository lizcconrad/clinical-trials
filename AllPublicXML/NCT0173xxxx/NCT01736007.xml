  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia Areata (AA) is a skin restricted autoimmune disease of the hair follicle, resulting
      in hair loss of the scalp, and in severe cases of the entire body. AA is the second most
      common cause of alopecia in childhood; no FDA-approved treatments exist. The use of focused
      narrow-band ultraviolet-B light via the excimer laser is a common treatment for many skin
      diseases in patients of all ages. In this study, the feasibility of the 308-nm excimer laser
      for treatment of patch type AA of the scalp will be examined. We anticipate the excimer laser
      will be safe and a feasible option for patients with patch type AA. The excimer laser may
      represent a novel treatment for childhood AA and no comparison or large studies currently
      exist in the literature.

      Hypotheses The 308-nm excimer laser procedure is a feasible, well-tolerated and safe
      treatment for patch type alopecia areata of the scalp in children.

      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety and response to treatment of the
      use of the 308-nm excimer laser in children (age 6-17 years) diagnosed with patch type
      alopecia areata involving the scalp, present for more than 6 months duration. Patients
      meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly enrolled in a treatment group or placebo
      group. Response to treatment during and after the 12-week laser treatment course will be
      measured in terms of hair regrowth utilizing the SALT score and 2 blinded evaluations of
      subject photographs.

      Specific Aims Evaluate the feasibility and safety of twice-weekly excimer laser treatments
      over a period of 12 weeks. Measures will include side effects, response to treatment (hair
      growth), tolerability of therapy, attrition, attendance, and overall satisfaction with this
      treatment modality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children 6-17 years old, diagnosed with patch type alopecia areata for a minimum of 6
             months prior to enrollment involving the scalp.
