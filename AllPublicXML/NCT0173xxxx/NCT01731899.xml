    <textblock>
      Depression and unrefreshed sleep are frequent in patients with fibromyalgia. Agomelatine is a
      new antidepressant with sleep-promoting properties. The objective of this study include the
      assessment of agomelatine therapy in patients with depression and fibromyalgia both on the
      severity of depressive symptomatology and sleep quality.

    <textblock>
      One of the most frequent comorbidities of fibromyalgia is major depression. Agomelatine is a
      new antidepressant whose mechanims of action include both agonism at melatonin receptores and
      5-HT2C blocking properties which, in addition to antidepressant efficacy, has shown
      sleep-improving properties. As unrefreshed sleep is a common symptom in fibromyalgia we
      hypothetized that agomelatine treatment of patients with concomitant depression and
      fibromyalgia could improve both depressive symtomatology and sleep quality. Thus, the
      objectives of the present study are the following:

        -  to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of agomelatine on the severity of
           depressive symptomatology in patients with fibromyalgia and concomitatnt depresssion

        -  to evaluate the effect of agomelatine treatment on sleep quality in these patients
