    <measure>Ocular Comfort Measured as Mean Change From Baseline in OSDI Score by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) is a 12-question validated questionnaire used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision. The OSDI scoring scale ranges from 0 to 100. The lower the score, the more symptomatic relief from dry eye symptoms a patient experiences. Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a negative number change from baseline indicates a perceived improvement in ocular comfort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) was determined using an ETDRS or modified EDTRS chart and measured in logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). Baseline-adjusted logMAR values were tabulated; a negative number change from baseline indicates better visual acuity. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Normal Slit-lamp Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>An undilated slit lamp exam was performed to examine the regions of the eye: orbit/lids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris and lens. Each region was graded normal or abnormal. The percentage of eyes with normal assessments by region is reported. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes were included in the tabulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meibomian Gland Expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Meibomian gland expression (ie, pressing on the meibomian glands to excrete oil) was performed by the investigator during undilated slit lamp examination and graded on a 4-point scale where 0=normal, clear oil expressed and 3=congealed or no material expressed. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Non-invasive Keratographic Tear Break up Time (NIKBUT) by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>NIKBUT (time required for dry spots to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking) was measured in seconds using the Oculus keratograph 5M. Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a positive number change from baseline indicates improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Tear Meniscus Height (TMH) by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>TMH (the distance between the line of reflection along the top of the tear prism to the edge of the eyelid) was measured in millimeters using the Oculus keratograph 5M. Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a positive number change from baseline indicates improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Ocular Surface Staining by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular surface staining (damage to the ocular surface) was assessed using non-toxic ophthalmic dye during slit-lamp review. Corneal and conjunctival staining were graded as per the National Eye Institute (NEI) pictorial scale. The ocular staining score ranges from 0 to 3. The lower the score, the less signs of dry eye disease a patient exhibits. Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a negative number change from baseline indicates an improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Tear Inflammatory Cytokine Expression at Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>A tear sample was collected and cytokine (small proteins) levels were analyzed using a High Sensitive Human Cytokine MilliPlex kit and measured in picograms/milliliter (pg/mL). Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a negative number change from baseline indicates improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline for % HLA-DR Inflammatory Biomarker Expression at Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival samples were collected by Impression Cytology (IC) and analyzed in a lab. The number of cells expressing the inflammatory marker HLA-DR (as a percentage of total cells) was calculated. Baseline-adjusted scores were calculated as HLA-DR score at Day 30 minus HLA-DR score at baseline. A negative baseline-adjusted value indicates an improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes were included in the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline mRNA for % HLA-DR and TNF-alpha Gene Expression at Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival samples were collected by Impression Cytology (IC) and analyzed in a lab. Total RNA was isolated. The number of cells expressing the inflammatory marker (as a percentage of total cells) was calculated. Baseline-adjusted scores were calculated as score at Day 30 minus score at baseline. A negative baseline-adjusted value indicates an improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes were included in the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Dry Eye Status as Measured by the Schirmer's Test by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Dry eye status was assessed using the Schirmer's test. The investigator placed a paper strip on the eye under the lower lid for a specified time period. The length of the strip wetted by the tears was measured in millimeters. Baseline-adjusted values were tabulated; a positive number change from baseline indicates an improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). Baseline-adjusted values were tabulated. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>

        <title>Ocular Comfort Measured as Mean Change From Baseline in OSDI Score by Visit</title>
        <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) is a 12-question validated questionnaire used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision. The OSDI scoring scale ranges from 0 to 100. The lower the score, the more symptomatic relief from dry eye symptoms a patient experiences. Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a negative number change from baseline indicates a perceived improvement in ocular comfort.</description>

          <title>Ocular Comfort Measured as Mean Change From Baseline in OSDI Score by Visit</title>
          <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) is a 12-question validated questionnaire used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision. The OSDI scoring scale ranges from 0 to 100. The lower the score, the more symptomatic relief from dry eye symptoms a patient experiences. Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a negative number change from baseline indicates a perceived improvement in ocular comfort.</description>
          <population>This analysis population includes all subjects who were randomized and attended at least one post-baseline study visit. Here, &quot;n&quot; is the number of subjects with non-missing values at the specific time point for each arm group, respectively.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline for % HLA-DR Inflammatory Biomarker Expression at Day 30</title>
        <description>Conjunctival samples were collected by Impression Cytology (IC) and analyzed in a lab. The number of cells expressing the inflammatory marker HLA-DR (as a percentage of total cells) was calculated. Baseline-adjusted scores were calculated as HLA-DR score at Day 30 minus HLA-DR score at baseline. A negative baseline-adjusted value indicates an improvement. Each eye was assessed individually. Both eyes were included in the mean.</description>
