  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to describe the metabolism of AT1001 (migalastat HCl) and the
      contribution of metabolism and urinary excretion to its overall elimination as part of the
      continuing assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the drug.

      This is a Phase 1, single-site, open-label, single dose study of the absorption, metabolism
      and excretion of radiolabeled AT1001 in healthy male subjects between 30 and 55 years of age,
      inclusive. Six subjects will be dosed, with the goal of having at least 4 subjects complete
      the study through follow-up. All subjects will be screened within 28 days before admission to
      the Clinical Unit. Subjects will be confined to the clinical unit for 10 days after dosing
      and will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit 28 days after dosing.

      Each subject will receive a single oral dose of AT1001 as an aqueous solution containing 150
      mg [14C] AT1001 (1 μCi). Blood, duodenal bile, expired air, urine, and feces samples will be
      collected at specified time points after dosing throughout the period of confinement at the
      study site. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring clinical laboratory
      tests, ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, and adverse events. The total duration of
      the study for each subject is approximately 8 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery of total radioactivity in urine</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 to 11</time_frame>
    <description>Urine will be collected: pre-dose (-12-0 hours), 0-12 and 12-24 hours on Day 1, 24-hourly on Days 2-10; the last sample will be collected on Day 11. Total radioactivity excreted in urine will be calculated for the entire collection period. The excretion rate will be calculated from total radioactivity collected in urine, divided by the duration of collection. The percentage of dose excreted in urine will be calculated from the total amount excreted in urine divided by the dose administered, multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Recovery of total radioactivity in feces</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 to 11</time_frame>
    <description>Feces will be collected: predose (-24 to 0 hours); all bowel movements post-dose will be collected on Days 1 to 10; the last sample will be collected on Day 11. Total radioactivity excreted in feces will be calculated for the entire collection period. The excretion rate will be calculated from total radioactivity collected in feces, divided by the duration of collection. The percentage of dose excreted in feces will be calculated from the total amount excreted in feces divided by the dose administered, multiplied by 100.</description>

    <description>150 mg of [14C] labelled AT1001 will be administered as a solution (prepared by weighing 150 mg of AT1001 powder and dissolving in 100 mL of water). The entire solution will be swallowed orally. After ingestion of study medication, the dosing bottle will be rinsed with 50 mL of water and this will be ingested by the subject. This rinse procedure should be performed twice. Following the second rinse ingestion, the subjects should be instructed to drink additional water to bring the total volume ingested to 240 mL.</description>
