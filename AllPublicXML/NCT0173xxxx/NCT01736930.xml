  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an overnight system that will turn off the insulin
      pump automatically if the system predicts that a low blood sugar is likely. The study system
      includes a combination continuous glucose monitor (CGM)/ insulin pump made by Medtronic
      MiniMed, Inc and a regular laptop computer that runs a computer program that predicts low
      blood sugar. It works by (1) measuring the glucose levels under the skin with a continuous
      glucose monitor, (2) using a computer program on a laptop to predict what will happen to the
      glucose level over the next 35-55 minutes, and (3) turning off the insulin pump when the
      computer program predicts that low blood sugar will occur. We have tested this system
      overnight in the hospital and are ready to test the system in the home environment to learn
      more about how well it will work and to make sure that the blood sugar does not go too high
      when the pump shuts off.

      This study has several phases and will take about a month or a little more for a patient to
      complete. Patients will use the study system for about 5 days at home to show that the
      patient is able to use it correctly. After that, the patient will be asked to use the study
      system each night for an additional 3-4 weeks. During this time, the system will be active
      for two-thirds of the nights and not active for one-third of the nights. When the system is
      active and predicts that your blood sugar will become low, the insulin pump will shut off for
      up to 2 hours.

      The study will include 2 clinical centers in the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will use the study system overnight at home for
      about 5 nights to demonstrate their ability to use the system and submit study data to the
      Coordinating Center.

      Patients who successfully demonstrate their ability to use the system as described above will
      be eligible for the randomized trial phase. This phase consists of use of the full system as
      an outpatient for approximately 21 nights:

        -  Each night the blood glucose level will be checked with the study blood glucose (BG)
           meter and used to perform a calibration of the CGM. The calibration must occur no more
           than 90 minutes prior to activation of the system. NOTE: Patients will be instructed to
           calibrate the CGM per manufacturer guidelines.

        -  Then the system will be activated, linking the CGM and insulin pump to the computer at
           the bedside.

        -  A randomization schedule on the laptop will be used to determine whether the 'pump shut
           off' application will be active that night or not.

        -  Patients will be blinded as to whether the pump shut off is active when a session is
           initiated each night.

        -  There will not be an alarm if the pump shuts off. The CGM alarm will be set to 60 mg/dL.
           When a CGM alarm occurs, the patient will be asked to measure the blood glucose with a
           BG meter, if he/she is aware of the alarm.

        -  The time period for outcome assessment each night will be from the time the system is
           activated until it is turned off in the morning.

        -  Pump shut off, when it occurs, will be for up to 2 hours. Multiple instances of pump
           suspension can occur if there are recurrent predictions of hypoglycemia during the
           night.

        -  Patients will be asked to check blood glucose with the study BG meter, blood ketones
           with the study ketone meter, and urine ketones with a ketone strip each morning prior to
           breakfast and enter the results on the study laptop. The patient will be instructed to
           contact the study physician if the blood glucose or ketone readings are out of an
           expected range. Patients will be contacted if these morning safety values are not
           reported as required or are out of range.

        -  Patients will be asked to record all overnight carbohydrate intake on the study laptop.

        -  Patients will be asked to perform periodic data uploads using the study laptop.
           Monitoring processes will ensure that the patient is contacted if these uploads do not
           occur as required, or if review of an upload reveals any extreme, prolonged episodes of
           low or high blood glucose readings, or elevated morning blood glucose, blood ketone, or
           urine ketone values.

      Upon completion of the study, patients as well as study clinicians will be asked to complete
      a questionnaire regarding use of the study system.

      There will a follow-up visit after completion of 21 successful nights of study system use. A
      successful night of study system use is defined as use of the system for at least four hours.
      Phone contacts with the patients will be made once a week.

    <measure>Mean Morning Blood Glucose (mg/dL)- Algorithm 1</measure>
    <time_frame>21 study nights</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety outcome will be evaluated by comparing the intervention and control nights and nights with vs. without actual shut-off of the pump for several measures of hyperglycemia such as mean morning blood glucose (mg/dL).
An objective was to evaluate and refine the control algorithm. The data were reviewed periodically during the study with the pre-stated goal of determining whether any changes should be made in the control algorithm. Algorithm 1 was used for the first 105 nights of the study (38 Control nights and 67 Intervention nights). The horizon prediction time of algorithm 1 was set at 70 minutes.</description>

    <description>The primary safety outcome will be evaluated by comparing the intervention and control nights and nights with vs. without actual shut-off of the pump for several measures of hyperglycemia such as mean morning blood glucose (mg/dL).
Algorithm 1 was modified to reduce the hypoglycemia prediction horizon from 70 minutes to 50 minutes, to suspend the pump only when the continuous glucose monitor sensor glucose value was ≤ 230 mg/dl, not suspend if there was a drop of &gt;40 mg/dl in consecutive sensor glucose readings, and to resume insulin delivery at the first rise in sensor glucose following a suspension. There was 156 nights of study data collected (48 Control nights and 108 Intervention nights) using algorithm 2.</description>

          <description>Each study night will be randomized to have either Predictive Low Glucose Suspend or to be inactive (control). On nights randomized to the intervention treatment, the study laptop will be running actively during the night and suspending the patient's pump if the algorithm predicts hypoglycemia based on the patient's continuous glucose sensor trend. (Pump suspension : The study laptop will communicate to the pump causing suspension based on output from the algorithm which predicts hypoglycemia based on the continuous glucose sensor trend.) On control nights, the algorithm will run passively and not recommend suspensions or resumption to the patient's pump.</description>

        <description>The primary safety outcome will be evaluated by comparing the intervention and control nights and nights with vs. without actual shut-off of the pump for several measures of hyperglycemia such as mean morning blood glucose (mg/dL).
An objective was to evaluate and refine the control algorithm. The data were reviewed periodically during the study with the pre-stated goal of determining whether any changes should be made in the control algorithm. Algorithm 1 was used for the first 105 nights of the study (38 Control nights and 67 Intervention nights). The horizon prediction time of algorithm 1 was set at 70 minutes.</description>

Algorithm 1 was modified to reduce the hypoglycemia prediction horizon from 70 minutes to 50 minutes, to suspend the pump only when the continuous glucose monitor sensor glucose value was ≤ 230 mg/dl, not suspend if there was a drop of &gt;40 mg/dl in consecutive sensor glucose readings, and to resume insulin delivery at the first rise in sensor glucose following a suspension.

          <description>The primary safety outcome will be evaluated by comparing the intervention and control nights and nights with vs. without actual shut-off of the pump for several measures of hyperglycemia such as number of mornings with urine ketones characterized as moderate or large based on measurement results of a urine dipstick test taken using Ketostix. Moderate is considered approximately 30 - 40 mg/dL and Large &gt;80 mg/dL.</description>
