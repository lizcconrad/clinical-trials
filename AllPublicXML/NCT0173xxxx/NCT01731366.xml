      Objective: To identify how specific changes of the whole grain content in the diet affect the
      host-gut microbiome interactions with implications for metabolic health .

      Design: A randomized, controlled, single-blinded, cross-over intervention trial consisting of
      two 8-week intervention periods, separated by a 6-week wash-out period. A total of 60
      participants will be included.

      Intervention: low vs. high whole grain intake.

      The study is designed as a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, cross-over intervention
      trial consisting of two 8-week interventions periods, separated by a 6-week wash-out period.
      A total number of 60 participants will be included. Participants consume, in randomized
      order, a diet rich in whole grain in the active treatment period and a refined grain diet
      during the control period.

      Measurements: Insulin sensitivity will be assessed by means of a meal challenge test and by
      the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) which is the primary outcome
      of this study. Secondary outcomes include metabolic and inflammatory markers, appetite
      hormones, transit time, and GM composition. Furthermore, selected control measures are
      included; 4-day food records and a study intervention diary.
