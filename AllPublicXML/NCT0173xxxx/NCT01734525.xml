  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study aimed at testing a strategy of early initiation of an antifungal
      agent to patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at risk for invasive candidiasis.
      Score system have been developed to identify groups at very high risk for the development of
      candidemia/invasive candidiasis in the ICU. These scoring system have used clinical
      information with or without data on Candida colonization, and have shown reasonable
      correlation with candidemia/invasive candidiasis. More recently, a biomarker - detection of
      1,3-beta-D-glucan in the serum - has been tested in the early diagnosis of candidiasis. The
      incorporation of biomarkers such as beta-D-glucan could help clinicians to select a group at
      higher risk for candidemia, and despite the fact that these tests may give false-positive
      results, their negative predictive value could be of great help. Likewise, analyzing the
      kinetics of these biomarkers in patients with candidemia/invasive candidiasis would help to
      define their usefulness in monitoring treatment.

      Therefore, the objectives of this study are:

        1. To assess the frequency of positive biomarkers in ICU patients at high risk to develop
           invasive candidiasis/candidemia;

        2. To evaluate the kinetics of positive biomarkers after initiation of antifungal therapy
           in patients with candidemia;

        3. To test the strategy of early discontinuation of antifungal therapy based on repeatedly
           negative blood cultures and 1,3 beta-D-glucan in the serum.

      Entry criteria are: In the ICU for &gt;2 days AND systemic antibiotics &gt;2 days OR central venous
      catheter for &gt;days AND at least two of the following: total parenteral nutrition, dialysis,
      surgery, pancreatitis, receipt of corticosteroids, receipt of other immunosuppressive agents.
      In addition, patients must have a clinical sign of infection (either one of the following):
      fever, hypothermia, hypotension, unexplanied acidosis, or unexplained elevation in C-reactive
      protein.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled after signing an informed consent and will have blood
      obtained for culture and determination of 1,3 beta-D-glucan serum levels for 3 days, and will
      start anidulafungin IV.

      If all tests are negative, anidulafungin will be discontinued on day 4. If 1,3 beta-D-glucan
      is positive (&gt;80 pg/ml) and / or blood cultures are positive for Candida species,
      anidulafungin will be continued for &gt;14 days. Blood will oe collected for determination of
      1,3 beta-D-glucan on days 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24 and 28.
