      This study evaluates the effects of complementary medicine (CAM) treatments on patient
      reported outcomes in hospital settings, for hospitalized people. Various CAM modalities such
      as acupuncture, reflexology, guided imagery and hypnosis are evaluated. The investigators
      compare outcomes between two groups: Standard of care (treatments that are provided commonly
      in hospital) versus standard of care AND CAM treatments. Outcomes assessed are both
      quantitative i.e. scores on Visual Analogue Scale for various symptoms such as pain, nausea,
      wellbeing, anxiety, and qualitative such as Measure Yourself Concerns And Wellbeing.

      Symptomatic patients are referred to CAM treatments by the medical staff of the departments.
      Patients interested in CAM treatments may receive various CAM treatments such as reflexology,
      acupuncture, guided imagery and hypnosis, according to patient preference and practitioner
      availability. Patients are requested to grade the severity of their symptoms on a visual
      analogue scale (0-100) before treatment and within 3 hours following treatments. Patients who
      are interested in standard care alone and not interested in CAM treatments grade their
      symptoms similarly, and serve as a control group. Primary outcomes are symptomatic relief and
      secondary outcomes are correlations between belief or disbelief in CAM with the primary
      outcomes.
