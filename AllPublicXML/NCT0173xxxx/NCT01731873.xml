  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to identify factors and genes (the nucleic acid
      material that determines the makeup of the human body) that may be associated with how
      children respond to pain medication, like morphine, which are called opioids. Though these
      pain medicines are used every day, some children have bad reactions from their use, like
      breathing problems, sedation, etc. It is not possible to completely predict which pain
      medicine is 'right' for a child. The investigators want to study factors that may be
      associated with pain sensitivity, pain medicine requirements after surgery, and their
      side-effects. The investigators expect that the information obtained in this research study
      will help to develop effective, safer, and tailored treatment options in the future.

    <textblock>
      Opioids are the mainstay for treatment of postoperative pain in children. Experience dictates
      that opioids have narrow therapeutic indices and large inter-patient variability in response.
      This leads to serious side effects like respiratory depression in up to 50% of children
      undergoing invasive surgery, which can be fatal. Moreover, up to two-thirds of the
      inter-individual variability in response to opioids results from genetic variations both from
      variability in pain perception as well as response to the pain medicine. Much of the
      inter-individual variability in response to opioids following surgical procedures can be
      explained by Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in a subset of the genes that encode
      proteins involved in pain perception, opioid transport/metabolism (pharmacokinetics), and
      opioid receptor signaling (pharmacodynamics). It is evident that there are particular
      children who are more susceptible to suffering side effects and having inadequate pain relief
      from opioids. Identifying genetic and non-genetic predictors for this susceptibility is vital
      for safe and effective analgesia in children. This is a critical knowledge gap in medical
      literature that significantly impacts pediatric pain management. The investigators' central
      hypothesis is that specific genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in pain perception,
      opioid transport, and opioid receptor signaling pathways contribute significantly to pain
      sensitivity, opioid side-effects, and analgesic efficacy in children.

      The choice and dosing of opioids has thus far been largely empirical, with a frequent need to
      switch opioids and alter doses due to inherent differences in individuals. By this study, the
      investigators hope to determine the 'right' doses of the 'right' opioids for optimized and
      safe postoperative analgesia in children. Given the unexplored nature of this complex
      phenomenon, The investigators propose a comprehensive study to evaluate gene, drug, and
      surgical interactions, in a large sample of 650 children undergoing different surgeries,
      requiring patient controlled analgesia with opioids.

      The proposed research is a preliminary step towards the investigators' long term goal to
      develop more effective, safer, and tailored pediatric opioid analgesia, by contributing to
      better understanding of the underlying genetic basis for variations in the sensitivity to
      pain, pain relief, and development of adverse effects from the extended use of postoperative
      intravenous opioids in children.

      The data collected will include pain scores, opioid doses, incidence of side-effects of
      opioids ̶ including respiratory depression, sedation, vomiting, and itching. Data analysis
      will use advanced logistic regression techniques to uncover the association between the SNP
      variants and the response to specific opioids following various surgeries.

      A database/ repository will be constructed for future research, analysis, and recruitment.
      De-identified study participants' genetic information, their responses to pain and pain
      medications, and side-effects will be included in a study database. Blood specimens will be
      included in the repository for exploring potentially important SNPs and biomarkers in future.
      No patient identifiers will be included in the database, and there will be a confidential
      (access limited to investigators only) code or link between the database and other
      information about the participant.
