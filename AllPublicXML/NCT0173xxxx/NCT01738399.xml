      The purpose of the study is to investigate the long-term (24 weeks) effects of coffee
      consumption on insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant individuals.

    <textblock>
      Coffee is a major source of the phenolic acid chlorogenic acid and a substantial source of
      trigonelline, niacin, lignans magnesium, and potassium. Several of these compounds have been
      shown to improve glucose metabolism in animal models. Consumption of coffee was inversely
      associated with the risk of type-2 diabetes in prospective cohort studies across the world.
      Consumption of 3 to 4 cups of coffee per day was associated with an approximately 25% lower
      risk of type-2 diabetes. However, direct evidence of the efficacy of coffee to reduce blood
      glucose and insulin resistance parameters in humans from randomized trials is still lacking.
      In recent small trials of short duration (up to 6 weeks) coffee consumption increased levels
      of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin, but did not significantly improve insulin
      sensitivity These results suggest that a larger longer-term trial of the effects of coffee
      consumption on directly measured insulin sensitivity is warranted.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects classified as being insulin-resistant in the screening visit. Subjects should
             have a non-diabetic fasting plasma glucose concentration (&lt; 7.0 mM) and a HOMA-IR &gt;
             2.2. The HOMA-IR was demonstrated as a reliable indicator of insulin resistance
             strongly correlated with values obtained by clamp (4). The cut-off value of the
             HOMA-IR was defined according to data obtained in the Singapore cohort. It corresponds
             to the 75th percentile of the population. The HOMA-IR cut-off was subsequently revised
             to ≥ 1.3 to increase recruitment rates.

          -  Age: ≥ 35 to ≤ 69 years old

          -  Body mass index : ≥ 22.5 to ≤ 35.4 kg/m2

          -  Users of at least 1 cups of caffeinated coffee per day who are willing to be
             randomized to any of the interventions.

          -  Subjects should be willing to stop consuming caffeinated soft drinks or supplements
             during the study and to drink coffee with non-dairy creamer.

          -  Non-smokers (&lt; 1 cigarette per week)

          -  Participants have been weight stable for at least -8 weeks pre-ceding the screening
             visit (± 2.5 kgs).

          -  Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicity

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects representing one or more of the following criteria are excluded from participation
        in the study:

          -  Any condition/illness that may affect the study outcomes or would make participation
             potentially harmful such as pregnancy or breastfeeding, diabetes mellitus, heart
             disease, stroke, hypertension, malabsorption syndromes, GERD, a history of ulcer,
             clotting or bleeding disorders,allergy to the test beverage, allergy to insulin,
             according to a detailed medical history.

          -  Participants who are allergic to foods may be excluded based on the investigator's
             discretion.

          -  Participants consume &gt; 2 alcoholic servings/day on a regular basis and &gt; 8 caffeinated
             servings (based on tea and coffee)/day

          -  Present drug abuse or use of medications that could interfere with the treatment
             including bronchodilators, quinolone antibiotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
             anxiolytics, ranitidine, corticosteroids, growth hormone, anti-hypertensives. These
             conditions will be screened based on subject reporting. Participants will be asked to
             bring in their current medications at the time of screening, and these will be checked
             by the study-staff.

          -  Subject is taking traditional medications, herbal or dietary supplements that may
             affect the study outcome in the opinion of the investigators.

          -  Subject who cannot be expected to comply with the study procedures in the opinion of
             the investigators.

          -  Currently participating or having participated in another clinical trial during the
             last 12 weeks prior to the beginning of this study.

          -  Premenopausal women with self-reported irregular menstrual cycles or peri-menopausal
             women (participants who stopped getting their menses for less than 48 weeks ).
