      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of a rush build
      up administration of Depigoid forte pollen and the first maintenance dose administered 4
      weeks later. The treatment period consists, thus, of 4 weeks.

      Primary variable:

      •Number of subjects [%] suffering at least one immediate or delayed systemic reaction of
      grade 2 or higher during the 4-weeks treatment period [grading according to the 2006 EAACI

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has dated and signed the informed consent.

          -  Men and women between 18 and 60 years of age (both inclusive).

          -  Individuals suffering symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or rhinitis during at
             least the preceding year, with or without allergic seasonal asthma caused by a
             clinically relevant sensitization to pollens (grasses AND P. judaica or O. europaea).
             Asthmatic patients can be included in the trial only if seasonal asthma is controlled
             with a medium daily dose minor or equal to 800 μg/day of budesonide or an equivalent
             or minor or equal to 400 μg/day of budesonide or an equivalent plus a long-acting- β2
             agonist.

          -  Asthmatic patients must be stable within 3 months prior to Visit 1 and on an stable
             inhaled steroid dose within 6 weeks prior to visit 1 and throughout the study. FEV1
             must be ≥ 80% of predicted value.

          -  The IgE-mediated sensitization must be demonstrated by the following:

        medical history AND IgE specific CAP RAST ≥ 2 to the suspected relevant pollens (grass
        pollen AND Olea and/or Parietaria) AND a positive skin prick test to grass and Olea and/or
        Parietaria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindication for treatment with allergen specific immunotherapy.

          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) value &lt;80% of the
             predicted normal value.

          -  Clinically relevant allergy symptoms due to sensitization to perennial allergens
             (mites, molds, epithelia) or other seasonal pollen which might interfere with the
             safety of the IMP.

          -  Asthma requiring a dose &gt; 800 μg/day of Budesonide or an equivalent, without
             long-lasting beta-2 agonists or requiring a dose &gt; of 400 μg/day of Budesonide or an
             equivalent plus a long-acting-β2 agonist to reach asthma control, according to the
             Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA 2010)

          -  Patients with non controlled bronchial asthma within 3 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients with asthma who have been treated with systemic steroids within 3 months
             prior to V1.

          -  Patients with hospital admission due to asthma exacerbations within 1 year prior to
             V1.

          -  Acute or chronic inflammatory or infectious diseases of the airways.

          -  Chronic structural diseases of the respiratory system (for example, emphysema or
             bronchiectasis).

          -  Immune system diseases, both autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiency.

          -  Any disease involving a contraindication for the use of adrenaline (for example,
             hyperthyroidism).

          -  Serious uncontrolled diseases involving a risk for the subjects participating in this
             study

          -  Malignant disease with activity in the last 5 years.

          -  Excessive consumption of alcohol, drugs or medication.

          -  Serious psychiatric, psychological or neurological disorders.

          -  Systemic or topical treatment with beta-blocker drugs 1 week before visit 2.

          -  Treatment with substances interfering with the immune system 2 weeks before visit 2.

          -  Use of tricyclic, tetracyclic and IMAO antidepressants. It will not be allowed to wash
             up antidepressants to enter the study because of the risks of interrupting
             antidepressant treatment, so patients on antidepressants therapy cannot be included in
             the trial.

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids 3 months before visit 1.

          -  Immunization with prophylactic (bacterial or viral) vaccines within 7 days before
             visit 1 (prophylactic vaccines are allowed during the administration of IMP period
             provided they are administered at least one week after IMP administration and the next
             IMP administration is administered at least 14 days later).

          -  Participation of the subject in another clinical trial 30 days before visit 2

          -  Subjects who are going to donate stem cells, blood, organs or bone marrow in the
             course of the study.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing and women with a positive pregnancy test
             at visit 1 or 2.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using highly effective methods of birth control.

          -  Subjects who are unable to comply with the requirements of the study or who in the
             opinion of the investigator should not participate in the study.
