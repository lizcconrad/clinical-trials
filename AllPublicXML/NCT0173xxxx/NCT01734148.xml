  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a biological process essential for health. Being hospitalized can exacerbate common
      sleep difficulties in children. Factors that contribute to sleep disturbances during
      hospitalization include environmental, physiological, and psychological factors. Although
      sleep interventions exist for healthy children in the community, interventions aimed at
      hospitalized children need to be developed and piloted with rigorous evaluative methods. The
      primary purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the RELAX TO
      SLEEP program on hospitalized children. Although this study is a pilot study, comparisons
      will be made to examine sleep outcomes between the intervention group and the control group
      including: total nocturnal (19h30-07h29), number of nighttime awakenings, longest stretch of
      nocturnal sleep, and total daytime (07h30-19h29) sleep. Other comparisons include anxiety
      levels and the development of post-hospital maladaptive behaviours.

    <description>The educational portion of the program will consist of a standardized educational booklet and a discussion with the PI and provides a brief overview will be given on normal sleep and sleep patterns, children's sleep needs, and the signs and consequences of sleep disturbance. Second, the educational booklet provides sleep hygiene info. The second component consists of of good sleep habits such as having a regular sleep-wake schedule, avoiding caffeine intake prior to sleep, avoiding stimulating activities near nighttime sleep, avoidance of naps during the day, ensuring that the child is exposed to natural light during the day, providing the child with opportunities to socialize during the day. Finally, the program consists of a relaxation breathing technique for the child.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children between the ages of 4 and 10.

          2. Children expected to stay for 3 nights.

          3. Children must have a parent present that plans to stay overnight with the child and
             must understand English (parent must read English).

          4. Child must be in a single private room.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children who are receiving palliative care only during their hospital admission.

          2. Children diagnosed with a sleep disorder or a clinical anxiety disorder.

          3. Children with limited or abnormal movements of both upper and lower extremities (e.g.
             paralysis, brain injury, cerebral palsy, use of drugs to induce paralysis,
             musculoskeletal impairments, use of restraints, under heavy sedation), thereby
             impairing sleep wake activity recording and the inability to use the relaxation
             breathing exercise.

          4. Children who are too acutely ill to participate in the study.

          5. Children who have major cognitive impairments that may impact their ability to
             understand and carry out the intervention.

          6. Children who are heavily sedated or receiving benzodiazepines or chloral hydrate.
