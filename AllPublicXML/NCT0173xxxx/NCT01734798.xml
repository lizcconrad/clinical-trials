  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical Cystectomy is still the standard treatment in muscle-invasive Bladder cancer. Local
      recurrence is still the major cause of failure together with distant metastasis.
      postoperative radiotherapy succeeded to decrease the local recurrence and hence improved the
      overall survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy has also improved the survival in different studies.
      This study is performed to test the efficacy and toxicity of adding the two modalities
      together compared to each modality alone.
