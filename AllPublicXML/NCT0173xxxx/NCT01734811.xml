  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two hospitals of the same geographic area. It will be included
      children &lt;3-years-old with recurrent wheezing attacks, confirmed by the review of the medical
      records, in the previous 12 months or a shorter time for those younger than one year.

    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will included 120
      children &lt;3 years old with ≥3 episodes of wheezing during the previous year. They will
      receive active treatment or placebo for six months. The main outcome will be the number of
      wheezing attacks during one year. Other outcomes were duration and severity of wheezing
      attacks , symptom and medication scores, and use of health resources.
