    <textblock>
      Oestrogen hormone deficiency in menopause leads to symptoms of which hot flushes, night
      sweats, insomnia and mood changes are the most frequent and, ultimately, worsen the quality
      of life. The gradual decline of oestrogen from peri-menopause results in altered function of
      many neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, melatonin and neuropeptides including
      beta-endorphins, which modulate the function of the hypothalamus and are involved in body
      thermoregulation.

      In post-menopause, dopaminergic activity is significantly reduced and stimulus of the D2
      receptors is effective in relieving hot flushes and in reducing the accompanying
      psychological symptoms.

      The use of hormone replacement therapy, which is generally prescribed in the case of moderate
      or severe symptoms, is limited due to real contraindications or simply the woman's refusal to
      take the therapy, despite the presence of symptoms requiring its use.

      A food supplement, named Estromineral (E), based on natural ingredients such as isoflavones,
      the absorption of which is increased by the presence of Lactobacillus sporogenes, and Vitamin
      D3 and calcium, strengthening bone mineralization, has been found to be effective at reducing
      vasomotor symptoms.

      To potentiate the effect of E on the most frequent symptoms in menopause, it was considered
      rational to add the extracts of magnolia, active on psycho-affective symptoms, and chaste
      tree, acting on both hot flushes and psychological symptoms and a new food supplement was
      developed: Estromineral Serena Plus (ESP).

      Estromineral Serena Plus is an association of isoflavones with added Lactobacillus, chaste
      tree and magnolia, active on menopausal vasomotor symptoms and on psycho-affective symptoms.

    <description>To calculate the Kupperman index, the symptoms were weighted as follows: hot flashes (4), insomnia (2), nervousness (2), and all other symptoms (night sweats, depressed mood (melancholy), dizziness, tiredness, joint and muscular pain, headache, and palpitations (1). The highest potential score is thus 51. The score of hot flashes was based on number of complaints per day: slight (more than 5), moderate (5-10), and severe (more than 10)</description>
