  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Echocardiography is an ultrasound-based imaging technique which can be performed through the
      esophagus (which lies behind the heart) and through the chest wall; both TEE and TTE are
      performed routinely as a monitoring and diagnostic tool at different times in the course of
      one cardiac surgery. The purpose of the study is to compare these two methods of
      echocardiography and comparing them to the 2D TEE and TTE assessments, which are routinely
      performed simultaneously. The study will also compare the echocardiography data to a third
      technique, thermodilution, which measures cardiac function via a pulmonary artery catheter.

    <description>Left ventricular volume will be assessed by 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D TEE) and compared to data from 3-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (3D TTE). 3D measurements will be compared to the 2D TEE and TTE assessment, which is routinely performed simultaneously. Last, this assessment will be compared to a third method of quantification of cardiac function via a pulmonary artery catheter.</description>

    <description>Patients having elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, valve repair or replacement surgery, aortic repair or replacement surgery, or any combination of these surgeries will be recruited for this study to validate measurements of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction (a quantitative measure of general heart function) as assessed by 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D TEE) as compared to 3-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (3D TTE). Secondarily, we will also compare the 3D TEE assessment to the 2D TEE and TTE assessment, which is routinely performed simultaneously. Last, we will compare this assessment to a third method of quantification of cardiac function via a pulmonary artery catheter using thermodilution.</description>
