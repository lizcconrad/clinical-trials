  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if taking a probiotic supplement versus a placebo
      will lower rates of relapse and improve the clinical course among participants who have been
      hospitalized for mania. Relapse and clinical course are measured by time to
      re-hospitalizations, new mood episodes, and changes in mood-related symptoms.
