      Primary objectives:

        -  To describe the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135,
           measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) and baby rabbit
           complement (SBA-BR), induced by a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menomune®
           - A/C/Y/W-135.

        -  To describe the safety profile of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or
           Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive a single dose of their assigned vaccine on Day 0. They will be
      assessed for immunogenicity on Day 30, and monitored for safety throughout the study.

          -  Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. Exclusion
             Criteria:

          -  Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of
             non-childbearing potential, a female must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year,
             surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from
             at least 4 weeks prior to vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after vaccination)

          -  Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 4 weeks preceding the trial
             vaccination) or planned participation during the present trial period in another
             clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination or planned
             receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following the trial vaccination except for

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F [≥ 38.0°C]). A
             prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has
             resolved or the febrile event has subsided

          -  Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 3 days prior to any blood
             draw. Should a subject receive oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 3 days
             prior to any blood draw, the Investigator will postpone the blood draw until it has
             been 3 days since the subject last received oral or injectable antibiotic therapy.
             Postponement must still be within the timeframe for blood draw indicated in the Table
             of Study Procedures, when possible

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
