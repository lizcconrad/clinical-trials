    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of a range of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. It consists of 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastro-intestinal tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating). Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent).
Item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency; the total score is obtained by summing the item scores. The NMSS total score ranges from 0 to 360 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Daily Normalized &quot;Off&quot; Time Based on Parkinson's Disease Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12 and Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Diary was completed by the participant for 3 consecutive days prior to each visit for the full 24 hours of each day. Participants recorded whether they had been &quot;On,&quot; &quot;Off,&quot; or &quot;Asleep&quot; and the severity of their dyskinesias (troublesome or not troublesome) for each 30-minute period during their normal waking time and upon awakening from time asleep.
&quot;Off&quot; time was defined as time when medication has worn off and was no longer providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness.
Parkinson's Disease Diary times were normalized to a 16-hour waking time to account for variation in participants' sleep time. Normalized PD Diary times at a given visit were calculated as the average normalized time from the PD Diary for the 3 days prior to the visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12 and Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing eight domains of health (mobility [10 items], activities of daily living [six items], emotional wellbeing [six items], stigma [four items], communication [three items] and bodily discomfort [three items]) which subjects consider to be adversely affected by the disease. Each item is scored on the following 5-point scale: 0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).
The PDQ-39 Summary Index (PDQ-SI) is the sum of all answers divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) which is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a 0 - 100 scale where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status and higher scores are associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CANTAB is a computer-based test of the participant's ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate remembered items in working memory. The Spatial Working Memory module requires that subjects find a blue token in a series of displayed boxes and use these to fill up an empty column, while not returning to boxes where a blue token has been previously found. The between errors score is the number of times the participant revisited a box in which a token was previously found; errors are calculated for 4-, 6-, and 8-box trials. Higher numbers indicate poorer performance.</description>

    <description>Participants had the PEG-J tube placement procedure performed on Study Day 1 and, at the discretion of the investigator, began initiation and titration of LCIG infusion. Dosing was determined individually. The starting total daily dose of LCIG was based solely on the daily dose of the oral levodopa taken immediately prior to Study Day 1 and was adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response for the individual participant.
Participants received treatment for up to 60 weeks; participants who completed their Week 60 visit before LCIG was commercially available had the option to extend their LCIG therapy, if in the opinion of the investigator, the participant would benefit from continued LCIG treatment.</description>

             Parkinsonian syndrome such as secondary Parkinsonism (e.g., caused by drugs, toxins,
             infectious agents, vascular disease, trauma, brain neoplasm), Parkinson-plus syndrome
             (e.g., Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Diffuse Lewy Body
             Disease, Corticobasilar Degeneration), or other neurodegenerative disease that might
             mimic the symptoms of PD.

          -  Subject has undergone neurosurgery for the treatment of Parkinson's disease

          -  Subject for whom the placement of a PEG-J tube for LCIG treatment is contraindicated
             or is considered a high risk for the PEG-J procedure according to the gastroenterology
             evaluation (e.g., pathological changes of the gastric wall, inability to bring the
             gastric wall and abdominal wall together, blood coagulation disorders, peritonitis,
             acute pancreatitis, paralytic ileus).

          <title>Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) Total Score</title>
          <description>The NMSS assesses non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. It consists of 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastro-intestinal tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous. Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent). The NMSS total score ranges from 0 to 360 with a lower score more desirable than a higher score. Baseline was the last measurement before the first dose of oral study drug.</description>
          <population>Data are reported for the efficacy dataset which includes all participants who received at least 1 infusion of LCIG study drug and had a baseline and LCIG Treatment Period observation for at least one efficacy or health outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of a range of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. It consists of 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastro-intestinal tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating). Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent).
Item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency; the total score is obtained by summing the item scores. The NMSS total score ranges from 0 to 360 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Used Healthcare Resources During the First 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>Use of healthcare resources was assessed by the investigator using the Health Resource Utilization Questionnaire (HRUQ), a questionnaire developed by the Sponsor regarding the use of healthcare resources due to the participant's Parkinson's disease. The Week 4 version of the questionnaire addressed the following questions during the first four weeks after the PEG-J procedure:
Has the subject had a visit to an emergency room?
Has the subject had a visit to an urgent care?
Has the subject had an outpatient visit to a neurologist?
Has the subject had an outpatient visit to a gastroenterologist, surgeon, or interventional radiologist?
Has the subject had an outpatient visit to a primary care physician?
Has the subject called the nursing support line?
Has the subject called a physician?</description>

        <description>Adverse events (AEs) related to treatment are those the investigator determined as having a reasonable possibility being related to study drug based on evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
A severe AE was defined as an adverse event that caused considerable interference with the participant's usual activities and might be incapacitating or life-threatening.
Serious AEs were defined as those that were life-threatening or resulted in death, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or important medical events requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent a serious outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 60 in the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of a range of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. It consists of 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastro-intestinal tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating). Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent).
Item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency; the total score is obtained by summing the item scores. The NMSS total score ranges from 0 to 360 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in NMSS Mood/Cognition Domain Score</title>
        <description>The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of a range of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. It consists of 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastro-intestinal tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating). Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent).
Item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency; domain scores are obtained by summing the item scores. The NMSS mood/cognition domain score ranges from 0 to 72 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in NMSS Urinary Domain Score</title>
        <description>The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of a range of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. It consists of 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastro-intestinal tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating). Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent).
Item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency; domain scores are obtained by summing the item scores. The NMSS urinary domain score ranges from 0 to 36 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Parkinson's Disease Diary was completed by the participant for 3 consecutive days prior to each visit for the full 24 hours of each day. Participants recorded whether they had been &quot;On,&quot; &quot;Off,&quot; or &quot;Asleep&quot; and the severity of their dyskinesias (troublesome or not troublesome) for each 30-minute period during their normal waking time and upon awakening from time asleep.
&quot;Off&quot; time was defined as time when medication has worn off and was no longer providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness.
Parkinson's Disease Diary times were normalized to a 16-hour waking time to account for variation in participants' sleep time. Normalized PD Diary times at a given visit were calculated as the average normalized time from the PD Diary for the 3 days prior to the visit.</description>

        <description>The PD Diary was completed by the participant for 3 consecutive days prior to each visit. Participants recorded whether they had been &quot;On,&quot; &quot;Off,&quot; or &quot;Asleep&quot; and the severity of their dyskinesias (troublesome or not troublesome) for each 30-minute period during their normal waking time and upon awakening from sleep.
&quot;On&quot; was defined as time when medication was providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness. &quot;On&quot; time without troublesome dyskinesia is a composite of &quot;On&quot; time without dyskinesia (involuntary twisting, turning movements which are an effect of medication) plus &quot;On&quot; time with non-troublesome dyskinesia (dyskinesia that does not interfere with function or cause meaningful discomfort).
PD Diary times were normalized to a 16-hour waking time to account for variation in participants' sleep time. Normalized PD Diary times at a given visit were calculated as the average normalized time from the PD Diary for the 3 days prior to the visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline for Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The UPDRS assessment was performed by an approved, trained rater.
The UPDRS was made up of the following sections:
Part I – Mentation, Behavior, and Mood
Part II – Activities of Daily Living
Part III – Motor Examination
Part IV – Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)
Part V – Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging
The Total UPDRS score includes 31 items contributing to three subscales: (I) Mentation, Behavior, and Mood; (II) Activities of Daily Living; and (III) Motor Examination. Each question is answered on a scale from 0 (None) to 4 (Severe); Some questions require multiple grades assigned to each extremity. The UPDRS Total score was computed as the sum of these 3 UPDRS subscales and ranged from 0 to 176, with 176 representing the worst (total) disability, and 0 no disability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UPDRS Part III: Motor Examination Score</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is an investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The UPDRS assessment was performed by an approved, trained rater.
The UPDRS was made up of the following sections:
Part I – Mentation, Behavior, and Mood
Part II – Activities of Daily Living
Part III – Motor Examination
Part IV – Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)
Part V – Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging
The motor examination score includes 17 items addressing speech, facial expression, tremor at rest, action tremor, rigidity, finger taps, hand movements, hand pronation and supination, leg agility, arising from chair, posture, gait, postural stability, and body bradykinesia. Each question is answered on a scale from 0 (Normal) to 4 (Severe), some items include multiple grades for each extremity. The UPDRS Part III: motor examination score was computed as the sum of these items and ranged from 0 (not affected) to 108 (most severely affected).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 Item (PDQ-39) Summary Index</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing eight domains of health (mobility [10 items], activities of daily living [six items], emotional wellbeing [six items], stigma [four items], communication [three items] and bodily discomfort [three items]) which subjects consider to be adversely affected by the disease. Each item is scored on the following 5-point scale: 0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).
The PDQ-39 Summary Index (PDQ-SI) is the sum of all answers divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) which is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a 0 – 100 scale where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status and higher scores are associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness.</description>

        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing eight domains of health (mobility [10 items], activities of daily living [six items], emotional wellbeing [six items], stigma [four items], communication [three items] and bodily discomfort [three items]) which subjects consider to be adversely affected by the disease. Each item is scored on the following 5-point scale: 0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).
Domain scores are calculated by summing the answers to the questions in the domain, dividing by the highest score possible and then multiplying by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status and higher scores are associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in PDQ-39 Bodily Discomfort Domain Score</title>
          <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing eight domains of health (mobility [10 items], activities of daily living [six items], emotional wellbeing [six items], stigma [four items], communication [three items] and bodily discomfort [three items]) which subjects consider to be adversely affected by the disease. Each item is scored on the following 5-point scale: 0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).
Domain scores are calculated by summing the answers to the questions in the domain, dividing by the highest score possible and then multiplying by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status and higher scores are associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Spatial Working Memory Between Errors Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>CANTAB is a computer-based test of the participant's ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate remembered items in working memory. The Spatial Working Memory module requires that subjects find a blue token in a series of displayed boxes and use these to fill up an empty column, while not returning to boxes where a blue token has been previously found. The between errors score is the number of times the participant revisited a box in which a token was previously found; errors are calculated for 4-, 6-, and 8-box trials. Higher numbers indicate poorer performance.</description>

        <description>CANTAB is a computer-based test of the participant's ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate remembered items in working memory. The Spatial Working Memory module requires that subjects find a blue token in a series of displayed boxes and use these to fill up an empty column, while not returning to boxes where a blue token has been previously found. The Strategy score represents the number of times a participant begins a search with the same box for 6- and 8-box problems. Minimum score is 8 and maximum score is 56. Higher numbers indicate poorer performance.</description>
