    <textblock>
      The application of the TLR7/8 (Toll Like Receptor) agonist gel (immune response helper)
      resiquimod will enhance the immune response to the intradermal influenza vaccine in seniors
      65-75 years of age.

    <measure>Reactogenicity of the vaccine regimens</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 - Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Reactogenicity of the vaccine regimens (Intanza+resiquimod gel; Intanza+placebo gel) will be collected from Day 0 (pre vaccination) to Day 7. The change from Day 0 to Day 7 will be measured. The following information will be collected and compared 1) local pain (none, mild, moderate, severe; 2) injection site redness, swelling, induration measured in millimeters; itchiness present or not 3) bruising; 4) fever-values greater than or equal to 38.0 will be considered fever; 5) general symptoms-shivering, sweating nausea, vomiting diarrhea will be measured for presence or absence; 6) general symptoms-myalgia (muscle aches), arthralgia (joint aches), malaise (feeling unwell), tiredness/fatigue, headache and sleep disturbance will be measured as mild, moderate or severe</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HAI (hemagglutination inhibition)titres</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The primary immunologic outcome will be the 28 day post vaccination immune (HAI, hemagglutination immune assay titer)responses to the 3 vaccine strains present in each vaccine, assessed by the EMEA/CHMP (European Medicines Evaluation/Committee on Human Medicinal Products) Agency criteria for evaluation on immune response to influenza vaccines in persons over 60 years of age. The measurements include seroconversion rate (CHMP threshold greater than 30%), geometric mean titre (GMT) fold-increase or ratio (threshold greater than 2) and seroprotection rate (threshold greater than 60%). Whether the CHMP threshold for each measurement is met or exceeded per strain will be noted between products as descriptive information.</description>

    <measure>Granzyme B levels and Interferon gamma to interleukin 10 ratios</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 28 post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The day 0 (pre vaccination) and day 28 Granzyme B levels and Interferon gamma to interleukin 10 ratios will be measured and the change in levels from Day 0 to Day 28 will be compared in the 2 groups: 1) Intanza+resiquimod gel; 2) Intanza+placebo gel</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Microneutralization titres</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 28 post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Microneutralization titers will be measured in serum for the 3 virus strains in the influenza vaccine and compared at Day 0 (pre vaccination) and Day 28.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>baseline Granzyme B Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 28 post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Differences between baseline Granzyme B activity in lysates of PBMC's (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and Granzyme B levels,interferon gamma to interleukin-10 ratios and HAI (hemagglutination inhibition) titres will be compared.</description>
