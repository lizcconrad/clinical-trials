    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies radioembolization and ipilimumab in treating patients with
      uveal melanoma with liver metastases. Radioembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the
      blood flow to the tumor and keeping radioactive substances near the tumor. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving radioembolization together with ipilimumab may
      kill more tumor cells in patients with uveal melanoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the safety and efficacy of sequential hepatic radioembolization and systemic
      ipilimumab in patients with uveal melanoma metastatic to liver.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate effects on regulators of tumor immunity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radioembolization with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres via hepatic arterial
      infusion on day 1. Beginning on day 29, patients also receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <description>Sequential hepatic radioembolization and systemic ipilimumab will be considered potentially efficacious if &gt;3/12 patients achieve objective responses because the upper limit of the corresponding exact 95% confidence interval will be &gt;57%.

    <description>A number of correlative studies will be performed. Data will be analyzed longitudinally using methods such as repeated measures ANOVA; however, the primary analyses will be at specific time points (e.g., pre-treatment, post-hepatic radioembolization, post ipilimumab), and these analyses will be conducted using primarily non-parametric methods (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank or rank sum test). All tests will be two sided with a significance level of .05, and no adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made due to the exploratory nature of these studies.</description>
