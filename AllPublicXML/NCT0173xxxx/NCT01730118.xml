  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - HER2/neu (HER2) is a tumor protein that appears in almost a third of breast cancers and in
      several other types of cancers such as colon, prostate and non-small cell lung. Tumors that
      overexpress HER2 can be associated with a more aggressive cancer, higher recurrence rates,
      and reduced survival rates. Researchers are testing a therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to
      stimulate the immune system to recognize HER2. The vaccine, called AdHER2/neu dendritic cell
      vaccine, is custom-made using an individual s own immune cells. These cells will be collected
      and used to produce the vaccine.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of AdHER2 vaccination.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have HER2-expressing tumors.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.

        -  Participants will have an apheresis procedure to collect immune cells to create the
           vaccine.

        -  Participants will receive four doses of the vaccine at study Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 24.

        -  Participants will be monitored with physical exams, frequent blood tests and imaging
           studies.

  <detailed_description>

      Background:

        -  Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as c-erbB2 or neu) is a
           proto-oncogene that encodes a 185-kd transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that
           participates in receptor-receptor interactions that regulate cell growth,
           differentiation and proliferation. Its over-expression contributes to neoplastic
           transformation.

        -  HER2 is over-expressed in up to 25-30% of node-positive or node-negative primary breast
           cancers and is associated with clinically aggressive breast cancer, a high recurrence
           rate and reduced survival.

        -  Trastuzumab (Herceptin (Registered trademark)) is a recombinant humanized mouse
           monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to the extracellular (EC) domain of the HER2
           receptor. Its clinical efficacy is limited to patients with 3+ HER2 tumor expression
           documented by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a Vysis fluorescent in situ hybridization
           (FISH) ratio of greater than 2.2. IHC is a subjective measurement of HER2/neu protein
           while FISH is an objective measurement of amplification of the HER2 oncogene.

        -  Although the use of trastuzumab has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, a
           significant number of patients are unresponsive to therapy and most eventually
           experience clinical progression. At present no vaccine is available that induces
           patients to make their own anti-HER2 antibodies.

        -  We propose to investigate the use of an adenoviral vector (Ad5f35) expressing human
           HER2ECTM (Ad5f35HER2ECTM- AdHER2) to transduce autologous dendritic cells for
           therapeutic vaccination in patients with HER2 expressing solid tumors.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the safety and toxicity of autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination.

      Specifically, to determine if the fraction of patients with cancer therapeutics-related
      cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD), defined as a decrease in LVEF &gt;=10 percentage points, to a value
      LVEF to less than or equal to 53% (normal reference value for two-dimensional (2-D)
      echocardiography), is sufficiently low to warrant further development in subsequent trials.

      -To determine the immunogenicity of autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination as measured
      by a 3-fold increase in anti-HER2/neu antibody concentration or a 4-fold increase in antibody
      dilution titers over baseline.

      Study Design:

      Open label, non-randomized, two part, phase I/ pilot study of 52 weeks duration for
      evaluation of primary endpoints with extended follow-up out to 30 months to monitor LVEF
      cardiac function.

      Part I involves vaccine dose escalation in a population with no prior exposure to trastuzumab
      or other HER2-targeted therapies to determine if there is a significant, adverse safety
      signal regarding cardiac toxicity, in addition to preliminary assessment of the vaccine s
      immunogenicity and clinical activity. Five doses of 5, 10, 20 or 40 x 10(6) viable
      cells/AdHER2 DC vaccine will be given intradermally at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 in patients
      with metastatic solid tumors or high risk bladder cancer in the adjuvant setting
      characterized by some HER2/neu expression. Re-staging for clinical evidence of stable
      disease, partial response or better by immune-related response criteria will be assessed at
      Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 with confirmatory scans (if indicated) at Weeks 12, 20, 28, 40 and
      52. Adjuvant bladder cancer patients will undergo re-staging for evidence of disease
      recurrence (with confirmatory scans 4 weeks later if recurrence is documented) at Weeks 8,
      16, 24, 36 and 48.

      Part II is identical to part I, but is conducted in a population with significant prior
      exposure to

      trastuzumab and other HER2-targeted therapies.

      Eligibility:

      Part I:

        -  Adults &gt;= 18 with recurrent, metastatic solid tumors including sarcomas characterized by
           some HER2/neu expression but for whom trastuzumab is not clinically indicated OR are
           naive to HER2 targeted therapies:

             -  Patients with ovarian, cervical, colon, gastric/gastroesophageal, non-small cell
                lung, renal cell, bladder and prostate cancer and osteosarcoma that is HER2 1+, 2+
