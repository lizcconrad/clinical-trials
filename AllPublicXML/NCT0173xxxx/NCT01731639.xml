    <textblock>
      A new technique based on the motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME) at a
      magnification of at least ×6000 has been developed. The MSOME assesses the nucleus, for both
      shape and chromatin content, which is the most important sperm organelle in influencing
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Sperm morphology has been described as one of the major determinants of male in vitro
      fertility. However, the standard morphology evaluation on random stained cells from the
      ejaculate is of limited value during ICSI. Current research is directed towards the
      dysmorphisms of the sperm head.A new technique based on the motile sperm organelle morphology
      examination (MSOME) at a magnification of at least ×6000 has been developed. The MSOME
      assesses the nucleus, for both shape and chromatin content, which is the most important sperm
      organelle in influencing ICSI outcomes. The goals for this study are to identify whether
      there is a connection between morphologic sperm normalcy under high magnification and (i)
      semen analysis according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) reference values and (ii)
      ICSI outcomes.

    <description>The semen samples will be evaluated according to the 2010 WHO reference values. After ICSI 200 spermatozoa of each sample will be analyzed under high magnification (MSOME - x6600) and graded into four groups according to the presence or size of the vacuoles. Grade I: normal form and no vacuoles; grade II: normal form and ≤ 2 small vacuoles; grade III: normal form &gt; 2 small vacuoles or at least one large vacuole and grade IV: large vacuole and abnormal head shapes or other abnormalities.</description>
