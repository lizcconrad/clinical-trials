  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this follow-up study is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies against all
      the vaccine antigens 10 years after booster vaccination with either Tdap or Td, and also to
      assess immunogenicity and safety of another dose of Boostrix, administered in this study.
      This protocol posting deals with objectives and outcome measures of the extension phase. The
      objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = NCT00109330).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were previously vaccinated with either Boostrix or a control Td vaccine in study
      NCT00109330. Only subjects who were part of the primary study will be invited to participate
      in this study. All subjects will receive a single dose of Boostrix at Visit 1 (Day 0) and
      subjects will be observed till Visit 2 (Day 30) for safety in terms of solicited adverse
      events (during 4 days post vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (during 31 days post
      vaccination) and serious adverse event (during the trial period). A blood sample will be
      collected from all subjects before vaccination (Visit 1) and one month after vaccination
      (Visit 2) for antibodies estimation.

      This summary has been updated following Protocol amendment 2 dated 03 October 2013. The
      protocol is being amended to facilitate enrolment by:

        -  - Extending the window period for re-vaccination from ± 6 months to ± 300 days from the
           Year 10 time point.

        -  - Extending the recruitment period from 6 months to 14 months. The format of
           non-inferiority criterion of the first co-primary objective has been updated to keep it
           aligned with the format of non-inferiority criterion of the second co-primary objective.

        <title>Number of Subjects With a Booster Response to Anti-D and Anti-T.</title>
        <description>Booster response to anti-D and anti-T antigens was defined as:
for initially seronegative subjects with pre-booster antibody concentration below 0.1 IU/mL, an increase of at least four times 0.1 IU/mL one month after vaccination,
for initially seropositive subjects with pre-booster antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL, an increase of at least four times the pre-booster antibody concentration one month after vaccination.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 1</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was done on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects who had met the eligibility criteria, who complied with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol and for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen.</population>
