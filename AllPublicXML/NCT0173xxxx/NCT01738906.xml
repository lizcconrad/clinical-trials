  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale

      It has been shown in several studies that alcohol increases subsequent food intake. However,
      moderate alcohol consumption has no clear effects on hunger and satiety hormones. In the
      Western world, where palatable food is highly available, food reward may play an important
      role in food intake. Alcohol consumption is known to stimulate neurotransmitters important
      for food reward and may therefore stimulate the reward response on a subsequent meal. This
      may lead to higher food consumption than when no alcohol is consumed. It is hypothesized that
      the reward response of food or beverages can already be generated when food or beverages are
      sensed in the mouth, because oral nutrient sensing is known to induce a satiety response
      (i.e. the cephalic phase response). Moreover, taste buds directly signal brain areas closely
      connected to the reward areas in the brain.

      Primary objective

        -  To determine whether moderate alcohol consumption influences subsequent food reward, as
           measured by questionnaires on food 'wanting' and food 'liking', and salivary and blood
           parameters related to reward.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To determine whether food reward is different when food is consumed than when food is
           sensed in the mouth, as measured by questionnaires on food 'wanting' and food 'liking',
           and salivary and blood parameters related to food reward.
