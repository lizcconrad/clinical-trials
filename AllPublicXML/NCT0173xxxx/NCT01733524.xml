  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' long-term goal is to discover novel, inexpensive and feasible strategies
      to improve the management and well-being of youth with T1DM. The specific objective of this
      proposal is to quantify the impact of responsible pet ownership on the glycemic control and
      health related quality of life in youth with T1DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) affects 151,000 children and adolescents in the United
      States. Youth with T1DM are at a high risk for multiple psychosocial co-morbidities including
      poor health related quality of life (HRQoL) which is linked to medication non-compliance and
      increased risk for diabetes-related complications. Any reduction in the psychosocial
      adjustment difficulties related to T1DM could improve the medical outcome of children with
      T1DM.

      Current standards for diabetes management reflect the need to maintain glucose control within
      a normal range. However, numerous reports indicate that normalization of blood glucose levels
      is seldom attainable in children and adolescents. Family cohesion, positive coping
      strategies, younger age of onset, social support and adequate self-regulatory behavior are
      found to favorably influence glycemic control. One may conclude that the presence of a
      companion animal, capable of enhancing the positive factors named above, would augment the
      array of tools available for the successful management of chronic illnesses such as T1DM.

      There is a lack of studies assessing the impact of pet ownership on the health and well-being
      of adolescents. The process of caring for, loving and being loved by a companion animal could
      offer direct and/or indirect benefits to the HRQoL in children with T1DM. To the
      investigators' knowledge, there are no studies examining the impact of pet ownership on
      glycemic control and HRQoL in youth with T1DM.
