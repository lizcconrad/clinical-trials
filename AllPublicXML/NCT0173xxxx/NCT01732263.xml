    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how much of the study drug SSP-004184 (SPD602) is
      absorbed by the body and how long it takes to be eliminated from the body in healthy subjects
      and subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic (liver) impairment compared with
      subjects with healthy normal liver function.

    <description>Tmax is the time after administration of a drug when the maximum plasma concentration in the body is reached.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Half-Life (T 1/2) of SSP-004184</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 96 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The time it takes for the blood plasma concentration of a substance to halve.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of SSP-004184</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 96 hours post-dose</time_frame>

    <description>The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy. Each category is based on a scoring system of 1-3 with 3 being the worst and a total score range of 5-15. It is broken into categories A (score of 5-6), B (score of 7-9), and C (score of 10-15) with worsening from A to C for prognosis.</description>

             and is:

          -  Male, or

          -  Non pregnant, non lactating female

        Subjects with hepatic impairment

          -  Subjects must provide a letter of evaluation from a hepatologist or copy of supporting
             documents confirming the subject's hepatic impairment (a liver biopsy is preferable
             but not mandatory).

          -  Hepatic impairment should be primary and must not be a complication of an underlying
             primary systemic disease (eg, patients with metastatic cancer and cancer cachexia)

          -  Male subjects who consume more than 3 units of alcohol per day. Female subjects who
             consume more than 2 units of alcohol per day. (1 alcohol unit = 1 beer [12 oz/355 mL]
             = 1 wine [5 oz/150 mL] = 1 liquor [1.5 oz/40 mL] = 0.75 oz/20 mL alcohol.)

          -  Caffeine consumption: For healthy subjects: Routine consumption of more than 2 units
             of caffeine per day or subjects who experience caffeine withdrawal headaches or have a
             history of caffeine withdrawal headaches. (One caffeine unit is contained in the
             following items: one 6 oz/180 mL cup of coffee, two 12 oz/355 mL (ie, 24 oz/710 mL
             cola) cans of cola, one 12 oz/355 mL cup of tea, three 1 oz/28 g chocolate bars (ie, 3
             oz/85 g chocolate). Decaffeinated coffee, tea, or cola are not considered to contain
             caffeine.)

          -  Donation of blood or blood products within 60 days.

          -  Substantial changes in eating habits within 30 days.

            <description>The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy. Each category is based on a scoring system of 1-3 with 3 being the worst and a total score range of 5-15. It is broken into categories A (score of 5-6), B (score of 7-9), and C (score of 10-15) with worsening from A to C for prognosis.
All subjects will take a single oral dose of SSP-004184 (SPD602) (50 mg/kg) on Day 1 (or a revised dose if dose modifications are warranted).</description>

            <description>The Child-Pugh Score is a scoring system used to determine the prognosis with cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation. Scoring is based upon albumin, ascites, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy. Each category is based on a scoring system of 1-3 with 3 being the worst and a total score range of 5-15. It is broken into categories A (score of 5-6), B (score of 7-9), and C (score of 10-15) with worsening from A to C for prognosis.
All subjects will take a single oral dose of SSP-004184 (SPD602) (50 mg/kg) on Day 1 (or a revised dose if dose modifications are warranted).</description>
