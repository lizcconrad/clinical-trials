    <description>The initial dose of cisplatin is fixed to be 60 mg/m2 and intravenously administered over 1 hour on day 1 of the cycle. TS-ONE is orally administered consecutive 14-day followed by 7-day rest. The initial standard dose of TS-ONE is determined based on the body surface area tabled below. Trastuzumab is intravenously administered with the loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by HER2-positive advanced GC 21 years or older No prior regimen HER2 protein HER2/neu detection procedure Tissue from (Gastric) Cancer FISH method IHC method negative positive HER-2 negative HER-2 positive Eligible 0 / 1+ 2+ 3+ HER-2 positive Eligible HER-2 negative iii Protocol S1/CDDP/Her V1.3 dated 21 May 10 maintenance dose of 6mg/kg in day 1 of each cycle. The study treatments are repeated every 3 weeks. Study treatment can continue until PD, but cisplatin can be skipped or discontinued if patients experienced unbearable toxicity which comes from cisplatin.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             more than or equals to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as more than or equals to
             10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          6. ECOG performance status less than or equals to 2 (Karnofsky more than or equals to
             60%).

          7. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL

               -  Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL

                  normal

               -  ALP less than or equals to 3 x upper limit of normal*

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine clearance** &gt;60
                  mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

                    -  In the presence of liver metastasis, patients with AST, ALT and ALP &lt; or = 5
                       x the upper limit of normal may be admitted. *In the presence of bone
                       metastasis, patients with AST ,ALT and ALP &lt; or = 10x the upper limit of
                       normal maybe admitted. **: Creatinine clearance can be estimated using
                       Cockcroft-Gault formula man: Ccr (mL/min) = body weight (kg) x (140 -
                       age)/(72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)), woman: Ccr = male Ccr x 0.85]. The
                       above CrCl Formula is to be applied in all sites.

          8. Patients who have HER2-positive cancer confirmed with IHC and/or FISH***.

             *** Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER-2 is routine as part of pathological evaluation
             of gastric hybridisation (FISH) for Her2 copy number is required. A copy number value
             above 2.2 is taken as positive. The sponsors for the drugs used in our investigator
             initiated trial (Taiho) have kindly agreed to pay for the HER2 FISH test.

          9. Patients able to take orally.

         10. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 50% on MUGA or

             inform her treating physician immediately.

         11. The effects of proposed regimen on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because antitumor agents as well as

                  University Hospital (S)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse

             composition to TS-ONE, cisplatin and trastuzumab or other agents used in the study.

          5. Presence of any contraindications to TS-ONE or cisplatin or trastuzumab.

          6. Baseline LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction) &lt; 50%.

          7. Patients with serious (e.g.inpatient care is needed) complications (e.g. intestinal

             poorly-controlled diabetes, renal failure or hepatic cirrhosis).

          8. Patients with massive ascites (moderate or higher, beyond the pelvic cavity and
             retention on the anterior surface of the liver on CT) or massive pleural effusion
             retention.

          9. Patients with fresh bleeding from the digestive tract which needs repeated blood
             transfusion.

         10. Patients with diarrhea (4 or more times per day or watery diarrhea).

         11. Previous malignancy other than gastric cancer diagnosed in the last 5 years except for
             basal cell carcinoma of skin or preinvasive cancer of cervix.

         12. Patients with reproductive potential who refuse to use an adequate means of
             contraception (including male patients).

         13. Significant disease or conditions which, in the investigator's opinion, would exclude
             patient from the study.

         14. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

         15. Pregnant or lactating female.

         16. HIV-positive patients.
