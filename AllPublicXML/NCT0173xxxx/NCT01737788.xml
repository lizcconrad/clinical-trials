      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cervical occlusion versus no cervical
      occlusion in women with cervical cerclages.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical weakness and ascending infection have long been considered important causes of
      preterm birth. Cervical occlusion could theoretically be used for the treatment of cervical
      weakness and to protect the cervix against infection. A cervical cerclage could be placed to
      increase the cervical resistance, and occlusion of the external os could be performed to
      retain the cervical mucus plug thereby preventing infection. The aim of this multicentre,
      stratified, randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of cervical occlusion
      versus no cervical occlusion in women with prophylactic and therapeutic cervical cerclages.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to slow recruitment and an interim analysis showing no benefit of occlusion.

    <description>Women were randomized to receive cervical occlusion or no cervical occlusion in addition to a cervical cerclage (McDonald or Shirodkar cerclage). Cervical occlusion was performed with interrupted or continuous sutures, placed approximately 1 cm deep on each lip, and 0.5 cm apart with a nylon 2-0/3-0 suture.</description>
