    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to ascertain the effects of cutaneous air cooling
      on vessel diameter within Capillary Malformations (CM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capillary malformation (CM) is the most common vascular malformation occurring in
      approximately 0.3% of all newborn. The standard treatment for facial or aesthetically
      sensitive CM's is flashlamp Pulsed Dye Laser. Skin cooling prior to laser treatment of CMs is
      standard practice within our department. The effects of skin cooling on the vasculature
      within CMs are poorly understood. Previous studies by our department have shown that raising
      ambient temperature increases CM vessel size. It has been postulated that by increasing CM
      vessel size, it may also increase the effectiveness of treatment. We hypothesize that cooling
      the skin during laser treatment may cause vasconstriction of the superficial vessels within
      the CM. This may have an impact on treatment success.

    <description>In a temperature controlled room, the participant's capillary diameter/depth and skin/core temperatures will be taken from their CM prior to cooling the skin. The patients' CM will be cooled for a duration of 1 minute. The above measurements will be repeated immediately after 1 minute of cooling.</description>
