      Particular attention was paid to the role played by nutrition in supporting the gut
      ecosystem, balancing microbiota and promoting health status. In that respect, the beneficial
      effects of probiotics were demonstrated for different infectious diseases, GII and URI.

      The beneficial effect of probiotics for treatment of symptomatic diarrhea was clearly
      documented.
