    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. The investigator or sub-investigator reviews all laboratory findings and determines if they constitute an AE. In-patient observation assessments will be performed during 1 week post-dose, followed by the out-patient observation assessments in groups: 0.0006, 0.006, 0.04, 0.2 mg/kg up to the end of Week 8 and in groups: 1, 3, 6, 10 kg/mg) up to the end of Week 24.</description>

    <description>A single ascending dose (SAD) administration of E6011 is administered to 8 groups as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at a dose of either 0.0006, 0.006, 0.04, 0.2, 1, 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg. Each participant in each group will receive a single-dose only once. The study drug will not be administered to more than two participants on the same day, and the second participant must start the study treatment after at least a 2-hour interval from the start of the study treatment in the first participant. The subsequent ascending dose groups will start approximately at least every 3 weeks following the study treatment in the first participant of each group.</description>
