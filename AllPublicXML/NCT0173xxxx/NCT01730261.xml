      This study will examine the feasibility of online delivery of emotional regulation training
      to individuals with TBI with emotional dysregulation. 80 subjects with significant emotional
      dysregulation will be enrolled and will receive 24 60-minute emotional regulation sessions
      twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered online in group modality. Attendance and compliance will
      be tracked, and outcomes will be monitored using online data collection methods. Treatment
      satisfaction and participant subjective experience will also be assessed.

      This study will examine the feasibility of online delivery of emotional regulation training
      to individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury who also have emotional dysregulation. 80 subjects
      with significant emotional dysregulation will be enrolled and will receive 24 60-minute
      emotional regulation sessions twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered online via a group meeting
      software. Study participation will last 28 weeks: 4 weeks of baseline, 12 weeks of treatment
      (24 sessions) and 12 weeks of follow-up. Assessments will be conducted at each of four
      timepoints: T1 (baseline), T2 (pre-treatment assessment), T3 (end-of-treatment assessment)
      and T4 (follow-up assessment). In addition, a subset of the measures will be administered
      bi-weekly for the duration of the study. Assessments will consist of a variety of measures
      designed to measure executive functioning, problem solving skills, and quality of life. All
      assessments will be completed online, using a web-based data collection. Attendance and
      treatment compliance will be tracked, and outcomes will be monitored using online data
      collection methods. Treatment satisfaction and participant subjective experience (including
      technical difficulties that make access to web-delivered treatment impossible) will also be
      assessed.

    <description>Emotional Regulation Training (EmReg) is a cognitive-behavioral approach which aims to increase awareness, and self-monitoring of affective states to improve self-regulation. EmReg combines didactic and experiential training, and emphasizes skill acquisition and generalization through examination of incidents of emotional dysregulation in one's life and completion of homework assignments. The treatment is divided into two phases: knowledge provision and practice facilitation. During the knowledge provision phase participants are introduced to the objectives and the main concepts of the treatment, to increase their familiarity with the terminology, and to the emotional regulation skills they acquire during the practice facilitation phase. During the practice facilitation phase participants receive training in emotional regulation skills, which they practice in-session with the guidance of the therapist and feedback from the group, as well as out-of-session as homework assignments.</description>
