  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the
      combination of ipilimumab and imatinib that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      Ipilimumab is designed to increase the immune system's ability to fight cancer.

      Imatinib is designed to bind to certain proteins on the tumor cells, which may prevent the
      cells from growing.

      This is an investigational study. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Imatinib is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal
      tumor (GIST).

      The combination of ipilimumab and imatinib is currently being used for research purposes
      only.

      Up to 96 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      Dose Escalation Group:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of your study drug combination based on when you joined this study. Up to 4 dose levels
      of the study drug combination will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination
      is found.

      Dose Expansion Group:

      After the highest tolerable dose level of the study drug combination is found, up to 20
      additional participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion group. Patients with
      metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), melanoma, or tumors with original tumor
      biopsies testing positive for KIT mutations (a cancer biomarker) will be eligible to enroll
      and will receive the highest dose of the study drug combination that was tolerated in the
      dose escalation group.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are in the Dose Escalation Group, the first study cycle is 35 days. Each cycle after
      that is 21 days.

      If you are in the Dose Expansion Group, all study cycles are 21 days.

      If you are in the Dose Escalation Group, you will start taking imatinib by mouth 2 times
      every day for 14 days before you receive ipilimumab. On Day 15 of each cycle, you will
      receive a single dose of ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes. You will continue to take
      imatinib by mouth 2 times every day.

      If you are in the Dose Expansion Group, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes
      on Day 1 of each cycle. You will also take imatinib by mouth 2 times every day.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) time each week during Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 14 of Cycle 1, if you have c-KIT positive mutant melanoma you will have a biopsy to
      check for changes in the tumor cells and for immune system testing.

      Every 3-4 weeks during Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      On Day 21 of Cycle 2, if you have c-KIT positive mutant melanoma you will have a biopsy to
      check for changes in the tumor cells and for immune system testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and then every other cycle:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing (for up to a year).

        -  You will have ECG.

      Starting after Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan after every 2 cycles to check the status of the disease.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine
           pregnancy test once a month.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For dose escalation study, patients must have histological confirmation of solid
             tumors that is metastatic or unresectable. For expansion cohorts, patients must have
             metastatic or unresectable GIST, melanoma, or uncategorized tumors with tumor biopsies
             that are positive for c-KIT mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or
             immunohistochemistry (IHC). For patients enrolled in the melanoma expansion cohort,
             only select KIT mutations will be eligible. Patients with mutations in exon 13 V654X,
             14 T6701, 17 D816X and all exon 18 mutations will not be eligible for enrollment.

          2. Patients who have completed previous therapies 4-weeks prior to (or within 5 drug half
             lives) enrollment on study. Radiation therapy wash out period will be 2 weeks. This
             includes an exception of patients with metastatic GIST tumors who are taking
             maintenance imatinib mesylate therapy. These patients are allowed to remain on
             imatinib mesylate therapy up to enrollment in this study.

             before starting therapy

          8. Patients with histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma, gliosarcoma or
             anaplastic astrocytoma will be eligible. Patients must have shown unequivocal
             radiographic evidence for tumor progression by MRI scan. A scan should be performed
             within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dose that has been stable for at
             least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and
             registration, a new baseline MRI is required.

          9. Patients in the expansion cohort must also agree to participate in the biomarker
             study. However, patients in the Melanoma KIT positive mutant subgroup, patients must
             agree to participate in the biomarker study and biopsies.

             diarrhea or chronic skin conditions, recent surgery or colonic biopsy from which the
             patient has not recovered, or partial endocrine organ deficiencies.

          9. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Women of child-bearing potential and men
             must agree to use contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
