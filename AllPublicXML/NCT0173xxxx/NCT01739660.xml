      This is a Phase 1 single dose study conducted to evaluate the PK and PD of pegloticase
      administered to hemodialysis patients.

      A single dose of pegloticase will be administered intravenously to male or female
      hemodialysis patients (N = 12) starting 3 hour prior to dialysis.

      The study consists of a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and Follow up Period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients that require hemodialysis typically undergo
      hemodialysis treatment 3 times per week. As such, medications can be dialyzed off, reducing
      their clinical effectiveness; this study is being conducted to understand how dialysis
      affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of pegloticase.
