  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adnexal mass is the most common indication for gynaecological surgery . Pre operative
      characterization is crucial and a scoring system would be useful to standardize the imaging
      report and thus, improve patient management. Recently, our center developed the first MR
      scoring system named ADNEXMR SCORING system in a retrospective study which is accurate and
      reproducible (1). Our objectives are to perform an external prospective validation of this
      scoring system, to evaluate its potential impact on therapeutic strategy and to test its
      reproducibility.

      This is a prospective large multicenter study. All patients with a sonographically
      indeterminate adnexal mass referred for MR imaging will be consecutively included in each
      center. Then, patients will undergo a routine pelvic MR imaging. Prospectively, one senior
      and one junior radiologists independently analyze the different MR criteria to characterize
      adnexal masses. The MR report will be issued as standard and the patient will be managed
      accordingly. Then, the reader will classify the mass using ADNEXMR SCORING system. The
      classification will be compared to the reference standard as defined below. The
      reproducibility of the classification will be tested between the junior and the senior
      radiologist. After anonymisation, images will be analyzed by another senior radiologist of
      another center blinded from any clinical or ultrasonographical data and correlated with the
      reference standard.

      Reference standard: Reference standard will be surgical procedure with histology or standard
      clinical follow-up depending on most appropriate routine practice.

      Sample size: The sample size was computed to ensure a power of at least 90% (with a two-sided
      type I error rate of 5%) to conclude that SCORE 2 and 3 and SCORE 4 and 5 would have a
      different PPV. It would thus be necessary to have at least 569 patients classified as SCORE
      2, 259 as SCORE 3, 52 as SCORE 4 and 51 as SCORE 5 (18). Given the prevalences, and assuming
      6% of patients would be classified, as SCORE 1 and 10% would be lost to follow-up, 1340
      patients will be included in this study to insure a probability of at least 95% to obtain the
      aforementioned number of patients in each score category. The inclusion period will last 18
      months (extension for a period of 12 months) and monitoring will continue for 2 years.

      All patients with an indeterminate ultrasonographically adnexal mass referred for MR imaging
      will be consecutively included in each center.

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  Patient ≥ 18 years old

        -  With indeterminate ultrasonographic adnexal mass

        -  Informed consent

      Non inclusion Criteria

        -  Pregnant women

        -  Pacemaker, ferromagnetic materials, or foreign body at risk of mobilization

        -  Intolerance to iodinated or gadolinium contrast agents, or severe renal insufficiency
           (GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m²).

      Objectives • Primary objective: Evaluate if ADNEXMR SCORING system is relevant for reporting
      pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations performed for characterization of
      sonographically indeterminate adnexal masses in an external prospective multicenter study

      • Secondary objectives and endpoints: Evaluate

        1. The potential impact of applying the score to the therapeutic strategy, in particular to
           measure the possible reduction in oncologic surgery in benign cases

        2. If ADNEXMR SCORING system improves reproducibility of MR report for characterization of
           adnexal masses

        3. If ADNEXMR SCORING system is as accurate if the radiologist is blinded from any clinical
           and ultrasonographic data

      Main endpoint Joint analysis of true negative and false negative rates according to ADNEXMR
      SCORING system as compared to the histological results (or follow-up outcome, see &quot;reference
      standard&quot;, below) with an evaluation of the sensitivity and the specificity of the score
