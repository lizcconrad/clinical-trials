  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the cost of treating eating disorders and the substantial morbidity and mortality
      associated with these disorders, prevention of eating disorders has considerable public
      health significance. Female athletes represent an important population for prevention due to
      their risk for the Female Athlete Triad, which includes inadequate energy intake, irregular
      or cessation of menses, and osteoporosis. The proposed randomized controlled trial will
      provide important information regarding the efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of
      implementing a brief eating disorder prevention and healthy living program within an existing
      social system of female athletes.

      Research supports the use of a Healthy Weight (HW) program targeting small lifestyle
      modifications in the prevention of ED onset and in reducing ED risk factors. Studies show
      that HW can be tailored for specific social systems (e.g., sororities) which can facilitate
      dissemination and that undergraduate peer-leaders can implement these programs. Interventions
      that can be administered affordably by endogenous providers are more likely to be
      disseminated, as indicated by the large scale dissemination of a peer-led ED prevention
      program by a national sorority. Another target social system for dissemination of ED
      prevention is collegiate athletics. Research suggests that disordered eating among female
      athletes is prevalent, and that this group is at greater, or at least equal, risk for
      developing EDs as non-athlete females. Disordered eating is especially dangerous in female
      athletes because it increases risk for the Female Athlete Triad (i.e., low energy
      availability/disordered eating, menstrual disorders, and decreased bone mineral
      density/osteoporosis) and subsequent injury. Moreover, the triad puts athletes at risk for
      serious long-term health consequences, such as osteoporosis, reproductive disorders, and
      cardiovascular disease. Despite this, efforts aimed at prevention of EDs among this group
      remain surprisingly limited. A pilot study with female athletes suggests that a modified
      version of HW can be successfully implemented by peer-leaders within the constraints of a
      competitive athletics program with positive effects at 12 month follow-up. The proposed study
      is a randomized controlled trial of the HW intervention among female athletes. 500 female
      collegiate athletes from three sites will be randomized to either the HW prevention program
      or a brochure waitlist control condition using group (cluster) randomization based on teams.
      Participants will complete surveys and telephone interviews at pretest, posttest, and at 6
      and 12 month follow-ups. The investigators will examine; (1) the efficacy of HW in reducing
      empirically supported ED risk factors relative to a waitlist brochure control condition at
      one year, (2) whether HW impacts secondary outcomes, including knowledge and identification
      of the female athlete triad, treatment seeking for the triad, affect, and health care
      utilization, and (3) whether positive effects for HW replicate the effects from the pilot
      study at one year and 18 months for the HW condition only.
