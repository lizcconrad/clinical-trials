    <description>The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of IV therapy with autologous MSCs in MS. Number of participants with adverse events will be documented at week 0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48 post treatment. Co-primary objective of the study is to evaluate the activity of autologous MSCS in MS patients, in terms of reduction as compared to placebo in the total number of contrast-enhancing lesions (GEL) at MRI acquired on conventional 1,5 T MRI scans over 24 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>To gather preliminary information of the efficacy of the experimental treatment in terms of combined MRI activity and clinical efficacy (incidence of relapses and disability progression).</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of MS

             a. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) not responding to at least a year of attempted
             therapy with one or more of the approved therapies (beta-interferon, glatiramer
             acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, fingolimod) as evidenced by one or more of the
             following: i. ≥1 clinically documented relapse in past 12 months ii. ≥2 clinically
             documented relapses in last 24 months iii. ≥1 GEL at MRI performed within the last 12
             months

             b. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) not responding to at least a year of attempted
