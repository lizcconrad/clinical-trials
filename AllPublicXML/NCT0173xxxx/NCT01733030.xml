      PROJECT SUMMARY:

      PTSD is a debilitating psychiatric condition precipitated by exposure to extreme, or life
      threatening, trauma with an estimated lifetime prevalence between 8% and 9% in U.S. adults.
      One core symptom of PTSD is intense psychological distress in the presence of stimuli that
      &quot;resemble&quot; one or more aspects of the trauma experience (DSM-IV). This phenomenon referred to
      as stimulus generalization has received surprisingly little empirical testing in the context
      of clinical anxiety in general, and PTSD more specifically. The current proposal represents
      the first effort to study the neurobiology and pharmacology of this PTSD-relevant learning
      phenomenon across those with and without PTSD. The objective of this particular proposal is
      to apply fMRI and pharmacologic methods to: 1) identify brain mechanisms associated with
      generalization of conditioned fear and 2) examine the pharmacologic modifiability of levels
      of generalization using a partial agonist at the NMDA receptor complex (D-cycloserine) shown
      to increase discrimination of CS+ (danger cue) and CS- (safety cue) in animal studies.

      To fullfill the objectives of this application, a generalization paradigm has been designed
      and psychophysiologically validated in which 6 rings presented on a computer screen gradually
      increase in size. For half of participants the smallest ring is the conditioned stimulus
      paired with electric shock (CS+) and the largest is the unpaired stimulus (CS-), and for the
      other half of participants this is reversed. Activity in fear-related brain structures
      measured via fMRI are predicted to gradually decrease as the presented stimulus gradually
      becomes less similar to the CS+, forming a generalization slope or gradient. One central
      hypothesis of the current application is that DCS (Seromycin) will dose dependently increase
      the steepness of generalization gradients (i.e., reduce fear generalization). This study will
      include 3 groups of healthy adults recieving either 1) 500 mg Seromycin, 2) 250 mg Seromycin,
      or placebo only prior to acquisition of fear conditioning. Twenty four hours later,
      participants will return to complete an fMRI during which brain responses to the danger cue
      and stimuli resembling the danger cue will be assessed.
