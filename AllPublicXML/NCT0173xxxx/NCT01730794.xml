  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a specific mode of artificial ventilation (help from
      a breathing machine) with other modes. This specific mode is called Neurally Adjusted
      Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) and is different from other modes as it uses direct signals from
      the diaphragm (breathing muscle) to help patients breathe. The investigators believe that
      using these signals, NAVA can determine the exact timing for patients' spontaneous breathing
      effort and delivers the artificial breath at the same time (in synchrony) with their own
      breath. Other modes (breathing methods) may cause asynchrony between the patient and the
      ventilator while delivering artificial breaths because of the way they operate. Asyncrony
      between patient and ventilator is a risk factor for increasing the length of artificial
      ventilation and number of related complications. The investigators would like to find out if
      NAVA performs better in establishing synchrony between patient and ventilator and as a result
      decreasing time for artificial ventilation and increasing better outcomes.

      Study Goal To compare the ability of NAVA vs. conventional lung protective ventilation in a
      multicenter, unblinded, randomized, controlled fashion to provide invasive ventilatory
      support during acute respiratory failure in adults with an AI &gt;5% who are expected to require
      ventilatory support for greater than 72 hours.

      Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the use of NAVA compared to conventional lung protective
      ventilation will result in a decrease in the number of days of mechanical ventilation. It is
      further hypothesized that NAVA compared to conventional lung protective ventilation will
      result in a decrease in the length of weaning, the length of ICU and hospital stay, and
      mortality.

      Primary Outcome

      • Number of invasive ventilator free days.

      Secondary Outcome

        -  Total mechanical ventilation (invasive plus noninvasive) free days

        -  Mortality

        -  Length of Invasive Ventilation

        -  Length of post extubation NIV

        -  Total length of mechanical ventilation (invasive plus noninvasive)

        -  Length of ICU and hospital stay

        -  Development of extrapulmonary organ failure (any organ failure developed during the
           study that was not present at the time of enrollment into the study)

        -  Incidence of barotrauma (defined as the presence of any extra-pulmonary air that was not
           present at study enrollment).

        -  Ventilator associated pneumonia (development of a pneumonia 48 hrs after entry into the
           study).

        -  Development of ARDS (after enrollment into the study; defined as a rapid onset, a
           P/F&lt;200 mmHg, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that are not of cardiac origin).

    <description>In this group, patients will be ventilated in either volume A/C, pressure A/C, pressure support, pressure regulated volume control or volume support based on the discretion of the medical team with TV 4-8 ml/kg PBW range and PP or pressure (control or support) level &lt;30 cmH2O.</description>

    <description>In the NAVA group, NAVA level will be set initially at zero, then the maximum Edi will be determined as the average level over the next 3 to 5 breaths without ventilatory support or PEEP. The actual NAVA level will then be titrated by the clinician to achieve the following: 1) an Edi equal to approximately 50% of the maximum Edi, 2) an average tidal volume of between 4 to 8 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW), and 3) an average respiratory rate between about 15 and 40 per minute. In addition, the trigger sensitivity should be set as sensitive as possible without causing auto-triggering and the maximum pressure limit in NAVA should be set at 40 cm H2O.</description>
