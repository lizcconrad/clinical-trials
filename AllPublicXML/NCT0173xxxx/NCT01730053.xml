      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 79 sites in 8 countries. Overall, 672 participants were screened between 24 October 2012 and 27 September 2013, 367 of whom were screen failures. Screen failures ware mainly due to exclusion criteria met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified according to prior history of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, and intensity of statin treatment (rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg). Assignment to treatment arms was done centrally using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio after confirmation of selection criteria.</pre_assignment_details>
