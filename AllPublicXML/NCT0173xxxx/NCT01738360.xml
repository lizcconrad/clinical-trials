  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives :

        -  To investigate the safety and the tolerability of ATO by IV infusions to patients with
           SLE,

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ATO.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Evaluation of the clinical and biological response of the SLE to ATO,

        -  Time of relapse in case of positive response,

        -  Determination of the efficacy,

        -  Pharmacokinetic study of ATO.

    <description>The definition of toxicity will be based on &quot;Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4&quot; of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health / National Cancer Institute.
The investigators will consider the occurrence of a significant toxicity if at least one of the following events is observed :
Any symptomatic toxicity (and / or abnormality) cardiac and / or QTc prolongation &gt; 480 msec.,
Apart from cardiac toxicity, toxicity of any grade 3 or 4 and irreversible toxicity (within 30 days) of any grade 1 or 2.</description>

    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Combined clinical response using the composite response of SLE or SRI (SLE Responder Index) (SLEDAI + BILAG (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group) + PGA) : a positive response is defined by a reduction of SELENA SLEDAI of at least 4 points, no worsening ( &gt; 0,3 point) of the physician's global assessment (PGA), no new score &quot;A&quot; and no more than one new score &quot;B&quot; about BILAG. This composite index is now the benchmark tool for evaluating therapeutic protocols in SLE.</description>

    <description>The study duration was 30 months (24 months recruitment + 6 months follow-up).Thirteen patients will be successively included in this study at 6 different dose levels of arsenic trioxide (0.075, 0.10, 015, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30 mg / kg / day). The treatment should be administered by IV infusion over 2 hours of D1 to D4 (conventional hospitalization) and at D8, D11, D15, D18, D22 and D25. The protocol starts at the dose of 0.10 mg / kg / day. The stage at the dose of 0.075mg/kg/day is planned in case of toxicity with the first stage at the dose of 0.10mg/kg/day.
The course of study is as follows :
Pre-inclusion between D-35 and D-15
Ten injections during the first month distributed as follows : conventional hospitalization from D1 to D4 (one injection per day) and daily hospitalization day for injections at D8, D11, D15, D18, D22 and D25.
A telephone contact between D32 and D34
A consultation at D40 then monthly consultation at D60, D90, D120, D150 and D180</description>
