  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that a subset of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/ myalgic
      encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), including also patients with no clinical response after B-cell
      depletion therapy using the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, may benefit from tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha inhibition using Etanercept as weekly subcutaneous injections.

    <description>The primary endpoint is defined as moderate or major response of the CFS/ME symptoms, of at least six weeks duration, independent on when during 12 months follow-up the response period(s) occurs. Single such response periods, and the sum of these, are recorded.</description>
