  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local recurrence after surgical resection is a complex phenomenon. An important predictive
      factor is the response to chemotherapy. Central site of disease may be a second independent
      predictive factor (Lin et al. 2007). Patients with more than 10% viable tumour cells at
      surgery following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy had a less favourable outcome with an Event-free
      Survival [EFS] of 47% after 10 years. Patients with good histological response (&lt; 10% viable
      tumour cells) after chemotherapy alone had a prognosis of about 70% after 10 years.

      However, further studies are necessary to determine the merit of adjuvant radiation for
      high-risk patients (poor responders). Taking into consideration that the toxicity and
      morbidity of combined surgery and radiation is greater than either alone and must be closely
      monitored.
