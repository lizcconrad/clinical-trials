      The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of two Eating Frequency prescriptions,
      meal (energy intake occurring during three meals per day) and grazing (energy intake
      occurring every two to three hours per day), on consumption during an ad libitum meal
      consumed at the end of the day, overall daily energy intake, and ratio of energy intake to
      energy expenditure. It is hypothesized that the grazing condition will produce lower
      consumption during an evening ad libitum meal, lower daily energy intake, and a lower ratio
      of energy intake to energy expenditure than the meal condition.

      20 men and women of healthy weight will participate in this study. The complete study design
      will be a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design, with the between-subject factor of order and a
      within-subject factor of eating condition (meal or grazing). Depending upon the eating
      condition, participants will be provided with a morning meal and an afternoon meal (meal) or
      two small meals and three snacks to be consumed every 2-3 hours (grazing). The types of foods
      and amount of foods provided to participants will be identical in each condition; the only
      difference in the conditions is the time spacing during the day when the foods are consumed.
      The primary dependent variable will be amount, both grams and energy, of food consumed during
      an ad libitum meal consumed in the evening at the completion of the meal condition, overall
      daily energy intake, and ratio of daily energy intake to energy expenditure. It is
      hypothesized that the grazing condition will produce lower consumption during an evening ad
      libitum meal, lower daily energy intake, and a lower ratio of energy intake to energy
      expenditure than the meal condition.

    <description>The foods that will be used in this investigation are Tyson Chicken Breast Tenders, Ore-Ida Tater Tots, Birds Eye Steamfresh Pure &amp; Simple green beans, and Sarah Lee Butter Pound Cake. Participants will be provided with ad libitum amounts of the foods, and the foods will be measured in grams to the tenth decimal point on an electronic food scale (Denver Instrument Co., Arvada, CO) before and after the meal. The weight of the container will also be measured. Total grams of each food consumed during the session will be determined by subtracting pre- and post-consumption weight of food.</description>
