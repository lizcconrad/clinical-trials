      The major objective of this project is to determine if compared to Standard Care (SC), a
      Community Approach to Lifestyle Modification for Diabetes (CALM-D) program including diet,
      exercise and coping skills training, can decrease depression, weight and HbA1c and improve
      medication adherence in low income, primarily Black and Latino/Hispanic, depressed,
      overweight, Type 2 diabetic patients seen in a large, comprehensive, community health center.
      Type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Obesity, poor
      glycemic control, depression, low socioeconomic status (SES) and being a member of a
      racial/ethnic minority group all increase this risk.

      The project will compare 100 CALM-D and 100 SC participants. Following 3 run-in sessions
      assessment sessions to determine eligibility, given to both SC and CALM-D participants, SC
      patients will be treated in accordance with ADA Clinical Practice Guidelines (2005) and also
      assessed by project staff at baseline, 6 months and 1 year. The CALM-D participants will
      receive 2 individual stress management and lifestyle sessions followed by 2 weekly group
      sessions. Then 4 bi-weekly sessions will be followed by 9 monthly sessions for a total of 17
      sessions. Secondary objectives of the project are to determine if compared to SC, CALM-D can
      improve glucose tolerance to challenge, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation,
      procoagulation, lipid profile, endothelial function resting blood pressure, cardiac and
      vascular function, cardiac morphology, psychosocial functioning and health quality of life.
      As many of the participants will already have been prescribed aspirin, statins, oral
      hypoglycemics and other medications, an important objective of the project will be to assess
      the extent to which improved adherence to medications - a goal of the CALM-D program - can
      account for improved intervention effects.

    <textblock>
      This project will be conducted on type 2 diabetic patients. Patients meeting eligibility
      criteria will be randomized to SC or the CALM-D condition, which includes diet and exercise
      counseling and coping skills training that in part is intended to facilitate medication
      adherence. Both CALM-D and SC patients will be prescribed antidepressant as well as other
      medications.

      Because patient retention and adherence to protocol will be a major emphasis in this project,
      we intend to use a 3 session &quot;run-in&quot; prior to randomization. Patients who appear to be
      medically eligible, meet study criteria for major depression, and who express willingness to
      participate return for a session in which the patient completes a medical history form,
      undergoes a brief physical exam, takes a maximum exercise stress test, is given a
      standardized dietary assessment, and is taught how to use a food diary and activity monitor.
      At the beginning of the third run-in session, the patient returns the completed food diary,
      and data from the activity monitor is recorded. The patient then takes a 2 hour oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT) during which time he or she answers questions about health habits,
      psychosocial functioning and health quality of life. After a brief rest and snack the patient
      is escorted to the Ultrasound Laboratory for assessment of echocardiography, carotid artery
      imaging and brachial artery endothelial functioning. Patients who satisfactorily complete all
      three run-in sessions, meet eligibility requirements and are interested in participating, are
      then asked to provide informed consent and are randomized into the CALM-D or SC conditions.

      Randomization will be implemented using a stratified randomized block design. Eight strata
      will be designated on the basis of age (&lt;50 vs ≥ 50 years), severity of depression (&lt;24 vs ≥
      24 on the HRSD), and glycemic control (&lt;8 vs ≥ HbA1c) at baseline. Within each stratum,
      random sequences will be generated in blocks of sizes 2, 4 or 6. The block size will also be
      randomly chosen. In this manner the resulting sequence will look purely random, but will be
      fairly closely balanced with respect to the critical variables of age, depression and
      severity of diabetes (Piantadosi, 1997). Elements in the random sequences will be paired with
      the subject number of participants assigned to each stratum. The number of sequences
      generated for each stratum will vary depending on the number of eligible participants in that
      stratum. These sequences will be concealed until the treatment conditions are actually
      assigned.

      The SC patients will be treated in accordance with ADA Clinical Practice Guidelines (2005),
      which will include at least 2 HbA1c tests, lipid profile, test for microalbuminuria, dilated
      retinal eye exam, complete foot exam and influenza immunization each year plus prescribed
      aspirin therapy, and a screen for readiness to stop smoking if they smoke. Smokers are
      encouraged to stop, using ADA recommendations in the Guidelines. In addition, each patient's
      physician will receive after baseline, 6 months and 1 year, a report including OGTT, insulin
      resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid profile, endothelial function, resting
      blood pressure, cardiac and vascular function, cardiac morphology, psychosocial functioning
      and health quality of life. Participants in the CALM-D condition will receive all of the
      above, but also 2 individual counseling sessions on (a) getting started, being active, losing
      weight and managing stress; and (b) negative thoughts and emotions including a discussion of
      ways to curb emotional eating. Following the 2 individual sessions there will be 2 weekly
      group sessions followed by 4 bi-weekly sessions and then 9 monthly sessions. Each session in
      CALM-D will be 1 hour long and will include deep breathing relaxation (5 min), homework
      review including medication adherence, activity level, and fat and caloric intake (10 min),
      session topics and homework assignment (45 min). The group topics include such issues as
      &quot;Where's the Fat?/Three Ways to Eat Less Fat&quot; and &quot;Taking Your Medications/Stress and You.&quot;
      Although participants and interventionists will be aware of the patient's treatment
      assignment, all staff who collect, verify or classify end point data or follow-up assessments
      will be masked as much as possible.

      The primary outcomes of the study will be: a) depression; (b) weight and waist circumference;
      (c) HbA1c; and (d) medication adherence. Secondary outcomes will include: (a) glucose
      tolerance, (b) insulin resistance, (c) inflammation, (d) fibrinolysis, (e) lipid profile, (f)
      oxidative stress, (g) endothelial function, (h) resting blood pressure, (i) cardiac and
      vascular function, (j) cardiac morphology, (k) psychosocial functioning, and (l) health
      quality of life. The above variables will be assessed at baseline, after 6 months and after 1
      year. Data will be analyzed using mixed-model analyses to determine change over time as a
      function of experimental condition. This will be done using the PROC Mixed module of SAS
      software (Littell, Milliken, Stroup, &amp; Wolfinger, 1996). This methodology is useful for
      intent to treat analyses in that it does not require complete data across multiple time
      points.

      Approximately 50% of the patients we intend to recruit are likely to be Latino/Hispanic;
      based on our previous experience, most of these Latino/Hispanic participants will prefer to
      speak, write, and answer questions in Spanish. All of the instruments proposed are available
      in Spanish. To a large extent, the CALM-D intervention developed for the present project is
      based on both the DPP and ENRICHD protocols. We recognize, of course, that language and
      ethnicity are not the same. However, there is a great deal of diversity among
      Latino/Hispanics in the patient sample we have enrolled from the Jackson Health Care System
      including Cubans, Colombians, Puerto Ricans, Nicaraguans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Peruvians and
      Guatamalans among others.

      During the 2 hour OGTT the participant will complete questionnaires including: a) Medical
      History Form (e.g., demographics, risk factors, comorbid illnesses, medications); (b) health
      habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol use; physical activity); (c) psychosocial functioning (e.g.,
      BDI, DISH); and (d) health quality of life. In addition to providing measures of blood
      glucose and plasma insulin, the blood draw will permit assessment of HbA1c, inflammation,
      fibrinolysis, and lipids. After the OGTT the assessor will provide the participant with a
      snack and allow for a brief rest period. Then the RD will conduct a dietary assessment and
      record the data from the activity monitor. The participant will then be escorted to the
      Ultrasound Laboratory for assessment of echocardiography, carotid artery imaging and brachial
      artery endothelial function. At the completion of the session the participant will report to
      the Assessors, review the days events, be thanked for participating and paid $100
      reimbursement for his or her time and transportation.

      Physical measures. Activity monitor. Between the second and third week of the run-in
      (Baseline) and 1 week before the 6 month and 12 month assessments all participants will wear
      activity monitors for physical activity. The participants will also complete the Blair (1984)
      questionnaire for the same one-week period. Participants in the CALM-D condition will be
      reminded one week prior to each of 17 intervention sessions to wear the accelerometer daily
      and bring it to the next session. We intend to use the New Lifestyle NL-2000 activity
      monitor. This device weighs .25 ounce, count steps and estimates calories burned. The caloric
      estimate subtracts calories burned in maintenance and adjusts for intensity based upon steps
      per unit of time. This device has a 7 day automatic memory that starts each midnight at zero.

      Albuminuria. Albumin and creatinine will be measured during the 2nd run-in/assessment
      /Baseline session by urine sample (see Core B). Serum creatinine will also be measured.
      Patients will be excluded if there is evidence of renal disease (i.e., urine dipstick protein
      4+; serum creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women or 1.5 mg/dL in men; or currently receiving
      dialysis). In those patients who meet criteria for entry into the study, the incidence and
      progression of microalbuminuria or greater level of excretion will be assessed using an
      albumin/creatinine ratio at both 6 month and 12 month follow-up. Serum creatinine will also
      be measured at these times.

      Cardiorespiratory fitness. Fitness will be evaluated at Baseline (second run-in/assessment
      session) and at 6- and 12-month follow-up with a maximal treadmill test (see Core C). The
      Baseline symptom-limited maximum stress test represents the current standard of care for an
      exercise prescription. The primary measure for assessing change will be change in maximal
      oxygen uptake (VO2 max). Heart rate, ECG changes, blood pressure and VO2 max will be
      determined during the exercise test. For the maximum exercise stress tests the participant
      will be continued on any prescribed medication for cardiovascular disease. The following 3
      abnormalities classify an individual at moderate to high risk for cardiac complication during
      exercise and will result in study exclusion: 1) 2 or more previous myocardial infarctions;
      (2) previous episode of primary cardiac arrest; (3) exercise capacity &lt; 6 METS, (4) ischemic
      horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression ≥ 4.0 mm, or (5) angina during exercise (see
      Core C for details).

      Diabetes control. CALM-D will include measurement of HbA1c, fasting glucose, and response to
      oral glucose challenge at Baseline (run-in/assessment session 2), and at both 6- and 12-month
      follow-up. Patients will be excluded at Baseline if HbA1c &gt; 11%.

      Psychosocial measures Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI (Beck, 1967) taps several
      domains of depression. Of the 21 items on the scale, 11 deal with cognition, 2 with affect, 2
      with overt behavior, 1 with interpersonal symptoms and 5 with somatic symptoms. In
      overweight, type 2 diabetic patients, somatic symptoms may reflect physical disease processes
      (e.g., fatigue or inflammation rather than primary depression. For this reason, subanalyses
      separating out effects of the intervention on somatic vs nonsomatic items will be important.
      The BDI has been used extensively in English, Spanish and various European speaking
      populations with internal reliability between α = .85-.93 (e.g., Sanz &amp; Vázquez, 1993).

      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS (Cohen, S. &amp; Williamson, G., 1988) is a 10 item scale
      that measures the degree to which situations in people's lives are perceived as stressful
      (unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming) and has good reliability (α = .85).

      Cook-Medley Hostility Scale (Ho). The Ho scale (Cook &amp; Medley, 1954) is composed of 50
      true-false items taken from the MMPI that measures cynicism and mistrust of others and has
      adequate test -retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity (Smith,
      1992). It has been shown in a number of large scale prospective studies to be associated with
      increased risk for CHD (Miller et al., 1996).

      Coping. The Brief Cope (Carver, 1997) will be used to assess coping strategies that may be
      moderating CALM-D intervention effects. This instrument has demonstrated high internal
      consistency, adequate stability over time and substantial convergent validity. Based on our
      previous studies using the Cope, we shall be looking at the following 2 item subscales: (1)
      active coping; (2) using emotional support; (3) using instrumental support; and (4)
      behavioral disengagement. Subscales 1, 2, and 3 will also be used as a composite measure.

      Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS). The PSSS (Blumenthal et al., 1987) is a 12-item scale
      that addresses perceived support from family, friends and significant others. It has
      established reliability and is related to CHD.

      Health quality of life Health Status Questionnaire, Short Form (SF-36). The SF-36 (Ware &amp;
      Sherbourne, 1992) is a 36-item instrument with 8 multi-item scales: (1) physical functioning;
      (2) social functioning; (3) role limitations due to physical health problems; (4) role
      limitations due to personal or emotional problems; (5) general mental health; (6) vitality;
      (7) bodily pain; and (8) general health perceptions. Subscale reliabilities have been above
      0.8 in multiple population studies conducted on adults. It has successfully been used to
      evaluate functional status in depressed, chronically ill, and healthy individuals (Wells et
      al., 1989).

      Intervention. In the present project all participants: (a) will meet diagnostic criteria for
      major depressive disorder, unless currently prescribed an antidepressant medication and have
      both a prior diagnosis of depression and current BDI score &gt;11. It should be noted that a
      patient with type 2 diabetes has approximately the same risk of an MI as a patient who has
      already had an MI but does not have diabetes (Haffner et al., 1998).

      During the study half of the participants, all of whom are depressed, will be randomized to
      the CALM-D intervention and half into standard care.

      The CALM-D intervention consists of 17 sessions. The first 4 sessions meet weekly. Sessions 1
      and 2 are individual sessions in which counselor and participant get to know one another and
      build rapport. They also provide the participant with the opportunity to ask questions,
      describe potential barriers and express reservations. Sessions 3 and 4, which also meet
      weekly, encourage participants to get to know one another and deal with issues concerning
      diet and medication adherence. After the first 4 weekly sessions, participants meet for 4
      biweekly sessions followed by 9 monthly sessions. One week prior to each bi-weekly and
      monthly session, the therapist will call to remind the participant of the next meeting and
      request that the participant wear the accelerometer and fill-out the food diary daily until
      the upcoming session. Immediately prior to each CALM-D intervention session, the participant
      is weighed, accelerometer results are recorded and the food diary is turned in. Upon initial
      randomization into the intervention condition and again during session 1, the participant is
      told that he or she is invited to ask a partner, family member living in the household or a
      friend to come to the intervention sessions. The topic for each session are shown in Table
      D.3.9.

      The objectives of the intervention are for participants to: a) lose 7% of their weight
      through healthy eating; (b) do 2.5 hrs of brisk, physical activity each wk (e.g., walk
      briskly for 30 min 5x per week); (c) manage stress better (e.g., through coping strategies;
      deep breathing); and (d) always take their medication. Participants are also taught how to
      fill out a food diary.

      At the outset of the intervention the counselor will discuss the effects of excess weight on
      diabetes and how complications of diabetes can be decreased with improved diet and increased
      activity level. In terms of diet, participants are taught how to: use a fat counter and read
      labels; weigh and measure foods; eat less fat; change eating habits to better match the food
      pyramid; choose healthy eating behaviors; make healthy food choices when eating out; and
      relate calorie balance to weight loss. To promote physical activity participants discuss:
      current activity level; benefits of being more active; possible activities that can be
      undertaken regularly; how to overcome barriers to activity; and ways to prevent injury. The
      participants also learn how to use an accelerometer. Later in the program patients learn the
      definition of aerobic fitness and its relationship to frequency, intensity, time and type of
      activity. Ways to add interest and variety to activity plans are also discussed.

      As a precursor to learning how to manage stress, participants are taught how to identify
      types of negative thinking and the relationships among thoughts, emotions and ways to curb
      emotional eating. The counselor also stimulates discussion on how failure to take prescribed
      antidepressants can lead to mood related physical inactivity and other unhealthy health
      behaviors (e.g., excessive alcohol use; overeating). Participants are taught how to: assess
      if negative thoughts are accurate; replace inaccurate negative thoughts with accurate
      thoughts; handle situations in which one can't fix the problem; identify sources of emotional
      and tangible support and use them effectively; prevent stress; and cope with stress. The
      intervention also deals with the need for handling lapses and relapses regarding diet,
      physical activity, depression, and medication adherence. Participants are taught to identify
      high-risk situations and early warning signs as well as how to use adaptive coping
      strategies.

      Specific strategies to achieve the weight loss goal. A weight loss goal of 7% is set, which
      should lead to a loss of 7-21 lbs within 24 weeks. Participants will be weighed in private at
      each session and this will be recorded on the weight graph in each participant's notebook.
      Participants will be encouraged, if possible, to weigh themselves outside of the study
      venues. A total fat intake goal will be set based upon 25% total calories from fat. A total
      caloric intake goal will also be set. Daily self-monitoring of food intake (fat and calories)
      will be requested of participants with food measuring tools and a fat and calorie counter
      will be provided. A more simplified form of self-monitoring will be provided for participants
      with very limited reading and math skills.

      Specific strategies to achieve the physical activity goal. A physical activity goal of 700
      kilocalories per week (or 2.5 hours of moderate activity) is set in a step-wise fashion to be
      reached in 5-weeks. Another goal is to reach 10,000 steps per week recorded on the
      accelerometer. Participants will be asked to maintain daily physical activity records in
      their diaries based on information from the accelerometer. Sites at which physical activity
      can be safely and effectively undertaken will be identified for each participant, based on
      their residence.

      Specific strategies to achieve the medication adherence goals. Participants list all of the
      medications they take and keep this list in a notebook. The purpose of each medication is
      explained to the participant as well as the reasons for always taking the medication each day
      as prescribed. Participants are encouraged to develop the habit of taking their medications
      as prescribed at the same time each day. Discussions about handling weekends, going on
      vacation, etc. are discussed during intervention sessions. Reminders about taking medications
      are offered at each session and each phone call. Refills of medications are carefully
      tracked. When participants report that they are running low on a medication they are
      encouraged to obtain refills promptly. Reported side effects of medications are carefully
      monitored and attempts made to determine if the side effects are easily remedied (e.g., take
      just before bedtime, take with breakfast) or are due to not following instructions correctly.
      If necessary the participant is referred to his or her physician for consideration of a
      change in medication.

      Counselors and their supervision. The counselors we propose to use in this intervention are
      licensed Ph.D. Clinical psychologists, who have served as counselors in the post-MI project
      and in the adolescent intervention project of the present program project. Supervision is
      carried out by Dr. Patrice Saab, Ph.D., who helped to develop both of our intervention
      protocols, and received supervisory training from the Beck Institute in conjunction with the
      ENRICHD trial and by Dr. Ronald Goldberg, M.D., who was the P.I. of the Miami site for the
      DPP. Based on weekly reviews of audiotaped sessions, Dr. Saab will determine, using a
      protocol check list, intervention adherence to the manual, point out any drift or lack of
      fidelity to the protocol and offer professional suggestions on how to remediate problems.
      Using standards developed in DPP, Dr. Goldberg will assure that counselors are adhering to
      protocol with regard to such issues as using a fat counter, weighing and measuring foods,
      using the food pyramid and supervising exercise and food diary homework. Weekly supervision
      is an institutionalized component of all of our intervention programs.

      Study hypotheses related to Primary aims and their association. In accordance with the
      specific aims it is hypothesized that:

      (From Primary Aim 1). Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show
      significantly greater improvement in BDI depression scores compared to participants in the SC
      condition.

      The greater improvement in BDI score in the CALM-D than in the SC condition will be mediated
      by increased medication adherence and improved coping skills by CALM-D participants.

      (From Primary Aim 2). Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show
      significantly greater weight loss than participants in the SC condition.

      The greater weight loss in the CALM-D than in the SC condition will be mediated by decreased
      depression, increased adherence to dietary instructions and increased physical activity.

      (From Primary Aim 3). Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show
      significantly lower HbA1c in the SC condition.

      The greater decrease in HbA1c in the CALM-D than in the SC condition will be mediated by
      greater weight loss, improved nutrition and increased exercise.

      (From Primary Aim 4). Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show
      significantly greater medication adherence than participants in the SC condition.

      The greater increase in anti-depressant medication adherence in the CALM-D than in the SC
      condition will be mediated by improved coping skills and an increase in perceived social
      support.

      The greater increase in adherence to prescribed medications other than anti-depressants in
      the CALM-D than in the SC condition will be mediated by decreased depression and improved
      coping skills.

      Study hypotheses related to secondary aims. In accordance with the study's secondary aims it
      is hypothesized that:

      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show significantly improved insulin
      sensitivity and tolerance to oral glucose challenge compared to participants in the SC
      condition.

      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show improved procoagulation and
      endothelial function and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress compared to participants
      in the SC condition.

      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show improved lipid profiles compared
      to participants in the SC condition.

      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show lower resting blood pressure and
      improved cardiac and vascular function as well as cardiac morphology compared to participants
      in the SC condition.

      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show improved psychosocial functioning
      compared to participants in the SC condition.

      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show improved health quality of life
      compared to participants in the SC condition.

      The greater improvement in improved tolerance to oral glucose challenge, insulin sensitivity,
      procoagulation, oxidative stress, lipid profile, endothelial function, resting blood
      pressure, cardiac and vascular function, cardiac morphology and health quality of life will
      each be associated with decreased waist circumference.

      Statistical analyses. Preliminary analyses. All data will be inspected employing quality
      control procedures. Descriptive statistics will be computed for every study variable to
      ensure that all data values are within expected ranges and to eliminate any data errors that
      may have occurred. If needed, in the event that some of our variables are not normally
      distributed, we will transform these variables using log transformations or use
      non-parametric statistics. A mixed model analysis program (using SAS Proc Mixed) for growth
      models will be used to assess our 4 primary hypotheses. Missing data will be handled using
      the full information likelihood algorithm, which uses all the data available for all
      participants. To assess our secondary hypotheses, structural equation models will be used.
      The secondary analyses will be conducted across several domains, modeled as latent variables.

      Control variables. The stratified randomized block design should lead to comparable groups
      with respect to key variables of interest, namely age, depression level and diabetes control
      at baseline. To the extent that our groups are heterogeneous with respect to these variables,
      they will be included as model covariates to reduce within group variability and increase
      power. Gender and ethnicity may also be included in our models as dummy coded variables.

      Test of our Primary Hypothesis. Because this project involves a longitudinal design with 2
      conditions measured at multiple times we will use mixed modeling to test our primary
      hypothesis. This approach will allow us to compare the SC and CALM-D conditions on the
      trajectory of change on our primary (i.e., BDI, weight, HbA1c, medication adherence)
      variables. Additionally, the mixed model allows us to incorporate relevant covariates into
      our specified models. (See Core D, for a fuller description of our modeling).

      In addition to mixed models, we will use latent growth modeling to assess indirect paths to
      test potential mediators of the relationship between our conditions and outcome variables.
      The program that will be used for these analyses is Mplus (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 1998). We will
      use hypothesis driven tests of mediation. Briefly, we will compare nested models: one with
      direct and indirect paths, and the second with indirect paths only (but without the direct
      path). If the difference between the models (using the χ2 difference test) is not significant
      than we don't need the direct path, and this will support the hypothesis of mediation. For
      example, we will assess whether a significant CALM-D effect on decreasing depression is due
      to increased medication adherence. In Core D we specify how we will combine data across
      projects for tests of mediation.

      Power Analyses Power calculations for the specific aims are included below. All power
      calculations were done using the statistical software nQuery (Elashoff, 2000). Power is
      presented for a two group (intervention vs. control design). In addition to needing to
      calculate the effect of our intervention on the primary endpoint, we are also concerned with
      the need for calculating power for our mediation hypothesis, which we consider to be
      exploratory.

    <description>Participants (Pts) randomized to the lifestyle intervention received a yr long, 17 session intervention. Pts were asked to wear a pedometer and record their food intake for at least the week prior to each session. The first 4 sessions were delivered weekly, followed by 4 sessions delivered biweekly and finally 9 sessions delivered monthly. Each session was approximately 1-2 hrs. At the beginning of each session anthropometric, physical activity and dietary data were collected. Participants were lead in a 5 min deep breathing exercise before the didactic portion of the session began. Sessions targeted a broad range of material related to diet, physical activity, and psychosocial well-being. Participants were given homework assignments to incorporate covered material into their daily lives. Participants randomized to the intervention arm received follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months post randomization.</description>
