      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      rasagiline compared to placebo in PD patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Levodopa has been the mainstay therapy for PD for decades, and it is considered to be one of
      the most effective medications for relief of the symptoms of PD. However, within few months
      to few years the majority of levodopa-treated patients notice a decline in the duration of
      benefit of each dose and develop motor-complications. A major problem is the appearance of
      fluctuations in mobility, cycles of ON and OFF periods. The administration of rasagiline, a
      MAO-B inhibitor, can slow the elimination of the endogenous dopamine supplies or the dopamine
      produced from the exogenous levodopa therapy and may therefore improve ON-OFF fluctuations.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      rasagiline compared to placebo in PD patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa therapy.
