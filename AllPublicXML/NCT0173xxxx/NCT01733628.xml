    <textblock>
      GEI-BEV-2011-02 is a multicenter, post-authorization observational with prospective follow-up
      (EPA-SP) study. Will be involved 137 metastatic breast cancer patients or metastatic
      colorectal cancer. The hypertension will be evaluated as a predictor of efficacy of
      bevacizumab associated with chemotherapy, in terms of progression-free survival (Main
      endpoint).

      The duration of the study will be approximately 42 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HT) is the most common side effect seen in trials of bevacizumab in combination
      with chemotherapy. Based on the hypothesis that the development of hypertension during
      treatment would be an indicative of the successful blockade of the VEGF pathway, different
      studies have explored retrospectively the relationship between hypertension and the results
      of treatment with bevacizumab.

      This study aims to demonstrate the association between hypertension (diagnosed optimally)
      with efficacy to treatment with bevacizumab prospectively and secondly verify if blood
      pressure measures taken at home are a reflection of a diagnosis of hypertension.

      Also have been explored different molecular markers involved in the pathway of VEGF which
      might be used as predictors of response. Therefore, this study includes the collection of
      blood samples (serum or plasma) and tumor tissue of patients included in this study, with the
      aim of exploring biomarkers that correlate with treatment efficacy and toxicity.

      The diagnosis of hypertension (HT) will be performed using a Holter recording, and standard
      blood pressure footage will be collected during the first three cycles of treatment given the
      Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute-NCI CTCAE version 4.0 and the
      guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and Hypertension, 2007.

      Will be collected a sample of primary tumor and blood for patients who previously have
      consented it. Samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis of biomarkers.

      An interim analysis will be conducted to assess the true incidence of hypertension. Based on
      this analysis, will be evaluated the need to recalculate the sample size.

      At the end of the study, will be performed an analysis of correlation of data measured by HTA
      and Holter recording footage with the SLP standard TA. Moreover will be determined in serum,
      plasma and tumor tissue and certain biomarkers to correlate with efficacy to treatment with
      bevacizumab.

Evaluate in tumor tissue biomarkers related to hypertension and angiogenesis (such as genetic variants and differences in the expression levels of VEGF, ARBs, AGTR, among others), and its association with efficacy to treatment with bevacizumab.
Evaluate in genomic DNA genetic variants (in genes such as VEGF, VEGFR1, AGTR, AGT, ACE, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3, GNAS, GNB3, etc.) involved in the development of hypertension secondary to treatment with bevacizumab.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        May only participate in the study patients (women and men) who meet all the following
        criteria:

          1. MCC or MBC patients with chemotherapy and bevacizumab established indication. The
             first line systemic treatment planned for patients with MCC should be based in
             combination chemotherapy (oxaliplatin / irinotecan plus fluoropyrimidine) associated
             with bevacizumab. The first line systemic treatment planned for MBC patients should be
             based on a combination of paclitaxel or capecitabine plus bevacizumab.

          2. Presence of measurable or evaluable disease according to RECIST 1.1, for the
             evaluation of the response to treatment.
