  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination therapy of temozolomide and radiation has been established as the standard
      therapy for the initial treatment of glioblastoma. However, the prognosis for patients with
      recurrent/ refractory glioblastoma is dismal, with a median survival of 3~6 months. There is
      no efficient and standard care at the time of recurrence or progression following
      temozolomide administration. Recently, many clinicians have reassessed the efficacy of
      second-line chemotherapeutic agents such as nitrosoureas for the treatment of
      recurrent/refractory glioblastoma. It is very important that the effect of the agent is
      sustained and the adverse effect is reduced to preserve the quality of life in recurrent
      settings. We have realized that the clinical features of Korean patients are very different
      from those of foreign patients. Therefore, it is mandatory to develop the new strategy for
      the treatment of Korean patients. We modify the PCV chemotherapy in the dose and
      administration schedule of CCNU and procarbazine to reduce the side effect, especially
      hematologic problems. The dose of CCNU is reduced to 75mg/m2 and the interval between CCNU
      and procarbazine is increased. Moreover, vincristine is excluded because BBB permeability of
      vincristine is very poor and the risk of neurotoxicity is high. We introduce the modified PC
      chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of recurrent/refractory glioblastoma, which is the
      first multicenter trial for glioblastoma patients in Korea.
