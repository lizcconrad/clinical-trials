      The aim of the study is to examine the effects of two different levels of PEEP on subsequent
      standard recruitment maneuver.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will examine the effects of two levels of PEEP on subsequent recruitment
      maneuver. In the first group a recruitment maneuver will be performed in patients who are
      ventilated with PEEP level set according to the ARDS network algorithm.

      Patients will then be crossed over to a study arm where another recruitment maneuver will be
      performed while PEEP is adjusted according to esophageal pressure measurements.

    <description>Upon patient recruitment Esophageal balloon will be inserted and esophageal / pleural pressure will be measured. Thereafter, Inspiratory pressures and PEEP will be adjusted according to well established criteria. Inspiratory pressure and PEEP will be adjusted to achieve the best lung compliance possible while not exceeding transpulmonary end Inspiratory pressure of 25 to 30 cm H2O, and at the same time maintaining a positive transpulmonary end expiarory pressure of not more than 5 cm H2O.
A recruitment maneuver with application of 40 cm H2O for up to 40 seconds will be performed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        20 Man and women older than 18 years will be recruited.

        Patients with acute respiratory failure of any cause who are mechanically ventilated
        according to the ARDS network recommendations will be considered for inclusion to the
        study.

        To be included in the study a prerequisite of high peak Inspiratory pressure (plateau
        pressure of 25 to 30 cmH2O) has to be present, and at least one of the following four
        severity inclusion criteria has to be met.

        1 - Low Total Respiratory system compliance (CT), defined as less than 50ml/cmH2O. 2 - PaO2
        /FIO2 ratio of less than 300. 3 - Need for a PEEP greater than 10 cmH2O to maintain SaO2 of
        &gt; 90%. 4 - PCO2 over 60 mmHg, or PH less than 7.2 that is attributed to respiratory
        acidosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with any of the following will be excluded from the study. Previous lung or chest
        wall surgery, previous esophageal surgery, known Achalasia or any other esophageal motility
        or spasm disorder, presence of chest thoracostomy tube, and any significant chest wall
        abnormality such as kyphoskoliosis.
