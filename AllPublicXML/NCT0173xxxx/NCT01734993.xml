  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single arm, interventional, long-term extension (LTE) study
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ, RoActemra/Actemra) in French
      participants with moderate to severe RA who have completed the Week 97 visit of WA22762 LTE
      study (NCT01194414) (EudraCT Number 2010-018375-22). Participants from France, who completed
      the Week 97 visit of the WA22762 LTE study and considered as responders (defined as having
      improvement in disease activity score based on 28-joint count [DAS28] of greater than [&gt;] 1.2
      points) will continue TCZ treatment within this local LTE study for a maximum of 156 weeks of
      subcutaneous (SC) TCZ treatment, or until SC TCZ becomes commercially available, whichever
      occurs first.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 142 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who was administered a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, could be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. A SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or resulted in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included SAEs as well as non-serious AEs.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who was administered a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, could be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. A SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or resulted in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included SAEs as well as non-serious AEs.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included SAEs as well as non-serious AEs. Causality of AEs based on physician’s discretion: certain (AE after drug intake, not explained by other drugs, reaction on drug cessation [DC], relapse on re-intake of drug), probable/likely (AE after drug intake, not explained by other drugs, reaction on DC, no information on re-intake), possible (AE after drug intake, explained by other drugs, no information on DC), unlikely (not related to drug intake time, explained by other drugs). AEs with causality of certain, probable/likely, and possible were considered TCZ related.</description>

Causality of AESIs based on physician’s discretion: certain (AE after drug intake, not explained by other drugs, reaction on DC, relapse on re-intake of drug), probable/likely (AE after drug intake, not explained by other drugs, reaction on DC, no information on re-intake), possible (AE after drug intake, explained by other drugs, no information on DC), unlikely (not related to drug intake time, explained by other drugs). AESIs with causality of certain, probable/likely, and possible were considered TCZ related.</description>

        <description>The DAS 28 ESR score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient’s global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (visual analog scale [VAS]: 0 millimeter [mm] = no disease activity to 100 mm=maximum disease activity) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR in millimeters per hour [mm/hr]). DAS28 was calculated using following formulas: DAS28-ESR = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt (SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PtGA of disease activity. A total possible score of 0 to approximately 10, with higher score indicating more severe disease activity. Completer last visit: Last visit data for participants who completed the study. Last visit: Last visit data for all participants (including those who discontinued prematurely). Early withdrawal: Data at the time of early withdrawal for those participants who discontinued prematurely.</description>

        <description>For SJC, a total of 28 joints were assessed. The presence of a swollen joint was scored as 1 and absence as 0. Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which is ranging from 0 (best possible score or no swollen joint) to 28 (worse possible score or all swollen joints). Lower scores indicate no swollen joint and higher scores indicate worsening swollen joints. Completer last visit: Last visit data for participants who completed the study.

        <description>Clinical remission defined as:DAS28-ESR score &lt; 2.6 and/or SDAI score &lt;/= 3.3.DAS28 score is measure of subject’s disease activity calculated using TJC [28 joints],SJC [28 joints],PtGA of disease activity [ VAS:0mm= no disease activity to 100 mm=maximum disease activity] and ESR (mm/hr). DAS28 was calculated as DAS28-ESR = 0.56*sqrt (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70* ln ESR + 0.014*PtGA of disease activity. DAS28-ESR score ranged from 0 to approximately 10, higher score indicating more severe disease activity. SDAI was calculated =[SJC (28 joints) + TJC (28 joints) + VAS PtGA + VAS physician global assessment of disease activity+CRP level(mg/dL)]. VAS assessments:0 mm=no disease activity to 100 mm=maximum disease activity. SDAI score ranged from 0 to 86, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity.</description>

          <description>Clinical remission defined as:DAS28-ESR score &lt; 2.6 and/or SDAI score &lt;/= 3.3.DAS28 score is measure of subject’s disease activity calculated using TJC [28 joints],SJC [28 joints],PtGA of disease activity [ VAS:0mm= no disease activity to 100 mm=maximum disease activity] and ESR (mm/hr). DAS28 was calculated as DAS28-ESR = 0.56*sqrt (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70* ln ESR + 0.014*PtGA of disease activity. DAS28-ESR score ranged from 0 to approximately 10, higher score indicating more severe disease activity. SDAI was calculated =[SJC (28 joints) + TJC (28 joints) + VAS PtGA + VAS physician global assessment of disease activity+CRP level(mg/dL)]. VAS assessments:0 mm=no disease activity to 100 mm=maximum disease activity. SDAI score ranged from 0 to 86, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI questionnaire measures functional status (disability) and health-related quality of life. It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities over past week. Each question is evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale. Total score for HAQ-DI was the average of all questions and ranges from 0 = without any difficulty to 3 = unable to do. Completer last visit: Last visit data for participants who completed the study. Last visit: Last visit data for all participants (including those who discontinued prematurely). Early withdrawal: Data at the time of early withdrawal for those participants who discontinued prematurely.</description>
