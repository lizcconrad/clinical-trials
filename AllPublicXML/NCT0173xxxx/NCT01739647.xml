  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose study in healthy male and female (of non-child bearing potential)
      volunteers, to assess the safety, effects on the body, and blood and urine drug levels of
      AZD3293. AZD3293 is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease

    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to 10 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. Some questions are yes/no and some are on a scale of 1 (low severity) to 5 (high severity). Completed suicide and non-fatal suicide events are yes/no questions and results presented are the number of participants with these events. Worsening of suicidal ideation was an increase in severity of suicidal ideation from baseline.</description>

Minimum observed plasma concentration (Cmin)
Minimum observed plasma concentration below the individual healthy volunteer baseline (pre-dose biomarker concentration prior to dosing) (ΔCmin)
Time to Cmin (tmin)
Duration (T) of concentration below individual healthy volunteer baseline (BBL), if appropriate for the data (tBBL)
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(0-t))
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 24 hours post dose (AUC(0-24))
Area under the plasma biomarker concentration curve from time zero to 24 hour that is below individual healthy volunteer baseline (ΔAUC(0-24)).</description>
