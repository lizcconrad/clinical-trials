    <textblock>
      The study is being done to compare the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone followed
      by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) and lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone without PBSCT in patients with untreated multiple myeloma. This comparison will
      include how the subjects respond to each study treatment combination, and what side effects
      are caused by each combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell proliferative disorder responsible for 11, 000
      deaths each year in the United States. Approximately one third of myeloma patients develop
      hypercalcemia and about two thirds present with anemia. As the second most common hematologic
      malignancy, myeloma remains incurable. In the last forty years, options for therapy have
      included melphalan-prednisone, anthracyclines, and vinca alkaloids; however, relapse with
      those regimens continues to be inevitable with a median survival of 3 years.

    <description>Subjects will receive the new treatment that will be compared with the standard of care. Lenalidomide and dexamethasone for eight 28-day cycles. After four cycles your stem cells will be collected (stem cell collection).

    <description>Subjects may receive up to the maximum recommended high-dose of cyclophosphamide at 4 gm/m2 intravenously with mesna at a total of 2.4 gm/m2 intravenously or orally divided over 3 doses. Subjects then will receive mobilization using daily filgrastim (G-CSF) at 10 mcg/kg subcutaneously starting 24 hours after cyclophosphamide is completed and until stem cell collection. The use of AMD3100 (Plerixafor) is permitted. Peripheral stem cell collection will be performed at marrow recovery, usually when WBC is &gt;2500 x 109 cells/liter; platelet count is &gt;20 x 103/mm3.</description>
