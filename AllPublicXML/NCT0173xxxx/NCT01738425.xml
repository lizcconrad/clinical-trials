  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase I
      clinical study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of five (5) single and four (4)
      multiple increasing oral doses of GIC-1001 compared to placebo, and to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of GIC-1001 following single and multiple-dose administration in 80 healthy,
      18-50 years old male and female subjects. Moreover, the effect of food on the
      pharmacokinetics of GIC-1001 in healthy subjects will be assessed. This study is designed
      with an integrated, adaptive approach which allows the evaluation of single and multiples
      doses of GIC-1001 in a progressive, overlapped fashion.

    <textblock>
      Each cohort of enrolled healthy volunteers will include a total of eight (8) subjects: Six
      (6) subjects randomized to the active GIC-1001 and two (2) subjects randomized to a matching
      placebo.

      Part 1: Single Doses Cohort A: Single dose of 125 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; Cohort B: Single
      dose of 250 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; Cohort C: Single dose of 375 mg of GIC-1001 or
      placebo; Cohort D: Single dose of 500 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; and Cohort E: Single dose of
      1000 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo. Up to 21 blood samples will be obtained over a 36 hour
      period.

      Part 2: Multiple Doses, three times a day (TID) during 7 consecutive days; Cohort F: Multiple
      doses of 125 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; Cohort G: Multiple doses of 250 mg of GIC-1001 or
      placebo; Cohort H: Multiple doses of 375 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; and Cohort I: Multiple
      doses of 500 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo. Up to 18 blood samples will be obtained over a 7 day
      period.

      Part 3: one single dose of GIC-1001 to be selected for the Food Effect cross-over evaluation.
      A total of 16 blood samples will be obtained over a 36 hour period.

      Physical exams, 24 hour cardiac monitoring, and a complete battery of biochemical and
      hematological lab tests will be done to assess the safety and tolerability of GIC-1001 in all
      dosing cohorts.

    <description>Blood samples will be obtained over a 36 hour period in the single dose portion of the study and over 7 days, every morning prior to GIC-1001, as well as 8 hours post-last dose in the multiple dosing phase. Main absorption and disposition parameters using a non-compartmental approach will be measured.
For GIC-1001 and its metabolites, the pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for the single dose regimens will be Cmax, AUC0-8, AUCT, AUC∞, Tmax, AUCT/∞, Kel, T½el, Cl/F and Vd/F. The parameters Cmax, AUC0-8, AUCT and AUC∞ will be dose-normalized, and their natural logarithm will be calculated. The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for the multiple dose regimens will be Cmax, Tmax, AUCτ, Cmin, Cpds, Fluctuation and Swing. The parameters Cmax, AUCτ and Cmin will be dose-normalized, and the natural logarithm of Cmax, AUCτ, Cmin and Cpds of will be calculated. For hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate, the pharmacokinetic parameters of interest will be Cmax, Tmax and AUC0-4.</description>

    <description>Safety and Tolerability Monitoring: During Single Ascending Dosing only, continuous cardiac monitoring will be performed from approximately 1 hour prior to drug administration until at least 23 hours post-dose.
In cases where the alarm activation of the monitoring system takes place for notification of concerns and/or rhythm changes, a rhythm strip will be printed and filed as source data. These occurrences will be followed up through further medical investigation, and/or filing of AEs.
Any interruption of the patient monitoring due to clinical activities or else will be documented.</description>
