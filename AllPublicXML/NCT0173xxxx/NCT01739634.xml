  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhea in patients with MTC (Medullary Thyroid Cancer) can be debilitating and, in some
      cases life threatening. Findings in such patients include volume depletion, renal
      insufficiency, and electrolyte disorders. Diarrhea can also lead to increased cost of care,
      reduced quality of life, and treatment delays. Not all patients benefit from conventional
      anti-diarrheal therapy. CASAD is proven to reduce diarrhea in humans and animals. Clays have
      water-binding effects, increase the absorptive capacity of the intestinal mucosa, and absorb
      the excess cytokines which are possible mechanisms of diarrhea in MTC. In this study, we will
      investigate if starting 1 g CASAD three times a day will ameliorate the severity of diarrhea
      in patients with MTC. Diarrhea in patients with MTC can be debilitating and, in some cases
      life threatening. Findings in such patients include volume depletion, renal insufficiency,
      and electrolyte disorders. We hypothesize that adding CASAD 3 grams/day will reduce the
      incidence and ameliorate the severity of diarrhea in patients with MTC.
