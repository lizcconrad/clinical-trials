        <description>Change in ankle brachial index (ABI) / toe brachial index (TBI).
Ankle brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of blood pressures from the ankle and arm and is used for diagnosing peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD):
Normal: 1 to 1.29 Borderline: 0.91 to 0.99 Mild PAOD: 0.71 to 0.90 Medium severe PAOD: 0.41 to 0.7 Severe PAOD: &lt;0.4
Toe brachial index (TBI) is the ratio between the toe pressure and the higher brachial pressure, used for diagnosing PAOD when the ABI cannot be used:
Normal: &gt;0.7 Mild: 0.5-0.7 Moderate: 0.35-0.5 Moderate-Severe: &lt;0.35 and toe pressure 40 mmHg Severe: &lt;0.35 and toe pressure &lt; 30 mmHg</description>
