  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and changes of
      neurohormonal markers of fimasartan and atenolol with exaggerated blood pressure response
      during exercise in essential hypertensive patients.

      After subjects have signed informed consent voluntarily, when they are taking hypertension
      medication, they go through screening period for 7 days including wash-out period.

      After screening and wash-out period, subjects take the placebo for 14 days (Maximum 21 days),
      and evaluate their suitability to Inclusion and Exclusion criteria.

      Patients, who evaluated the proper subject for this clinical trial, are allocated to
      experimental group (Fimasartan 60mg) or Control group (Atenolol 50mg) randomly at a ratio 1:1
      and their investigational drugs will be administered daily for the study period (8 weeks).
      Subjects visit their investigators twice during treatment period, when they take their
      investigational drugs for 4 weeks, and 8 weeks.

      The placebo period will be single-blinded and the treatment allocation in this study will be
      double-blinded.
