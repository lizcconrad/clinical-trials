    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to assess the impact of nutritional support guided by repeated
      measurements of REE in geriatric patients following surgery for hip fractures.

      Our hypothesis is that tight caloric control will reduce the risk of significant
      postoperative complications in geriatric patients following surgery for hip fractures.

      Study Design :Prospective, Single center, Randomized, Unblinded study. Study
      Population:geriatric patients following surgery for hip fractures.

      The primary outcome:

      presence of postoperative complications,hospital length of stay.

      Secondary outcomes:

      energy intake and calculated energy balance

      Study Procedure:

      eligible patients will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: the tight calorie
      (intervention)group and the control group.

IC measurements:after a fasting period of at least 6 hours at three time periods : on admission to the study,between 24-48 hours following surgery and on the 7th day of the study.Measurements were performed by an experienced nurse or dietician,the device was automatically calibrated before each measurement and the REE was recorded after 15 minutes.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        patients older than 65 years who were admitted to the unit following hip fracture within 48
        hours of the injury and in whom orthopedic surgery was considered the treatment of choice.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients were excluded if they presented to hospital &gt; 48 hours after the injury, were
        receiving steroids and/or immunosuppression therapy; in the presence of active oncologic
        disease, multiple fractures, diagnosed dementia or in the event that patients required
        supplemental nasal oxygen which precludes the measurement of resting energy expenditure.
