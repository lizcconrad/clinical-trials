      The trial will compare exercises using Therabite® versus wooden spatulas to prevent or
      relieve trismus in patients with stage 3 and 4 oral/oropharyngeal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trismus is defined as a tightening of jaw opening. The negative impact of Trismus on the
      quality of life of head and neck cancer patients is well established. It affects eating,
      drinking, speaking and social function and is often as debilitating as any disfigurement
      resulting from treatment.

      The use of jaw exercises using a Therabite appliance following treatment has been shown to
      reduce the level of Trismus in small studies. Many UK centres, however, use stacked wooden
      spatulas inserted between the incisors as a means of passive exercise. There is anecdotal
      evidence that suggests the use of exercises prior to treatment may help reduce the severity
      of the Trismus experienced by the patient.

      This study will enrol 112 head and neck cancer patients allocated by chance to use either the
      Therabite or wooden spatula and patients will be asked to perform mouth exercises on a daily
      basis for 6 months.

      There is a need to evaluate both the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
      Therabite as opposed to wooden spatulas to determine whether they should be adopted as
      standard care in head and neck cancer patients.

      In this pilot trial, the investigators will measure benefits of Therabite to patients, as
      compared to usual care with wooden spatulas. Mouth opening will be the key outcome for the
      study.

        operative chemoradiotherapy

          -  All patients will receive 60-70 Gy in 30-35 fractions over 6 to 7 weeks to the region
