    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies sorafenib tosylate and stereotactic body radiation
      therapy to see how well they work compared to sorafenib tosylate alone in treating patients
      with liver cancer. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send
      the radiation dose directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving
      sorafenib tosylate together with stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves overall survival in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the difference in time to progression (TTP) and progression-free survival
      (PFS) in HCC patients treated with sorafenib compared to SBRT followed by sorafenib.

      II. To measure differences in toxicity in HCC patients treated with sorafenib versus SBRT
      followed by sorafenib.

      III. To measure vascular thrombosis response post sorafenib versus SBRT followed by
      sorafenib.

      IV. To measure differences in health related quality of life (QOL) and quality-adjusted
      survival in HCC patients treated with sorafenib compared to SBRT followed by sorafenib.

      V. Collection of biospecimens for future correlative studies to investigate differences in
      potential biomarkers in patients treated with sorafenib versus SBRT followed by sorafenib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM 1: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients undergo SBRT every 24-72 hours for a total of 5 fractions over 5 to 15 days.
      Within 1-5 days post-SBRT, patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly during SBRT, monthly during sorafenib tosylate and on the
      following schedule as a whole from study entry: every 3 months for 3 years, then every 6
      months for 2 years and then annually.
