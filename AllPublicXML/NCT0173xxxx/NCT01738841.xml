  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect data on the safety of the MMRV vaccine (Priorix-Tetra™) used in
      routine practice in children aged 12 months to 12 years living in the Philippines.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participating physicians will enroll only those subjects for whom they would prescribe
      Priorix-Tetra in the course of their normal clinical practice.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Local authorities no longer require routine PMS studies; GSK does not believe the study would
    add meaningfully to the safety data already available for MMRV.
