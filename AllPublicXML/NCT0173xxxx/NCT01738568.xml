  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with a loss of brain function and conditions such as dementia and
      Alzheimer's disease. It is likely that decreased brain metabolism is contributing to the
      progression of age related degenerative diseases. Aerobic exercise training can increase
      brain volumes and is associated with decreased risk for degenerative brain conditions.
      However, little is know about the changes that occur to brain metabolism with aerobic
      training and aging.
