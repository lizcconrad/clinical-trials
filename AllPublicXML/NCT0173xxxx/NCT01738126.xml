      This K01 application is designed to prepare the applicant with the skills necessary to
      establish an independent research program on pain--related processing in the cerebellum.
      Although pain studies using functional imaging in humans consistently find cerebellar
      activation, the role of this structure during pain is unknown. In such studies, speculation
      regarding the cerebellum's function during a painful event is often influenced by its
      reputation as a coordinator of motor function, though animal studies have indicated that it
      may also modulate the neural encoding of noxious stimuli. The candidate has published work
      that indicates a functional dichotomy in the way the cerebellum responds to experimental pain
      in healthy subjects and neuropathic pain patients. This suggests that the cerebellum has been
      overlooked as a potential pain processing area, and research into this area could lend
      invaluable insight into the basic physiological circuitry involved with pain and its
      modulation.

      The hypothesis of this project is that the cerebellum serves as an integrator of aversive
      stimuli and adaptive motor behavior, and may modulate the emotional and cognitive experience
      that distinguishes the perception of pain from the appreciation of innocuous sensory
      stimulation. A human trigeminal model of experimental pain will be used, as all the
      pain--‚Äêrelated circuitry involved can be imaged along with the cerebellum at the same time.
      The specific aims are (1) to map cerebellar activations related to sensory coding of noxious
      stimuli and to correlate functional activity with anatomical connectivity using functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); (2) to distinguish
      between pain and its anticipation based on cerebellar responses and connectivity; and (3) to
      determine whether physical pain and aversive images engage similar circuitry in the
      cerebellum. To accomplish these aims, the candidate will need to expand his background in
      fMRI of cortical and brainstem pain processing to encompass cerebellar physiology, become
      proficient in DTI analysis, and learn the white matter connectivity to and from the
      cerebellum. The research environment at McLean Hospital and the other affiliates of the
      Harvard Medical School system will provide the candidate with the resources to reach his aims
      within 4 years.
