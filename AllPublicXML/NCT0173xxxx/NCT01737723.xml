      Inclusion criteria study population Age &gt; 18 years old. Acute stroke symptoms onset within
      120 hours of inclusion, and as proximate to event as possible.

      Acute ischemic moderate or severe hemispheric stroke (assessed as 5 points or more by NIHSS)
      and including patients treated by t-PA

      Exclusion criteria study population Primary intracranial hemorrhage on admission by CT.
      Significant movement disorder. Previous major hemispheric stroke. Local skull or skin
      affliction which prevents electrodes application. Any known condition which in the opinion of
      the investigator may interfere with the protocol implementation.
