      The purpose of this study is to compare two different medicines to treat babies with opiate
      withdrawal. The treatment medicines are morphine, which is an opiate, and clonidine, a
      non-opiate. Morphine is a narcotic medicine, with is included in most pain killers. Clonidine
      is another drug, but is different from morphine. It is also used for babies, and even adults
      for withdrawal symptoms. Both drugs are effective, but the purpose of this study is to see if
      one may be better than the other.

      Withdrawal from drugs, called Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), is a group of symptoms that
      occurs to babies whose mother took or used drugs (prescription, addicting, illegal, pain
      pills, or drugs for addiction treatment) during pregnancy. Medicines the mother takes while
      pregnant, the baby also takes. Babies may experience withdrawal after delivery, and may need
      treatment. There are different ways to treat babies with withdrawal - about 50% of doctors
      use morphine, an opiate, to treat these babies, the rest uses other drugs, like clonidine and
      phenobarbitol.

    <measure>Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Mean of total Finnegan Scores obtained every 3 hours on days 2, 7, and 14 following start of treatment; A score is a number representing the total score or sum from 21 items or symptoms or manifestations of opiate withdrawal in newborn infants. The total score ranges from 0 to 43. Reference: 1. Finnegan LP, Connaughton JF, Jr., Kron RE, et al. Neonatal abstinence syndrome: assessment and management. Addict Dis 1975;2(1-2):141-58. Although normal newborn may manifest mild symptoms that will give scores in the range of 0 to 7. A score of 8 consecutively obtained times 3 indicate that infant will benefit from treatment, in this study morphine or clonidine. A decrease in scores especially to less than 8 is suggestive of a good response to treatment.</description>

    <measure>Neurobehavioral Performance Summary Scores From the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 days after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>The summary scores from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) give a measure of infant neurobehavior in the following areas (score range): habituation (1-9), regulation (2.20-7.50), attention (1.29 -8.4), Handling (0 - 1), quality of movement (1.20 - 6.20), Non-optimal reflexes (0-12), Asymmetric reflexes (0-7), arousal (2.43 - 6.67), hypertonicity (0- 8), hypotonicity (0 - 5.0), excitability (0-11), lethargy (0 - 11.0). and stress/abstinence (0. - 0.57). A higher score for each item means a higher level of the construct. For example, a higher score for hypertonicity means the infant is more hypertonic and higher score on hypotonicity means the infant is more hypotonic. No cut-off score published for normal or abnormal behavioral performance. Reference: Lester BM et al.

    <time_frame>1 year of life</time_frame>
    <description>Scores obtained Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition in the developmental domains of motor, cognitive, and language. This tool for measures of motor, cognitive and language development is a series of standardized measurements and for each domain, the standardized scores have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. Scores below 1 standard deviation (= or less than 84) is considered below normal. Scores above 1 standard deviation (over 115) represent higher than normal functioning in each domain The score for each domain (motor, cognitive, and language functioning) represents the full-scale score</description>

        <title>Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System</title>
        <description>Mean of total Finnegan Scores obtained every 3 hours on days 2, 7, and 14 following start of treatment; A score is a number representing the total score or sum from 21 items or symptoms or manifestations of opiate withdrawal in newborn infants. The total score ranges from 0 to 43. Reference: 1. Finnegan LP, Connaughton JF, Jr., Kron RE, et al. Neonatal abstinence syndrome: assessment and management. Addict Dis 1975;2(1-2):141-58. Although normal newborn may manifest mild symptoms that will give scores in the range of 0 to 7. A score of 8 consecutively obtained times 3 indicate that infant will benefit from treatment, in this study morphine or clonidine. A decrease in scores especially to less than 8 is suggestive of a good response to treatment.</description>

        <title>Neurobehavioral Performance Summary Scores From the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS)</title>
        <description>The summary scores from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) give a measure of infant neurobehavior in the following areas (score range): habituation (1-9), regulation (2.20-7.50), attention (1.29 -8.4), Handling (0 - 1), quality of movement (1.20 - 6.20), Non-optimal reflexes (0-12), Asymmetric reflexes (0-7), arousal (2.43 - 6.67), hypertonicity (0- 8), hypotonicity (0 - 5.0), excitability (0-11), lethargy (0 - 11.0). and stress/abstinence (0. - 0.57). A higher score for each item means a higher level of the construct. For example, a higher score for hypertonicity means the infant is more hypertonic and higher score on hypotonicity means the infant is more hypotonic. No cut-off score published for normal or abnormal behavioral performance. Reference: Lester BM et al.

        <title>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition</title>
        <description>Scores obtained Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition in the developmental domains of motor, cognitive, and language. This tool for measures of motor, cognitive and language development is a series of standardized measurements and for each domain, the standardized scores have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. Scores below 1 standard deviation (= or less than 84) is considered below normal. Scores above 1 standard deviation (over 115) represent higher than normal functioning in each domain The score for each domain (motor, cognitive, and language functioning) represents the full-scale score</description>

            <title>Morphine</title>
            <description>Initial dose is 0.4mg/kg/day, divided every 3-4 hours, given PO with feeds. Drug is required until symptoms of withdrawal no longer cause the infant feeding, behavior, or elimination problems, up to 3 months.
Morphine: Start at 0.4mg/kg/day (divided every 3-4 hours, given with feeds. Dose may be increased 25% of initial dose until symptoms are stable, up to 1 mg/kg/day.
Once stable for 72 hrs, weaning may begin (decrease 10% of max dose, every other day). When total dose is &lt;0.1mg/kg/day, may discontinue.</description>

            <description>Dose is started at 5 mcg/kg/day, given PO with feeds, divided every 3-4 hours. Drug is required until symptoms of withdrawal no longer cause the infant feeding, behavior, or elimination problems, up to 3 months.
Clonidine: Initial dose is 5 mcg/kg/day (divided every 3-4 hrs, given with feeds). Will increase 25% of initial dose every 12-24 hrs until stable, up to 12 mcg/kg/day. Dose is unchanged for 72 hours once stable, then may decrease by 10% every other day. If re-escalation is required, the previous dose may be used with 72 hours for stabilizing.</description>
