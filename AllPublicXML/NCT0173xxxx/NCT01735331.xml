    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is determine vascular endothelial growth factor levels and
      angiogenesis/vascularity from hysteroscopic endometrial biopsies which taken from patients
      who has Recurrent Pregnancy Loss.The endometrial vascular endothelial growth factor levels
      will be measured by immunohistochemical staining methods due to office hysteroscopic
      endometrial biopsy after the menstruation at follicular phase of menstrual cycle.

      This study is a prospective,observational,single-center study.Ethical approval was obtained
      from the Institutional Review Board.This study will be completed 30 patients with Habitual
      Abortus.

      Endometrial vascular endothelial growth factor levels will be measured using Flk-1 / Kinase
      Domain Receptor / Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, Ab-1 (Rabbit PAb), Vascular
      Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Ab-7 (VG1), Cluster of Differentiation 34 (Endothelial Cell
      Marker) Ab-1 (QBEnd/10), Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (N-term) (FLT1)
      antibody kits. All assays will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
