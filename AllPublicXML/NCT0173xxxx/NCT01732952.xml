      This cross-sectional, non-interventional, and observational study will assess the lipid
      profile of patients who have been taking lipid-modifying drugs (i.e., proportion of patients
      achieving treatment to goal according to national and international lipid management
      guidelines) during a single visit to their physicians on an outpatient basis in 6
      representative geo-economic regions in China: Northeast, North, East, South, Southwest, and
      Northwest; and within each region, in three tiers of hospitals: tier 3 (primary or teaching
      hospitals), tier 2 (secondary or city level hospitals), and tier 1 (community
      hospitals/health centers). The investigators will primarily be cardiologists,
      endocrinologists, neurologists, gerontologists, internists, or other physicians who are
      representative of the general population of physicians managing patients with dyslipidemia
      and/or at high risk for cardiovascular events likely to be treated with lipid-modifying
      drugs. Demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, a history of cardiovascular disease and
      cardiovascular treatments will be documented in a single visit through patient clinical
      examination and chart review.

      DYSIS-China is part of a string of epidemiological studies that share the same master
      protocol, which has been conducted in different countries mainly in Europe and Canada. The
      analysis of the pooled studies including overall data and cross-country comparisons is the
      subject of a distinct protocol.
