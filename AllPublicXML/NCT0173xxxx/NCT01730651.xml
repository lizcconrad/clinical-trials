      This phase II study of high dose intensity modulated radiation therapy in the cervical cancer
      with metastatic lymphadenopathies at initial diagnosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymph node (LN) involvement in cervical cancer is a poor prognostic factor(1). Although lymph
      node evaluation is not a part of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
      (FIGO) staging system(2), it is generally performed as one of the initial workup of patients
      with cervical cancer by use of modern imaging tools for accurate evaluation of the disease
      extent and possible treatment adjustment. Kidd et al reported the positron emission
      tomography with [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET)-positive lymph node rate is 47% at
      diagnosis in 560 patients. They also showed that within a stage, patients with PET-positive
      lymph nodes had significantly worse disease specific survival than those with PET-negative
      lymph nodes (p&lt;0.001)(3).

      Historically, dose escalation to the pelvic or para-aortic metastatic lymphadenopathies was
      not given as much attention as primary uterine cervical lesion partly because of the expected
      increased risk of bowel toxicity with when conventional radiotherapy technique was used.
      Unlike for the head and neck cancer where intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or
      tomotherapy was actively used for treatment of large lymphadenopathies and shown to produce
      improved disease control(4, 5) , there are few similar studies for cervical cancer. It is
      well known that more than 60 Gy10 2Gy equivalent dose (EQD2, α/β=10 Gy) is needed to control
      the gross tumor sized of 10 mm, containing 109 cells, according to the logarithmic cell
      killing(6). Theoretically, pelvic and para-aortic LNs (PAN) could not be controlled with the
      dose of 45-50 Gy10 EQD2, and we need to escalate the dose as much as possible with new
      radiation technology.

      In the current is study, we evaluate the LNs control rate, toxicity rate, progression-free
      survival and overall survival in cervical cancer patients with lymphadenopathies and treated
      with high dose intensity modulated radiation therapy
