    <textblock>
      Due to continuing technological progress and better understanding of the needs for glucose
      monitoring, the performance requirements of blood glucose meters, primarily regarding their
      accuracy, are constantly debated and keep evolving as a consequence. Recently a discussion
      was initiated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to improve the accuracy of BG meters
      in the point-of-care testing setting by asking for fulfilment of higher requirements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.
             Trial-related activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the trial,
             including activities to determine suitability for the trial.

          2. Male or female subjects aged 18-74 years (both inclusive).

          3. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (as diagnosed clinically) ≥ 12 months.

          4. Body mass index 18.0-28.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive).

          5. HbA1c ≤ 9.0 % by local laboratory analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to lancet fingerpricks / needle injections.

          2. Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as having performed at
             least one BG meter measurement as part of the study.

          3. Receipt of any investigational medicinal product within 30 days before randomisation
             in this trial.

          4. Formation of callus on the fingertips or any other skin condition that may hamper
             fingerprick blood sampling and/or insufficient capillary blood volume sampling (&lt; 50
             μL) during test fingerprick(s).

          5. Haemoglobin &lt; 8.0 mmol/L (male) or &lt; 6.4 mmol/L (female), total leukocyte count &lt; 3.0
             x 109/L, thrombocytes &lt;100 x 109/L, serum creatinine levels ≥ 126 μmol/L (male) or ≥
             111 μmol/L (female), bilirubin &gt; 3x the upper limit of normal (ULN), and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
             and gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) &gt; 2 x ULN.

          6. Suffer from or history of a life threatening disease (i.e. cancer except basal cell
             skin cancer or squamous cell skin cancer), or any clinically significant respiratory,
             metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrinological (with the exception of
             diabetes mellitus and euthyroid struma), haematological, dermatological, venereal, -
