      The investigators performed a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eriobotyra Japonica Lindley Extract on
      improvement of Memory Function. The investigators measured decrement of improvement of Memory
      Function, including K-MMSE, Rey-Kim Memory Test, BCRS, and PRMQ, and monitored their blood
      pressure.
