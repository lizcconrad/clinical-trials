  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this pilot study is to collect preliminary data regarding the
      variability of weight gain associated with lurasidone (Latuda©) treatment of antipsychotic
      naive children and adolescents in order to inform decisions about including a lurasidone arm
      in a future large scale trial of different approaches to minimize antipsychotic associated
      weight gain in the pediatric population. In adults, lurasidone appears to cause minimal
      weight gain. The participants will be 6-19 years old with psychotic spectrum, mood spectrum,
      or autism spectrum disorders. They will have 4 weeks or less of lifetime antipsychotic
      exposure.

      This is a multi-site, 12-week, open-label study assessing the weight and metabolic changes
      associated with lurasidone treatment. Antipsychotic (AP) naive subjects will start open-label
      treatment by following a flexible titration schedule. Quasi-antipsychotic naive subjects
      (less than 4 weeks of total AP treatment) will be started on lurasidone and tapered off the
      other antipsychotic over an estimated 4 weeks depending on the dose and tolerability of the
      prior antipsychotic. Other psychoactive medications including antidepressants,
      benzodiazepines, stimulants, alpha-2 agonists, and mood stabilizers are allowed as long as
      the dose is not changed, unless it is clinically necessary. Assessments of weight, efficacy,
      and side effects are conducted at baseline, week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12. The primary
      outcome is percent change in weight. The secondary outcomes include psychiatric efficacy
      measures and side effects.

    <description>Efficacy measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) total score which focuses on problem behaviors in five subdomains, including irritability, attention, repetitive behaviors, unusual speech, and social withdrawal. Differences in subdomains were not assessed. The ABC-C total score is the sum of 58 items, each rated among 0 = Not at all; 1 = Slight in degree; 2 = Moderately serious; and 3 = Severe in degree. The ABC-C total score ranges from 0 to 174. Higher values of ABC-C total scores represent greater severity of illness.</description>

Differences in subdomains were not assessed. The ABC-C total score is the sum of 58 items, each rated among 0 = Not at all; 1 = Slight in degree; 2 = Moderately serious; and 3 = Severe in degree. The ABC-C total score ranges from 0 to 174. Higher values of ABC-C total scores represent greater severity of illness.</description>
