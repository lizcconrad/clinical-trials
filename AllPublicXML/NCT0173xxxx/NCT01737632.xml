    <textblock>
      The fundamental objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an intensive
      in-home family-based treatment, Multidimensional Family Therapy, with a multifaceted
      residential treatment, Adolescent Residential Treatment, over 4 years post-intake and to
      delineate the mechanisms of change for each treatment. The study targets dually- diagnosed
      adolescent drug abusers recommended for residential treatment.

      Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of residential treatment with outpatient, family-based
      treatment multiple outcomes including substance use, mental health, school functioning,
      family function and delinquency among dually diagnosed adolescents.

      Hypothesis 1. From intake to 2 months, residential treatment will show better outcomes than
      the family based treatment. Between 2 months and 18 months, family based treatment will show
      better outcomes than residential. Between 18 months and four years post intake, outpatient
      family based treatment will maintain its treatment gains, while the residential treatment
      condition will show an increase in these same symptoms and behaviors.

      Aim 2: To examine the relationship between predictors (family, peer, educational/vocational
      functioning and involvement in post-treatment services), and outcomes (drug use, co-morbid
      symptoms, and criminal behavior) during the four-year post intake period.

      Hypothesis 2a. Family functioning, educational/vocational functioning, and peer relationships
      measured at discharge will predict drug use, co-morbid symptoms, and criminal behaviors
      though the four year longer term follow up period.

      Hypothesis 2b. Family functioning, educational/vocational functioning, peer relationships,
      and involvement in post-treatment services during the post treatment period will predict drug
      use, co-morbid symptoms, and criminal behavior through the longer term follow up period.

      Research Question 1. Is the rate of change in family functioning, educational/vocational
      functioning, peer relationships, and involvement in post-treatment services related to the
      rate of change in drug use, co-morbid symptoms, and criminal behavior?

    <description>The Adolescent Treatment Program (ATP) is a residential dual diagnosed substance abuse treatment program that is staff secure. It is based on a social learning approach which emphasizes positive reinforcement for appropriate coping behavior and social skills, and incorporates a &quot;levels&quot; system which allocates privileges and responsibilities according to the individual's behavioral capacities.</description>

    <description>The Adolescent Treatment Program targets the adolescent's abuse or dependency on chemicals while simultaneously treating the comorbid symptomatology found in dual diagnosed patients. These goals are accomplished by using four primary forms of intervention: (1) Chemical Education; (2) Group, Individual and Family Counseling; (3) Twelve Step Work; and 4) Psychotropic Medication for Clinical Symptomatology Comorbid with Substance Abuse.</description>
