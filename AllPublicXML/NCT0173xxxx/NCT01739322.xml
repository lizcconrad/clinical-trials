  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the biologic activity of a Platanus acerifolia
      allergen extract in histamine equivalent prick (HEP) units, in order to be used as in-house
      reference preparation (IHRP).

      This is an open, unblinded and non-randomized biological assay. The study design is a slight
      modification of the recommendations proposed by the Nordic Guidelines.

      Four concentrations of Platanus acerifolia allergen extract, together with a positive and
      negative control, using 10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride solution and a glycerinated phenol
      saline solution, respectively, will be tested in every patient in duplicate on the volar
      surface of the forearm.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent, appropriately signed and dated by the
             subject (or legal representative, if applicable).

          -  Subject can be male or female of any race and ethnic group.

          -  Age &gt; and =18 years and &lt; and =60 years at the study inclusion day.

          -  Positive skin prick test with a standardized commercially available preparation of
             Platanus acerifolia allergen extract. The skin prick test will be considered positive
             if the test results in a wheal major diameter of at least 3 mm or an area at least 7
             mm2. Positive skin prick test results are valid if performed within one year prior to
             the inclusion of the subject in the study

          -  A positive test for specific IgE to Platanus acerifolia (CAP-RAST major or equal to
             2). IgE results are valid if performed within oneyear prior to the inclusion of the
             subject in the study.

          -  Allergic symptoms during the pollen season of Platanus acerifolia.

          -  Medical history positive allergy inhalation (rhinitis and /or rhinoconjunctivitis
             and/or asthma) from Platanus acerifolia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Immunotherapy in the past 5 years with an allergen preparation known to interfere with
             the allergen to be tested due to a high degree of cross-reactivity (for example:other
             species of Platanus: Platanus orientalis, Platanus occidentalis).

          -  Use of drugs that may interfere with the skin reactions (e.g., antihistamines). See
             Appendix 1 of the protocol.

          -  Treatment with any of the following medications: oral tricyclic or tetracyclic
             antidepressants or IMAOs, beta-blockers, chronic use of corticosteroids or use of oral
             or parenteral corticosteroids in repeated and intermittent patterns (10 mg/daily of
             prednisone or equivalent).

          -  Women who are pregnant or period of breastfeeding and women with a pregnancy test
             positive during the visit 2, prior to the prick test.

          -  Dermographism affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          -  Atopic dermatitis affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          -  Urticaria affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          -  Diseases of the immune system relevant clinically, both autoimmune and
             immunodeficiencies.

          -  Serious diseases not controlled that may increase the risk for the safety of the
             subjects involved in this study, including, but not limited to the following: heart
             failure, uncontrolled or severe respiratory diseases,endocrine diseases, clinically
             relevant kidney or liver diseases or hematological diseases.

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial within 30 days (or 5 times the biological
             half-life of the research of the study product, whichever is longer) prior to the
             inclusion of the subject in this clinical trial.

          -  Patients with diseases or conditions that limit the use of adrenaline (heart disease,
             severe hypertension, ..)

          -  Severe psychiatric, psychological or neurological disorders

          -  Abuse of alcohol, drugs or medicines in the previous year.
