    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single arm, long-term extension study will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with early moderate to severe
      rheumatoid arthritis who completed the WA19926 core study. Patients will receive
      RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 104 weeks.
