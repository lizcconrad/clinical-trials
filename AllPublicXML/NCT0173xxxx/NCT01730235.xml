  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The last mile of the medication use system requires tools to help patients comply with
      medication administration rules and monitor for side effects. Personal health records (PHR)
      and emerging user-adopted communication tools promise to change the landscape of medication
      management. The overarching goal of the MyMediHealth project is to investigate ways in which
      PHRs and supported applications can improve the safety and quality of medication delivery.
      Preliminary work in this area by a team of parents, patients and school/clinic health
      providers created a vision for MyMediHealth, a next-generation medication management system.
      MyMediHealth was envisioned to allow home-based, school-based, and other caregivers to ensure
      safe and effective medication delivery. This vision featured just-in-time medication
      reminders to children with special health care needs, two-way communication to log when doses
      have been administered or when side effects have occurred, and mechanisms to warn caregivers
      about side effects and drug interactions. However, much of this work was done using
      prototypes, storyboards, and vision videos. Recognizing that this vision cannot be carried
      out without significant changes in processes and policies, the purpose of this proposed study
      is to evaluate the impact of medication management tools such as MyMediHealth on medication
      adherence for children with chronic illnesses. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize
      that compared with usual practice, children using mymedihealth will have improved medication
      adherence and will report improved (decreased) asthma symptoms.

    <description>At the end of the 2-week data collection period (following the 1-week test period), all participants (Control and Intervention) and their parents will be asked to complete a brief online survey, including the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and the weekly adherence survey(SDSCA). All responses collected from participants and their parents in the Time 2 Survey will be compared to those collected from the Baseline Survey, where applicable. Medication adherence will be measured by responses to ACT and SDSCA survey items for all participants.</description>
