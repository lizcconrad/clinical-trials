  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase Ib clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of the combination of
      INC424 and BKM120 in the myelofibrosis population and to establish the maximum tolerated dose
      and or the Recommended Phase II dose of the combination guided by the Bayesian dose
      escalation model. INC424 has shown efficacy in myelofibrosis (MF) and is approved in the US
      and EU for the treatment of MF. BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor. Preclinical and early clinical
      experience support inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in MF as aberrant activation of the
      pathway has been observed in MF models and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.
