  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness in infants and children caused
      by viruses that belong to the enterovirus genus of the picornavirus family. Although most
      HFMD cases do not result in serious complications, outbreaks of HFMD caused by enterovirus 71
      (EV71) can present with a high rate of neurological complications, including
      meningoencephalitis, pulmonary complications, and can even cause infant death. HFMD caused by
      EV71 has become a major emerging infectious disease in Asia and the highly pathogenic
      potential of EV71 clearly requires the attention of world medical community.

      The phase II study of inactivated vaccine (vero cell) against EV71 has completed last month
      in Jiangsu Province in China. The data from the phase II study suggested that the inactivated
      EV71 vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese
      children and infants. But the antibody titer against EV71 was found decreased significantly
      at month 8 compared to that at day 56. Considering the similar dynamic trend had also been
      found in the antibody against poliovirus induced by polio vaccines, and whose immunization
      schedule contains a booster dose administrated at 1 to 1.5 year after the first 3 doses of
      fundamental immunity. In order to find a better immunization schedule for children, the
      investigators decided to perform this booster immunity trial among these children who had
      received two doses of EV71 vaccines (around one year after the fundamental immunity). The
      investigators do the recruitment among these children who had participated in the previous
      phase II trial and received EV71 vaccines, and randomize them in a ratio of 2:1 to receive
      either a booster dose of EV71 vaccines or placebo.
