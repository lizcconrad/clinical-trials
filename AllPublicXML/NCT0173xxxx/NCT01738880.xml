  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing craniotomy, 0.9% normal saline is commonly administered in order to
      reduce cerebral edema. Excessive administration of 0.9% normal saline has been to reported to
      cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, hypovolemia due to insufficient
      fluid replacement for perioperative loss can also result in metabolic acidosis by lactic acid
      accumulation. However, the guideline for perioperative fluid management has not been yet
      established. The investigators hypothesized that intraoperative fluid management according to
      SVV(Stroke Volume Variation)could reduce perioperative metabolic acidosis compared to those
      by CVP(Central Venous Pressure). Therefore, the study is trying to determine if
      intraoperative fluid administration based on SVV could reduce metabolic acidosis when
      compared with CVP in patients undergoing craniotomy due to brain tumor who receive 0.9%
      normal saline as main fluid regimen.
