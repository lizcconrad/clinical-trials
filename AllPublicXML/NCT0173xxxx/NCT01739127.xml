      The purpose of this study is to compare abdominal weight gain and fat distribution in people
      taking aripiprazole versus risperidone or quetiapine, to people not taking any of these
      antipsychotic medications.

    <textblock>
      Second generation antipsychotic drugs have much greater efficacy for refractory schizophrenia
      and have much lower propensity to induce motor side-effects. These medications are seeing
      increased use for indications other than psychosis, and greater use in populations such as
      adolescents. However, one of the most critical issues in the field of psychiatry today is the
      overwhelming evidence that chronic use of the second generation antipsychotics can result in
      metabolic dysregulation, which includes weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance.
      A recent meta-analysis indicated that switching from other second generation antipsychotics
      to the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole consistently resulted in significant weight loss and
      may be an optimal treatment for patients who exhibit drug-induced weight gain. Therefore, we
      aim to compare metabolic dysregulation (namely abdominal weight gain and fat distribution)in
      participants taking aripiprazole, to participants who are taking higher-metabolic propensity
      antipsychotic drugs (such as risperidone or quetiapine), and to healthy participants.

      Participants will be offered the option of taking part in an optional biobanking component of
      the main study. Six milliliters of whole blood samples will be collected and stored at -80
      degrees Celsius for genotyping to determine if certain genetic polymorphisms predispose
      individuals to gain weight while taking antipsychotic medications.
