  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective of this study is to prospectively compare and evaluate efficacy as well as
      note side effects of the interscalene block and combined suprascapular and axillary nerve
      block for ambulatory arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients having elective arthroscopic rotator cuff repair will be randomized to one of the
      two groups.

      Group 1: This group will receive Interscalene block (ultrasound guided and nerve stimulator
      aided) followed by a general anesthesia.

      Group 2: This group will receive Suprascapular and Axillary nerve block (ultrasound guided
      and nerve stimulator aided) followed by a general anesthesia.

      Performance time, quality and efficacy as well as any side-effects of the blocks will be
      evaluated in terms of pain scores in recovery room, after 4- 6 hours and the next morning,
      opioid usage and patient satisfaction.

      Primary hypothesis:

      • Combined Suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks provide similar postoperative analgesia as
      compared to interscalene block for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

      Secondary hypothesis

      • Interscalene block is associated with more side effects and complications as compared to
      suprascapular nerve block and axillary nerve block.

    <description>Visual Analogue scores for pain will be analyzed using chi-squared test. Interscalene block (ISB) of the brachial plexus has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective analgesic modality during arthroscopic shoulder surgery. However, despite its (ISB) time-tested record of relative safety, ISB is associated with some complications. These could be central nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular complications. These side effects and complications are based upon the anatomy of the brachial plexus at this level.Recently, suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks have been used to control postoperative shoulder pain. The study will try to find out whether combined supra scapular and axillary nerve blocks are as effective in pain control as compared to inter scalene block.</description>
