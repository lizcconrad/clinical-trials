  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in patients with cystic fibrosis the effect of
      Lactobacillus Reuteri (LR) on the rate of respiratory exacerbations and of the infections of
      both upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hallmarks of cystic fibrosis (CF) are recurrent severe and destructive pulmonary
      inflammation and infection, beginning in early childhood and leading to morbidity and
      mortality due to respiratory failure. During the disease, most children become colonized with
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and undergo progressive impairment of respiratory function.
      Therefore, patients colonized with Pseudomonas are at increased risk for pulmonary infections
      and persistent inflammation and have a decrease in survival rate. In an attempt to reduce the
      rate and severity of pulmonary exacerbations, children with CF are put on heavy load of
      antibiotics.

      Intestinal inflammation is another typical finding in CF patients and gut bacterial
      overgrowth may be present.

      Probiotics are live bacteria administered orally, successfully used in children with acute
      gastroenteritis, as well as in preventing and treating atopic diseases in children. In
      addition, probiotics have been used as adjuvant therapy in patients with pouchitis and
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Interestingly, probiotic supplementation is able to reduce the
      incidence of fever, child care absences, antibiotic prescription and to prevent nosocomial
      gastrointestinal and respiratory infections. The effect of probiotics may be through
      improvement of intestinal barrier function and modulation of immune response. The latter
      mechanism could well explain the clinical effects of probiotics observed in extraintestinal
      diseases.
