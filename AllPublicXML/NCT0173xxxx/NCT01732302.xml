  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an educational intervention given towards
      health care providers working in primary health care centers can reduce inappropriate
      prescribing in the elderly patient and thus reduce number and length of drug-related
      hospitalizations as well as number of emergency department visits in this patient group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate medication in the elderly patient leads to substantial morbidity, possibly
      causing up to 20% of hospitalizations in this patient group (1). To improve prescribing and
      thus reduce undesired drug effects is a great challenge for doctors and nurses in primary
      health care.

      Performance of drug utilization reviews is recommended in order to reduce the negative impact
      of inappropriate prescribing in the elderly. However, scientific evidence on their efficacy
      is lacking, especially regarding patient-related health outcomes (2,3). Most studies are
      carried out in inpatient care, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding primary
      health care (2). Moreover, studies in this scientific field diverge regarding the content and
      structure of drug utilization reviews, which implies that comparison between studies becomes
      challenging, if not impossible.

      This trial aims at educating health care providers in how to perform drug utilization
      reviews, and to help them implement theory into practice.

    <description>Primary health care centers (PHCC) in the intervention group will be visited twice by a pharmacist within a period of three months. At the first visit, an educational intervention will focus on two properties: on the one hand, feed-back of actual patient data of the PHCC illustrating the primary-health-care-specific characteristics of inappropriate prescribing in the elderly patient will be given. Education of relevant subjects will be given in relation to detected problems. On the other hand, a clinical routine regarding the performance of drug utilization reviews will be developed in cooperation with the health care providers. At the second visit 3 months later, the developed concept will be critically reviewed and eventually developed further.</description>
