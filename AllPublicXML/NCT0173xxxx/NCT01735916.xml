    <textblock>
      This study is looking at whether the electrical treatment provided by a special type of
      pacemaker called a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) pacemaker may keep a patient's
      heart failure from getting worse. When the lower heart chambers (i.e. ventricles) are
      electrically paced to beat together by the CRT pacemaker, blood may be pumped to the body
      more efficiently.

      The CRT pacemaker being studied in this clinical trial is approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for patients with moderate to severe heart failure, whose hearts pump
      blood inefficiently. In the MIRACLE EF study, patients who have heart failure with slightly
      less inefficient hearts will be observed to see if the electrical pacing treatment is better
      than not getting the treatment. This study is being conducted to support FDA approval of this
      type of pacemaker for people whose heart failure is less inefficient.

      Medtronic, Inc. is sponsoring the MIRACLE EF study, a prospective, randomized, controlled,
      double-blinded, global multi-center, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) in Heart Failure
      (HF) clinical study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate market released CRT pacemaker
      (CRT-P) devices in symptomatic HF patients with less severe left ventricular systolic
      dysfunction, specifically patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in
      the range of 36% to 50%. This study will support expansion of indications for CRT worldwide.
      The outcome of this study is expected to support modification of existing U.S. and Japanese
      labeling for Medtronic's implantable CRT-P devices and to provide further evidence to support
      changes to cardiology practice guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC guidelines) regarding the use of CRT
      in patients with mild to moderate HF.

      Following enrollment and the baseline assessment, eligible subjects will be implanted with a
      CRT-P system and randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either treatment (CRT-P ON) or control (CRT-P
      OFF) groups. Study subjects will be followed for a minimum of 24 months or until study
      closure, and will remain in their randomized groups until their 60 month visit or until the
      study is stopped, whichever comes first. The effectiveness of CRT-P in this population will
      be assessed using a composite endpoint of time to first event, with event defined as
      All-cause mortality or HF Event. To assess the safety of CRT-P in this population, the
      primary safety endpoint will measure freedom from system-related complications at 6 months
      post-implant.

    <description>The Medtronic Consulta CRT-P (models C3TR01, C4TR011) dual chamber implantable pacemaker with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-P) is a multi-programmable cardiac device that monitors and regulates the patient's heart rate by providing single or dual chamber rate-responsive bradycardia pacing, and sequential biventricular pacing.
The device senses the electrical activity of the patient's heart using the electrodes of the implanted atrial and right ventricular leads. It then analyzes the heart rhythm based on selectable detection parameters. The device responds to bradyarrhythmias by providing bradycardia pacing therapy.
Simultaneous or sequential biventricular pacing is used to provide patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy. The device also provides diagnostic and monitoring information that assists with system evaluation and patient care.</description>
