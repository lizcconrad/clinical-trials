  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dyn@mo lifestyle intervention (CHU Sainte-Justine, Quebec, Canada) targets children and
      adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old with cardiometabolic risk factors, such as obesity,
      hypertension, disorders in glucose regulation or dyslipidemia. Its primary goal is to promote
      physical activity and reduce sedentary time to improve childrens' cardiometabolic profile. To
      do so, the intervention relies on gathering data on mobility and physical activity using
      wearable sensors. These data provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and physical
      activity levels, improving the health care professional's ability to tailor counseling. The
      investigators are presently in the implementation phase of this intervention.

    <description>Children will be equipped with a heart rate monitor, a GPS receiver and an accelerometer for collection of heart rate, mobility and physical activity free-living data during a 7-day period. This will provide a 'spatio-behavioural diagnosis' using a map-based interactive web application. This data will be used to developed a tailored plan to promote physical activity in the child's every day environment.</description>

    <description>In this arm, while children will wear the same sensors as in the intervention arm, the intervention will not rely on data gathered using the wearable sensors. Rather, a traditional physical activity counseling strategy will be adopted in this control group.</description>
