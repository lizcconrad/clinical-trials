      METHODOLOGY:

      This multi-centre and open-label study comprises six groups corresponding to the six
      indications tested. No placebo or reference product is involved. No randomization is required
      as the indication will define the patient selection.

      The six indications studied are:

        -  Direct pulp capping following carious pulp exposure

        -  Direct pulp capping following dental trauma injury to healthy pulp (partial pulpotomy)

        -  Repairing perforated root canals and/or the pulp chamber floor

        -  Retrograde endodontic surgery

        -  Pulpotomy in primary molars

        -  Apexification

      Study start: October 2009

      Inclusion period: 1/10/2009 to 30/06/2011

      Study duration: 2 years

      OBJECTIVES:

      The trial objective is to illustrate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of RD94 in the
      indications described.

      Primary objective:

      The primary objective is to show that RD94 can be easily applied in the claimed indications
      and to evaluate its efficacy. This can be defined after a 6 month follow-up.

      Secondary objective:

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of RD94 after a two year follow-up which
      is important for safety and the longevity of the product.

      TRIAL POPULATION AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS:

      60 patients in three French study centers, 10 per indication studied. Depending on the
      indication, children (from 3 years onwards), and/or adults will be included.

      DURATION OF TREATMENT:

      The product is applied on D0 (Inclusion) of the study. The follow-up period includes 2 years
      with six visits: Visit1 - Week 1, Visit 2 - Month 1, Visit 3 - Month 3, Visit 4 - Month 6,
      Visit 5 - Year 1, Visit 6 - Year 2.
