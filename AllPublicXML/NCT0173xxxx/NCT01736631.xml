    <textblock>
      We are doing this study to find out how well cognitive behavioural therapy for social phobia
      works in people with bipolar disorder, who also have social phobia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social phobia is a very prevalent anxiety disorder in people with bipolar disorder and is
      associated with adverse outcomes. Yet, social phobia is treatable by cognitive behavioural
      therapy or antidepressant medication. As antidepressants are often contra-indicated in people
      with bipolar disorder, cognitive behavioural therapy is the likely first choice treatment for
      social phobia in this population. However, people with bipolar disorder were excluded from
      previous clinical trials on treatment of social phobia. Our aim is to evaluate the
      acceptability and to provide a rough estimate of efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy
      protocol for social phobia in people with bipolar disorder in a systematic case series. We
      will also prepare pilot data for evaluating the impact of treatment of comorbid social phobia
      on the long-term course of bipolar disorder.
