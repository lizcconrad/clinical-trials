  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended for treatment and prevention of dehydration
      due to acute gastroenteritis in infants and children. Acute diarrhoea leads to zinc depletion
      in infants, and zinc is recommended by the World Health Organization in the treatment of
      acute gastroenteritis in infants and children. However, the efficacy of zinc supplementation
      to children with acute gastroenteritis in more affluent settings is unclear. Selected strains
      of probiotics, including L. reuteri ATCC 55730, have been shown in several studies to shorten
      the duration of diarrhoea by about 24 hours, and also to attenuate symptom severity. If
      probiotics are given within 60 hours from onset of symptoms the duration can be reduced even
      more. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) has been shown to reduce the duration and severity
      of acute gastroenteritis in children aged 6-36 months. In these studies L. reuteri was proven
      to have clinical effect on diarrhoea of both bacterial and viral (rotavirus) origin. In
      humans, L. reuteri strain DSM 17938 has recently been shown to reduce the duration of watery
      diarrhoea by 1.2 days among 6-36 mo old Italian children with acute gastroenteritis treated
      in hospital.

      The present, community-based study aims to assess if an ORS with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM
      17938 and zinc can be superior or equivalent to ORS without probiotic and zinc in reducing
      the duration of acute gastroenteritis in children aged 6-36 months, with no, mild or moderate
      dehydration when introduced early (within 48 hours) after the start of gastroenteritis
      associated diarrhoea in an out-patient setting.

      A prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled study with parallel groups will be
      performed. Assuming a difference of 25% between groups in the primary outcome of prevalence
      of diarrhoea 48 hours after start of treatment (80% power, alfa = 5%), and estimating an
      attrition rate of approximately 15%, the final sample size will be 142 subjects, or 71
      subjects in each arm.

      Parents contacting the health care telephone enquiry agency, the primary care emergency unit,
      the paediatric emergency unit, all at the Umeå University Hospital or the well-baby care
      centres (BVC) in Umeå for advice on their children's gastroenteritis will be informed that
      they may participate in the present study and they will be given contact information to the
      research nurse for this activity. A home visit by study personnel will then be done for
      evaluation of eligibility, information, collection of informed consent and delivery of study
      product.

      Data collection points will be at the recruitment visit in the patient's home, and by
      telephone on day 7. If the child still has gastrointestinal symptoms on day 5 it will be
      referred to the primary health care facility or the outpatient clinic of the Department of
      Paediatrics, Umeå University Hospital.
