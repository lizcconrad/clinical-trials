      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:
      Etodolac Tablets USP 500 mg of Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the corresponding
      Reference Product: Etodolac Tablets USP 500mg of Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., USA,
      under fasting condition in healthy, adult, human subjects in a randomized crossover study.

      The study was conducted with 36 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 500 mg
      dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization
      schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting
      position.

      The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 12 days including washout period of 9
      days between administrations of study drug in each study period.
