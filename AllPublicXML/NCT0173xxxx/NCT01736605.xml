      In this study we propose to explore the efficacy of massage therapy combined with meditation
      in women recovering from tissue reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer. Patients
      will be randomized into 2 groups. The first group will consist of massage therapy on 3
      consecutive days starting on the 1st day after surgery. The second group will consist of
      massage therapy combined with meditation for 3 consecutive days starting on the 1st day after
      surgery. The effect of massage and massage combined with meditation on stress, anxiety,
      relaxation, insomnia, alertness, fatigue, tension/muscular discomfort, pain, mood and energy
      level will be evaluated by using three different surveys.

    <textblock>
      Besides skin cancer breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women. Most women with
      breast cancer will undergo some kind of breast cancer surgery. For women undergoing a
      mastectomy, breast reconstruction offers significant quality of life benefits and is a vital
      option to enhance breast cancer recovery. There are two general types of reconstructive
      options:

        1. Prosthetic devices (saline implants, silicone implants, tissue expanders)

        2. Autologous tissue reconstructions with tissue flaps that are transferred from adjoining
           or distant donor sites to the anterior chest wall.

      When reconstruction of the breast mound is accomplished using the patient's own tissues, the
      result is typically more natural in both appearance and feel than with expander/implant
      reconstruction. However the disadvantages of autologous reconstruction include longer
      surgical procedures and prolonged recovery time as compared to prosthetic reconstruction.
      Postoperative pain, anxiety, fatigue are among the challenges facing patients undergoing
      breast cancer surgery and especially patients who decided to undergo these complicated
      plastic surgical procedures. Massage therapy has been used successfully to target common
      postoperative symptoms such as pain, anxiety, tension and fatigue in breast cancer patients.

      Meditation has been shown to be helpful in achieving healing and relaxation through
      purposeful contemplation and reflection.

      In this study we propose to explore the effectiveness of massage therapy combined with
      meditation in breast cancer patients recovering from autologous tissue reconstruction with
      the hope that the combination will augment the benefit obtained by massage therapy alone.
