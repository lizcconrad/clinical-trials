  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation is the first intention treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with
      claudication. Initially proposed in the sixty's, rehabilitation programs dedicated to
      patients with PAD have recently been proved effective and defined in many guidelines.
      Supervised walking training on treadmill is recommended. Usually patients walk up to a mild
      or moderate pain (evaluated at 3 or 4 on the claudication pain scale; maximum pain =5), then
      stop until pain completely subsides and walk again .

      The Artex study assesses the efficacy of a fractionated mode of training avoiding pain by
      alternating short sequences of intensive training and active recovery (without rest).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fractionated mode of training with active recovery has been proved effective in sport
      training as well as in Cardiac rehabilitation. We hypothesized it might be also interesting
      in the rehabilitation of patients with a peripheral arterial disease. The active recovery
      period might magnified the beneficial effect of a short intensive training.
