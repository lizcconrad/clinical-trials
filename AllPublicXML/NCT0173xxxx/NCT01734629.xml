  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies show an association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
      coronary artery disease (CAD). Besides risk factors such as smoking, both are associated with
      physical inactivity, advanced age and systemic inflammation The use of coronary computed
      tomography (CCT) with multiple detectors is a diagnostic method for coronary disease,
      describing the anatomy and severity of arterial obstruction. One way of estimating the
      cardiovascular risk is coronary calcium score (CCS). Due to the association between COPD and
      CAD, it is likely that many patients with IHD diagnosed by CT have reduced lung function.

      The aim of this observational study is to establish the correlation between the CCS and lung
      function. It will also correlate the presence of irreversible airway obstruction with
      significant coronary lesions.

      Patients over 40 years referred to CCT who agree to participate in the study will perform a
      spirometry with bronchodilator and collect a blood sample to measure serum markers of
      inflammation and cardiovascular risk (glycemia, lipid profile, C reactive protein (CRP),
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Alpha) and fibrinogen). The data will be compared in the
      general population and in subgroups: smokers, former smokers and nonsmokers.

      One year after the CCT patients will be contacted by the investigators and accessed for
      emergency room visits, hospital admissions and fatal or nonfatal coronary or respiratory
      events.

      The investigators hypothesis is that reduced lung function is independently associated with
      elevated CCS and is, also a risk factor for increased hospital admission and coronary events.

      The concomitant assessment of lung function and CCS can contribute knowledge about the
      epidemiological association between pulmonary disease and CAD. This can also add to evidence
      for the use of spirometry as a marker of cardiovascular risk.
