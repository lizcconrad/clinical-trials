  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biological membranes that surround a cell and its organelles are vital to the overall
      function of the cell. Fatty acids are the main structural component of membranes, and the
      presence of specific fatty acids can alter a membrane's characteristics, which subsequently
      alters function. Two fatty acids that are of particular interest to researchers are
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These omega-3 fatty acids have
      unique unsaturated structures, and their incorporation into biological membranes appear to
      elicit potent physiological effects. The body is unable to intrinsically synthesize these
      important fatty acids, so they must be obtained from the diet or through supplementation.

      Compared to research investigating other body tissues, the effect of EPA and DHA on skeletal
      muscle membranes and cellular function has received little attention. Of the studies done,
      EPA and DHA supplementation consistently results in increased EPA, DHA, and total omega-3
      fatty acid content in the skeletal muscle membranes of rodents. One study has also
      demonstrated this effect in humans. These studies, however, have been limited to whole muscle
      measurements, yet cells contain numerous subcellular membranes with diverse functions. Two
      membranes of key importance to the metabolic function of a skeletal muscle cell are the
      membrane that surrounds the cell (plasma membrane), and the membrane that surrounds the
      mitochondria.

      The plasma and mitochondrial membranes are responsible for taking up nutrients and converting
      them into useable energy for the muscle. Recent findings suggest that physiological changes
      in these processes may occur following EPA and DHA supplementation. At rest and during
      exercise, there is potential for a shift in substrate selection that favors fat utilization
      following EPA and DHA supplementation. Several membrane proteins are responsible for
      transporting fat into the cell and mitochondria. The presence of EPA and DHA within membranes
      has the potential to affect the membrane integration and function of proteins. The
      investigators aim to determine whether fat utilization increases following EPA and DHA
      supplementation, and if there is a concurrent change in the concentrations of fat transport
      proteins within plasma and mitochondrial membranes. Supplementation with EPA and DHA may also
      affect oxygen consumption, an important process in energy production that is regulated by
      mitochondrial membrane proteins. Evidence from human and rodent studies shows a decrease in
      whole body oxygen consumption following supplementation. The investigators aim to examine
      these changes directly by measuring mitochondrial respiration following EPA and DHA
      supplementation.

      Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to examine how plasma and mitochondrial
      membrane fatty acid composition change individually in response to EPA and DHA
      supplementation in humans. The secondary purpose of this study is to examine functional
      metabolic changes that occur in skeletal muscle in response to EPA and DHA supplementation,
      and to investigate correlational relationships between these changes and any compositional
      alterations in plasma and mitochondrial membranes. The investigators hypothesize that
      supplementation with EPA and DHA will alter fuel selection at rest and during exercise, and
      this will correspond to an increase in the concentration of membrane fatty acid transport
      proteins, and that these changes will correlate to an increase in the EPA, DHA, and total
      omega-3 content of plasma and mitochondrial membranes.
