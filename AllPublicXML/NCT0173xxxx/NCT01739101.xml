  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women and men are at risk for sexual transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies and
      have unrealistic family planning intentions and insufficient knowledge of health promoting
      lifestyle prior to conception. Without sufficient support from the health care system this
      can lead to negative consequences. The aim of our study was to investigate if the usage of
      the Reproductive Life Plan in midwifery counselling increases women's knowledge of
      reproduction and particularly knowledge of folic acid intake prior to pregnancy. Secondary
      aims were to evaluate the influence on women's family planning and to further explore how
      women experienced the Reproductive Life Plan-based counselling.

    <measure>Knowledge of reproduction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge will be measured by knowledge of the following:
the fecundity of an ovum
how likely it is that a 25-year old women gets pregnant if she has unprotected intercourse at the time of ovulation
at what age there is a marked decline in women's ability to become pregnant
baby take home rate after IVF-treatment
factors that can impair female fertility
healthy lifestyle during pregnancy planning</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Planning Intentions</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Family planning intentions will be measured by the following questions:
Do you want (more) children in your life?
If yes, how many (more) children do you want?
If yes, at which age would you like to have your first/next child?
If yes, at which age you like to have your last child?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Experience of the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Experience of the intervention is measure by
The overall experience of the intervention (very positive - very negative)
If the intervention made them think about reproduction in a different way
If the intervention made them search for more information about reproduction
The likelihood of approaching a midwife if they have more questions about reproduction
If they considered that midwifes or other health care professionals routinely should discuss the Reproductive Life Plan with their patients</description>
