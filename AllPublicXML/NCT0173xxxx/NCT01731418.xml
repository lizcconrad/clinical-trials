  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to investigate to what extent Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is an
      effective treatment for the reduction of symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      and depression and for the improvement of daily functioning in Iranian women who have
      experienced intimate partner violence (IPV). In addition, the study seeks to investigate
      whether NET therapy could lead to the reduction of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) within
      their marriage.

    <measure>Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS/PSS-I).</measure>
    <time_frame>Symptoms will be assessed at pre-treatment-point and post-treatment-point (up to 6-month follow-ups)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDS/PSS-I is a 17-item screening instrument on a 4-point-Likert-scale (0 = not at all to 3 = very much). The PDS aims at assessing all Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and thus it includes information about the nature of the traumatic event and the level of functional interference.</description>

    <time_frame>At pre-treatment-point, post-treatment-point, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Abuse Scale (CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-treatment-point, post-treatment-point, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The CAS, a 30-item validated research instrument, is a widely used self-report questionnaire of behaviors that women describe as abusive by their partners. It is a self-report measure that provides standardized sub scale scores on four dimensions of intimate partner abuse. The four dimensions are Severe Combined Abuse, Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, and Harassment, scaled from 0 (never) to 5 (daily) over a period of 12-month.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-treatment-point, post-treatment-point and 3- and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The WSAS is a widely used 5-item measure of disability. Its psychometric properties were analyzed and shown in different studies and disorders (Mataix-Cols et al, 2005; Mundt et al, 2002).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Life Events Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-treatment-point, post-treatment-point and 3- and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The Life Events Checklist (LEC) is a brief, 17-item, self-report measure designed to screen for potentially traumatic events in a respondent's lifetime. The LEC assesses exposure to 16 events known to potentially result in PTSD or distress and includes one item assessing any other extraordinarily stressful event not captured in the first 16 items.</description>

    <measure>Checklist of family violence</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-treatment-point, post-treatment-point and 3- and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>This checklist assessing the incidence of domestic violence was developed by Catani (2002) and includes questions on physical abuse, verbal violence, neglect and sexual abuse as well as witnessing intimate partner violence between parents.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23)</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre-treatment-point, post-treatment-point and 3- and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The BSL-23 is a shortened form of the full version of the BSL-95. The self-report questionnaire assesses borderline-specific symptomatology on a five response scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very strongly).</description>

    <intervention_name>Narrative Exposure Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is a treatment approach that was developed by a research group of the University of Konstanz (Schauer, Neuner, &amp; Elbert, 2005, 2011). In NET, the patient repeatedly talks about the most arousing traumatic events in detail while re-experiencing the emotions associated with this event. In the process, the patient constructs a narration of his life, focusing on the detailed report of the traumatic experiences.</description>
