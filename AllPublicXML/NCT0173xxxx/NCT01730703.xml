      The purpose of this interview study is to learn why adults would join a walking program. This
      study involves interviews with persons who are 65 years of age or older. The interview takes
      approximately 25 minutes. A total of 132 people will be enrolled. This study will examine the
      utility or value of various potential features of an incentive-based walking program. These
      data will enable us to monitor and improve upon enrollment of incentive-based walking
      programs.
