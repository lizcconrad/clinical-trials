    <textblock>
      This is an early phase research study looking at whether an experimental gene transfer,
      LVsh5/C46 (also known as Cal-1), is safe and if it can protect the immune system from the
      effects of HIV without the use of antiretroviral drugs.

      Cal-1 is an experimental gene transfer agent designed to inhibit HIV infection through 2
      active parts:

        1. Removing a protein named CCR5 from bone marrow and white blood cells

        2. Producing a protein named C46 on bone marrow and white blood cells

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 33 million individuals are currently infected with HIV. HIV/AIDS is a
      disease that impairs immune function, primarily by decreasing CD4+ T lymphocytes. The
      progression can be contained by daily dosing with antiretroviral therapy (ART) but there are
      side effects that can be treatment limiting, and the development of HIV drug resistance can
      force the physician to modify the ART regimen. There are no effective vaccines currently
      available for HIV.

      LVsh5/C46 (also known as Cal-1) is a dual therapeutic, self-inactivating lentiviral vector
      that encodes for both a short hairpin RNA against the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 (sh5) and a
      HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, C46 and inhibits two processes required for HIV-1 infection:

        1. Binding of the virus to the cellular CCR5 co-receptor and

        2. Fusion of the virus with the host cell

      The rationale is that Cal-1 introduced into hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells (HSPC) and
      mature CD4+ T lymphocytes will protect these cells and their progeny cells from HIV-1
      infection and its pathogenic sequelae. This may provide a continuous means of controlling
      HIV-1 after a single or infrequent dose(s), thereby decreasing or delaying (partially or
      completely) the need for antiretroviral drug therapy.

    <measure>Feasibility and safety of the introduction of Cal-1 into HSPC and CD4+ T lymphocyte cell populations, and the associated delivery procedures.</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline demographic and clinical information, treatment, and duration of follow-up will be summarized by group and overall. Severity of clinical adverse events (AEs) and laboratory safety parameters will be graded according to DAIDS criteria. Numbers of individual AEs, in numbers of subjects, will be summarized by severity and treatment. AEs will also be summarized and aggregated by body system for clinical events. The worst severity of each clinical and laboratory AE, for each subject, will be summarized by treatment.
All grade 3 and 4 AEs, and any other events that lead to a subject ceasing trial follow-up, will be listed by treatment, with duration and resolution.
Feasibility measures include the number of manufacturing procedures successfully completed (i.e. complying with all release criteria); number of gene modified cells, as affected by CD4+ and CD34+ purity, transduction efficiency, and viability; and the number of target cells harvested.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The benefit of busulfan conditioning in impacting efficacy of Cal-1 in controlling HIV-1 infection</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Log10 HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, CD4+ %, CD4:CD8 ratio, measures of Cal-1 marking/expression and thymopoiesis will be plotted over time for each individual subject, and will be summarized for each nominal study week.
Changes in Log10 HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T lymphocyte count from baseline will be formally compared in all subjects.
Associations between feasibility and safety measures and secondary outcomes include:
Number of gene-modified cells infused and peripheral blood marking, plasma HIV RNA and CD4+ T cell counts
Integration profile of the Ttn and HSPCtn products and observations in integration analysis of peripheral blood post infusion
HSPCtn methylcellulose colony forming units and peripheral blood subpopulation marking</description>
