      The primary objective of the study is to validate an EEG base algorithm system to detect and
      monitor changes in cerebral electrophysiological parameters as compared to clinical
      evaluation in patients undergoing Carotid Endarterectomy.

      The secondary objectives is measure time from ICA clamping to algorithm asymmetry detection,
      time from clinical deterioration to algorithm asymmetry detection Thi study is a prospective,
      open label, single arm, self control, single center study.

      This study will be conducted in 50 subjects according to the inclusions/exclusions criteria.
