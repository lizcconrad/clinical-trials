  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, patient sponsored study of
      Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (AD-SVF) implantation performed intra-articularly
      to affected joints.

      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      diagnosed Osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AD-SVF will be collected from the patient's adipose-derived tissue (body fat). Using local
      anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The adipose
      tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of AD-SVF. In addition, patient's
      peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of platelet rich plasma (PRP), which are
      then combined with the AD-SVF for intra-articular administration of affected joint.

    <description>Adipose tissue is available in most patients for harvest through minimally invasive procedures such as liposuction. AD-SVF can be obtained in large quantities after processing of adipose tissue in the laboratory.
AD-SVF to promote tissue regeneration and repair with their ability to secrete various growth factors that can modulate host tissue environment.
Patient's AD-SVF combined with PRP are used for direct intra-articular injection after processing.</description>
