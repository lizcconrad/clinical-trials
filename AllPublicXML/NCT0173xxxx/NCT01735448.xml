      Aim: To identify barriers and facilitators in the uptake of smoking cessation
      pharmacotherapies, tobacco prevention, doctor visits, smoking amongst youth, community held
      health priorities and barriers to research in Aboriginal Australians from the perspectives
      of:

        -  Aboriginal smokers and ex/non-smokers

        -  Aboriginal Healthcare workers

        -  Consultants/general practitioners, and

        -  Key stakeholders in Aboriginal health

      Focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys will be conducted to provide information at
      the 'grass-roots' level including examinations into perceived differences in locally held
      beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, traditional practices and the cultural and social constructs,
      to assist implementation of future tobacco cessation/prevention interventions and treatment
      of smoking related illnesses. This information can be used to improve the health of
      Aboriginal people by identifying inadequacies in current practices and highlighting what
      these are through the eyes of community members, healthcare workers, consultants/general
      practitioners and key stakeholders. We also intend on examining any facilitators that are
      identified as positive and working aspects of current initiatives e.g. community
      infrastructure, in an effort to not 'reinvent the wheel' and acknowledge what is working.

      We will identify barriers and facilitators for the implementation of smoking cessation
      pharmacotherapies, tobacco prevention, doctor visits, youth and smoking, community held
      health priorities and barriers to research through:

        1. Multiple focus groups held within 2 communities with Aboriginal smokers and
           ex/non-smokers, and

        2. Focus groups with healthcare workers serving these communities, and

        3. Qualitative one-on-one interviews with key stakeholders in Aboriginal communities

        4. Qualitative one-on-one interviews with specialists/doctors working with Aboriginal
           patients

        5. Surveys with all participants mentioned above

        6. Surveys with specialist groups including members of tobacco related special interest
           groups of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ)

      Smoking cessation is one of the most important ways to improve the prognosis of patients with
      respiratory diseases. Despite being over represented in the burden of smoking related
      morbidity and mortality, very little methodologically rigorous research has been conducted to
      evaluate and/or enhance the uptake of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and smoking
      prevention for Aboriginal Australians, as evident in our two recent (2012) Cochrane
      meta-analyses and through extensive consultation over the past two years with Aboriginal
      Elders, key stakeholders, researchers and experts throughout Australia. Moreover, many of the
      healthcare workers and some doctors on the frontline are reporting that they do not believe
      they have the skills or ability to offer smoking cessation/prevention initiatives to these
      patients, and perhaps more importantly, admit to the attitude of 'even if I did, it's not
      going to work, so why bother'.

      In light of this gap in knowledge, our project relates specifically to understanding and
      improving the lung health of Aboriginal Australians, the cohort with the greatest burden of
      disease and lowest life expectancy, through qualitative analyses. A total of 10 focus groups,
      30 one-on-one interviews and approximately 120 surveys (unless data saturation is reached
      sooner) will be carried out in collaboration with Aboriginal community involvement. The
      information obtained from these will provide an overall picture of the barriers and enablers
      from the perspectives of the various individuals involved, being:

        -  Aboriginal participants from urban, regional and rural cohorts (8 focus groups plus
           surveys)

        -  Aboriginal healthcare workers from urban, regional and rural cohorts (2 focus groups
           plus surveys)

        -  Respiratory consultants who see Aboriginal patients (10 one-on-one interviews plus
           surveys)

        -  Key stakeholders in Aboriginal health including Aboriginal liaison officers, Aboriginal
           health councils, Elders &amp; influential figures in communities (10 one-on-one interviews
           plus surveys)

        -  Medical Consultants who see Aboriginal patients (2 one-on-one interviews plus surveys
           from each of the following disciplines: General Practitioners, cardiology, neurology,
           oncology and vascular; total of 10, or until data saturation)

      Triangulation will occur at multiple levels to improve credibility and dependability
      including: data collection (focus groups, interviews and surveys), investigators (minimum
      five investigators involved throughout various aspects of the study), data sources (multiple
      locations, communities and venues), analysis methods (Grounded theory and Triandis model of
      behavioural change).

      In addition a detailed audit trail will be kept and all focus groups and interviews will
      undergo feedback (confirmation of accuracy and interpretation) by participants.
      Quasi-statistics will also be employed as part of the analysis methods.

    <description>Qualitative analysis (focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys). Research in Aboriginal populations are often lengthy and in many cases fail to achieve their objectives, often due to inappropriate methodology or a lack of consultation with Aboriginal Elders or key stakeholders research initiatives particularly related to tobacco and chronic illnesses will be determined through these qualitative discussions and mixed method approaches. In addition, we aim to identify health priorities identified by participants within the focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys that can be targeted for future research initiatives.</description>

    <description>Initially, ten focus groups with an average sample size of 5-7 participants each will be performed in two communities within South Australia, one being Adelaide and the other Murray Bridge, this includes focus groups held with healthcare workers.
The proposed focus groups will be conducted by experienced mediators who have undertaken Aboriginal cultural awareness training and have experience in qualitative research methods. Both mediators have also been involved in all aspects of project development and consultation with Aboriginal Elders and key stakeholders since its conception.
We will be using topic guides (reviewed by Aboriginal Elders and researchers) that will be semi-structured with open-ended questions designed to encourage group discussion around smoking cessation and the use of pharmacotherapies in particular, in addition to other objectives identified during the consultation phase of this research.</description>

    <description>A four page survey will be administered to all focus group and interview participants in addition to select cohorts including tobacco related special interest groups of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ). The survey will include demographic data, smoking history and current smoking status (questions related to smoking for current tobacco users include the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence, multiple Likert scales for cravings, motivation to quit, confidence etc.) and Likert scales examining perceptions, attitudes and knowledge about tobacco use, cessation, prevention, health and research in the Aboriginal setting.</description>

        Participants who agree to be involved in the focus groups will be recruited via existing
        community contacts (e.g., Aboriginal elders, leaders of community groups and doctors who
        support the planned research) in urban Adelaide and regional Murray Bridge. We also intend
        on actively recruiting through clinic visits made by our visiting respiratory clinicians.
        Copies of the participant information sheet and consent form will be disseminated via local
        healthcare workers to seek focus group volunteers and via existing contacts in health and
        by word of mouth for one-on-one interview participants. Survey participants will be
        recruited as per above methods in addition to use of delegate lists and mail outs.
