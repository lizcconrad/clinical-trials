  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collection of data from different sites regardless of whether they use standard or tailored
      protocols for the application of high concentration iodinated contrast agents to assess if
      the individually patient-adapted protocols result in a similar diagnostic image quality.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To record technical information and compare image quality regarding routine MDCT procedures
      with contrast administration using a tailored contrast injection and radiation dose protocol.
      The hypotheses are that the tailored protocols lead to a lower applied mean radiation dose
      compared to the use of standard protocols and will provide a more standardized contrast dose
      per patient size without impairing diagnostic quality.

    <description>Images are to be assessed according to the following scale: 0=Uninterpretable (Image quality severely affected by motion artifacts or technical reasons; need to repeat the examination); 1=Insufficient (Impaired image quality precludes adequate diagnostic assessment because of severe image noise or insufficient contrast enhancement; need to repeat the examination); 2=Adequate (Image quality in terms of noise and contrast enhancement does not interfere with sufficient diagnostic assessment; delineation of small structures may be suboptimal); or 3=Good (Absent or minimal image noise and good contrast enhancement allow adequate diagnostic assessment with clear delineation of even small structures).</description>
