      Main objective: To determine the optimal molar doses of the biospecific antibody TF2 and 68
      Ga-IMP-288 and the optimal time for pretargeting for immuno-PET in patients with breast
      carcinoma.

      Secondary objectives: To study the sensitivity of the immuno-PET, compare its performance to
      standard imaging methods, evaluate the safety of 150 MBq of 68 Ga-IMP-288; study the
      development of immunization against TF2 or complex TF2-IMP-288;

      -  4 or 5 cohorts of 3 patients receiving different doses of TF2 IMP-288 with different
           interval time. A last cohort (4 or 5 ): maximum of 21 additional patients with the
           optimal schedule.

      Cohort I: TF2 120 nmol / 6 nmol IMP-288 / 24 hours

      Cohort II: based on the results of the cohort I :

        1. Good signal of the tumor but high background: increased interval time, 120 nmol TF2 / 6
           nmol of IMP-288 / 30 hours

        2. Low signal of the tumor: reduction of the interval time, 120 nmol TF2 / 6 nmol IMP-288 /
           18 hours

        3. Good signal of the tumor and good background signal : dose reduction, 60 nmol TF2 /
           3nmol IMP- 288 / 24 hours

           Cohort III: based on results of cohort II:

           - Good signal of the tumor : dose reduction, 120 nmol TF2 / 3 nmol IMP-288 / 30 h

           Cohort IV : based on results of cohort III Cohort V : Based on results of cohort IV

           • A last Cohort (VI) : 19 patients with the optimal schedule of injection : 120 nmol TF2
           / 3 nmol IMP-288 / 30 h or 120 nmol TF2 / 6 nmol IMP-288 / 30 h

           • In the four weeks prior to the immuno-PET:

           - Clinical examination,

           - CEA and CA15-3,

           - thoraco abdominal pelvic scan, bone scan, FDG-PET,

           - immunohistochemistry ACE on the tumor if possible,

           - Anti-Antibodies if the patient has already received MAb,

           - pregnancy test within 2 days prior to immuno-PET,

           - (creatinine &gt; 2.5 normal) D0: Injection of TF2 D1 to D4: injection of 68 Ga-IMP-288
           (depending of the cohort) D0 to D4 : pharmacokinetics, imaging

           Evaluation at 1 month of Immuno-PET:

           • Assessment of the clinical oncologist and

           - histological biopsy and / or surgery performed according to the results of imaging and
           assessment of the potential clinical impact

           Evaluation at 3 and 6 months of immuno-PET:

           based on the results of immuno-PET, evaluation and therapeutic decision of the
           oncologist,

           - Imaging (ultrasound, bone scintigraphy, CT or PET FDG),

           - markers

             -  Anti-Antibody Search

             -  For patient with a cancer treatment a new immuno-PET can be proposed
