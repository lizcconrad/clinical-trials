    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-year study is to assess the sustained clinical efficacy and safety of
      300 IR/day of a sublingual solution of birch pollen allergen extract starting 4 months prior
      to the birch pollen season and continuing over the birch pollen season compared with placebo
      for reduction of rhinoconjunctivitis-related symptoms and anti-allergy medication usage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic birch pollen-related allergic rhinoconjunctivitis for at least the
             previous 2 pollen seasons requiring intake of symptomatic treatment.

          -  Sensitization to birch pollen demonstrated by a positive Skin Prick Test to birch
             pollen with wheal diameter &gt; 3 mm and birch pollen allergens specific IgE levels ≥
             0.70 kU/L.

          -  RRTSS based on the previous or on the penultimate birch pollen season ≥ 12 out of a
             maximum possible score of 18.

          -  Patients with an FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume at one second) ≥ 80% of the predicted
             value.

          -  Patients who are willing to comply with the protocol.

          -  Patients having given a signed informed consent before completing any study related
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptoms of rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis during the birch pollen season
             due to any other allergens (except alder and hazel). This includes patients with
             symptomatic allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis due to cat or dog allergens, and
             living with these animals at home or at risk of frequent contacts with these animals
             (family, friends etc.) during the course of the study.

          -  Patient who previously received desensitization treatment to birch pollen and/or
             another Betulaceae sp. (for example hazel or alder) within the previous 5 years.

             device, spermicide used with a male condom, bilateral tubal ligation, diaphragm with

          -  Patients with seasonal mild persistent asthma (GINA 2) necessitating treatment with
             inhaled glucocorticosteroids at a dose level greater than 400 mcg budesonide
             dose-equivalents.

          -  Patients with any nasal or oral condition that could interfere with the efficacy or
             safety assessments (such as nasal polyposis or oral inflammation).

          -  Patients with severe immune deficiency.

          -  Patients with a past or current disease, which as judged by the Investigator, may

             whatever the route and/or immunosuppressive drugs.

          -  Patients treated with inhaled/systemic steroids (whatever the indication) within 4
             weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening), or with long acting systemic corticosteroids 12

          -  Patients under continuous corticotherapy (inhaled or systemic drugs).

          -  Patients following a strict low sodium diet as the study treatment contains 590 mg of
