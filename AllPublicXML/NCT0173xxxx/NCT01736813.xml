  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surface molecule CCR5 is found on tumor cells within liver metastases of colorectal
      cancer. Inhibition of this molecule leads to a reduction in growth signals for tumor cells
      and subsequent slowed or halted tumor growth. The agent for the inhibition of CCR5 has
      already received FDA approval for treatment of HIV and has shown little side effects and
      toxicities even on long term treatment. Therefore CCR5-inhibition has the potential of
      providing non-toxic tumor growth inhibition.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 %

          -  patients that have received current standard treatment options (progression or
             intolerance to oxaliplatin, irinotecan and 5-Fluorouracil with or without treatment
