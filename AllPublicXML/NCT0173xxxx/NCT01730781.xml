  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess the availability of cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) in
      the human brain. CB1R are present in everyone's brain, regardless of whether or not someone
      has used cannabis. The investigators will image brain cannabinoid receptors using Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) imaging and the radioligand OMAR, in healthy individuals and
      several conditions including 1) cannabis use disorders, 2) psychotic disorders, 3) prodrome
      of psychotic illness and 4) individuals with a family history of alcoholism, using the PET
      imaging agent or radiotracer, [11C]OMAR. This will allow us to characterize the number and
      distribution of CB1R in these conditions. It is likely that the list of conditions will be
      expanded after the collection of pilot data and as new data on cannabinoids receptor function
      and psychiatric disorders becomes available.

      Those in the cannabis us disorder arm of the study will have a PET scan on at least three
      occasions: once while smoking as usual, once after 48-hours of abstinence from cannabis, and
      a final time after 4 weeks of abstinence. Additional scans may be conducted within the 4
      weeks and the last scan may be conducted well beyond 4 weeks. Similarly, while most
      schizophrenia patients may get scanned just once, a subgroup of patients may get scanned more
      than once. For example to tease out the effects of medications, unmedicated patients may get
      scanned while unmedicated and again after treatment with antipsychotic medications. Similarly
      prodromes may get scanned while in the prodromal stage off medications, on medications and
      after conversion to schizophrenia.

    <description>This study will utilize the radioligand [11C]OMAR and High Resolution Research Tomography (HRRT) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to measure brain CB1 receptor availability in all study populations.
Those in the cannabis dependent population of the study will have PET scanning on three occasions: once within four weeks of screening while smoking as usual, once 48-hours later after remaining abstinent, and once four weeks later after remaining abstinent. The change in receptor density at each time point will be evaluated.
Those in the other populations will have PET scanning done on one occasion within four weeks of screening.</description>

      At the screening visit, genomic DNA will be extracted from whole blood, assigned a code, and
      stored for analysis of group differences in the frequency of CB1R alleles and to examine the
      relationship between allelic variation at the CB1R locus and [11-C] OMAR binding. In
      addition, other genes or markers that may be related to brain function or to behavior may be
      studied.
