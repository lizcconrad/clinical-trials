  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biological membranes that surround a cell and its organelles are important to the overall
      function of the cell. Fatty acids are the main structural components of a membrane, and the
      presence of certain fatty acids can alter a membrane's characteristics, which subsequently
      alters its function. Two fatty acids that are of particular interest to researchers are
      eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). These omega-3 fatty acids have
      unique unsaturated structures, and their incorporation into biological membranes appears to
      elicit potent physiological effects. The body is unable to intrinsically synthesize these
      important fatty acids, so they must be obtained from the diet or through supplementation.

      EPA and DHA supplementation has been reported to provide numerous positive health benefits,
      including decreased blood pressure and an improved blood lipid profile. Recent research in
      our laboratory has demonstrated in young men that resting metabolic rate was increased
      following a 12 week period of omega fatty acid supplementation of 3 g/day. Fat utilization
      was also increased and carbohydrate use was decreased both at rest and during a 1 hr moderate
      exercise challenge. These findings have positive implications for people who are interested
      in losing weight, but it not known whether these effects occur in older adults. With age,
      body composition changes (increase in fat mass and decrease in lean mass) occur which may
      negatively affect general health, particularly normal physical functioning and quality of
      living of the older adult. The potential role of omega 3 fatty acids to increase fat
      oxidation and increase resting metabolic rate may be a therapy for decreasing fat mass in the
      older adult. Research has suggested that omega 3 fatty acids may elicit an additional
      therapeutic role by reducing joint pain.

      Another aspect of aging is a loss in lean body mass, which is associated with an attenuation
      of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to nutritional stimuli (amino acids and
      insulin). The weakened anabolic response is considered to be partly due to defects in the
      anabolic signaling cascade in the muscle. Research in older adults has reported an increase
      in muscle protein signaling with EPA and DHA supplementation in response to a nutritional
      challenge. However it is unknown whether the increase in protein signaling results in an
      eventual increase in lean body mass. The physical functioning of older adults is not only
      influenced by body composition changes, but also age-related neuronal changes that affect the
      velocity of axonal conduction and influence the ability of the muscle to generate torque and
      the rate at which the torque is developed. Muscular strength and functional capacity
      increases have been reported with chronic resistance exercise in a cohort of older women
      supplemented with EPA and DHA. However, the effect of EPA and DHA intake on physical strength
      in older adults with previously low EPA and DHA consumption, independent of exercise, is
      currently unknown.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of 12 weeks of omega-3
      supplementation at 3 g/day on metabolic and physical health parameters in community-dwelling
      older adults. We hypothesize that EPA and DHA supplementation will result in 1) a decrease in
      resting heart rate and blood pressure; 2) a more healthy blood profile; 3) an increase in
      resting metabolic rate; 4) a greater reliance on fat oxidation for energy both at rest and
      during exercise; and 5) a decrease in fat mass; and 6) an increase in lean mass, strength and
      physical function.
