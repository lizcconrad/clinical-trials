  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has been widely used as a diagnostic and treatment
      techniques of gastrointestinal small lesions. Postoperative rebleeding is one of the common
      complication following EMR. Several endoscopic hemostasis methods are currently in use.
      EndoClotÂ® absorbable polysaccharide hemostat (PAPH) as a new hemostasis material was
      previously used for surgical hemostasis, but the therapeutic effect and safety in endoscopic
      application remains unknown. This study has been designed to observe the effect of rebleeding
      prevention after EMR.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rebleeding rate after EMR procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Rebleeding rate up to 1 week was obtained by clinical manifestations such as melana; decreased hemoglobin &gt; 20g/L; hemodynamic instability or active bleeding from mucosal defect under endoscope.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mucosal healing after EMR</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Colonoscopy will be repeated 1 month after EMR procedure to observe if application of Endoclot will delay the musosal healing.</description>

    <description>Gastrointestinal tract obstruction has been previously reported as a possible adverse effect of hemostats, therefore it was observed in the current study.</description>
