    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well imetelstat sodium works in treating patients with
      primary or secondary myelofibrosis and other myeloid malignancies. Imetelstat sodium may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of imetelstat (imetelstat sodium) in myelofibrosis
      (MF).

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of imetelstat in the reduction of spleen size, as measured by
      physical examination (palpable distance from the left costal margin).

      III. To evaluate the efficacy of imetelstat in improving anemia or inducing red blood cell
      transfusion-independence in previously transfusion-dependent patients (per International
      Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment [IWG-MRT] criteria).

      IV. To evaluate onset and durability of response as defined in primary and secondary
      endpoints

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of imetelstat on bone marrow histology, karyotype and JAK2V617F
      allele burden II. To evaluate the effect of imetelstat on leukocytosis, circulating blast
      count, circulating immature myeloid cell count and thrombocytosis.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive imetelstat sodium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1.
      Patients may continue to receive imetelstat study treatment for as long as they derive
      clinical benefit or until study end. The study will end when all patients have discontinued
      study drug, the last patient enrolled has been treated for 5 years, or imetelstat is
      commercially available in the United States, whichever occurs first.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
