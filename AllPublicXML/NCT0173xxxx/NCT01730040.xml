      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 85 sites in 9 countries. Overall, 859 subjects were screened between 24 October 2012 and 26 September 2013, 504 of whom were screen failures. Screen failures ware mainly due to exclusion criteria met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified according to prior history of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, and intensity of statin treatment (atorvastatin 20 or 40 mg). Assignment to treatment arms was done centrally using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio after confirmation of selection criteria.</pre_assignment_details>
