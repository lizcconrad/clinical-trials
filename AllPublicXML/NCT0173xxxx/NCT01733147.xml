      Will oral supplementation with Omega 3 free fatty acids in obese Barrett's esophagus subjects
      downregulate pro-neoplastic and pro-inflammatory pathways in the esophagus to
      anti-inflammatory pathway?

    <description>Baseline assessment: Measure waist and hip circumference, height, weight. Complete Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (GERQ). Blood draw for serum free fatty acid (FFA) profile. Clinical baseline blood draw: INR, LDL, AST and ALT. Single slice CT of abdomen. Endoscopy performed with biopsies, brushings, and mucosal impedance testing. Randomized to ω3 FFA preparation or placebo for six months. Telephone calls will be made every month to subjects to assess for adverse effects and reinforce compliance. Repeat assessment at six months following randomization. This will include anthropometry (similar to baseline), a blood draw as outlined at baseline, and endoscopy with research biopsies as outlined at baseline. Subjects will also fill out the GERQ.</description>
