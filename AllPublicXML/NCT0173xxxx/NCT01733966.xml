      The primary outcome measure is to compare efficacy of an association of
      Secnidazol(2g)-Ciprofloxacin(1g) (during 3 days) versus 3g of Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid
      during 10 days for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Episode of Diverticular Sigmoïditis Among
      Adults in clinical and biological cure.

      The cure rate will be evaluated at the second visit (14 days after the inclusion visit)
