  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence, prevalence, clinical characteristics
      and prognosis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis over time in a district of Seoul,
      Korea.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is comprised of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of gut with uncertain etiopathogenesis.
      According to our previous study (Yang, et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis 2008; 14: 542-549), the
      incidence and prevalence of IBD in Korea are still low compared with those in Western
      countries, but are rapidly increasing. However, the long-term trends of epidemiology of CD
      and UC together with their characteristics and prognosis in Korea are uncertain yet. The
      investigators therefore aim to elucidate the incidence and prevalence of CD and UC over a
      30-year period, from 1986 to 2017, in the Songpa-Kangdong district of Seoul, Korea. In
      addition, the investigators also aim to reveal the clinical features at the time of diagnosis
      of IBD, long-term evolution of disease and prognosis.

        The study is performed in the Songpa-Kangdong district, a well-defined administrative area
        in Seoul, the capital of Korea, beginning in 1986, when the first patient with IBD was
        diagnosed, until 2017. The population of the study area was racially and ethnically
        homogeneous and was relatively stable in number.

          2. a typical sigmoidoscopic or colonoscopic picture with diffusely granular, friable, or
             ulcerated mucosa without rectal sparing or skip lesions or radiological signs of
             characteristic continuous granular or ulcerated mucosa

          3. characteristic histopathological signs of inflammation on biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:
