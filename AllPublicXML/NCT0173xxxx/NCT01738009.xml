  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the upper airway recurrently closes during sleep. The
      mechanisms that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. Some studies have shown
      that there is progressive narrowing of the pharyngeal airway across breaths during expiration
      (Progressive Expiratory Narrowing, PEN) preceding an obstructive apnea. The cause of PEN is
      unknown. The investigators will test if lung volumes and low respiratory drive play a role in
      PEN.

      The mechanisms that lead to airway closure in OSA are not completely understood. Some studies
      have shown that there is progressive narrowing of the pharyngeal airway across breaths during
      expiration (Progressive Expiratory Narrowing, PEN) preceding an obstructive apnea.

      The investigators will test if lung volumes and low respiratory drive play a role in PEN. To
      this end, the investigators will visualize the pharynx of sleep apnea patients during sleep
      using a thin endoscope during sleep while simultaneously measuring lung volumes, genioglossus
      electromyogram, and pharyngeal pressure during flow-limited breaths. Flow limitation will be
      induced by sustained reductions of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The time frame for the outcome will be the duration of induced flow limitation (3 minutes each) . Flow limitation will be induced several times during the night. Flow limited breaths will be averaged.</description>
