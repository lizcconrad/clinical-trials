  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemi spatial neglect, or the tendency to ignore stimuli originating in a portion of the
      environment contra lateral to a cerebral lesion, can be a major source of functional handicap
      after stroke. The currently available treatments for unilateral neglect are scanning
      training, visual cuing approaches, limb activation strategies, visual imagery, tactile
      stimulation, prisms and sustained attention training.Mirror therapy improves the hand
      function in sub-acute stroke.

      Hypothesis: To evaluate the effectiveness of Mirror therapy in the management of stroke
      patients with unilateral neglect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 30 - 50% of stroke patients are left with considerable residual deficits. The post
      stroke disabilities are due to loss of locomotion and activities of daily living, cognition
      and communication skills.Hemispatial neglect has been reported in association with damage to
      several different cerebral structures in a large-scale distributed neurocognitive
      network.Mirror therapy improves the hand function in sub-acute stroke. It also helps in the
      recovery of neglect in stroke patients. But little consensus exists as to whether one
      treatment is more efficacious than others and many studies fail to document duration of
      treatment effects or generalization to daily activities. The aim of our study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of limb activation with MT and limb activation strategy alone in the
      management of stroke patients with unilateral neglect and to make the patient functional in
      activities of daily living.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Star Cancellation Test Scores at 1,3, and 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1,3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SCT consisted of a page containing 52 large stars, 10 short words and 13 letters, randomly positioned, with 56 small stars interspersed. Subjects were instructed to cross out (with a black pen) all the small stars across the page. The tester demonstrated by crossing out the two central stars. The cut off score to establish presence of unilateral visual neglect were: 51 or fewer stars cancelled for SCT.
Minimum score: 0 Maximum score: 54
Higher scores: better outcome</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Line Bisection Test Scores at 1,3, and 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1,3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Line Bisection Test (LBT) consisted of three horizontal black lines, 20 cm long, one to the right, one central and one to the left side of a sheet of white paper (21cms X 30 cms). The patients were asked to ﬁnd and mark the centre of each line in turn. Errors away from true midline were measured, with leftward errors being given a negative sign, rightward errors a positive sign.
We took an absolute value for the change in error. The values for baseline to 1 month were calculated by subtracting baseline values from 1 month values. Then, the mean change was calculated for baseline to 1 month. Similar method was followed for the calculation of mean change in baseline to 3 months and 6 months.
The patients responses were similar for the three lines that they marked hence we took the first line for the interpretation. None of the patients had extreme errors like missed marking at 3 and 6 months.</description>

    <description>The FIM consists of 13 motor and 5 social-cognitive items, assessing self-care, sphincter management, transfer, locomotion, communication, social interaction and cognition.14 It uses a 7-level scale anchored by extreme rating of total dependence as 1 and complete independence as 7; the intermediate levels are: 6 modiﬁed independence, 5 supervision or set-up, 4 minimal contact assistance, 3 moderate assistance and 2 maximal assistance.
For the purpose of analysis we divided FIM into two categories ≤5 dependent, ≥6 independent.</description>

    <description>During the mirror practices, patients were seated close to a table on which a mirror (35×35cm) was placed vertically. The practice consisted of non paretic-side wrist and finger flexion and extension movements while patients looked into the mirror, watching the image of their noninvolved hand, thus seeing the reflection of the hand movement projected over the involved hand. Patients could see only the noninvolved hand in the mirror; otherwise, the noninvolved hand was hidden from sight. During the session patients were asked to try to do the same movements with the paretic hand while they were moving the non paretic hand.</description>

        <description>The FIM consists of 13 motor and 5 social-cognitive items, assessing self-care, sphincter management, transfer, locomotion, communication, social interaction and cognition.14 It uses a 7-level scale anchored by extreme rating of total dependence as 1 and complete independence as 7; the intermediate levels are: 6 modiﬁed independence, 5 supervision or set-up, 4 minimal contact assistance, 3 moderate assistance and 2 maximal assistance.
For the purpose of analysis we divided FIM into two categories ≤5 dependent, ≥6 independent.</description>

The practice consisted of non paretic-side wrist and finger flexion and extension movements while patients looked into the mirror, watching the image of their noninvolved hand, thus seeing the reflection of the hand movement projected over the involved hand. Patients could see only the noninvolved hand in the mirror; otherwise, the noninvolved hand was hidden from sight. During the session patients were asked to try to do the same movements with the paretic hand while they were moving the non paretic hand.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Line Bisection Test Scores at 1,3, and 6 Months</title>
        <description>The Line Bisection Test (LBT) consisted of three horizontal black lines, 20 cm long, one to the right, one central and one to the left side of a sheet of white paper (21cms X 30 cms). The patients were asked to ﬁnd and mark the centre of each line in turn. Errors away from true midline were measured, with leftward errors being given a negative sign, rightward errors a positive sign.
We took an absolute value for the change in error. The values for baseline to 1 month were calculated by subtracting baseline values from 1 month values. Then, the mean change was calculated for baseline to 1 month. Similar method was followed for the calculation of mean change in baseline to 3 months and 6 months.
The patients responses were similar for the three lines that they marked hence we took the first line for the interpretation. None of the patients had extreme errors like missed marking at 3 and 6 months.</description>

            <description>Mirror therapy: During the mirror practices, patients were seated close to a table on which a mirror (35×35cm) was placed vertically. The practice consisted of non paretic-side wrist and finger flexion and extension movements while patients looked into the mirror, watching the image of their noninvolved hand, thus seeing the reflection of the hand movement projected over the involved hand. Patients could see only the noninvolved hand in the mirror; otherwise, the noninvolved hand was hidden from sight. During the session patients were asked to try to do the same movements with the paretic hand while they were moving the non paretic hand.</description>

          <title>Mirror Therapy</title>
          <description>Mirror therapy: During the mirror practices, patients were seated close to a table on which a mirror (35×35cm) was placed vertically. The practice consisted of non paretic-side wrist and finger flexion and extension movements while patients looked into the mirror, watching the image of their noninvolved hand, thus seeing the reflection of the hand movement projected over the involved hand. Patients could see only the noninvolved hand in the mirror; otherwise, the noninvolved hand was hidden from sight. During the session patients were asked to try to do the same movements with the paretic hand while they were moving the non paretic hand.</description>

          <title>Control Group</title>
          <description>Group 2 will be given sham mirror therapy
Control group: The control group performed the same exercises for the same duration but used the nonreflecting side of the mirror in such a way that the paretic hand was hidden from sight. The same therapist delivered the control therapy to the patients. Both the treatment and the control group received limb activation.</description>
