      Background: A recent systematic review showed that patients undergoing esophagectomy for
      cancer had scores of physical function, vitality and performance of health in general
      significantly lower than those obtained from the reference population. The analysis of the
      quality of life at six months follow-up showed that the total score and physical function
      were better before surgery and symptoms-based scales indicated that the fatigue, dyspnoea and
      diarrhea were worse six months after esophagectomy. The objective of this study is therefore
      to assess the impact of esophageal resections for cancer on the quality of life of patients
      and to improve it through simple interventions of post operative care.

      The study is divided into two steps.

      This is step 1.

      Patients will be randomized into four groups receiving respectively: psychological counseling
      for support plus appropriate measures to reduce sleep-wake rhythm disorders during ICU stay;
      psychological counseling alone; appropriate measures to reduce sleep-wake rhythm disorders
      during ICU stay alone; or standard care. The primary end point are the items SL (sleep
      disorder) and QL2 of the QLQ C30, and the secondary end point is the score of the PSQI.
