      This multi-reader multi-case study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL®
      Labor Monitor® (SureCALL®) directly to the standard Tocodynamometer device (TOCO).

    <textblock>
      The SureCALL® Labor Monitor® (SureCALL®) is a transabdominal electromyography monitor
      intended to measure uterine activity. It is intended for use on pregnant women, with
      singleton pregnancies, using surface electrodes on the maternal abdomen. The device is
      intended for use by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting.

      This multi-reader multi-case study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL® to
      the predicate Tocodynamometer device (TOCO).

      This study involved 25 women at a Gestational Age of 36 weeks or less and 5 women at a
      Gestation Age of greater than 36 and not in labor at five clinical sites. Each study subject
      was instrumented with two technologies for measuring uterine activity:

        1. Standard tocodynamometer attached to the maternal abdomen,

        2. SureCALL® with a set of abdominal surface electrodes for uterine electromyography
           attached to the maternal abdomen

      An assessment was obtained and quantified from masked, qualified clinical obstetrician
      readers for the evaluation of the equivalence of both labor monitor devices by identifying in
      isolation the individual uterine contraction signals and the peak of each contraction signal
      as recorded by each labor monitor device.

    <measure>Comparison of SureCALL® and Tocodynamometer Detection of Contraction Events, as Identified by Readers</measure>
    <time_frame>9 - 41 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Agreement will be assessed by coefficient of individual agreement (CIA) derived from a dataset of all Reader-marked contractions. In addition, sensitivity and false positive rate per hours will be estimated for each patient by each reader. If CIA ≥ 0.445 (Barnhart, 2007, section 3) or CIA&gt;0.8, Pan 2010), the SureCALL® is not significantly different than the TOCO.</description>
