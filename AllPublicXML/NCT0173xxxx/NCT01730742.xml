  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to investigate whether sleep deprivation will affect a variety of
      measures, including hormones, immune system functioning, and behaviors related to food intake
      and hunger. It is predicted that sleep deprivation will affect circulating neutrophil
      activity, and do so via affects on DNA methylation. It is also predicted that sleep
      deprivation will up-regulate ghrelin, and down-regulate circulating oxytocin. Finally, it is
      predicted that sleep deprivation will increase participants' tendencies to pick larger
      portions of food, and also increase their tendency to purchase foods that are more caloric in
      a mock supermarket scenario.

    <measure>Neutrophil phagocytotic function production</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in 4 neutrophil phagocytotic function from baseline to 36hours later (after the nighttime intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This project is designed to test the inflammatory capacity of circulating neutrophils. It also aims to investigate if any changes in neutrophil efficacy are governed by alterations in DNA methylation.
Measured during 36 hours (at 1930 day 1, 0730 and 1930 day 2, 0730 day 3)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Portion Size Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in selected portion size from baseline to 1 hr after consuming a caloric preload</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated on their tendency to choose larger or smaller portions of a variety of meal items on a computer screen. This will be conducted both following sleep deprivation and sleep, and changes over the hour will be compared between these conditions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuro-economics task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in purchasing behaviour 1 hr after consuming a caloric preload</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated on their purchasing behavior with regards to high-calorie and low-calorie food items in a mock supermarket scenario following sleep and sleep deprivation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circulating hormone levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in circulating hormone levels from baseline (ie. 1930 - before sleep intervention) to 12hr later (0730 after the nighttime intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have their circulating hormone levels taken and analyzed, including ghrelin and oxytocin, to determine if sleep deprivation alters hormone levels related primarily to obesity or weight gain</description>
