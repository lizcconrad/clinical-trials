  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754)
      affect the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) and pharmacodynamics (ie, how
      the drug affects the body) of a single dose of glyburide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the
      assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same
      medication on the same days) to determine how canagliflozin (a drug currently being
      investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of glyburide (a blood glucose-lowering agent used to treat patients with
      diabetes). The study will consist of 3 phases; a screening phase, an open-label treatment
      phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. During the open-label treatment phase, each
      volunteer will receive a single 1.25 mg dose of glyburide on Day 1, followed by 200 mg
      canagliflozin once daily on Days 4 through 8. On Day 9 volunteers will receive both glyburide
      1.25 mg and canagliflozin 200 mg. Each volunteer will participate in the study for
      approximately 40 days.

    <description>Comparison of plasma concentrations of glyburide following administration of a single dose of glyburide alone or in combination with multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754). This will be used to determine whether there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between glyburide and canagliflozin.</description>

    <description>Plasma glucose concentrations following the administration of a single dose of glyburide after the administration of multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) will be used to determine whether there is a pharmacodynamic interaction (changes in plasma glucose) between glyburide and canagliflozin.

    <description>Plasma C-peptide is formed during the body's production of insulin. Plasma C-peptide concentrations following the administration of a single dose of glyburide after the administration of multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) will be used to determine whether there is a pharmacodynamic interaction (changes to plasma C-peptide) between glyburide and canaglifloxin. The area under the plasma C-peptide concentration-time curve (AUC) will be used as the key pharmacodynamic parameter.</description>
