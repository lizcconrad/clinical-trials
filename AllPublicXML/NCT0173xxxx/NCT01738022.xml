  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the upper airway recurrently closes during sleep. The
      mechanisms that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. Models to study
      mechanisms of airway collapse have been proposed. However, these models have not been tested
      in the human upper airway. Gas density and viscosity are different gas properties that
      influence upper airway collapse and are variables of different models. In this study,
      subjects will breathe gas mixtures of different densities and viscosities for brief periods
      of time in order to test those models.

      Models to study mechanisms of airway collapse have been proposed. However, these models have
      not been tested in the human upper airway. Gas density and viscosity are different gas
      properties that influence upper airway collapse and are variables of different models.

      In this study, subjects will breathe gas mixtures of different densities (helium and
      sulfur-hexafluoride) or viscosity (neon) for brief periods of time during flow-limited
      breaths. Flow limitation will be induced by sustained reductions of continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP). The investigators will test some models of upper airway collapse by
      observing if flow while breathing different gas mixtures scales according to the differences
      in density and viscosity.

    <description>Observed peak inspiratory flow while breathing different gas mixtures will be compared to model predicted flows.
Subjects will breathe different gas mixtures for 2 consecutive breaths only. Therefore the time frame is equal to one breath before gas mixture administration and two breaths after (usually 10-15 seconds).</description>
