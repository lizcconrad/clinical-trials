      Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single booster dose of NU300, co-administered with
      Prevnar 13® over a 28 day period following the injection compared to a single booster of
      ACTHIB co-administered with Prevnar 13® over a 28 day period following the injection.

      Evaluate the immunogenicity, as determined by anti-PRP polysaccharide response, of a single
      booster dose of NU300 co-administered with Prevnar 13® compared to a single booster dose of
      ActHIB® co-administered with Prevnar 13®.

      Evaluate the individual IgG antibody quantitative response to the 13 antigens in Prevnar 13®
      following NU300 co-administration with Prevnar 13® compared to the IgG antibody response to
      the pneumococcal polysaccharides following ActHIB® co-administration with Prevnar 13® 28 days
      following injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject

          2. Male or female subjects 12-15 months of age at the time of booster vaccination, who
             had previously received complete primary vaccination series with a licensed Hib
             product and Prevnar 13® in accordance with the FDA approved labels.

          3. Subjects for whom the investigator believes that the parent/guardian can and will
             comply with the requirements of the protocol

          4. Subjects free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and
             clinical examination before entering the study

          2. Any confirmed or suspected Haemophilus influenzae or pneumococcal illness.

          3. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period
             starting from 30 days before and ending 28 days after administration of study vaccines
             (before the blood draw at Visit 2).

          4. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 30
             days prior to dosing in the study.

             history of seizures, apnea, etc.

          8. Concurrent participation in another clinical study at any time during the study period
             or within the previous 6 months in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an
             investigational or non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product, formula, or
             device)

          9. Presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever at the time of
             vaccination (fever is defined as a temperature of ≥ 38.0C [100.4F]).

         10. Known history of thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.

         11. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccines.

         12. Known hypersensitivity to latex.

         13. The subject is unable to provide an adequate blood draw for immunogenicity assays, and
             safety panels at Visit 1
