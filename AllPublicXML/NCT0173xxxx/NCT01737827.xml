  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find out if INC280 is safe and has beneficial effects in patients with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma known to have dysregulation of c-MET pathway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a Phase II, single arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of INC280 as first-line treatment in patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not eligible for or had disease progression after
      surgical or locoregional therapies, with c- MET dysregulation.

      The study includes a Dose-Determining Part and a Dose Expansion Part. Pharmacokinetic and
      safety profiles of INC280 in the setting of liver dysfunction will be determined in the
      Dose-Determining Part. The Dose Expansion Part will start when the appropriate dose for
      patients with liver dysfunction is determined based on pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data
      from the Dose-Determining Part and other INC280 ongoing clinical studies.
