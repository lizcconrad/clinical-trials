    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the potential drug-drug interaction between dapivirine vaginal
      Ring-004 and vaginally administered miconazole nitrate, and will evaluate the safety of
      co-administration of the dapivirine vaginal ring and miconazole nitrate in healthy,
      HIV-negative women.
