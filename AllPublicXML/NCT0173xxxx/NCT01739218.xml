    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant
      bevacizumab in participants with initially unresectable, FIGO stage IIIC/IV ovarian, tubal,
      or peritoneal cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive 8 cycles of carboplatin plus
      paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab before surgery (interval debulking surgery [IDS]).
      Surgery will be scheduled 28 days after the last course of neoadjuvant treatment in
      participants with resectable cancer. Participants with unresectable cancer will go through
      the follow-up period. All participants will receive bevacizumab for Cycles 6 to 26.
