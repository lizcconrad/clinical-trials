  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chuvash polycythemia (CP) is a rare form of congenital polycythemia caused by mutations in
      the VHL gene. Currently, there are no therapies that have proven effective for CP. Recent
      studies have demonstrated that VHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor) regulates the
      activity of JAK2 (Janus kinase 2). In mouse models, inhibition of JAK2 reverses the CP
      phenotype. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that JAK2 inhibition may have significant
      clinical benefits for CP patients.

      Study involvement will last for 48 weeks. There will be approximately 11 visits through week
      48. Visits may take up to 2-3 hours to complete and occur every 4 weeks for the first 24
      weeks, then every 12 weeks until week 48.

      During each study visit, any or all of the following procedures may occur:

        -  List current medications and participant general health

        -  Obtain blood pressure, body weight, body temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate

        -  Measure Spleen by examination

        -  Obtain an abdominal MRI to evaluate spleen and any pre-existing or new blood clots

        -  Obtain blood samples for safety tests and to monitor kidney/liver function.

        -  Questionnaires for participant to complete regarding symptoms related to disease.

        -  Ruxolitinib dosing may be increased after 4 weeks if needed. The dose of the ruxolitinib
           may be reduced related to side effects.
