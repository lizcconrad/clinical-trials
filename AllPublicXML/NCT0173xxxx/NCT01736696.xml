    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in subjects with psoriasis to evaluate drug activity in this patient
      population by analysis of changes in psoriatic lesion biopsy characteristics. This subject
      population was selected to evaluate potentially relevant biological activity of CP-690,550 as
      well as assessing safety and pharmacokinetics.

    <description>EAUC 50 was calculated from a regression analyses using area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) as the independent variable. A sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model was used to explain the relationship between AUC and modified Psoriasis Severity Index (mPASI) score, where Emax was the maximum effect (100 percent reduction in the total mPASI score from baseline), and EAUC 50 was the AUC where 50 percent of the maximum effect was measured.</description>

    <description>Modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI) assessed lesion severity but not the body surface area affected. Severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration, scaling; ranged 0-4: 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Final mPASI = sum of the each component scores. Total score range 0-12 , higher score indicated more severity.</description>

    <description>Physician global assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis is a 7-point scale used to assess severity of psoriatic plaques, scaling and/or erythema. Severity scale ranged from 1 to 7: 1=severe, 2=moderate to severe, 3=moderate, 4=mild to moderate, 5=mild, 6=almost clear, 7=clear (no sign of psoriasis).</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR) and by Bazette’s formula (QTcB = QT divided by square root of RR). Participants with maximum increase from baseline of 30 to less than (&lt;) 60 msec(borderline) and greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 60 msec (prolonged) were summarized.</description>

          <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR) and by Bazette’s formula (QTcB = QT divided by square root of RR). Participants with maximum increase from baseline of 30 to less than (&lt;) 60 msec(borderline) and greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 60 msec (prolonged) were summarized.</description>

        <description>The degree of immunosuppression induced by the study drug administration was evaluated using a bioluminescent assay in which the concentration of Adenosine-5-Triphosphate (ATP) released by CD4 cells was measured. ATP concentrations released from stimulated and unstimulated cells were evaluated. ATP Concentration less than or equal to (&lt;=) 225: low immune cell response, 226 to 524: Moderate immune cell response, &gt;= 525: strong immune cell response.

        <title>Number of Participants With Modified Psoriasis Severity Index (mPASI) at Day 14</title>
        <description>Modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI) assessed lesion severity but not the body surface area affected. Severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration, scaling; ranged 0-4: 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Final mPASI = sum of the each component scores. Total score range 0-12 , higher score indicated more severity.</description>

Baseline was defined as mean of samples obtained at the screening visit within 7 days prior to Day 1, at the baseline biopsy, and Day 0.
