  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 10 minute baseline survey will be administered to parents of healthy newborn infants while
      in the hospital after delivery at Brigham and Women's Hospital, to be followed by a 25 minute
      survey 3-24 months later. We will measure parents' attitudes and preferences related to
      genome screening of newborns. The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To investigate whether parents' opinions regarding genome screening of newborns change
           between the first 48 hours post-partum and 3-24 months post-partum.

           a. We hypothesize that there will not be significant differences between interest in
           genome screening results in the 48 hours post-partum compared to 3-24 months
           post-partum.

        2. To determine whether seeing hypothetical genome screening results affects parents'
           decisions regarding whether they would want genome screening for their newborn.

             1. We expect many parents to state initially (in the 48 hours post-partum) that they
                would elect to have genome screening for their newborn if it were available. In the
                follow-up survey, half of study participants will receive hypothetical scenarios in
                which they will need to struggle with the probabilistic and ambiguous nature of the
                information that could be derived from genome sequencing. We will examine whether
                this alters their preferences. We will also explore whether parents who receive
                hypothetical genome screening results scenarios are more likely to alter their
                preferences than parents who do not receive hypothetical scenarios.

    <description>Newborn screening refusals are very rare. When they occur, they are tracked by nurses on the postpartum inpatient unit. At the start of all shifts for study recruitment, the research assistant will ask the nurse-in-charge if any patients refused newborn screening since the previous study recruitment shift.</description>
