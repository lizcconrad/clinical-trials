    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if aural rehabilitation adds measurable benefit and
      participant satisfaction to a cochlear implant recipient's overall treatment. Also, the study
      is designed to compare the efficacy of a commercially available aural rehabilitation program
      (LACE) and an electronic program which takes advantage of a traditional form of auditory
      training (NOOK) for cochlear implant users.
