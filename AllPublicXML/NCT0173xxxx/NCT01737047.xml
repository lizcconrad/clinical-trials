  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify medical conditions that may cause particular
      problems to individuals receiving care for HIV infection over the age of 50. In addition, as
      the effects and potentially the side effects, of HIV medication may change with age, this
      study will also investigate the association between age and differing effects of
      antiretroviral therapies such as treatment outcomes, side effects and the levels of drugs in
      blood.

      Results from this study may inform future HIV treatment guidelines on how we monitor
      individuals with HIV infection. The results may also assist in the design of future studies
      for the treatment of diseases associated with ageing.

      Multicentre, prospective, observational study over 3 years.

      Our study will describe the impact of advancing age on the experience of living with HIV in
      England and Ireland. To address this we will establish cohorts of HIV-positive people aged
      &gt;50 and &lt;50 years as well as demographically matched HIV-negative people aged &gt;50 years.

        1. To analyse the incidence and outcomes of co-morbidities in older-HIV-positive people and
           their relationship with demographic/clinical factors.

        2. To evaluate associations between antiretroviral drug concentrations and age, and to
           assess the potential impact of age on drug efficacy, drug-drug interactions and
           co-morbidities.

        3. To contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based recommendations
           for the clinical monitoring of older HIV-positive patients.

      2000 will be recruited in all either white or black african individuals (self reported) 1000
      will be Over 50 years of age and HIV positive, 500 will be under the age of 50 and will be
      HIV positive and 500 will be over the age of 50 and be HIV negative.
