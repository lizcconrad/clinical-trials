  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, health related
      quality of life and use of health resources associated with QUTENZA treatment when QUTENZA is
      used in standard clinical practice.

      The patient's primary diagnosis of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) will be classified into
      subtypes: post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN); HIV-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN); neuropathic back
      pain; cancer-related neuropathic pain; post-operative &amp; post-traumatic neuropathic pain; and
      'other' neuropathies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A detailed medical history will be taken, with particular emphasis on the primary PNP
      diagnosis. In addition to all current neuropathic pain medications, all previous therapies
      (pharmacological and surgical) for PNP from the point of primary diagnosis will be
      documented.

      QUTENZA treatments may be repeated up to every 90 days, in line with the Summary of Product
      Characteristics document (SPC) as determined by the persistence or return of pain.

      Patients who have not required treatment for 365 days or longer may re-enter a treatment
      cycle if their treating physician decides to retreat them with QUTENZA in the course of
      standard clinical management.

      The duration of participation for each patient will be at least 12 months following first
      QUTENZA treatment.

      Short questionnaires will be completed by the investigator whilst in contact with the patient
      (either in person or by telephone) at the following time points: 1) Screening prior to the
      first QUTENZA treatment; 2) at each QUTENZA treatment visit; 3) 2 weeks, 8 weeks following
      the first QUTENZA treatment 4) 12 weeks following each QUTENZA treatment; 5) any additional
      contact with the patient outside the protocol schedule.

      For patients not returning for retreatment with QUTENZA within any of 6 months, 9 months, and
      1 year of their previous QUTENZA treatment further follow-up questionnaires will be
      completed.

      End of study (EoS) is defined as one year after the last patient enrolled receives their
      first QUTENZA treatment.
