      The investigators aimed to evaluate effects of combined NMES, FEES and traditional swallowing
      rehabilitation in stroke patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)and Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing
      (FEES) are both promising approaches to enhance swallowing recovery for dysphagic patients.
      However, there is no literature on the effectiveness of combined application of these
      modalities in the treatment of patients with poststroke dysphagia. The purpose of this study
      was to prospectively investigate whether combined NMES, FEES and traditional swallowing
      rehabilitation can improve swallowing functions in patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia
      after stroke.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The FOIS is a 7-point ordinal scale reflecting the dietary intake of patients with dysphagia. It has adequate reliability and validity and has been used extensively in clinical studies of dysphagia to measure functional oral intake</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The degree of dysphagia</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of dysphagia was classified from grade 1 to 4 after detailed clinical swallowing evaluation including cranial nerve assessment, observations of swallowing and related movements and swallowing trials using various volumes and consistencies of food</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>swallowing VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient completed a perceptual evaluation of his swallowing ability using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). It was rated by answering a single question: ''How do you qualify your swallowing ability?'' Scores can vary from 0 (no difficulty at all) to 10 (unable to swallow).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>global satisfaction to the combination therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to rate the level of global satisfaction to the combination therapy. The rating was based on a 7-point categorical scale weighted from completely satisfied, satisfied, somewhat satisfied, no change, somewhat unsatisfied, unsatisfied to completely unsatisfied.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The occurrence of adverse events or pneumonia</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6-month follow-up</time_frame>

    <description>Patients received 12 sessions of NMES for 1 hour /day, 5 days/week within a period of 2-3 weeks. FEES was done before and after NMES for evaluation and guiding therapy. All patients subsequently received 12 sessions of traditional swallowing rehabilitation (50 minutes/day, 3 days/week) for 4 weeks.</description>
