  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigation of application possibilities of optical spectroscopy within the field of
      oncology. Optical spectroscopy enables the possibility to specifically differentiate between
      different (human) tissues. The hypothesis is that incorporation of this technique into
      existing medical devices (e.g. biopsy needle) would enlarge the accuracy and reliability of
      these devices. The purpose is to improve and speed up the diagnostics and therapy of the
      malignancies.

      Primary Objective:

      In this observational study the investigators aim to evaluate whether optical spectroscopy
      can correctly diagnose malignant tissue in the existing clinical workflow of percutaneous
      interventions in lung, liver, and breast.

      Secondary Objective:

      During the measurement procedure, possible improvements of the measurement hardware will be
      recorded. Analysis of this documentation will provide information for possible alterations of
      hardware design for improved clinical applicability in the future. Special attention will be
      paid to observe how the procedure fits in the standard workflow of the radiologist.
