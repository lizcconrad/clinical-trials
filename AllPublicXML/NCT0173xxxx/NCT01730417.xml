      The goal of this proposal is to produce and test high specific activity Ultratrace iobenguane
      I 123 in normal human volunteers. The low specific activity iobenguane I 123 has been shown
      to be useful for the detection and staging of neuroendocrine tumors in adults and children
      and imaging neuronal activity in the heart. The innovation in this proposal is through the
      use of patented solid phase technology to produce a proven diagnostic agent at extremely high
      specific activity to increase sensitivity and specificity and lower radiation exposure to
      normal organs without the pharmacologically active cold carrier compound. The FDA considers
      iobenguane labeled with two different isotopes of iodine [I-131 and I-123] as two distinct
      drugs requiring distinct regulatory applications.

      To meet the required quality standards for the chemistry, manufacturing and controls
      component of an IND application, GMP quality polymer drug precursor is used to generate the
      Ultratrace diagnostic iodine-123 agent. Analytical methods were validated with the proposed
      final drug formulation to demonstrate the final drug does not interfere with tests used to
      define the identity, purity, and strength of the agent. The drug product was verified for
      apyrogenicity and sterility before human testing. The IND application was written and
      submitted to the FDA and the Duke Medical Center IRB. MIP produces clinical trial material,
      and will conduct human testing of the radioactive drug substance for safety and superiority
      compared to conventional iobenguane I 123 in normal healthy volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  normal healthy volunteers with written informed consent who understand and are willing
             to comply with protocol requirements

          -  at least 21 years of age

          -  if female, then not of childbearing potential as documented by history (e.g., tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy) or is post menopausal with a minimum 1 year without menses

          -  if female of childbearing potential, a negative serum beta HCG pregnancy test within
             24 hours prior to receiving iobenguane I 123

          -  if female of childbearing potential, agrees to use an acceptable form of birth
             control, defined as abstinence or use of IUD, oral contraceptive, barrier and
             spermicide, or hormonal implant, throughout the study period

          -  No existing predisposition to administration of thyroid blocking potassium iodide

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  females who are nursing

          -  documented history of significant allergy that required medical intervention to
             shellfish, X-ray contrast media, iodine/iodides, or iobenguane

          -  administered a radioisotope within 5 effective half-lives of that radioisotope prior
             to study enrollment

          -  abnormal screening laboratory studies (serum creatinine, SPOT, SGPT, total bilirubin
             as defined by standard laboratory reference ranges)

          -  those who have received an investigational compound and/or medical device within 30
             days of entering this study

          -  pre-existing medical condition or circumstances which would significantly decrease the
             chances of obtaining reliable data, achieving study objectives, or completing the
             study, (e.g. cancer, heart disease, or other medical conditions which potentially
             alter normal biodistribution)

          -  is determined by the investigator that the patient is clinically unsuitable for the
             study

          -  are taking medication which inhibits uptake of iobenguane I 123 within 2 weeks of
             enrollment, or tricyclic antidepressants or related drugs within 6 weeks of
             enrollment. Categories of medications include sympathomimetics, antihypertensives and
             cardiovascular agents, opioids, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and
             medications as previously published

          -  have participated in a clinical trial with an investigational drug in the past 30
             days.
