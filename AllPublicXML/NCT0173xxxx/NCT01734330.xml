      Background: Pharmacological strategies to improve smoking cessation have been largely
      studied. The efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy associated to nicotine replacement in
      tobacco cessation has not yet been demonstrated.

      Objective: Evaluate if cognitive behavior therapy during six weeks associated to nicotine
      replacement for twelve weeks is able to contribute to tobacco cessation at the end of 52
      weeks.

      Methods: Multicentre, open-label, and pragmatic randomized controlled trial will include 334
      patients. Analysis will follow intention-to-treat principle.

      Patients older than 18 years old and who had smoked at least 5 cigarettes in the past year
      before randomization will be included.

      All of them will receive nicotine replacement therapy with patches and gum. They will be
      randomized 1:1 ratio to attend or not cognitive behavior therapy once a week for the first
      six weeks of the treatment. Every two weeks all of the patients will be evaluated by a
      physician in order to access any adverse effects from the nicotine replacement.

      All patients will have carbon monoxide levels accessed at baseline and after 6 weeks.
      Telephonic interview will be done at 16, 28, and 52 weeks to access the rates of tobacco
      cessation, relapses episodes and abstinence maintenance.
