             core involved in cancer

          -  Clinical stage T1c-T2a (Initial diagnosis of T1a/T1b obtained during a TURP is not

          -  No known hypersensitivity or intolerance to metformin hydrochloride

          -  No condition associated with increased risk of metformin hydrochloride-associated
             lactic acidosis (e.g., congestive heart failure defined as NYHA class III or IV
             function status, history of acidosis of any type, or habitual intake of ≥ 3 alcoholic
             beverages per day, or age greater than 80)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous prostate cancer treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,
             oral glucocorticoids, GnRH analogues)

          -  Diabetes including type 1 diabetes. Patients with known type 2 diabetes are eligible
             provided they have not been on metformin during the previous 12 months and are not on
             any other pharmacological agents.

             properties including 5-ARIs (dutasteride and finasteride)

          -  Prostate volume greater than 80 cc. (as per TRUS biopsy report)

          -  Prostatic surgery or procedure within 3 months of screening visit

             NMIBC or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5
             years

          -  Planned or concurrent participation in other interventional randomized trials
             including exercise

          -  The presence of any other coexistent medical condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator would have the potential to significantly limit adherence to medication,
             or ability to absorb the medication including but not limited to psychiatric
             conditions, malabsorption syndromes or severe ischemic heart disease

          -  Known hypersensitivity or intolerance to metformin

          -  Concurrent or planned participation in randomized trials of weight loss or exercise
             interventions or trials targeting insulin, IGF-1 or their receptors, or PI3K
             inhibitors.
