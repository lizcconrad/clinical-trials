  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogenic differentiated adipocytes (ANT-adip-AL) is produced by well-established techniques
      including cell harvesting from lipoaspirates obtained from healthy donors, expansion of
      adipose tissue derived stem cells, and differentiation into pure and immature adipocytes.
      This was an open-label study. Subjects were received subcutaneous injection of ANT-adip-AL
      and followed for 8 weeks according to the clinical trial protocol.
