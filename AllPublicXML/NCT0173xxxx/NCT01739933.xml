  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilated ICU patients frequently have sepsis and the majority have delirium, a form of
      brain dysfunction that is an independent predictor of increased risk of dying, length of
      stay, costs, and prolonged cognitive impairment in survivors. Universally prescribed sedative
      medications—the GABA-ergic benzodiazepines—worsen this brain organ dysfunction. The available
      alternative sedation regimens, the shorter acting GABA-ergic propofol, and the alpha2
      agonist, dexmedetomidine, have both been shown to be superior to benzodiazepines, and yet are
      different with regard to their effects on innate immunity, bacterial clearance, apoptosis,
      cognition and delirium. The MENDS II study will compare propofol and dexmedetomidine, and
      determine the best sedative medication to reduce delirium and improve survival and long-term
      brain function in our most vulnerable patients— the ventilated septic patient.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) secondary to sepsis is the leading cause of
      admission to the intensive care unit, often necessitating sedation for patient safety and
      comfort. Recently, we have learned that these sedative medications contribute to iatrogenic
      injury, such as prolonging ventilator time and ICU length of stay and exacerbating acute
      brain dysfunction. This acute brain dysfunction, manifested as delirium and coma, occurs in
      50%-70% of MV septic patients and is a significant contributor not only to death but also to
      functional and cognitive decline, which can persist for years after recovery of lung and
      other organ function, levying significant costs to patients and society. Despite advances in
      the management of acute respiratory failure and sepsis, few clinical trials have examined the
      effects that supportive therapies, like sedation, may have on both short- and long-term
      outcomes in this vulnerable population. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic
      benzodiazepines, in particular, have been shown to increase brain dysfunction, promote
      infection, and prolong MV. Therefore, the short-acting GABA-ergic sedative propofol and the
      alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine are becoming widely used to sedate septic MV patients. There
      are only a few randomized trials, however, to guide clinicians when selecting between these
      and other sedatives, and none have explored the mechanisms underlying the differences in
      outcomes, though some data indicate that GABA-ergic and alpha2 agonist agents have very
      different effects on innate immunity, apoptosis, arousability, and respiratory drive. In
      early animal and human studies, dexmedetomidine had more anti-inflammatory effects than the
      GABA-ergic agents; dexmedetomidine improved bacterial clearance, whereas propofol impaired
      it. In addition, sedation with dexmedetomidine instead of benzodiazepines reduces delirium by
      20%-30% and improves arousability, cognition, and attentiveness in ventilated patients.
      Alpha2 agonists induce unconsciousness at the brainstem—more akin to natural sleep—which may
      improve autonomic function and immunity. All these factors converge to suggest that sedation
      with an alpha2 agonist rather than a GABAergic agent may improve outcomes, including brain
      function, MV, and survival, for septic MV patients. We therefore propose the MENDS II
      (Maximizing the Efficacy of Sedation and Reducing Neurological Dysfunction and Mortality in
      Septic Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure) study, in which we will test the hypotheses
      that sedation of MV severely septic patients with an alpha2 agonist (dexmedetomidine) rather
      than a GABAergic agent (propofol) will (Aim 1A) increase days alive without delirium or coma,
      (Aim 1B) increase ventilator-free days, (Aim 2A) improve 90-day survival, (Aim 2B) decrease
      long-term cognitive impairment, and (Aim 3) reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade
      following sepsis. We will randomize 420 ventilated, severely septic patients requiring
      goal-directed sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol, giving the study 85% power to detect
      a difference of 1.5 delirium/coma-free days and an absolute difference in mortality of 12%
      between the two groups.

    <description>The analysis of DCFDs will be conducted using Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who were randomized to study drug. We chose a 14 day evaluation period for delirium, because it represents the best balance of gaining valuable clinical information, while maximizing resource utilization, given the average study drug infusion to be 7 days and maximum duration to be 14 days. Thus our follow-up period will cover 7 additional days of delirium monitoring after the study drug is stopped in the majority of our patients.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Consecutive patients will be eligible for inclusion in the MENDS II study if they are: [1]
        adult patients (≥18 years old) [2] in a medical and/or surgical ICU and [3] on MV and
        requiring sedation and [4] have suspected or known infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded (i.e., not consented) for any of the following reasons:

          1. Rapidly resolving organ failure, indicated by planned immediate discontinuation of MV,
             at time of screening for study enrollment

          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding

          3. Severe dementia or neurodegenerative disease, defined as either impairment that
             prevents the patient from living independently at baseline or IQCODE &gt;4.5, measured
             using a patient's qualified surrogate. This exclusion also pertains to mental
             illnesses requiring long-term institutionalization, acquired or congenital mental
             retardation, severe neuromuscular disorders, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's
             disease. It also excludes patients in coma or with severe deficits due to structural
             brain diseases such as stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, cranial trauma, malignancy,
             anoxic brain injury, or cerebral edema.

          4. History of 2nd or 3rd degree heart block, bradycardia &lt; 50 beats/minute, pacemaker for
             bradyarrythmias or uncompensated shock.If patient has a pacemaker for bradyarrythmias,
             then patient does not meet this exclusion criterion and may be enrolled.

          5. Benzodiazepine dependency or history of alcohol dependency based on the medical team's
             decision to institute a specific treatment plan involving benzodiazepines (either as
             continuous infusions or intermittent intravenous boluses) for this dependency.

          6. Active seizures during this ICU admission being treated with intravenous
             benzodiazepines.

          7. Expected death within 24 hours of enrollment or lack of commitment to aggressive
             treatment by family/medical team (e.g., likely to withdraw life support measures
             within 24 hrs of screening)

          8. Inability to understand English or deafness or vision loss that will preclude delirium
             evaluation. The inability to understand English (for example in Spanish-only or
             Mandarin-only speaking patients) will not result in exclusion at centers where the
             research staff is proficient and/or translation services are actively available in
             that particular language; these patients will not be followed in the long-term
             follow-up phase of the trial since the testing materials are primarily available only
             in English. Patients with laryngectomies and those with hearing deficits are eligible
             for enrollment if their medical condition permits them to communicate with research
             staff.

          9. Inability to obtain informed consent from an authorized representative within 48 hours
             of meeting all inclusion criteria, i.e., developing sepsis and qualifying organ
             dysfunction criteria for the following reasons:

               1. Attending physician refusal.

               2. Patient and/or surrogate refusal.

               3. Patient unable to consent and no surrogate available.

               4. 48-hour period of eligibility was exceeded before the patient was screened.

         10. Prisoners.

         11. Medical team following patient unwilling to use the sedation regimens.

         12. Documented allergy to propofol or dexmedetomidine.

         13. Current enrollment in a study that does not allow co-enrollment or that uses delirium
             as a primary outcome.

         14. Patients who are on muscle relaxant infusions at time of screening with plans to
             maintain paralysis &gt;48 hours.

         15. Greater than 96 hours on mechanical ventilation prior to meeting all inclusion
             criteria.
