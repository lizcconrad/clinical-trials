  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Funded by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services - Medicaid Technical Assistance and
      Policy Program (MEDTAPP), the &quot;Child Health Excellence Center - a University-Practice-Public
      Partnership&quot; (CHEC-UPPP) focuses on improving the health of Ohio's children in 3 target
      areas: 1) prevention of dental decay; 2) detection and management of overweight and obesity;
      and 3) lead screening. These topics represent critical public health issues for Ohio's
      children.

      The study is based on strong evidence that interventions are needed to improve practice in
      the target areas and that achieving these goals represents fundamental improvements in child
      health care that would reduce morbidity and costs. The approach for the study involves a
      trained Practice Facilitator (PF) working with multiple pediatric and family medicine
      practices to create change tailored to individual practice preferences and methods of
      operation.

      Our overall hypothesis is that a university-community consortium, utilizing evidence-based
      methods (involving education plus a facilitated, practice-tailored approach) will increase
      the rates of targeted services in primary care practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research design involves a sample of 30 primary care practices (a combination of
      pediatric and family medicine) from across Northeast Ohio who have at least a 20% Medicaid
      patient population. We are using a cross-over study design. After the run-in period during
      which baseline data is collected via chart review and all practices receive basic education
      in the 3 focal areas of lead, dental and obesity screening, the practices will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups.

      The Phase 1 group will receive the practice-tailored intervention with the Practice
      Facilitator (PF) starting immediately after randomization and continuing for 6 months. The
      Phase 2 group will start their practice-tailored intervention with the PF 4 months
      post-randomization and continue through post-randomization month 10.

      This design gives us a natural 'control' group (Phase 2 group) for the first four months
      post-randomization. The Phase 2 group will have had the same Run-in Phase education as the
      Phase 1 group, but will not be starting the practice-tailored intervention with the study
      facilitator for 4 months, at which time they will cross-over to their Intervention Phase.

      Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 groups will have a 2 month Follow-up Phase after the completion of
      their 6 month Intervention Phase. During the Follow-up Phase they will strive to continue
      reaching the outcome measures on their own without the support of the PF. This will give us
      an opportunity to assess short-term sustainability of the rates of delivery of services
      achieved during the Intervention Phase.

    <intervention_name>Practice-tailored intervention to increase rates of targeted services</intervention_name>
    <description>Over a 6 month period, the Practice Facilitator (PF), offers individualized suggestions, strategies and tools for streamlining processes and incorporating new ideas into the flow of a practice's work day to increase their rates of delivery of the 3 targeted services of lead screening, obesity detection and dental decay prevention.
During the intervention visits the PF reviews a small number of recent well-visit charts. This allows for rapid feedback to a practice on their progress as they work toward reaching outcome measures. It also provides 'real time' feedback regarding the degree to which suggested interventions are working, allowing the PF to change the approach as needed.</description>
