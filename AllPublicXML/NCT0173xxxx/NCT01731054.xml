      The primary objectives of the study are as follows: To develop and optimize a renal
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol consisting of Diffusion-Weighted
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI), Blood-Oxygen- Level-Dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI), Arterial
      Spin Labeling MRI (ASL-MRI), Phase Contrast MRI (PC-MRI), and T1rho-MRI; To compare renal
      functional MRI cross-sectional readouts between normal healthy volunteers (NHV) and lupus
      nephritis (LN) participants.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: Explore whether renal functional MRI
      techniques discriminate between renal inflammatory activity and damage in lupus nephritis
      (LN); To examine whether renal functional MRI measurements correlate with laboratory features
      of renal involvement and renal function in participants with lupus nephritis (LN).

    <criteria>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a documented diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to
             current American Academy of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. At least 4 American Academy
             of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria must be documented, 1 of which must be a positive
             antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Sm, or anti-double stranded DNA antibody.

          -  Must have a standard of care renal biopsy for lupus nephritis performed or scheduled
             within +/-7 days of Day 1.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a metal device affected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI )(e.g., any type of
             electronic, mechanical, or magnetic implant; cardiac pacemaker; aneurysm clips;
             implanted cardiac defibrillator), or has potential ferromagnetic foreign body (metal
             slivers, metal shavings, other metal objects) that would be a contraindication for
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  History of renal transplant.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes or other condition that may result in significant
             renal disease.

        NOTE: Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
