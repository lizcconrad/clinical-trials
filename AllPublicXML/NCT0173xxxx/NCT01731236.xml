  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal goal for the study is to examine the role gut flora plays in modulating
      metabolism of dietary trimethylamine nutrients in humans. We have recently shown that dietary
      intake of two trimethylamines abundant in animal products, carnitine and the choline group of
      phosphatidylcholine (PC), are mechanistically linked to cardiovascular disease risk. We wish
      to further explore the metabolism of these nutrients in humans, and to test the hypothesis
      that the intestinal micro flora (gut flora) plays a critical role in generation of
      metabolites from dietary carnitine and choline/PC linked to cardiometabolic disease. We
      further hypothesize that the production of specific metabolites of carnitine and choline/PC
      are influenced by the composition of gut flora, and these may be altered by the preceding
      dietary patterns of the subjects. We therefore wish to test whether dietary supplementation
      with carnitine and/or choline alters the metabolism of carnitine and choline/PC in subjects.
      We also hypothesize that transient suppression or modulation of gut flora via short-term
      broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, or by reconstitution of micro flora composition via
      probiotic therapy, in healthy subjects, can alter the metabolism of carnitine and choline/PC.
      We will also examine the impact of low dose aspirin on these pathways by examining subjects
      before versus after taking aspirin.
