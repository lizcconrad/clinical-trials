  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Removal of colorectal adenomas prevents the occurence of colorectal cancers. The use of
      chromo-endoscopy has been shown to improve the detection of flat adenomas. Narrow band
      imaging enables endoscopists to accurately describe the pit pattern of adenomas. By comparing
      White Light Endoscopy and Bright Narrow Band Imaging it will show if there is any comparable
      advantage to using one or the other for lesion detection and assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Removal of colorectal adenomas prevents occurrence of cancers [1]. It is recognized that
      colonoscopy can miss colorectal adenomas and early cancers [2]. There is a need to further
      improve performance of colonoscopy. The use of chromoendoscopy has been shown to improve
      detection of flat adenomas [3]. Narrow band imaging was introduced in year 2006. It is
      similar to chromoendoscopy in that it provides more mucosal details. This enables
      endoscopists to accurately describe the pit pattern of adenomas. NBI has been used as a
      substitute to chromoendoscopy.

      In pooled analysis, NBI is comparable to chromoendoscopy in their sensitivity and specificity
      in the diagnosis of malignant colorectal adenomas [4]. Unfortunately, the use of NBI has not
      been shown to conclusively improve rate of colorectal adenoma detection. Two of 3 randomized
      trials that compared WLE to NBI showed a higher adenoma detection rate with the use of NBI
      [5, 6]. In a study by Rex et al., the rate was however similar with either modality. In a
      pooled analysis, NBI was only marginally better than WLE [7].

      The effective use of NBI depends on the quality of bowel preparation and the experience of
      endoscopist. In the presence of fecal matters, NBI tends to be dark and detection of small
      adenomas becomes difficult. The prototype bright NBI coupled with high definition resolution
      is likely to overcome this drawback of original NBI.
