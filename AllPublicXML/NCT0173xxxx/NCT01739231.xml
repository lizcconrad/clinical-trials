    <textblock>
      This is a research study about an experimental (investigational) oral ETEC vaccine (ACE527).
      ACE527 is a live attenuated vaccine that is being made to prevent disease from
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which causes watery diarrhea, largely in children
      living in developing countries and in travelers to those countries. This research study is
      also testing an investigational adjuvant called dmLT. An adjuvant is something that is added
      to a vaccine to make it work better. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, Part A
      aims to find out if the vaccine by itself or the vaccine combined with the adjuvant is safe,
      tolerable, and initiates an immune response. Second, Part B aims to find out if the vaccine
      by itself or the vaccine combined with teh adjuvant prevents diarrheal disease when
      challenged with ETEC H10407. About 60 healthy adults, ages 18-50, will participate in Part A,
      and they will be required to stay in the research facility for several nights for the first
      dose, but will not be required to stay overnight for the second and third doses. Participants
      will be assigned to receive either the vaccine alone, the vaccine with adjuvant, or placebo
      by mouth. Study procedures include: stool samples, blood samples, and documentation of side
      effects. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for about 8 months.

      Interested volunteers from Part A will along with volunteers who were never vaccinated in
      Part A will return to participate in Part B. These volunteers will be required to stay
      overnight in the research facility for several nights after challenge, after which they will
      be treated with antibiotics and sent home. Study procedures include stool samples, blood
      samples, and documentation of infection with ETEC H10407. If the vaccine with/without
      adjuvant is effective, the volunteers should not development diarrhea, but if the vaccine
      with/without adjuvant is not effective, the volunteers will have diarrhea for a few days.

      This study is a single site, Phase 1/2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and
      efficacy of a live attenuated ETEC vaccine, ACE527, with and without a mucosal adjuvant,
      dmLT. ACE527 comprises three genetically attenuated and engineered strains of E. coli, with
      antigen profiles covering a wide range of ETEC surface colonization factor antigens (CFA/I,
      CFA/II [CS1, CS2, CS3] and CFA/IV [CS5, CS6]) and also expressing LT-B, the inactive subunit
      of LT (ETEC heat labile toxin). LT(R192G/L211A), or dmLT, is a derivative of wild-type
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin that has been genetically modified
      by replacing the arginine at amino acid position 192 with glycine and the leucine at amino
      acid position 211 with alanine. Approximately 36 volunteers (projected enrollments plus
      possible alternates) will be enrolled in Part A into each of two separate Cohorts.
      Approximately 30 volunteers per Cohort will be randomized to receive 10^10 cfu total live
      dose ACE527 vaccine alone, 10^10 cfu total live dose ACE527 vaccine + 25 µg dmLT, or placebo.
      The placebo preparation will be CeraVacx, which is being used as the buffer in both vaccine
      formulations. Cohort 1 and 2 volunteers will receive 10^10 cfu total dose of ACE527, 10^10
      cfu total dose of ACE527 with 25 µg dmLT, or placebo at 0, 1, and 2 months. Enrollment and
      dosing of Cohort 2 will be dependent on an acceptable safety profile of the first dose of
      Cohort 1, based on evaluation of data up until Day 3 by the Safety Review Committee (SRC).
      The first immunization of each Cohort will be administered in the Center for Immunization
      Research (CIR) Inpatient Unit, followed by 72 hours of direct post-immunization observation.
      A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will meet after the first dose of cohort to determine
      continuation of volunteer dosing on an outpatient basis, and enrollment of Cohort 2. The SRC
      will meet again after the first dose of Cohort 2; if after review by the SRC the first dose
      appears safe and well tolerated, subsequent doses will be administered on an outpatient
      basis. Safety will be assessed by solicited symptoms/subject memory aid and laboratory
      evaluations. Adverse events (AE)s will be graded according to standardized criteria. The
      immunogenicity outcome measures of interest include serum IgG and IgA antibodies by ELISA
      against all vaccine antigens, cytokine assays, B and T cell memory responses, shedding
      profile of ACE527, and vaccine specific mucosal IgA responses

      Part B challenge cohorts will include at least 14 and up to 24 volunteers per vaccine
      treatment group, recruited among those participating in Part A; at least 4 and up to 12
      placebo recipients recruited among those participating in Part A; plus additional
      unvaccinated control volunteers sufficient to enroll up to a total of 60 recruited, as
      needed. Volunteers in the Phase 2b study will be enrolled and challenged in 2-4 cohorts due
      to the CIR Inpatient Unit capacity of 30 beds. A minimum of 8-10 controls will be challenged
      with each cohort of vaccinees to ensure comparability of attack rates across challenge
      cohorts. Volunteers will be admitted as inpatients and challenged, with approximately 2 x
      10^7 cfu of the fully virulent ETEC strain, H10407, followed by 5 days of direct observation.
      A Data Review Committee (DRC) will be convened to review the clinical data for all challenged
      volunteers and verify all outcomes per protocol definitions before any vaccine efficacy
      assessments are made.

      This study was designed initially as a single site, Phase 1, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of a live attenuated ETEC vaccine, ACE527, with and without a mucosal
      adjuvant, dmLT. The addition of this challenge step provides a unique opportunity to evaluate
      the efficacy of the new lyophilized formulation of ACE527 vaccine, given in a two or three
      dose regimen, with and without dmLT, against wild type ETEC strain H10407 challenge
      (designated as Part B: Phase 2b Open Label Challenge Study). In addition, challenging the
      volunteers may allow for the identification of immune correlates of protection, taking
      advantage of newly available technologies (immune proteomics, transcriptomics, etc.) This is
      a first in man study to explore the immunogenicity and efficacy of lyophilized ACE527 alone
      and in combination with dmLT. The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the
      safety, reactogenicity tolerability, and immunogenicity of a lyophilized, oral, live
      attenuated, ETEC vaccine designated ACE527 when administered orally with or without double
      mutant heat labile toxin (dmLT) at Days 0, 28, and 56; and to evaluate vaccine efficacy 4-6
      months later after with ETEC H10407. The secondary objectives are to examine shedding of
      ACE527 during the week following each vaccination, to assess whether dmLT enhances the
      immunogenicity of the ACE527 vaccine, and to measure the protective efficacy of 2 or 3 doses
      of vaccine and vaccine plus adjuvant against severe diarrhea resulting from challenge with
      ETEC strain H10407.
