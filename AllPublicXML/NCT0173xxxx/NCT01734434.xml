    <textblock>
      This study will collect information regarding the factors that might influence access of
      pregnant women to the local healthcare system. The main visits of the study will be screening
      &amp; enrollment, delivery and 90 day infant follow-up. Data will be collected mainly from
      questionnaires administered to pregnant women at these visits. The questionnaires contain the
      following standard questions which will be asked at each visit, in addition to some
      visit-specific questions related to delivery and health status of infants up to 90 days of
      age. The standard questions will be related to the following aspects:

        -  Logistics of transportation to the study site (type, time it takes, cost incurred)

        -  Accessibility to a telephone/cell phone

        -  Provisions of alternative child care during site visits if there are other children
           under the subject's care
