    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that the local control for both arms were not statistically significant, when
      irradiation to the post-induction chemotherapy tumor volume is compared with irradiation to
      the pre-induction chemotherapy tumor volume.While elective nodal irradiation will be omitted
      for both arms.

    <description>For patients who are randomized to study arm, (i.e. to irradiate the post-chemotherapy tumor extent) the clinical target volume-tumor (CTV-T) includes the post-chemotherapy gross tumor volume-tumor (GTV-T) with a margin of 0.8 cm.
Chemotherapy includes etoposide 100mg/m2 d1-d3 combine with cisplatin 80mg/m2 d1 at 21-day interval for 4 cycles.
Radiotherapy will be administered with cycle 3 chemotherapy（1.5 Gy twice daily to 45 Gy in 30 fractions over 3 weeks）</description>
