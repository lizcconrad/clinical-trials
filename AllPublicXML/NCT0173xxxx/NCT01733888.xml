  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental fluorosis is a clinical manifestation of chronic exposure to high intakes of fluoride
      during the tooth development.

      The present study is planned to evaluate the efficacy of Resin Infiltration technique in
      improving the esthetics of non-pitted fluorosis stains on permanent anterior teeth. Resin
      infiltration is a novel method that has shown its efficacy in improving the esthetics of
      White spot lesions (WSLs) per say and post orthodontics WSLs in different both in-situ and
      in-vivo studies. The Resin Infiltration technique is also known to stop the progression of
      caries in non cavitated lesions in both, smooth surface and interproximal lesions.

      Therefore, the following trial will be conducted to assess the esthetic improvement of
      fluorosed permanent anterior teeth after resin infiltration and compare it with standard
      bleaching procedure and a combination of bleaching and Resin infiltration therapy in children
      with damaged teeth by fluorosis.

    <description>In this group before starting the procedure the teeth intended to be treated will be cleaned with pumice and after that cheek retractors will be placed and exposed lip surface will be covered with petroleum gel. Thereafter, teeth will be dried and gingival Barrier will be applied to both arches, slightly overlapping enamel and interproximal spaces. Light curing of the gingival barrier will be done in a fanning motion for 10-20 seconds . Once the gingival barrier will be cured then homogeneous mixing of the powder and liquid will be done in powder pot, followed by application of thick layer of gel to all teeth undergoing treatment. The gel will be then left in place for 8 minutes and after that the gel will be removed using a surgical aspirator tip.</description>

    <description>In this group after taking pre-operative photographs the fluorosed tooth will be isolated using rubber dam and the Resin infiltrant (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany) will be applied as per manufactures' instructions. For this purpose, after rubber dam application tooth surface will be dried using cotton rolls and air syringe. Icon Etchant will be applied and left for 2 minutes followed by rinsing and air drying for 30 sec. After complete etching, Drying agent (99% ethanol), as supplied in the Icon kit. Resin infiltrant will then be applied and allowed to seep in for 3 minutes followed by light curing for 40 seconds followed by cleaning of the surface with pumice and rubber polishing cup and rinsing with water for 30 sec. After application, patient will be instructed neither to eat nor brush their teeth for 45 minutes.</description>

    <description>In this group vital bleaching will be done using 35 % Hydrogen Peroxide (Pola Office, SDI, Australia), as explained in intervention &quot;bleaching&quot;; followed by wash over period of 20 days. After 20 days the patient will be recalled and on the day of appointment initially a new preoperative photograph shall be taken, then the fluorosed tooth will be isolated using rubber dam and the Resin infiltrant (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany) will be applied as per manufactures' instructions, similar to intervention &quot;Icon Infiltration&quot;. For this group a postoperative photograph shall be taken after the application of RI and then the circle of post-operative recall shall be counted from here, that is, 1week, 1 month and 6 months respectively.</description>
