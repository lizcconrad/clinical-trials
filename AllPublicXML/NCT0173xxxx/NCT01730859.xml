    <textblock>
      Both taping and balance exercises have effects on dynamic balance, so this study compared
      ankle taping and balance exercise on postural stability indices in healthy women. we
      hypothesized that both balance exercise and taping would increase stability indices but the
      effects of balance exercise was more greater than taping.

      The ability to control the body in the space is a complex interaction between musculoskeletal
      and neural systems. This set is called postural control system. Postural control involves the
      control of body position in space for the dual purposes of postural stability and postural
      orientation. Balance process is divided into four-stage by Sullivan and Markos: mobility,
      stability, controlled mobility, and skill. Several types of exercise have been proposed to
      improve proprioception. Bout and Gahery stated that balance exercises improve neuromuscular
      relations and reduces the proprioception errors. They believe that those who have more
      proprioception difficulty may benefit more from exercise therapy.Taping is another technique
      to enhance proprioception. Improvement in proprioception leads to better function and
      reduction of disability. Kinesiotaping is being used to prevent injuries and to help curing
      the injury. It can also improve efficiency in sport, improve lymph and venous circulation,
      decrease edema, stimulate the mechanoreceptors and increase awareness of subject about the
      ankle position, reduces the pain and improves muscle performance

    <description>Biodex Balance System: It is possible to quantify the neuromuscular control performance by evaluating subject's ability in single and double leg balance on a stable or unstable surface. This system can be used to do exercises in order to increase kinesthetic abilities and improve proprioception.</description>

    <description>Balance Exercises: The first group performed balance exercise which last for six weeks, 3 times a week, and 40 minutes each session. Each session started by several minutes of slow walking and progressive stretching of ankle, knee and hip muscles which was gradually increased in time and repetition. After that, balance exercises were performed.
Ankle taping: In second group Ankle joint taping continued for 6 weeks and was renewed three times a week.</description>
