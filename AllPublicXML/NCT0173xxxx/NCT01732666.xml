  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids has been reported to cause hyperalgesia. Opioid induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is defined
      as paradoxically lowering the threshold of pain after the exposure of opioid. Remifentanil is
      a short acting opioid that is commonly used during anesthesia and surgery. However, OIH was
      reported to occur after surgery when large amount of remifentanil was administered. On the
      other hand, nefopam is a centrally acting, non-opioid analgesic. Nefopam has been reported to
      have analgesic and anti-hyperalgesic effect.

      The investigators hypothesized that nefopam administration could prevent OIH or reduce the
      severity of OIH. Therefore, the objective of the study is to find out the effect of nefopam
      on remifentanil induced hyperalgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.
