    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug
      known as LY3053102 in healthy participants. The study will also investigate how much of the
      study drug gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it.
      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. The study is
      expected to last approximately 8 weeks for each participant (up to 4 weeks from the screening
      visit to the administration of study drug and an additional 4 weeks of follow up).
