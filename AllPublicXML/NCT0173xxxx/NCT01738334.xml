  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have impairments in attentional
      subsystems of alerting and conflict monitoring. Mindfulness meditation may lead to an
      improvement of these deficits, and reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the
      studies that demonstrated these improvements did not use a control group, nor controlled the
      use of medication. In the present study the investigators will examine the effects of the
      mindfulness practices (same protocol of 8 weekly sessions used in the study that showed
      positive effects in this disorder) in the performance of adult patients and healthy people
      (with ADHD). Cognitive performance, mood, and the quality of life will be assessed by
      validated questionnaires before and after treatment/standby.

    <description>In the eight weeks following the first session of cognitive tests, the participants made a practice of weekly meditation group lasting 2 hours. Practices with each group (patients and &quot;active&quot; controls) occurred on different days. With regard to meditation practices were performed in a sitting posture with emphasis on daily life. Each weekly session involved meditation practices with trained professional, practical proposals for home exercise and a discussion group. Meditation compact discs (CDs)were given to participants for practices at home, which proposed activities for 5 minutes to 1 week and 2 weeks for 10 minutes 3-5, and finally 15 minutes for 6-8 weeks. After 8 weeks of treatment the second session of tests was held that involved the same tasks in session 1.</description>
