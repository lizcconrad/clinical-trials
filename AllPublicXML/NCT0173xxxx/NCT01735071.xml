    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at assessing the efficacy and the safety of the combination of
      bevacizumab and trabectedin with or without carboplatin in adult women with epithelial
      ovarian cancer at first recurrence occurred 6-12 months after the end of the last (first or
      second) platinum-containing regimen. According to the Bryant and Day design the primary
      endpoints will be the proportion of progression-free patients at 6 months for the efficacy,
      and the proportion of patients with severe toxicity for the safety at the same time-point.
