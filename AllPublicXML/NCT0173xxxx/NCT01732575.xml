      This RCT study addresses the topic of improving the possibilities for people with severe
      mental illness (SMI) to be engaged in meaningful daily occupations at community-based
      activity (CBA) centers. Meaningful occupation, which includes not only work-related
      activities, but also leisure, household and social activities, is assumed to generate health
      and wellbeing. It is well established that there is a relationship between satisfaction with
      daily occupations and well-being.

      A Swedish mental health care reform stated that the social services should provide meaningful
      daily occupations to people with SMI. However, evaluations of the effects of the reform
      conclude that the target group's needs for meaningful daily occupation have not been met.

      Thus, on the basis of governmental reports and evaluations, there is an urgent need for
      improving the quality of the activities and support offered at CBA centers. Therefore, the
      overarching aim of this project is to develop and implement an intervention method for
      improving the activities offered and support given at CBA centers, and evaluate the outcomes
      of that intervention.

      Specific aims

        -  Developing and implementing an intervention that means reorganization of CBA centers in
           such a way that they become enriched with characteristics that have been identified as
           rewarding and meaningful in previous research.

        -  Evaluating the outcome of that intervention on:

             -  the unit level, i.e., in terms of changes in the characteristics of the CBA
                centers,

             -  the individual level, in terms of changes among the consumers regarding
                satisfaction with the activities at the CBA center, perceived control, social
                interaction, quality of life, etc.

      Cluster randomization is used. Day centers are randomized to either giving the new
      intervention (&quot;enrichment&quot;) or continuing with &quot;care as usual&quot; during the study period, which
      is 14 months. This means that all participants in a day center get the type care their
      specific day center offers during the study period.

    <description>A self-report measure, Estimation of Perceived Meaning in Day Centers (EPM-DC,) has been developed in previous research. It is a psychometrically sound instrument for assessing meaningfulness in the day center context.

    <description>Gaps in the rehabilitation are identified by staff and researchers in dialogue. Staff gets relevant education. An intervention is tailored by staff and researchers to bridge the gaps. Consumers have a say and the intervention is revised accordingly.
