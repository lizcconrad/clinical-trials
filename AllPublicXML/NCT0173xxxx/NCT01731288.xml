      The main purpose of this study is to assess conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and pain
      experiences among women who have been diagnosed with vulvodynia. Specifically, this study
      aims to examine the following among women who have been diagnosed with vulvodynia: 1) rates
      of pregnancy/childbirth and desire for children; 2) fear of pregnancy and childbirth; 3)
      potential difficulties experienced while attempting to become pregnant and during
      pregnancy/childbirth; 4) methods used to become pregnant and deliver; 5) methods used to
      manage vulvodynia symptoms during pregnancy; and 6) pain outcomes associated with pregnancy.

      Very little research has examined pregnancy/childbirth experiences among women with
      vulvodynia, or the natural history of vulvodynia. As such this is a preliminary investigation
      that will provide descriptive information regarding many of the proposed research questions.
      Based on the clinical experience of the investigators, it is expected that women with
      vulvodynia will report lower rates of pregnancy and higher levels of fear about pregnancy and
      childbirth in comparison to women without such pain. It is also expected that women with
      vulvodynia will report more difficulties becoming pregnant as compared to women without such
      pain, and that women with vulvodynia will report more elective nonvaginal births in
      comparison to vaginal births.

        1) Vulvar Pain Clinic (no longer active) located at the Women's Clinic, Willow Pavilion,
        Vancouver General Hospital; 2) Multidisciplinary Vulvodynia Program (MVP); or 3) BC Centre
        for Sexual Medicine
