  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A standard PET/CT scanner is comprised of two different machines: An X-ray computed
      tomography scanner (CT), which gives information about your anatomy, and a Positron Emission
      Tomography scanner (PET) that provides information about how the body functions. Both of
      these work together to make the final images for doctors to review. As part of this research
      study the investigators would like to test a new scanner technology by evaluating the quality
      of the images obtained using this new PET system.

      The scanner the investigators would use is able to do both types of examination, the standard
      PET/CT and the additional research PET. The new PET system adds a second scanner ring to the
      standard PET/CT. This allows the patient to stay on the same imaging table for both studies.
      Being in this study does not change how the standard PET/CT will be done.
