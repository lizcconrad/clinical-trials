  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cystic fibrosis, there is a critical need for better predictors of treatment response. The
      investigators have identified a panel of white blood cell biomarkers which can be directly
      measured as a blood test in subjects with cystic fibrosis. These biomarkers predict reduction
      of airway inflammation and infection more accurately than lung function testing, in patients
      receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy. In the current study, we hypothesize that this
      panel of gene biomarkers which can be readily measured from peripheral blood will sensitively
      predict changes in inflammation when patients receive inhaled antibiotic therapy,
      specifically Cayston (or inhaled aztreonam lysine). Patients enrolled in the study will have
      blood drawn before and after a month of inhaled Cayston, in order to test whether genes
      predict response to Cayston therapy more robustly than do standard measures such as lung
      function tests.

        Enrolled subjects will include adults with cystic fibrosis, over the age of 18 years, who
        are at baseline health and colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and who are newly
        prescribed Cayston (aztreonam lysine) for inhalation, or who are resuming use of this drug
        after 28 days off of inhaled antimicrobial agents with activity against Pseudomonas
        aeruginosa.
