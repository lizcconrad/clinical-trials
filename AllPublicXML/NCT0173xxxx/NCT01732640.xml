      Trial Objectives:

      The objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib with induction
      chemotherapy in primary unresected patients with locally advanced, HPV-negative, stage III or
      IVa/b HNSCC including oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx.

      Primary Objective Phase I The primary objective of the phase I portion of the trial is to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase II dose of daily oral
      afatinib that is safe in combination with carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 175mg/m2 q 21 days
      as an induction regimen.

      Primary Objective Phase 2 The primary objective of the phase 2 portion of the trial is to
      estimate the objective tumor response rate and toxicity with induction therapy in patients
      treated on the afatinib dose determined in Phase I.

      Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of phase II is to estimate: 1) the overall
      response to entire treatment after completion of CRT, 2) progression-free survival (PFS) rate
      at 2 years, and 3) overall survival (OS) at 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/phase II prospective multicenter trial to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of afatinib with induction chemotherapy in primary unresected patients with
      HPV-negative locally advanced SCC stage III or IVa/b of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
      or larynx. The primary endpoint is overall response rate after the completion of induction
      chemotherapy.

      Eligible patients will begin with a 14 day lead-in period with afatinib alone. This will be
      followed immediately by 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC 6 IV,
      paclitaxel 175mg/m2 day 1, and afatinib as a continuous daily dosing. Each cycle is repeated
      every 21 days. All patients will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy beginning 2-3 weeks
      after the completion of the second cycle of induction chemotherapy (Refer to Study Schema in
      page 8 of the protocol).

      During the period of induction chemotherapy, a complete history and physical (including
      weight) and tumor assessment by physical examination on Day 1 of each cycle will be performed
      and documented. Complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic profile
      will be performed weekly. After completion of induction chemotherapy, reassessment with blood
      work, physical exam, CT/MRI of neck and nasopharyngolaryngoscopy will be performed. After the
      completion of CRT, the patient will have a MRI, CT, or FDG PET approximately 12 weeks after
      CRT. Follow-up will be standard of care from this point onwards.

      Physical exam, blood work and AE assessments will also be frequently performed during entire
      treatment.
