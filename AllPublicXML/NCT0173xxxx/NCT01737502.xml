    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of auranofin when given together
      with sirolimus and to see how well it works in treating patients with lung cancer that has
      spread or other places in the body and cannot be cured or controlled by treatment or has come
      back after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. Auranofin and
      sirolimus may stop or slow the growth of lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose of auranofin plus sirolimus after at least one
      line of platinum based chemotherapy for lung cancer (squamous, ras-mutated adenocarcinoma, or
      small cell lung cancer) patients with no acceptable standard treatment options. (Phase I) II.
      To assess the progression-free survival at four months of patients treated with auranofin
      after at least one line of platinum based chemotherapy for lung cancer (squamous, ras-mutated
      adenocarcinoma, or small cell lung cancer) patients with no acceptable standard treatment
      options. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival in this population in comparison to recent historical
      controls.

      II. To determine the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of the regimen. III. To determine
      the overall response rate, per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria, and duration of tumor response in those patients with measurable disease.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship between molecular correlates and progression-free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS), response and adverse events.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of auranofin followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) on days 1-28 and sirolimus PO on days 1-28 (days 8-28
      of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 5 years.

    <measure>Progression-free survival rate (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient is considered to be a 4-month progression-free survivor, or success, if the patient is 4 months from registration without a documentation of disease progression. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated using the properties of the binomial distribution. Additionally, an estimate and confidence interval for the 4-month progression-free survival rate incorporating censoring may be computed using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival time</measure>
    <time_frame>Defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. The median overall survival time will be descriptively compared to that of the subgroup of patients with squamous cell carcinoma on the cisplatin/gemcitabine arm of Scagliotti et al (2008).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate, defined to be either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) noted as the objective status</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The overall response rate will be estimated in the subset of patients with measureable disease by the number of responses in evaluable patients with measurable disease divided by the total number of evaluable patients with measureable disease. The appropriate confidence interval will be calculated based on the binomial distribution</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined for all evaluable patients with measurable disease who have achieved a response as the date at which the patient's earliest best objective status is first noted to be a CR or PR to the earliest date progression is documented. The distribution of duration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>

    <measure>Change in protein kinase C (PKC) iota protein expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 5 years</time_frame>
