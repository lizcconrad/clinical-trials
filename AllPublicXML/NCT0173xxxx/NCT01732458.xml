  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability
      of aprepitant for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in pediatric
      participants.

      Post-operative aprepitant plasma concentrations will be evaluated with a non-compartmental
      analysis (NCA) at each dose and for each age cohort. Full PK profiles analyzed using
      population PK modeling and simulation will be described in a separate report.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children will be limited, a
      flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times will be utilized which will
      limit the burden to participants.

    <masking_description>This study will be conducted as a partially blinded study. PK samples will not be collected from participants in the control group. To maintain a partial blind, approximately 3 participants randomly selected from each age group in each of the aprepitant treatment groups will not have PK sampling. All participants will remain blinded to the study treatment. The investigator and Sponsor will be blinded to the study medication in participants not providing PK samples. The investigator and Sponsor will remain blinded to the aprepitant dose given to participants from whom PK samples will be collected.</masking_description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 262 screened for inclusion, 229 were randomized to treatment. 1 participant was inadvertently randomized to a 2.5 mg aprepitant dose arm that was not evaluated in this study; therefore the participant was not included in any analyses. Of remaining 228 randomized participants, 8 did not receive treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of Aprepitant From Time 0 to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC0-last) Following Administration of 125 mg Dose Equivalent in 12 to 17 Year Age Group</title>
        <description>AUC0-last was analyzed independently for participants in the 125 mg dose equivalent arm aged 12 to 17 years old due to age- and dose-dependent differences in aprepitant absorption and clearance. Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children is limited, a flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times was to be utilized which would limit the burden to participants. Plasma for aprepitant AUC0-last assessment was obtained at 30-60 minutes prior to aprepitant administration, 2-4 hours post aprepitant administration, 5-7 hours post aprepitant administration, and 8-10 hours post aprepitant administration. Post-operative aprepitant plasma AUC0-last was evaluated using a noncompartmental analysis (NCA). The limit of quantitation (LOQ) value for this analysis was 10 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Aprepitant Following Administration of 125 mg Dose Equivalent in 12 to 17 Year Age Group</title>
        <description>Cmax was analyzed independently for participants in the 125 mg dose equivalent arm aged 12 to 17 years old due to age- and dose-dependent differences in aprepitant absorption and clearance. Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children is limited, a flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times was to be utilized which would limit the burden to participants. Plasma for aprepitant Cmax assessment was obtained at 30-60 minutes prior to aprepitant administration, 2-4 hours post aprepitant administration, 5-7 hours post aprepitant administration, and 8-10 hours post aprepitant administration. Post-operative aprepitant plasma Cmax was evaluated using an NCA. The LOQ value for this analysis was 10 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>Cmax of Aprepitant Following Administration of 125 mg Dose Equivalent in 2 to &lt;6 Year Age Group</title>
        <description>Cmax was analyzed independently for participants in the 125 mg dose equivalent arm aged 2 to &lt;6 years old due to age- and dose-dependent differences in aprepitant absorption and clearance. Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children is limited, a flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times was to be utilized which would limit the burden to participants. Plasma for aprepitant Cmax assessment was obtained at 30-60 minutes prior to aprepitant administration, 2-4 hours post aprepitant administration, 5-7 hours post aprepitant administration, and 8-10 hours post aprepitant administration. Post-operative aprepitant plasma Cmax was evaluated using an NCA. The LOQ value for this analysis was 10 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>Cmax Following Administration of 40 mg Dose Equivalent in 12 to 17 Year Age Group</title>
        <description>Cmax was analyzed independently for participants in the 40 mg dose equivalent arm aged 12 to 17 years old due to age- and dose-dependent differences in aprepitant absorption and clearance. Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children is limited, a flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times was to be utilized which would limit the burden to participants. Plasma for aprepitant Cmax assessment was obtained at 30-60 minutes prior to aprepitant administration, 2-4 hours post aprepitant administration, 5-7 hours post aprepitant administration, and 8-10 hours post aprepitant administration. Post-operative aprepitant plasma Cmax was evaluated using an NCA. The LOQ value for this analysis was 10 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>Cmax of Aprepitant Following Administration of 40 mg Dose Equivalent in 2 to &lt;6 Year Age Group</title>
        <description>Cmax was analyzed independently for participants in the 40 mg dose equivalent arm aged 2 to &lt;6 years old due to age- and dose-dependent differences in aprepitant absorption and clearance. Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children is limited, a flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times was to be utilized which would limit the burden to participants. Plasma for aprepitant Cmax assessment was obtained at 30-60 minutes prior to aprepitant administration, 2-4 hours post aprepitant administration, 5-7 hours post aprepitant administration, and 8-10 hours post aprepitant administration. Post-operative aprepitant plasma Cmax was evaluated using an NCA. The LOQ value for this analysis was 10 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>Cmax of Aprepitant Following Administration of 10 mg Dose Equivalent in 12 to 17 Year Age Group</title>
        <description>Cmax was analyzed independently for participants in the 10 mg dose equivalent arm aged 12 to 17 years old due to age- and dose-dependent differences in aprepitant absorption and clearance. Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children is limited, a flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times was to be utilized which would limit the burden to participants. Plasma for aprepitant Cmax assessment was obtained at 30-60 minutes prior to aprepitant administration, 2-4 hours post aprepitant administration, 5-7 hours post aprepitant administration, and 8-10 hours post aprepitant administration. Post-operative aprepitant plasma Cmax was evaluated using an NCA. The LOQ value for this analysis was 10 ng/mL.</description>

Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children is limited, a flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times was to be utilized which would limit the burden to participants. Plasma for aprepitant Cmax assessment was obtained at 30-60 minutes prior to aprepitant administration, 2-4 hours post aprepitant administration, 5-7 hours post aprepitant administration, and 8-10 hours post aprepitant administration. Post-operative aprepitant plasma Cmax was evaluated using an NCA. The LOQ value for this analysis was 10 ng/mL.</description>

        <description>Plasma for aprepitant CL/F assessment was obtained at 30-60 minutes prior to aprepitant administration, 2-4 hours post aprepitant administration, 5-7 hours post aprepitant administration, and 8-10 hours post aprepitant administration. Because the opportunity to collect specimens for PK analyses in children is limited, a flexible sparse sampling scheme using ranges of collection times was to be utilized which would limit the burden to participants. CL/F data were to be log transformed and analyzed via a linear mixed-effects model containing fixed effects for age for each dose level tested.</description>
