  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of death of infants. Strong
      preclinical evidence suggests that effective therapy must be delivered as early as possible
      to prevent progression of the disease. The primary study objective will be to identify
      prognostic and surrogate biomarkers of disease progression that will facilitate the execution
      of therapeutic SMA clinical trials in infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1. To establish the validity of putative physiological SMA biomarkers in the immediate
      postnatal period. A longitudinal, natural history examination of physiological markers of
      muscle innervation will be performed in healthy and SMA infants. The first week of life is
      the ideal first time point, with visits occurring at scheduled visits up to the age two.
      Compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude and electrical impedance myography (EIM)
      will be examined and will be correlated with motor function. Each of these is associated with
      muscle innervation and provides information on the number and function of lower motor neurons
      in the spinal cord, the cellular target of SMA therapeutic interventions. This trial will
      establish the natural history of these putative SMA biomarkers as the disease evolves in
      affected infants. Moreover, our approach will allow for measurements in pre-symptomatic and
      early symptomatic subjects and determine their predictive value.

      Aim 2. To establish the validity of putative molecular SMA biomarkers in the immediate
      postnatal period. Survival Motor Neuron (SMN2) copy number is a valid, predictive molecular
      SMA biomarker; however, it is fixed, and therefore not useful as a biomarker of clinical
      progression or response to therapy. SMN messenger Ribonucleic acid (mRNA) ( and protein
      expression is variable in different cell types and, in mice, naturally decreases with age
      postnatally. In this study, SMN expression levels will be measured longitudinally in SMA
      patients and controls. Additional putative molecular SMA markers that have been identified to
      correlate with motor function will be determined in an effort to distinguish between
      predictive markers that change prior to development of weakness and those that change as a
      consequence of weakness.

    <measure>Motor Function Assessments- Test for Infant Motor Performance Screening Items (TIMPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Describe &amp; compare the distribution of motor function assessments over the first two years of life in SMA vs. healthy control infants.
The TIMPSI is used to assess the postural and selective control of movement typically used by infants younger than 5 months. The TIMPSI scores were related to an infant's ability to reach. The TIMPSI is a 29-item evaluation that contains 3 item sets: a Screening set, an Easy set, and a Hard set. The Screening set consists of 11 items from the TIMP, each with a 5- to 7-point rating scale; the Easy set has 6 items with 5- or 6-point rating scales and 4 dichotomously scored items; the Hard set has 8 items, 3 with 5-point rating scales and 5 items that are scored dichotomously. The Total score is derived from all subset scores and is the sum of those subset scores. The final score could range from 0 to 99 points. The higher the score the better the functional ability of the participant. Linear mixed effects models were used for analyses.</description>

    <measure>Motor Function Assessments- The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TIMPSI motor function testing was done during all of the study visits knowing that the healthy controls would eventually ceiling out. The study design allowed for secondary motor function tests based on the score of the TIMPSI. If infants scored a 41 or above on the TIMPSI they would be tested with the AIMS. If they were below they were tested with the CHOP-INTEND. The CHOP-INTEND is a reliable and validated, comprehensive assessment of the postural and selective control of movement needed by infants. It is a clinician-rated questionnaire developed to assess motor skill in spinal muscular atrophy type I. The 16 items are scored from 0 to 4. The global score ranges from 0 to 64, a higher score indicating better motor skills.(Finkel, McDermott, 2014). All healthy controls based upon scores at 6 months moved on to the AIMS test, therefore no healthy controls completed the CHOP-INTEND. Linear mixed effects models were used for analyses of Motor function outcome data.</description>

    <measure>Motor Function Assessments-Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Linear mixed effects models were used for analyses.
The reason that the number of infants differ from those in participant flow is based upon the protocol. The selection of which secondary test to perform depended upon the score of the TIMPSI that was performed. TIMPSI &lt;41, do CHOP-NTEND. TIMPSI &gt; 41, do AIMS.
The AIMS incorporates the neuromaturational concept and the dynamical systems theory and is used to measure gross motor maturation of infants from birth through the age of independent walking (Piper, Pinnell et al. 1992, Piper, Darrah et al 1994). In the AIMS, the impact of neurological components on motor development is reflected by a sequence of motor skills, which are used as the basis of assessment. The AIMS consists of 58 items, including 4 positions: prone (21 items), supine (9 items), sitting (12 items) &amp; standing(16 items). The highest score available is 58. The higher the score the better the functional ability of the participant.</description>

    <measure>Putative Physiological Biomarker- Compound Motor Action Potential Testing (CMAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Describe and compare the distribution of the putative physiological and molecular biomarkers over the first two years of life in SMA vs. healthy control infants.
Maximum ulnar CMAP amplitude and area will be obtained by recording from the abductor digitiminimi muscle following ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist. All electrophysiologic testing will be performed by certified electromyographers experienced in the assessment of pediatric patients. Maximum values for both negative peak (NP) amplitude and NP area will be obtained. No medications will be used.
This test is done routinely in this population. Pediatric electrodes and each site's standard electromyograph devices will be utilized. The test, while not considered to be painful, may cause some discomfort similar to a static electric shock. Infants may whimper or cry due to the surprise of the shock. Each shock lasts approximately 0.1 millisecond. The testing duration is expected to be approximately 30 seconds.</description>

      Absolute quantification of full length survival motor neuron (SMN) transcripts will be
      performed. The SMN1 and SMN2 transcripts will be measured in a multiplex reaction and
      SMN-del7 will be quantified separately. Droplet digital PCR will be used to determine SMN
      levels to further increase reliability and reduce variance in the SMN mRNA level
      determination. SMN protein in PBMCs SMN cell-based immunoassays will be performed. This assay
      is performed using a single monoclonal antibody for SMN and does not involve the disruption
      of cells. From the same PBMC sample, a commercially available SMN ELISA will also be
      performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The B for SMA pilot study identified
      over 100 protein analytes that significantly correlated with motor function in SMA patients
      compared to controls.

        <title>Motor Function Assessments- Test for Infant Motor Performance Screening Items (TIMPSI)</title>
        <description>Describe &amp; compare the distribution of motor function assessments over the first two years of life in SMA vs. healthy control infants.
The TIMPSI is used to assess the postural and selective control of movement typically used by infants younger than 5 months. The TIMPSI scores were related to an infant's ability to reach. The TIMPSI is a 29-item evaluation that contains 3 item sets: a Screening set, an Easy set, and a Hard set. The Screening set consists of 11 items from the TIMP, each with a 5- to 7-point rating scale; the Easy set has 6 items with 5- or 6-point rating scales and 4 dichotomously scored items; the Hard set has 8 items, 3 with 5-point rating scales and 5 items that are scored dichotomously. The Total score is derived from all subset scores and is the sum of those subset scores. The final score could range from 0 to 99 points. The higher the score the better the functional ability of the participant. Linear mixed effects models were used for analyses.</description>

        <description>The TIMPSI motor function testing was done during all of the study visits knowing that the healthy controls would eventually ceiling out. The study design allowed for secondary motor function tests based on the score of the TIMPSI. If infants scored a 41 or above on the TIMPSI they would be tested with the AIMS. If they were below they were tested with the CHOP-INTEND. The CHOP-INTEND is a reliable and validated, comprehensive assessment of the postural and selective control of movement needed by infants. It is a clinician-rated questionnaire developed to assess motor skill in spinal muscular atrophy type I. The 16 items are scored from 0 to 4. The global score ranges from 0 to 64, a higher score indicating better motor skills.(Finkel, McDermott, 2014). All healthy controls based upon scores at 6 months moved on to the AIMS test, therefore no healthy controls completed the CHOP-INTEND. Linear mixed effects models were used for analyses of Motor function outcome data.</description>

The overall number of participants analyzed (14 and 0) differs from the total enrollment in each cohort reported in the participant flow (26 and 27, respectively) because of the staggered enrollment, significant mortality, and protocol design of who was eligible for this second motor measure.</population>

        <title>Motor Function Assessments-Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS)</title>
        <description>Linear mixed effects models were used for analyses.
The reason that the number of infants differ from those in participant flow is based upon the protocol. The selection of which secondary test to perform depended upon the score of the TIMPSI that was performed. TIMPSI &lt;41, do CHOP-NTEND. TIMPSI &gt; 41, do AIMS.
The AIMS incorporates the neuromaturational concept and the dynamical systems theory and is used to measure gross motor maturation of infants from birth through the age of independent walking (Piper, Pinnell et al. 1992, Piper, Darrah et al 1994). In the AIMS, the impact of neurological components on motor development is reflected by a sequence of motor skills, which are used as the basis of assessment. The AIMS consists of 58 items, including 4 positions: prone (21 items), supine (9 items), sitting (12 items) &amp; standing(16 items). The highest score available is 58. The higher the score the better the functional ability of the participant.</description>

        <title>Putative Physiological Biomarker- Compound Motor Action Potential Testing (CMAP)</title>
        <description>Describe and compare the distribution of the putative physiological and molecular biomarkers over the first two years of life in SMA vs. healthy control infants.
Maximum ulnar CMAP amplitude and area will be obtained by recording from the abductor digitiminimi muscle following ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist. All electrophysiologic testing will be performed by certified electromyographers experienced in the assessment of pediatric patients. Maximum values for both negative peak (NP) amplitude and NP area will be obtained. No medications will be used.
This test is done routinely in this population. Pediatric electrodes and each site's standard electromyograph devices will be utilized. The test, while not considered to be painful, may cause some discomfort similar to a static electric shock. Infants may whimper or cry due to the surprise of the shock. Each shock lasts approximately 0.1 millisecond. The testing duration is expected to be approximately 30 seconds.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
        <population>Patients enrolled in the trial from birth to 6 months. The overall number of participants analyzed (18/ and 26) differs from the total enrollment in the participant flow (26 and 27) because of the staggered enrollment, significant mortality and tolerance of procedure. Therefore not all infants enrolled were included in all longitudinal analyses.</population>

        <title>Correlation of Biomarkers With Motor Function Tests for SMA Subjects- CMAP</title>
        <description>In these analyses motor function score was the outcome measure. Correlation was defined as the estimated mean increase per a one unit increase in the biomarker under consideration. A linear mixed effects model was used to estimate the correlation between the biomarker and motor function score. Separate models were used for the TIMPSI and CHOP-INTEND. In the CHOP-INTEND analyses, correlations were not estimable for the 18 and 24 month visits.</description>

        <title>Motor Function Assessments- Test for Infant Motor Performance Screening Items (TIMPSI) SMN Copy Number =2 Cohort</title>
        <description>Describe and compare the distribution of motor function assessments over the first two years of life in SMA subjects with SMN copy number = 2 versus healthy control infants.
The TIMPSI is used to assess the postural and selective control of movement typically used by infants younger than 5 months. The TIMPSI scores were related to an infant's ability to reach. The TIMPSI is a 29-item evaluation that contains 3 item sets: a Screening set, an Easy set, and a Hard set. The Screening set consists of 11 items from the TIMP, each with a 5- to 7-point rating scale; the Easy set has 6 items with 5- or 6-point rating scales and 4 dichotomously scored items; the Hard set has 8 items, 3 with 5-point rating scales and 5 items that are scored dichotomously. The Total score is derived from all subset scores and is the sum of those subset scores. The final score could range from 0 to 99 points. The higher the score the better the functional ability of the participant.</description>

The CHOP-INTEND is a reliable and validated, comprehensive assessment of the postural and selective control of movement needed by infants. It is a clinician-rated questionnaire developed to assess motor skill in spinal muscular atrophy type I. The 16 items are scored from 0 to 4. The global score ranges from 0 to 64, a higher score indicating better motor skills.(Finkel, McDermott, 2014).</description>

        <title>Putative Physiological Biomarker- Compound Motor Action Potential Testing (CMAP) SMN Copy Number = 2 Cohort</title>
        <description>Describe and compare the distribution of the putative physiological and molecular biomarkers over the first two years of life in SMA2 vs. healthy control infants.
Maximum ulnar CMAP amplitude and area will be obtained by recording from the abductor digitiminimi muscle following ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist. All electrophysiologic testing will be performed by certified electromyographers experienced in the assessment of pediatric patients. Maximum values for both negative peak (NP) amplitude and NP area will be obtained. No medications will be used.
This test is done routinely in this population. Pediatric electrodes and each site's standard electromyograph devices will be utilized. The test, while not considered to be painful, may cause some discomfort similar to a static electric shock. Infants may whimper or cry due to the surprise of the shock. Each shock lasts approximately 0.1 millisecond. The testing duration is expected to be approximately 30 seconds.</description>

        <population>The overall number of participants analyzed (13 and 26) differs from the total enrollment in the participant flow (26 and 27) because of the staggered enrollment, subset of patients with SMA, significant mortality, and tolerance of procedure.</population>
