  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of refined indigo naturalis (indigo naturalis extract in oil, INEO)ointment to treat
      psoriasis has been proven effective in our previous study. This study aims to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of INEO ointment, and further determine the optimal concentration of INEO
      ointment (per gram of ointment containing either 200 μg, 100 μg, 50 μg or 10 μg of indirubin)
      in treatment of various local skin signs and thickness of psoriasis plaque.

      The use of indigo naturalis ointment to treat psoriasis has been proven effective in our
      previous clinical studies which demonstrated the efficacy and safety of topical indigo
      naturalis ointment, showing its ability to provide significant improvement of psoriatic skin
      lesions.

      We developed a new formulation in which indigo naturalis powder is refined and reduces the
      blue discoloration of skin and clothes, making the treatment more user-friendly. We had
      observed an equivalent efficacy of the refined form of indigo naturalis (INEO) ointment on
      treating psoriasis as the crude form. However, it is necessary to determine an appropriate
      dosage of the refined form regarding its efficacy and safety.

      This is a double-blind, 4-arm parallel study. The aim of this study is

        1. To determine an appropriate dosage of indirubin in INEO ointment, regarding its efficacy
           and safety.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of INEO ointment in different local skin signs of plaque
           lesions.

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of INEO in different traditional Chinese medicine clinical
           syndromes of psoriasis vulgaris.

        4. To investigate the effects of INEO ointment on the immune system.

        5. To evaluate the effects of INEO ointment in improving quality of life after treatment.
