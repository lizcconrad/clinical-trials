  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroencephalography (EEG) with very high spatial resolution (HR-EEG, 256 electrodes) allow
      for better analysis of local and global activity of the cerebral cortex, as compared with
      conventional EEG. Since January 2012, the Neurology Department of CHU Rennes is the first
      clinical service in France equipped with such a system.

      Applied to HR-EEG recordings, brain connectivity methods are likely to provide essential
      information (in the form of &quot;connectivity graphs&quot;) on cortical networks, either dysfunctional
      or not, involved in the generation of interictal paroxysms (like spikes or spike-waves) and
      during seizures.

      So far, many methods have been proposed (see for a review: Wendling et al., 2009; Wendling et
      al., 2010). However, since each method is highly sensitive to the type of model that is
      assumed for the underlying relationship between distinct brain regions (Ansari-Asl et al.,
      2006), none of them has yet demonstrated its effectiveness.

    <measure>The quality of matching between i) the graphs produced by the evaluated connectivity method(s) applied to the HR-EEG and ii) the results of the visual analysis typically performed by an expert on the standard EEG recorded during intercritical phase.</measure>

    <description>Main objective :To determine which functional connectivity estimation method(s) show(s) best performance(s) for the identification of epileptogenic networks from the HR-EEG recording performed in epileptic patients.</description>

    <measure>The quality of matching between i) the connectivity graphs obtained from control subjects performing a well defined cognitive task to ii) data from the literature on networks activated and sustaining these cognitive processes.</measure>

    <description>Our secondary objectives are:
The application of linear, non-linear and phase synchronization methods in digital signal processing on broadband band analysis or on band-filtered EEG signals acquired during HR-EEG explorations of patients with epilepsy,
The evaluation of the performance of these methods by comparing the resulting connectivity graphs with those expected in healthy subjects (controls),
The application of the methods offering the best performances to data acquired in patients.</description>

    <description>Epileptic patients, as in healthy volunteers will be offered a review of EEG recording equipment resting on EEG-HR 256-channel EGI © in operation since January 2012 in the Van Gogh Service Unit of Neurology Rennes University Hospital (hospital Pontchaillou). The EEG is a routine now included in the Phase I report some epileptic patients during presurgical investigation. Patients to be included in this research protocol pass all review on the new device EEG-HR 256 channels. In addition to the rest condition, shared by both groups of participants, the healthy control subjects participate in two additional experimental tasks to be performed during recording. A picture naming task and a task of spelling words represented by these images.</description>
