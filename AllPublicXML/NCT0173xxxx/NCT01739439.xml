      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of radiosurgery boost following
      chemoradiation in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that may or may
      not be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Radiosurgery can send x-rays
      directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy together with radiosurgery may kill more tumor cells and allow doctors to
      save the part of the body where the cancer started

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a radiosurgery boost added to
      hypofractionated chemoradiation in patients with borderline resectable or unresectable
      pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of a radiosurgery boost added to hypofractionated chemoradiation
      on surgical morbidity (specifically, healing of the surgical anastomoses and abdominal wounds
      and late hemorrhage from blood vessels in the field) in patients with advanced borderline
      resectable (BLR) or unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      II. To evaluate the utility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an
      assessment of treatment response after chemoradiation followed by radiosurgery.

      III. To determine the feasibility of collecting tissue for immunohistochemistry (IHC)
      analysis via endoscopic ultrasound or computed tomography (CT)-guided fine needle aspiration.

      IV. To utilize pathologic response rates in dose escalated regions, hypofractionated regions,
      and the dose gradient region in between to better characterize the radiobiologic response of
      pancreatic cancer to radiation dose escalation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of radiosurgery.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once weekly and
      undergo hyperfractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days a week in weeks
      1-3. Patients then undergo a single fraction of radiosurgery boost in week 5 and then receive
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 6-8. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
