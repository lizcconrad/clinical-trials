      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Fluoride varnish and Casein
      Phospho-Peptide Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (CPP-ACP) containing paste on oral symptoms and
      salivary characteristics in patients under chemotherapy.

      Chemotherapy as a treatment method of cancers, affects different parts of the oral cavity
      such as oral mucosa, teeth and salivary glands caused by salivary glands dysfunction during
      chemotherapy.Oral status of patients under chemotherapy will be affected by consumption of
      the drugs and their side effects such as reduction of the saliva, dryness of the oral cavity,
      changes in bacterial balance, oral mucosa damage, bleeding due to irritation of the tissues,
      xerostomia, dental caries, burning sensation, dysgeusia and dysphagia. No effective
      preventive protocol has been presented for oral care during chemotherapy.

      Patients who were met the inclusion criteria (aged over 12, diagnosed to have cancer by an
      oncologists and needed chemotherapy drugs, had at least 20 teeth, had no other pathologic
      lesion in their oral cavity, were not treated by radiotherapy and did not have specific
      systemic diseases or head and neck cancer) were selected for the study. the participants were
      evaluated according to oral and salivary symptoms.
