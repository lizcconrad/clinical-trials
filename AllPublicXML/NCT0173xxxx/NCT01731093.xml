  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, bioavailability, and effectiveness of
      an organic yeast-selenium compound in reducing brain oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in
      the brain has been linked to a variety oif disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Selenium
      is a very powerful antioxidant that could prove useful in reducing the harmful effects of
      oxidative stress in the brain and may help prevent diseases such as Alzheimer's. Our recent
      work has demonstrated that the specific type of selenium compound greatly influences it's
      ability to enhance brain health and prevent Alzheimer changes in mouse models of this
      disease.

      This study will enroll 24 participants and will allow us to test the hypotheses that
      yeast-selenium supplementation is safe in the elderly, and that our specific formulation
      reduces brain oxidative stress.

      Placebo-controlled, single-center, multiple ascending dose study. Approximately 8 healthy
      volunteers will be enrolled into 3 sequential cohorts, for a total of 24 enrolled subjects.

      All subjects will be treated with study drug or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects will be seen
      in the clinic for the following visits: Screening, Baseline (Day 1), Day 2, Day 4, Day 7
      (Week 1), Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8,and Week 12 while on study drug. An additional
      safety visit at Week 14 (two weeks after study drug discontinuation) will be required of
      study participants.

      Subjects will undergo blood draws, urine collection, assessment of vital signs, and review of
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) as well as changes in concomitant
      medical conditions and medications at every visit.

      Routine medical examinations will be performed at study screening and enrollment, Week 1,
      Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 14 visits.

      MRI will be performed on all subjects at Screening to ensure safety of lumbar puncture.
      Research procedures will also include lumbar puncture at the Screening and Week 12 visits.

      A designated Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate safety in the subjects who
      have been enrolled and completed a cohort before escalating to the next cohort. The DSMB will
      review safety data (i.e. any AE or SAE) through Week 14. The committee may also request to
      review additional data.

      The DSMB will also be convened in the event of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) to determine
      whether stopping rules for accrual have been met.
