    <description>The study will comprise of 2 parts. A dose escalation and a dose expansion part. All patients in the dose escalation part will have a pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in period of 7 days receiving imatinib monotherapy. Patients will receive increasing doses of BYL719 (200, 300, 400 mg) in combination with 400mg imatinib daily until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and rapid phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. Approximately 35 patients will enter the expansion phase.</description>

    <description>Evaluable patients must meet the minimum treatment and safety evaluation requirements of the study. Patients will be treated until they experience progression of disease, withdraw consent, or experience unacceptable toxicity. One study cycle equals 28 days.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age -WHO performance status (PS) of 0-2
             -Histologically confirmed diagnosis of GIST that is unresectable or metastatic
             -.Available tissue specimen: • Dose-escalation part: patients must have available
             archival tumor tissue which can be shipped during the course of the study. In the
             absence of archival tumor tissue, patients must agree to a fresh pre-treatment biopsy
             at screening. • Dose-expansion part: patients must have available archival tumor
             tissue which can be shipped during the course of the study and must agree to a fresh
             pre-treatment biopsy

          -  Failed prior therapy with imatinib followed by sunitinib for the treatment of
             unresectable or metastatic GIST. Note the following specific criteria for the two
             parts of the trial: • Dose-escalation part: patients who failed prior therapy with
             imatinib and then have failed therapy with sunitinib. Treatment failure may be due to
             either disease progression on therapy (both imatinib and sunitinib) or intolerance to
             therapy (sunitinib) • Dose-escalation part patients may have had additional lines of
             therapy than imatinib and sunitinib dose-expansion part: patients must have documented
             disease progression on both imatinib and sunitinib. In addition, patients may have had
             no more than two lines of prior therapy (i.e. treatment with imatinib followed by
             treatment with sunitinib). • Note: Adjuvant imatinib will not count as a prior course
             of imatinib for the purposes of this criterion 6. Radiological (CT/MRI) confirmation
             of disease progression (RECIST criteria) during prior therapy with imatinib and
             sunitinib will be required for patients entering the Dose-expansion part

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -Previous treatment with PI3K inhibitors -Patient has active uncontrolled or symptomatic
        central nervous system (CNS) metastases Note: A patient with controlled and asymptomatic
        CNS metastases may participate in this trial. As such, the patient must have completed any
        prior treatment for CNS metastases &gt; 28 days (including radiotherapy and/or surgery) prior
        to start of treatment in this study and should not be receiving chronic corticosteroid
        therapy for the CNS metastases -Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition
        that, in the opinion of the investigator, could cause unacceptable safety risks or
        compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. acute or chronic liver, pancreatic disease,
        severe renal disease considered unrelated to study disease, chronic pulmonary disease
        including dyspnea at rest from any cause) -Patients with diabetes mellitus requiring
        insulin treatment and/or with clinical signs or with FPG &gt;120mg/dL / 6.7mmol/L, or history
        of documented steroid-induced diabetes mellitus -Patient who has not recovered to grade 1
        or better from any adverse events related to previous imatinib and/or sunitinib therapy
        before screening procedures are initiated
