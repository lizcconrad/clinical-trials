  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators examined the hypothesis that serum lactate is raised in early necrotizing
      fasciitis to a much greater extent than in other differential diagnoses, such as severe
      cellulitis, and therefore provides a diagnostic indicator.

      A prospective comparison of serum lactate levels at referral to the Plastic Surgery team to
      the 'gold standard' test of histology at initial surgical debridement, looking at 53
      consecutive patients referred with suspected necrotizing fasciitis to a single surgeon at one
      institution between 2000 and 2010.

    <description>Serum lactate level at initial referral to the plastic surgery team, as measured by arterial blood gas analysis (calibrated point-of-care testing). Levels compared between the group with confirmed histological necrosis at initial surgical debridement, versus those with no evidence of necrosis (a composite of those who did not undergo surgery as they were judged not to have necrotizing fasciitis, and those who did undergo surgery, but whose histology did not show tissue necrosis).</description>

        All patients referred to a single surgeon at one institution over 10 years (September 2000
        - September 2010) with a suspected diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. Patients were
        followed for the duration of their hospital stay.
