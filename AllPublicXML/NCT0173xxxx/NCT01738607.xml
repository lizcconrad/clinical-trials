  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of supplementation with one of three
      dietary fibers (gum arabic, carboxy-methylcellulose, or psyllium) or a placebo on fecal
      incontinence (FI), symptom intolerance, and quality of life in community-living individuals
      who have incontinence of loose or liquid feces. A secondary aim was to explore the possible
      mechanism(s) underlying the supplements' efficacy (i.e., improvements in stool consistency,
      water-holding capacity or gel formation).
