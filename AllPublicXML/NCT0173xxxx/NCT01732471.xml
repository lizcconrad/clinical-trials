      This is an open-label, non-comparative, Phase 3 study to evaluate the degree, frequency of
      response and safety of Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride) in subjects aged 4 to 18 years
      who have phenylketonuria and with elevated blood phenylalanine level of greater than or equal
      to 450 micromole per liter.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent (for children under 18 years old

          -  Age of 4 - 18 years, inclusive

          -  Confirmed clinical and biochemical hyperphenylalaninemia due to phenylketonuria
             documented by past medical history with at least 2 blood phenylalanine level greater
             than or equal to 400 micromole per liter obtained in 2 separate occasions

          -  Blood phenylalanine level at screening greater than or equal to 450 micromole per
             liter (mean of two measurements)

          -  For women of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test is required at
             screening and willingness to use a highly effective method of contraception is
             required while participating in the study

          -  Subject and/or the parent/guardian willing and able to comply with study procedures

          -  Subject and/or the parent/guardian willing to continue current diet unchanged during

             target range during the 6 week treatment period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject already assessed for responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride or other
             tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)

          -  Used any investigational agent other than Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride) within
             30 days of screening, or required any investigational agent or vaccine prior to
             completion of all scheduled study assessments

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or considering pregnancy

          -  Concurrent disease or conditions that would interfere with study participation or

             transplantation recipient)

             synthesis (for example, methotrexate), levodopa, phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5)
             inhibitors (such as, sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil), medications that are known
             to affect nitric oxide synthesis metabolism or action

          -  Any conditions, that, in the view of the Principal Investigator renders the subject at
             high risk for failure to comply with treatment or to complete the study
