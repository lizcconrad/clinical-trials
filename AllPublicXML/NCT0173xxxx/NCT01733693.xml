  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) compare the effects of buprenorphine and methadone, two
      types of opioid addiction treatment, on the ability to think and reason among people addicted
      to opiates, and who are either HIV negative or HIV positive; and (2) investigate whether HIV
      infection changes the way opioid treatment affects the ability to think and reason. The
      investigators hypothesize that there will be (1) significant improvement in thinking and
      reasoning ability after starting buprenorphine treatment compared to methadone treatment,
      among participants with and without HIV at 2 and 4 months compared to baseline; and (2) HIV
      positive participants will demonstrate significant improvement in thinking and reasoning
      ability at 2 and 4 months compared to baseline, but that their thinking and reasoning ability
      will still be lower than HIV negative participants.

    <description>Metrics:
A Global Deficit Score (GDS) is computed by adding deficit ratings of the component test measures, and dividing by total number of measures. (Please see list of component test measures under the Domain-Specific Neurocognitive Function outcome).</description>

    <measure>Domain-Specific Neurocognitive Function (i.e. in the domains of executive functioning, learning, memory, attention/working memory, processing speed, motor, and verbal functioning).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Metrics:
Domain Deficit Scores (DDS) are created for each of the 7 cognitive ability domains. Deficit Scores can be analyzed as dichotomous variables to classify individual subjects as impaired or normal, or continuously.
Executive Functioning -- Wisconsin Card Sorting Task-64 Item Version; Trail Making Test (Part B)
Learning -- Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (Total Recall); Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (Total Recall)
Memory -- Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (Delayed Recall Trial); Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (Delayed Recall Trial)
Attention/Working Memory -- WAIS-III Letter Number Sequencing; PASAT Total Correct
Processing Speed -- WAIS-III Digit Symbol; WAIS-III Symbol Search; Trail Making Test (Part A)
Motor -- Grooved Pegboard Time (dominant hand); Grooved Pegboard Time (non-dominant hand)]
Verbal Functioning -- Controlled Oral Word Association Test (F-A-S); Semantic (Animal) Fluency</description>
