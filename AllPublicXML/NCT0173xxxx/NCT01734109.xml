  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an important adjunct for management of wounds, and
      promotes granulation tissue and angiogenesis. Despite these known means for facilitation of
      wound management, further research is needed to examine whether this modality is superior to
      other currently used options, thus defining clear indications for and benefits of NPWT. This
      would also help establish the role of combination therapy, using NPWT with simultaneous
      irrigation or other forms of dressings. This study aims to compare treatment efficacy of
      NPWT, NPWT plus proprietary simultaneous irrigation, and traditional hospital standard of
      care for treatment of grade III &amp; IV pressure ulcers. Primary endpoint of this study is
      comparison of reduction of wound volume between the three treatment arms; and secondary
      endpoints include bacterial load, rate of wound healing, preparation for grafting, and pain.
