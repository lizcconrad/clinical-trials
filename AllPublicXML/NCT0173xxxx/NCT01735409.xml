    <textblock>
      This is a single center, non-randomized phase IIa study to determine the tolerance and safety
      of Abraxane (ABX) in combination with cisplatin (DDP) in patients with advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients in whom the standard therapy had failed or had been
      infeasible will be eligible.The safety and efficacy will be evaluated according to NCI-CTCAE
      V4.0 and RECIST 1.1 respectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is most commonly seen in Southeast Asia, especially in
      southern and southeastern China, where the incidence rate has been documented between 10 and
      150 cases per 100,000 population per year. For advanced or metastatic NPC, chemotherapy
      remain the mainstay of treatment. The 130-nm albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel
      ([Abraxane, ABX ];Celgene,Summit,NJ) is a promising new agent with more efficient entry to
      the tumor microenvironment via caveolae-mediated transcytosis and preferential uptake by
      cancer cells. Superior activity of ABX-based regimens without the necessity for
      antianaphylactic pretreatments been shown in various solid tumors compared with the
      traditional solvent-based paclitaxel-based ones. However, the safety and efficacy of
      combination of ABX and cisplatin (DDP) has not been determined in patients with advanced NPC.
      In this single center, non-randomized phase IIa study, investigators seek to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of ABX-DDP, and perform an
      exploratory study of its efficacy as measured by tumor response.
