      This study will test compare the Stentys Stent with the Multi-Link Vision™ stent system
      (Abbott Vascular Inc.)in patients with a heart attack. It is expected that the Stentys stent
      is not worse than the Vision stent.

    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease continues to be the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in
      the occidental world. Treatment of coronary atherosclerotic disease has been significantly
      advanced by interventional cardiology, and in particular the advent of coronary arterial
      stents. In comparison to angioplasty alone, stents have reduced the incidence of angiographic
      as well as clinical restenosis, the recurrence of angina, the need for coronary arterial
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery, the need for repeat revascularization and the occurrence of
      major adverse cardiac events (MACE).However,problems remain due to failure to achieve optimal
      stent apposition and normal myocardial reperfusion. Early stent malapposition may be due to
      incomplete expansion or undersizing of balloon-expandable stents. Several studies have
      emphasized the importance of early malapposition in the setting of ST elevation MI, in which
      substantial thrombotic burden and the presence of diffuse vasoconstriction may be
      contributory. The Stentys Coronary Stent System includes a self-expanding bare metal
      (nitinol) stent on a rapid exchange (RX) delivery system. In view of the theoretical
      implications of malapposition, the self-expanding property may offer a potential benefit.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Stentys Coronary Stent
      System in the treatment of de novo stenotic lesions in coronary arteries in patients
      undergoing primary revascularization due to AMI as compared to the Multi-Link Vision™
      coronary stent system (Abbott Vascular Inc. The study is powered for non-inferiority of the
      Stentys Coronary Stent System compared to the Vision Stent System.

        General Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject ≥ 18 years old.

          2. Subject experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with AMI of &gt;30 min. in duration.

          3. ST elevation ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous leads or new left bundle branch block, or true
             posterior MI with ST depression of ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous anterior leads.

          4. Symptom duration is &lt;12 hours prior to signing informed consent.

          5. Subject should be in catheterization laboratory and procedure started within 2 hours
             of consent.
