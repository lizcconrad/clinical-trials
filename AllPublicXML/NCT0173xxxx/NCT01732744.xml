  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of a castor bean-based solution (Ricinus communis) for removal of
      complete denture biofilm, comparing it with two products available on the market (sodium
      hypochlorite and alkaline peroxide). Fifty complete maxillary denture-wearers were instructed
      to brush their dentures after meals and once a day, for a period of 07 days, immerse them in
      the following solutions: A - Control: Physiological solution(20 minutes). B - Polident
      alkaline peroxide(3 minutes). C - 1% sodium hypochlorite(20 minutes). D - castor bean-based
      solution(20 minutes). The participants immersed their dentures in each of the solutions,
      according to a randomized sequence. For biofilm quantification, before (Baseline) and after
      the use of each product, the internal surfaces of maxillary complete dentures were revealed
      (1% neutral red), photographed and the stained biofilm was quantified with the aid of
      software (Image Tool 3.0). After concluding measurements of the areas (total and biofilm),
      the percentage of surface covered by biofilm of the complete denture was calculated .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study sought to minimize the occurrence of bias, and whenever possible sought to &quot;blind&quot;
      the parties involved (researchers, volunteers and statisticians), since none of them had
      knowledge of the allocation of treatments. The present study also followed the criteria
      described in the CONSORT Declaration

    <description>The volunteers were instructed to brush their dentures ,3 times a day and use the following chemical immersion methods, only once a day after dinner: A)Physiological solution .B) 1% Sodium Hypochlorite .C) Polident Alkaline Peroxide .D) 2,0% Castor bean solution . All the volunteers used one of the four chemical methods in a random sequence for a period of 07 days each. Between each period of use, there was a one week wash out period during which the patient performed his/her habitual cleaning procedure.On the first day and after 07 days of using the interventions, the internal surfaces of dentures were revealed with 1% neutral red solution and photographed with a digital photographic camera. Biofilm was measured on the photographic images of the complete dentures, using the computerized quantitative method &quot;ImageTool&quot;. After concluding measurements of the areas (total and biofilm), the percentage of surface covered by biofilm of the complete denture was calculated .</description>
