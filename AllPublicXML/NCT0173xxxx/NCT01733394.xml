  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specific rules which generic drug
      companies must follow to get a generic copy of a seizure medication approved. Currently, FDA
      approves generic drugs by requiring studies on normal volunteers who don't have epilepsy and
      who take just one dose of the generic drug followed by a series of blood tests. Some people
      with epilepsy and their physicians have complained about side effects or loss of seizure
      control when taking generic drugs, but no one knows if these complaints are truly because of
      problems with the generic drugs.

      This research is to determine whether several different generic versions and the brand
      version of the medication lamotrigine perform in a similar way when given to people with
      epilepsy.

      The study drug Lamictal® (lamotrigine) and both of the generic forms of lamotrigine to be
      tested are approved by the FDA for the treatment of seizures.

      The study proposed in this protocol will determine if bioequivalence testing performed for
      the FDA translates into similar bioequivalence in a population of people with epilepsy when
      switching among different generics of the anti-epileptic drug (AED). Based on a variety of
      pharmacokinetic (PK) data and clinical reports of concern, the example anti epilepsy drug
      (AED) used for this study will be lamotrigine (LTG).

      In this single dose study, people with epilepsy taking AEDs, but not currently taking the
      test medication, lamotrigine, will be studied. We will use an order-randomized three-sequence
      six-period replicate design with the two most disparate generics studied in two replicate
      periods each and the brand (reference) product studied in two additional periods. A standard
      single dose of the test drug (lamotrigine 25mg) will be administered under controlled
      conditions (fasting with subsequent standardized meals) with a 12-hour in-facility blood
      sample collection followed by a collection every 24 hours for a total of a 96 hour sample
      collection that will be used to establish the pharmacokinetic measures of Cmax, AUC96 and
      AUC∞. Each period will be separated by at least a 12 day washout interval.

      The replicate studies will be used to determine the intra-individual variability of the
      pharmacokinetic responses of the brand and the two generic products, as well as
      subject-by-formulation interaction variances. The data will also be used to calculate
      simultaneously all parameters that are needed to compare the 3 products in average and
      individual bioequivalence and outlier analyses. The differences between the disparate
      generics will be used to establish if the current standards translate to equivalence within
      the limits of the brand intra-subject variation.

      The factors we will use to determine the most disparate generics include the results from the
      in vivo data from the ABE studies submitted to the FDA in the ANDA and in vitro chemical
      assay (potency) and dissolution data performed on several currently available lots. The
      intent is to study the specific lot of the generic product predicted to result in the lowest
      levels and compare it to the specific lot from another generic product predicted to result in
      the highest levels. Similarly, if multiple lots of the brand products are available, we will
      perform in vitro testing to establish the most desirable lot to study.

      Factors that alter metabolism, including concomitant AEDs that may have hepatic enzyme
      induction effects will be tracked but not excluded, as long as the dose remains constant, as
      the goal is to reproduce the 'real life' situation as closely as possible within the
      practical limits of funding and study size. Subjects receiving valproate as concomitant
      medication will be excluded because the prolongation of half life would not allow LTG to
      reliably be completely cleared by 13 days. The criteria that establish an enriched population
      will also be tracked and used in a secondary analysis, but will not be used as an inclusion
      requirement. The enriched population is defined as people who experienced an otherwise
      unexplained increase in seizures or adverse effects, or a substantial change in AED level
      after a switch in AED products.

      The discovery of any subject-by-formulation interaction outliers (i.e. subjects with
      differential pharmacokinetic reactions to a pair of formulations) will raise considerable
      concerns about equivalence. Recently established methods in the statistical analysis of
      outliers in crossover studies will be used to determine if any outliers are present.

      Qualified subjects will be screened and upon fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria and
      signing the informed consent will be enrolled in the study and enter the randomization phase
      (2-30 days). Subjects will be randomized according to a sealed allocation list that will be
      balanced for sequence and provided to each site prior to the first subject enrollment.
      Subjects that withdraw prior to completing the third period will be replaced in a randomized
      manner. The randomization list will be generated by the study statistical group. There are
      six test periods in three sequences for a sequence-randomized study. During two test periods
      subjects will receive a single dose of the brand AED and during the other four test periods
      subjects will receive a single dose from one of the two investigated generics (each twice).
      The single doses will be administered in the fasting state during an in-facility 12-hour
      pharmacokinetic session to collect samples to determine Cmax and AUCs. Four additional
      samples will be drawn at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the dose as an outpatient (making
      each pharmacokinetic test last for 4 days). Each in-facility pharmacokinetic testing will be
      separated by a 12-23 day washout period; consistent washout periods of 14 days will be
      preferred. A final follow-up phone evaluation will be conducted 12-16 days (target 14 days)
      after the last dose. During the study the subjects will continue their usual concomitant
      medications, including AEDs, without change.

      Investigators will compare the AED levels as measured by Cmax and AUC in each group using
      average bioequivalence (ABE) and individual bioequivalence (IBE) criteria. Average
      bioequivalence will be established if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of
      Cmax and AUCs for the most disparate generic products compared to each other are entirely
      within the 80%-125% range (the FDA criteria for bioequivalence) using the two one-sided
      standard analyses. Otherwise the products will be considered to not be bioequivalent.
      Similarly, the products will be considered to not be bioequivalent if the criteria for IBE
      for each generic product compared to the brand product are not met.

      Study Population: Approximately 54 subjects (45 subjects to completion).

      Number of centers: 3 sites enrolling approximately 18 subjects each.

      Duration of study: Approximately 1 year.

        Eligible subjects must satisfy the criteria below at the time of enrollment:

          1. 18 years or older.

          2. BMI not less than 18.5 and weight not less than 110 pounds.

          3. Not donated blood within the past 56 days before the first pharmacokinetic testing.

          4. Agrees not to donate blood at any time during the trial and for 56 days after the
             final PK in-facility admission.

          5. Has epilepsy for at least one year based on site PIs assessment.

          6. Taking at least one AED, which is not the study medication (lamotrigine).

          7. No changes in AED regimen for at least 28 days prior to first pharmacokinetic testing.

          8. Have the ability to understand the informed consent form and be willing to provide
             informed consent.

          9. Willing to remain on same AED regimen through entire study. Subjects will be
             responsible to supply all of their concomitant medications (except for the study
             medication, lamotrigine).

         10. Willing to stay approximately 14 hours in the research facility on six separate
             occasions for pharmacokinetic testing.

         11. Willing to fast overnight and the morning of each of the six pharmacokinetic testing
             sessions.

         12. Willing to have at least 23 blood samples collected during the pharmacokinetic testing
             including the in-facility session and each of the following four mornings for 96 hours
             post the study medication dose to complete the sample collection for each of the 6
             periods. The in-facility blood collections will mainly be performed using an inserted
             catheter. In the event of difficulty with the catheter, samples may be drawn by
             venipuncture. The outpatient collections will be drawn by venipuncture. The total
             amount of blood during each PK session will be equal to about 14 teaspoons (66.5
             milliliters). The total amount of blood drawn throughout the entire study will be
             about 96 teaspoons (478.5 milliliters) or less. For reference, this amount is
             approximately equal to the quantity of blood drawn during a standard blood donation by
             the Red Cross.

         13. Willing to completely abstain from alcohol consumption for at least 24 hours prior to
             each pharmacokinetic testing admission until after the last sample is drawn for each
             period (~96 hours after the initial dose at each pharmacokinetic admission). We
             encourage no or minimal alcohol use throughout the study, but alcohol is not
             restricted at other times.

         14. Willing to remain on a consistent regimen of concomitant medications including
             over-the-counter drugs and herbal drugs, if they are being used and deemed to possibly

             study.

         16. If a tobacco user, willing to continue with the same pattern of tobacco use, except
             that no tobacco use is permitted during the PK facility admissions of approximately 14
             hours (includes all tobacco products).

         17. Willing to complete the subject diary as outlined in the protocol.

         18. Willing to adhere to all other protocol requirements as outlined in the informed
             consent document.

         19. Females must be either of non-childbearing potential (defined as having undergone
             surgical sterilization or postmenopausal (greater than 50 years old and amenorrhea for
             greater than or equal to 12 months) or must be using at least one acceptable method of

             prescribed or over-the-counter medication in a manner, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, indicates abuse.

          6. History of psychogenic seizures within the past 2 years.

          7. Any clinically significant psychiatric illness or psychological or behavioral problem
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the subject being able
             to participate in the study or comply with the study requirements. .

          8. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality or illness which, in the opinion of
