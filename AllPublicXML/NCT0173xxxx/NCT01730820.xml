  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perioperative hemodynamic management aims to ensure organ perfusion pressure and an
      oxygen arterial transport adapted to oxygen consumption. Phenylephrine is the Î±-adrenergic
      agonist widely used during anesthesia for arterial pressure control.

      Several questions on phenylephrine global and regional hemodynamics effects remain
      unresolved.

      The investigators assume that Phenylephrine may decrease cardiac output by increasing the
      afterload, while most likely could also make an increase or a stability of cardiac output by
      action on the venous return. The investigators propose an observational study assessing the
      influence of preload dependence, defined by the values of pulse pressure variation, on the
      effect of phenylephrine on cardiac output, measured beat by beat by esophageal Doppler.

      The aim of the investigators work is to improve the understanding of phenylephrine action, a
      daily use therapeutic action, to improve the patients care.
