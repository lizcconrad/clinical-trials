  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triamcinolone acetonide is a mid-potency, class 4/5 topical corticosteroid that is available
      in a spray formulation (Triamcinolone Acetonide Spray, T Spray). It is indicated for the
      relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.
      Unlike more potent steroid products, T Spray has no time limitations on its use; therefore,
      it is commonly used to treat flares in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis,
      and contact dermatitis.

      In contrast to creams and ointments, T Spray can easily cover large and hard-to-reach areas
      of the body. Its optional nozzle directs application of the medication to precise areas
      without affecting nearby areas. Patients requiring a mid-potency corticosteroid for lesions
      on the scalp, back, intertriginous folds, large areas, or areas that require precise
      application would benefit from the T Spray formulation. In the time since the introduction of
      T Spray to dermatology, other topical corticosteroids have entered the market, but T Spray
      remains the only mid-potency corticosteroid available in a spray formulation.

      In a recently published open-label, non-comparator study involving 42 patients with chronic
      steroid-responsive dermatoses, T Spray was used up to four times a day for 28 days.
      Improvement of lesions after one week of treatment was experienced by 85% of patients, and
      95% of subjects preferred the spray over creams and ointment. Most importantly, 56% of
      patients reported an anti-pruritic cooling effect which was experienced upon application.
