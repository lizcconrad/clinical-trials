      The study is to demonstrate non-inferior thyroid remnant first ablation success of Thyrogen
      and 131I compared to thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) and 131I in patients with T4 tumour
      based on historical diagnostic whole body scan (DxWBS) records.

        Historical records at clinical sites will be reviewed in a systematic fashion to identify

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Historical records from patients who meet all of the following criteria will be eligible
        for inclusion in this retrospective evaluation:

          1. Male or female patients living or deceased, aged 18 years or older at the time of
             first ablation for thyroid cancer.

          2. Diagnosed with a well-differentiated T4 tumour (defined as a primary tumour of any
             size that extends beyond the thyroid capsule [this may be referred to as TNM
             classification T4, N0-1, M0-1]). This excludes unusual histological types such as
             oncocytic (Hurthle cell carcinoma), tall cell, sclerosing or cribriform thyroid
             cancers.

          3. Undergone a near-total or total thyroidectomy on or after 01 January 2000

          4. Undergone first ablation of thyroid remnants with high activity 131I (≥28 mCi or ≥
             1.036 GBq).

          5. Undergone first 131I ablation for the T4 tumour using either Thyrogen (0.9 mg IM on 2
             consecutive days) or THW stimulation. This excludes use of non-standard Thyrogen
             regimens (i.e., had a regimen of Thyrogen other than the standard 0.9 mg IM on 2
             consecutive days or received Thyrogen in combination with THW).

          6. Historical records are available confirming ablation results by:

               -  DxWBS using small activity (≥2 mCi or 74 MBq) of iodine 131I (or 123I) performed
                  at least 6 months after administration of the first ablation activity of 131I
                  and/or

               -  Stimulated Tg measured at least 6 months after administration of the first
                  ablation activity of 131I.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Historical records from patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded
        from this retrospective evaluation:

          1. Received propylthiouracil, methimazole, vitamins or supplements containing kelp or
             iodine (taking a multivitamin that does not contain iodine or kelp is acceptable),
             medications that significantly affect iodine handling such as high dose
             corticosteroids, high dose diuretics, or lithium in the 45 days before administration
             of first ablative activity of 131I.

          2. Received any iodine-containing contrast agents within 3 months prior to first ablative
             activity of 131I administered.

          3. Used amiodarone within the 2 years prior to first ablative activity of 131I
             administered.
