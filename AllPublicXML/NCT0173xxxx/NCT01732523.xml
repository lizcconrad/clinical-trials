      Atherosclerosis is a chronic, systemic and progressive disease affecting different arterial
      blood vessels in the body. Atherosclerotic lesions silently progress from small plaques to
      severe stenosis and may remain asymptomatic for years. Unstable plaques and stenosis (also
      called vulnerable plaques), however, are prone to rupture leading to myocardial infarction,
      or stroke. The proliferation of the small arteries that are distributed to the outer and
      middle coats of the larger blood vessels (vasa vasorum) and within the atherosclerotic
      plaques (neovascularization) are inherently linked with the atherosclerotic plaque
      development, plaque inflammation and vulnerability. By injecting ultrasound contrast agents
      (microbubbles) into the blood stream, it is possible to detect this microcirculation of the
      vessel wall and the neovascularization within the atherosclerotic plaque using a
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging technique. Particularly, CEUS of the carotid
      artery has been introduced as a non-invasive technique to improve detection of carotid
      atherosclerosis and to evaluate the presence of carotid plaque neovascularization which has
      emerged as a new marker for plaque vulnerability. The project investigates the predictive
      value of the detection of carotid plaque neovascularization on CEUS imaging in patients with
      asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis regarding the progression of the carotid atherosclerotic
      lesion and future vascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke or vascular
      intervention. The investigators hypothesize that neovascularization within the carotid lesion
      will significantly be more pronounced in patients with progressive carotid lesions and in
      patients suffering future vascular events during. The project will support the concept that
      intraplaque neovascularization is associated with plaque instability and vulnerability and
      therefore, the use of CEUS may provide an additional non-invasive, simple, safe, and reliable
      imaging modality to risk stratify individuals. The identification of vulnerable that are at
      increased risk of rupture by identification of intraplaque neovascularization is expected to
      improve the prediction of future vascular events and thus allow for better treatment
      selection. It will help the clinician to further risk stratify carotid stenosis.
      Particularly, it will help to identify unstable carotid stenosis that may already benefit
      from invasive therapy as carotid thromboendarterectomy and stenting.

      Background: Injection of ultrasound contrast agents, in conjunction with contrast specific
      imaging techniques, is increasingly accepted in clinical use for diagnostic ultrasound
      imaging. As microbubbles contrast agents appear to be ideal pure intravascular tracers to
      enhance the vascular lumen and more important to assess the dynamic spatial and temporal
      heterogeneity of the microvasculature, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) provides a unique
      opportunity for new application especially in vascular imaging. CEUS of the carotid artery
      has been introduced as a non-invasive technique to improve detection of carotid
      atherosclerosis and evaluate the presence of plaque vascularity (vasa vasorum). As the
      proliferation of intraplaque and adventitial vasa vasorum (neovascularization) are inherently
      linked with the atherosclerotic plaque development, plaque inflammation and vulnerability,
      direct visualization of intraplaque neovascularization by CEUS has emerged as a new marker
      for plaque instability.

      Aim: The aim of this study is to test the predictive value of the presence and degree of
      carotid artery atherosclerotic lesion neovascularization assessed with contrast enhanced
      carotid ultrasound in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis in regard to lesion
      progression and future cerebrovascular and coronary events.

      Methode:

      - Baseline characteristics: cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
      smoking, lipids), history of myocardial infarction (MI), coronary or peripheral vascular
      revascularization, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and medications
      (contemporaneous with the carotid duplex ultrasound examination)

      - Atherosclerosis on standard carotis duplex ultrasound: Carotid standard ultrasound will be
      performed using a Philips (Bothel, WA) iU22 ultrasound scanner equipped with a linear array
      L9-3 MHz probe. The examinations will be performed by a trained vascular specialist using a
      standard imaging protocol. Both left and right carotid arteries will be examined. The
      examination includes B-mode ultrasound imaging, color Doppler ultrasound and pulsed Doppler
      spectral analysis of the common carotid artery (CCA), the extracranial segments of the
      internal carotid artery (ICA), and the external carotid artery. The mean and maximal IMT
      value will be measured at the distal part of CCA (2 cm proximal of the tip of the flow
      divider) at the fare wall using an automated edge detection program (QLAB software, Philips;
      Bothel, WA). The degree of stenosis of the ICA at both sides will be graded according to
      current guidelines as 30-50%, 50-69%, or ≥ 70% stenosis based on spectral Doppler velocities.
      The lesion area [cm2] of each plaque will be calculated by drawing a region of interest along
      the lumen-intima interface and the media-adventitia interface of each plaque in a 2D
      longitudinal plan. Total lesion burden will be expressed as total plaque area and will be
      calculated by adding all plaques areas of both sides. Total lesion volume [cm3] of each
      carotid plaque will be measured using stacked contours measurements from 3D data using a
      General Imaging 3D Quantification program (QLAB software, Philips). Lesion echogenicity of
      each plaque will be classified according to well established criteria as uniformly echolucent
      (Class I), predominantly echolucent (Class II), predominantly echogenic (Class III),
      uniformly echogenic or extensively calcified (Class IV).

      - Carotid contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): For CEUS imaging intravenous continuous
      infusion (VueJectTM, Bracco, Milan, Italy) of 4.8ml of phospholipid-stabilized sulfur
      hexafluoride microspheres (SonoVueTM, Bracco) at a flow rate of 1ml/min preceded by a bolus
      inject of 1ml will be used. The examinations will be performed using a Philips (Bothel, WA)
      iU22 ultrasound scanner equipped with a linear array L9-3 MHz probe and with ultrasound
      contrast harmonic software (puls inversion / power modulation). Following setting for CEUS
      imaging will be implemented: mechanical index 0.06, overall gain 80%, compression 36 will be
      provided as &quot;pre sets&quot;. Imaging after start of contrast injection will be performed during 2
      minutes at the right side followed by 2 minutes at the left side and will be standardized as
      follows: using a longitudinal view focusing on the carotid stenosis at the carotid bulb, or
      the proximal part of the ICA. The standard and CEUS studies will be stored digitally as DICOM
      format for further analysis and quantification.

      - Quantification of intraplaque neovascularization on CEUS imaging: Following the infusion of
      ultrasound contrast agent, the presence of blood flow &quot;activity&quot; will be identified based on
      the dynamic movement of the echogenic reflectors (microbubbles) observed within the
      intraplaque microvessels. Intraplaque neovascularization (contrast-agent enhancement) will be
      categorized with visual interpretation using a grading scale previously published: Grade 1
      will be used to indicate no appearance of moving bubbles within the plaque or microspheres
      only confined to the adjacent adventitial layer, Grade 2 will be considered for moderate
      visible appearance of moving bubbles within the plaque at the adventitial side or plaque
      shoulder, and Grade 3 will be reserved for images with extensive intraplaque
      neovascularization with clear visible appearance of bubbles moving to the plaque core.

      The enhancement of the lesion after injection of contrast material will also be
      quantitatively analyzed by use of a time-signal intensity curve analysis software package
      that can display the signal intensity-versus-time curve in the region of interest during the
      process of enhancement. A region of interest with the size and shape fitted to the lesion
      will be drawn manually and positioned at the lesion. Another region of interest of the same
      size and shape will be positioned in the lumen of the carotid artery. The carotid lesion and
      lumen signal intensity-versus-time curves will be produced. The degree of enhancement of the
      lesion during constant flow of the contrast material (steady-state) will be measured by
      looking at the enhanced intensity in the plaque and the ratio of the enhanced intensity (dB)
      in the lesion to that in the lumen of the artery.

      - Clinical and ultrasound follow-up: A clinical follow up and a carotid ultrasound follow up
      including CEUS will be performed 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after inclusion in the study.

      - Sample size analysis: Sample size is estimated to demonstrate statistically significant
      difference in cardiovascular event rate up to 5 years after inclusion between patients with
      moderate or extensive intraplaque neovascularization (vulnerable lesions/patients) and no
      intraplaque neovascularization (stable lesion), assuming a 2-sided level of statistical
      significance of .05, 80% power, and an event rate of 30% in the group with intraplaque
      neovascularization compared to 15% in the group without intraplaque neovascularization.This
      results in a requirement of total 240 individuals in this study project.

      Hypothesis and potential clinical significance:

      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the
      lesions with more intraplaque neovascularization will have more pronounced lesion progression
      over time, and these patients with more pronounced intraplaque neovascularization at baseline
      will have more vascular events during follow-up.

      These results would support the concept that intraplaque neovascularization is associated
      with plaque instability and vulnerability and therefore, the use of CEUS could provide an
      additional non-invasive, simple, safe, and reliable imaging modality to stratify individuals
      risks. The identification of vulnerable and more progressive carotid lesions that are at
      increased risk of rupture and thrombosis by identification of intraplaque neovascularization
      is expected to improve the prediction of future vascular events and thus allow for better
      treatment selection. It will help the clinician to further risk stratify carotid stenosis.
      Particularly, it will help to identify unstable 50-69% carotid stenosis that may already
      benefit from invasive therapy as carotid endarterectomy and stenting, and may refrain
      patients from invasive therapy with stable &gt;70% stenosis.
