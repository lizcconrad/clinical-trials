  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography (PET/CT) scans and sentinel lymph node mapping in finding lymph nodes that have
      endometrial cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will have a PET/CT scan before your
      surgery and sentinel lymph node mapping procedure during the surgery.

      For the sentinel lymph node mapping procedure, a blue dye, a radioactive colloid, and/or an
      indocyanine green (IC-Green) dye will be injected into your cervix during your surgery. The
      study staff will then use a device that detects radioactivity and that looks for lymph nodes
      stained with the dye(s). When the study staff locates the sentinel lymph nodes, they will
      remove them. The sentinel lymph nodes will then be sent to a lab where a pathologist will
      check them to see if they contain cancer cells. Other lymph nodes may be removed as part of
      your standard of care surgery if your surgeon thinks it is in your best interest.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be over after your surgery.

      This is an investigational study. The 2 procedures being compared in this study are standard
      of care.

      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 10 will be enrolled at the
      Harris Health System.

    <description>PET/CT prior to surgery. Surgical approach as determined by the primary surgeon.
At time of surgery, an endometrial biopsy will be performed once the patient is under anesthesia. Intra-operative lymphatic mapping with blue dye, radioactive colloid, and/or indocyanine green will be performed. Sentinel lymph nodes will be removed and labeled as blue, green, and/or hot. These nodes will be processed separately.</description>
