    <description>The HAM-D17 is a clinician-rated 17-item scale for assessing the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. The rating is based on the past 7 days prior to the time of assessment. The total score ranges from 0 to 52 with lower scores indicating less depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>After 2 days of dose-titration, elderly participants received either FK949E 150 mg or FK949E 300 mg once daily at bedtime from day 3 to week 52. Dose increase and reduction was allowed following dose increase or reduction guidelines and at the investigator's discretion. After which, participants went through a follow-up period of 1 week. For participants, who completed or discontinued treatment at FK949E 300 mg, a dose-tapering period was placed before proceeding to the follow-up period, and FK949E 150 mg was administered once daily for 1 week in this period.</description>
