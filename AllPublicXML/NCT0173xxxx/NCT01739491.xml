  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and effectiveness of extended bendamustine in
      the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      This is a Phase IV, open label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      multi-center, observational (a scientific study to make a clear and easy understanding of the
      cause and effect relationship) study of bendamustine. The study duration is of 24 Weeks to
      coincide with the 4 weeks-6 cycles bendamustine treatment. The study will run for three
      years, and will enroll 10 percent of patient who would use this product, as a requirement of
      the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Approximately fifty patients will be
      enrolled in this study. Safety evaluations including adverse events, clinical laboratory
      tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination will be monitored throughout
      the study.
