    <textblock>
      The study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multidimensional worksite intervention
      program to reduce the severity of metabolic disorders in older workers in Taiwan.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a quasi-experiment in older workers from three worksites in
      southern Taiwan.

        -  Qualified subjects were assigned to the intervention or the reference group according to
           their availability to take part in study activities.

        -  A researcher reviewed the health record and discussed with the subject about his/her
           health status.

        -  Subjects in the intervention group received lifestyle interventions. The activities
           included motivational presentations to increase awareness of own health problems and the
           role of lifestyle in the etiology of non-communicable chronic diseases.

        -  Subjects were organized into small groups to have biweekly meetings to share
           experiences, stimulate mutual encouragement and to overcome obstacles.

        -  Anthropometric and biochemical indicators were measured at baseline and endpoint (week
           24).
