      Men following after proven and treated urethritis, looking for signs of chronic genital
      inflammatory syndrome with oxidative stress.

      This group of patients will be compared to a control group with no urethritis and no history
      of urogenital infection. Monocentric, prospective trial.

      Duration of study : one year

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of leucospermia in an chronic inflammatory genital tract syndrome leads to an
      oxidative stress and alterations in sperm parameters. Inflammation also affect the glands of
      the genital tract. This can eventually leads to male infertility, long after the initial
      infection. But 10% of men who seek treatment for infertility have such a leucospermia, while
      it is a potentially treatable cause.

      Main aim of this study: Search of development of an inflammatory genital tract syndrome in
      patients with urethritis proven and treated at 6 months after the end of treatment.This group
      of patients will be compared to a control group with no urethritis and no history of
      urogenital infection. Monocentric, prospective trial.

      Primary endpoint: Seminal elastase value to 6 months after the end of treatment. (500ng/ml or
      greater)

      Secondary objective:

        -  Search for a genital inflammation in patients with urethritis proven and treated at 12
           months after the end of treatment

        -  Search for oxidative stress in patients with urethritis proven and treated at 6 and 12
           months after the end of treatment

        -  Study of the frequency of relapses infectious and / or passages at the stage of chronic
           infection after acute urethritis

        -  Assessment of the parallel evolution of the quality of sperm in the two groups

      Progress of research. Time frame Search :

        -  Duration of inclusions: 12 months

        -  Duration of patient follow-up: 12 months for control group, 14 months at most for
           patients taking into account the duration of treatment for urethritis which is 4 to 6
           weeks

        -  Total duration of the study: 26 months

      Patients &amp; Methods: French monocentric, prospective trial. 300 subjects are planned to be
      included for 150 subjects in each group
