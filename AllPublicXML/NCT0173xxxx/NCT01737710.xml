  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a disease in which the skin is dry and scaly with
      severe itching. People who have atopic dermatitis often have complications from skin
      infections; these can include eczema herpeticum after herpes simplex virus infection or
      eczema vaccinatum after smallpox vaccination. People with atopic dermatitis may suffer from
      skin infections and may therefore respond differently to vaccinations.

      A new flu vaccine which is injected into the skin instead of into muscle has recently been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for vaccination of the general population
      including patients with atopic dermatitis. This new vaccine has been shown to work as well as
      the vaccine which is injected into muscle when tested in people without atopic dermatitis.
      The main purpose of this study is to compare how people with atopic dermatitis respond to
      this new flu vaccine compared to non-atopic volunteers without atopic dermatitis. The second
      purpose is to look at how people with atopic dermatitis respond to the new vaccine which is
      injected into the skin compared to the vaccine which is injected into muscle.

    <measure>Seroprotection, Non-Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Intradermal vs. Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis, Intradermal - Influenza B</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in the percent of participants that achieved seroprotection against influenza B at Day 28 between non-AD and moderate to severe AD participants, following a single dose (0.1mL) of the seasonal 2012 - 2013 Fluzone Intradermal vaccine. Seroprotection is defined as having a serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titer of 1:40 or greater, which represents a sufficient antibody amount to avoid disease in half of the individuals infected with influenza B. Participants who achieved seroprotection prior to vaccination were excluded from the analysis. The goal was to examine whether there was a difference between the two groups in the percent of participants who achieved seroprotection at Day 28 who were not seroprotected prior to vaccination.</description>

A fold-difference of greater than 1 indicated an increase in HAI antibody titers against influenza B as a result of vaccination; therefore, higher numbers indicate a greater probability of avoiding disease if infected with influenza B.

          <title>Seroprotected at Baseline â influenza B</title>
          <description>The number of participants that achieved seroprotection against influenza B at baseline prior to vaccination. Seroprotection is defined as having a serum hemagglutination-inhibition [HAI] antibody titer of 1:40 or greater, which represents a sufficient antibody amount to avoid disease in half of the individuals infected with influenza B. The goal of the study was to examine the immune response to influenza vaccination against influenza B. Participants who were already seroprotected against influenza B prior to vaccination were excluded from all relevant analyses for influenza B.</description>

Seroprotection is defined as having a serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titer of 1:40 or greater, which represents a sufficient antibody amount to avoid disease in half of the individuals infected with influenza H1N1. Participants who achieved seroprotection prior to vaccination were excluded from the analysis.

        <description>The fold-difference (defined as a ratio to describe the change from baseline to Day 28) in geometric mean serum HAI antibody titers against influenza H3N2 between non-AD and moderate to severe AD participants, following a single dose of the seasonal 2012-2013 Fluzone Intradermal vaccine. A fold-difference of greater than or equal to 1 indicated an increase in HAI antibody titers against influenza H3N2 as a result of vaccination; therefore, higher numbers indicate a greater probability of avoiding disease if infected with influenza H3N2 Participants who achieved seroprotection prior to vaccination were excluded from the analysis, which is defined as having a sufficient antibody amount to avoid disease in half of the individuals infected with influenza H3N2.</description>

        <title>Seroconversion, Non-Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Intradermal vs. Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis, Intradermal â Influenza B</title>
        <description>The difference in the percentage of participants that achieved seroconversion at Day 28 between non-AD and moderate to severe AD participants, following a single dose (0.1mL) of the seasonal 2012 â 2013 Fluzone Intradermal vaccine. Seroconversion is defined as a 4-fold or greater increase in serum hemagglutination-inhibition [HAI] antibody titers against influenza B compared to baseline values, which represents the minimum intended effect of vaccination. Participants who achieved seroprotection, defined as having a sufficient antibody amount to avoid disease in half of the individuals infected with influenza B, prior to vaccination were excluded from the analysis. The goal was to examine whether there was a difference between the two groups in the percentage of participants who achieved seroconversion at Day 28 who were not seroprotected prior to vaccination.</description>

        <title>Seroconversion, Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Intradermal vs. Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis, Intramuscular â Influenza H1N1</title>
        <description>The difference in the percentage of moderate to severe AD participants that achieved seroconversion at Day 28 between those given a single dose (0.1mL) of the seasonal 2012 â 2013 Fluzone Intradermal vaccine and those given a single dose (0.1mL) of the seasonal 2012 â 2013 Fluzone (Intramuscular) vaccine. Seroconversion is defined as a 4-fold or greater increase in serum hemagglutination-inhibition [HAI] antibody titers against influenza H1N1 compared to baseline values, which represents the minimum intended effect of vaccination. Participants who achieved seroprotection, defined as having a sufficient antibody amount to avoid disease in half of the individuals infected with influenza H1N1, prior to vaccination were excluded from the analysis. The goal was to examine whether there was a difference between the two groups in the percentage of participants who achieved seroconversion at Day 28 who were not seroprotected prior to vaccination.</description>
