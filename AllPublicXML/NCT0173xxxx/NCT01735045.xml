    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been advised that the contact lenses they will be wearing for the next 3 months
             are being used for investigational purposes and that their informed consent will be
             needed and documented prior to the start of the study.

          -  Visual acuity must be correctable to 20/30, with spherical lenses ranging in power
             from -1.00 to -5.00D, astigmatismâ‰¤1.50D.

          -  Have been successfully wearing soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses for at least one
             month prior to entering the study. (Success means both subject and practitioner are
             satisfied with visual acuity, comfort, and ocular physiology).

          -  Have non-diseased eyes which are normal or which have no preexisting ocular condition
             which would interfere with the patient's ability to adapt to the new pair of LSH
             Silicone Hydrogel Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses. A normal eye is defined as one
             having all the following characteristics:

               1. No evidence of lid infection.

               2. No structural lid abnormality.

               3. No conjunctival abnormality or infection.

               4. A cornea which is clear with no edema, staining, vascularization or abnormal
                  opacities, all as observed by slit lamp examination.

               5. No iritis.

               6. No other active ocular disease that would contraindicate use of the
                  investigational lens.

               7. No GPC (giant papillary conjunctivitis, tarsal abnormality) Grade 2 or greater

          -  Use no ocular medication.

          -  Have no known sensitivity to solutions currently used for contact lens care.

          -  Have binocular correction with contact lenses.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Astigmatism &gt;1.50D

          -  No monocular or monovision fits may be included.

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study

          -  Minors (under age 18) are excluded from the study
