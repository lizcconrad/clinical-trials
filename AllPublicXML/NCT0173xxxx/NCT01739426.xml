  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluation the success of endoscopic treatment of
      Zenker's diverticulum using a LigaSure device (thermal fusion of vessels) via a measure of
      swallowing function at 12 months post-surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our secondary objectives are:

      A. To evaluate short-term (pain, fever, time to start of eating) and medium-term (weight,
      swallowing) post-operative parameters.

      B. To evaluate the prevalence of post-operative complications.
