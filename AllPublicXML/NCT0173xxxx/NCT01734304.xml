  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of an autologous DC
      immunotherapy in patients with AML of non-favorable risk profile.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients ≥ 18 years of either gender with AML of non-favorable risk profile in CR or CRi not
      being eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation will receive as intradermal
      injections at two different sites up to ten immunotherapies with autologous DCs presenting
      two leukemia-associated antigens and one CMV antigen conserved in cryomedium over a time span
      of 26 weeks. Phase I will test the safety and toxicity in a small group of patients (n=6).
      After at least four vaccinations of three patients, the safety and toxicity data will be
      presented to the Data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Only after the DSMB has no objectives
      against the continuation of the trial, further patients will be included into the trial.
      Again, after three more patients, receiving a minimum of four vaccines, clinical data will be
      presented to the DSMB, and phase I will be terminated. The decision for continuation of the
      trial will be done by the DSMB. If there are no objectives by the DSMB, the trial will
      continue and evaluation will be started in a larger group of patients (n=14). During the
      phase II trial, safety and toxicity will be evaluated in a larger co-hort of patients).
      Besides, preliminary assessment of efficacy will be performed including induction of
      immunological responses to leukemia associated antigens as well as to a viral antigen (CMV),
      MRD control, time to progression of disease and ECOG performance status.
