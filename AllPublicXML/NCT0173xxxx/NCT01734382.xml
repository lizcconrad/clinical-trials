    <textblock>
      PART1 Participants in Part 1 (Run-in-Phase) of study will receive Tocilizumab (TCZ)
      (RoActemra/Actemra) 12 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) or 8 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 2
      weeks (Q2W) for up to 24 weeks. Participants who experience a laboratory abnormality during
      part 1 may be eligible to move into Part 2 of the study.

      PART 2 This open-label Phase IV study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in reduced dose
      frequency in participants with adequately controlled systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis
      who have experienced a laboratory abnormality on twice weekly RoActemra/Actemra dosing, that
      has since resolved. Participants will receive RoActemra/Actemra 12 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg
      intravenously every 3 weeks. After 5 consecutive infusions, participants who experience an
      event of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or liver enzyme abnormality will move to every 4 weeks
      RoActemra/Actemra administration. Anticipated time on study treatment is 52 weeks.
