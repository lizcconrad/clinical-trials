    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the SYSTANE® family of products
      (SYSTANE® Lid Wipes, SYSTANE® BALANCE Lubricant Eye Drops, and SYSTANE® Vitamins) on
      meibomian gland functionality in subjects with lipid deficiency related to evaporative dry
      eye as compared to the standard of care warm compresses.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Meibomian gland functionality was evaluated by the investigator using the Meibomian Gland Evaluator (MGE), a handheld instrument that provides a standardized method for applying consistent, gentle pressure to the outer skin of the lower eyelid. The total number of meibomian gland orificies evidencing liquid secretion during expression with the MGE, in both eyes, was recorded. A lower number of functioning meibomian glands may contribute to dry eye syndrome.</description>

    <measure>Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) Questionnaire Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) Questionnaire is a 16-question validated questionnaire (resultant overall score 0-28, with 0 being best and 28 being worst) that measures the frequency and severity of dry eye symptoms. The SPEED questionnaire was completed by the patient with no assistance from the office staff, physician, or anyone else. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>

    <measure>Dry Eye Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Questionnaire Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Dry Eye OSDI Questionnaire is a 12-question validated questionnaire [resultant overall 0-100 score, with 0 being none of the time (best) and 100 being all of the time (worst)] that measures ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision. The OSDI questionnaire was completed by the patient with no assistance from the office staff, physician, or anyone else. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
