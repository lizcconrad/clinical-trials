      Purpose: To compare a novel psychotherapy, Partner-Assisted Interpersonal Psychotherapy
      (PA-IPT), with treatment as usual (TAU) in a sample of pregnant women seeking treatment for
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH)
      Perinatal Psychiatry Program.

      Participants: 52 women, ages 18-45, who are 16-29 weeks pregnant and experiencing a
      depressive episode, and their partners.

      Methods: Women and their identified partners will complete a diagnostic interview, complete
      measures of depressive symptom severity at baseline, and be randomized to treatment with
      PA-IPT or TAU. Women randomized to TAU will be treated by UNC physicians according to the
      UNC-CH Perinatal Psychiatry Program's algorithm for treatment of prenatal MDD (usually one of
      a number of antidepressant medications, tailored to the individual, although some women may
      opt against medication altogether and still be eligible to enroll). Women randomized to
      PA-IPT will participate in 8 therapy sessions with their identified partner over a 12-week
      period, along with one refresher session at or around 6 weeks postpartum. Women and partners
      will be assessed for change in depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction during
      pregnancy at visits 4 and 8, and postpartum at 6-week and 6-month visits.

      Hypothesis: The investigators anticipate notable improvement in both groups similar in
      magnitude, however it is hypothesized that couples participating in PA-IPT will have higher
      relationship satisfaction post-treatment (controlling for baseline satisfaction) than those
      receiving TAU.

    <description>Because treatment(s) are prescribed for subjects by the UNC Perinatal Psychiatry physicians, it is impossible for the investigators to list each potential medication and dosage that might be prescribed to women randomized to this condition. The medication regimens are individual, and some women may opt against medication altogether (and still be eligible to enroll). Women who refuse antidepressant medication will attend visits at the same intervals as those in the study arms for evaluation of safety and symptoms.</description>
