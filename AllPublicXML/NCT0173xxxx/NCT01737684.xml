    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of vibegron (MK-4618)
      administered to participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy participants
      matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). Participants may be enrolled with mild
      hepatic insufficiency.

      This study is planned to be conducted in two parts. Part 1 of the study will include
      participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy participants. If Part 2 is
      conducted, Part 2 of the study will include participants with mild hepatic insufficiency.
