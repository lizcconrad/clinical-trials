      Dose and duration of bisphosphonate therapy will increase the likelihood that patients
      experience delayed healing of non-union fractures.

      We intend to review the UWHealth patient database to identify individuals with delayed or
      nonunion fractures. Subsequently, we will collect associated medical information related to
      fractures such as age of osteoporosis diagnosis, BMI, previous bisphosphonate treatment, type
      and location of fracture, time to complete union, other treatment needed for nonunion etc.
      With this information, we will evaluate the risk of delayed and nonunion fractures in
      patients previously receiving bisphosphonate treatment compared to a normal population. We
      also will investigate other potential causes of delayed or nonunion fractures in this
      population.
