  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other 13 well-known
      hospitals in China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of Recombinant Human
      thrombopoietin combining with Dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with primary immune
      thrombocytopenia (ITP), compared to High-dose Dexamethasone therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial
      of 200 primary ITP adult patients from 14 medical centers in China. One part of the
      participants are randomly selected to receive recombinant human thrombopoietin (given
      subcutaneously at a dose of 300Units/kg for7-14 consecutive days, following with a flexible
      dosage depending on platelet count until the 28th day), combining with dexamethasone (given
      intravenously at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4days, the others are selected to receive
      high-dose of dexamethasone treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 40 mg daily for 4
      days). Platelet count was evaluated before and after treatment, in order to report the
      conversion ratio of primary ITP to chronic ITP.
