    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on corneal endothelial cell density
      (cells/mmÂ²) changes at 3 months when mapracorat ophthalmic suspension, 3% is administered QID
      (four times daily), for 14 days in healthy subjects with a normal ophthalmic history.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a Pinhole visual acuity (VA) equal to or better than 20/40 in both eyes.

          -  Must be in good ocular health

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the study drug or its
             components.

          -  Subjects who currently require or are expected to require treatment with any
             medication listed as a disallowed medication per the Disallowed Therapy section of the
             protocol.

          -  Any topical ophthalmic medication, including tear substitutes that cannot be
             discontinued during the study.

          -  Subjects who are monocular (fellow eye is absent or fellow eye's Pinhole VA is worse
             than 20/200).

          -  Subjects with a history of ocular surgery, or who anticipate ocular surgery in either
             eye within the study period.

          -  Presence of significant ocular or systemic disease that the Investigator determines
             could interfere with the study.
