      The purpose of PREPARE trial is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of TRI versus
      TFI for PCI in patients with left main (LM) and/or three-vessel coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transradial intervention (TRI) has been widely practiced in China, accounting for approximate
      80 to 90% of procedures. A recent meta-analysis indicated that TRI has advantages in reducing
      major bleeding and ischemic events compared to transfemoral intervention (TFI) after the
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, no clinical trial has yet shown
      statistical equivalence in terms of long-term efficacy of TRI compared with TFI for the
      treatment of complex coronary lesions, which is simply due to limited numbers of subjects
      enrolled. The purpose of PREPARE trial is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of
      TRI versus TFI for PCI in patients with left main (LM) and/or three-vessel coronary artery
      disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks,
             benefits and treatment alternatives and he or his legally authorized representative
             provides written informed consent prior to the randomization, as approved by the
             appropriate IEC.

          -  Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina,
             silent ischemia, positive functional study or a reversible changes in the
             electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with ischemia).

          -  Patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery.

          -  Patient with complex lesion who may need two or more than 2 stents implantation during
             the indexed procedure is required surgeon's consultation before the operation. The
