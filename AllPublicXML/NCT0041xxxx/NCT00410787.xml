      The primary purpose of this study was to characterize the pain control achieved with
      long-term repeated dosing of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) in patients with chronic
      cancer pain and the secondary purpose was to characterize the effects of pain on the
      patients' quality of life with long-term, repeated dosing of OROS hydromorphone (slow
      release) taken by patients with chronic cancer pain.

      Study DO-118X was a phase-3, multicenter, open-label extension study in adult patients with
      cancer pain who had successfully completed Study DO-118 with dose-stable pain control taking
      at least 8 mg of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) or its equivalent morphine sulfate SR
      (slow release) dosage. Patients were started on the dose of OROS hydromorphone equivalent to
      the opioid dose on which they had achieved dose-stable pain control in the SR (slow release)
      phase of Study DO-118. Patients returned to their study clinic once a month for 1 year.
      Dosage adjustments to study medications and breakthrough pain medication were permitted. OROS
      hydromorphone HCI (slow release) tablets in 8, 16, 32 and 64mg doses administered orally
      every 24 hours

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have chronic cancer pain, and who have successfully completed the OROS
             hydromorphone SR (slow release) study, DO-118

          -  Patients must have been in dose-stable pain control in the last two days of the slow
             release phase of the study

          -  Patients who require at least 8mg of OROS hydromorphone slow release every 24 hours
             for the management of chronic cancer pain

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pain which is not considered to be potentially responsive to opioids

          -  Gastrointestinal disease of sufficient severity to be likely to interfere with oral
             analgesia including: dysphagia, vomiting, no bowel movement or bowel obstruction due
             to impaction within the 5 days prior to the start of the trial, severe gut narrowing
             that may affect the absorption or transit of orally administered drugs, particularly
             the insoluble OROS outer coating

          -  Any patient in whom the risks of treatment with hydromorphone outweigh the potential
             benefits. Such risk categories include: raised intracranial pressure, hypotension,
             hypothyroidism, asthma, reduced respiratory reserve, prostatic hypertrophy, hepatic
             impairment, renal impairment, elderly and debilitated, convulsive disorders and
             Addison's disease
