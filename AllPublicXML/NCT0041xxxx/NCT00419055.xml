  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and feasibility of same day discharge after elective coronary
      percutaneous intervention in a selected stable patient population. The hypothesis to be
      tested is that in an appropriately selected stable coronary artery disease population post
      percutaneous coronary intervention, early discharge is safe and feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A select stable population of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention are
      randomized to standard of care in-hospital stay for one night or early discharge to a nearby
      hotel. During PCI, patients receive bivalirudin as their anti-coagulant and also must be
      eligible for an angioseal closure device. Patients that stay overnight in the hotel must be
      accompanied by a family member. They return to the cath lab the next day for groin check and
      blood work. Satisfaction questionnaires are filled out by all patients.
