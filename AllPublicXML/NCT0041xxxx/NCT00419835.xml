  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD)has become a significant health problem worldwide. Strategies to
      decrease the rate of progression of this disease and reduce the number of patients needing
      dialysis or renal transplantation are urgently needed. In this study we wish to compare the
      effect of dual blockade of renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors plus angiotensin II
      receptor blocker) compared to the effect of ACE inhibitor monotherapy in patients with
      diabetic chronic nephropathy.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease is the current leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the
      world. Despite all efforts to control this disease, rates of CKD progression are still high
      and a significant number of patients will ultimately need renal replacement therapy.
      Pharmacological blockade of renin-angiotensin system is one of the key elements of CKD
      secondary prevention, and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor 1 blocker (ARB)can be
      used for this purpose. However, it is still not clear if dual blockade (ACEi and ARBs
      simultaneously)is superior to monotherapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. A recent trial has
      suggested that dual blockade is superior to monotherapy in non-diabetic chronic kidney
      disease. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of combination therapy compared
      to ACE inhibitors alone in type 2 diabetic patients with macroalbuminuric diabetic
      nephropathy.
