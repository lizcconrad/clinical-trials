  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RTL1000 is a new agent that has not been previously tested in humans. It is thought that RTL
      may specifically control the abnormal immune response or attack against the insulation on the
      nerves that occurs in multiple sclerosis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible side effects of a single intravenous
      dose of RTL1000 in subjects with multiple sclerosis. Some subjects will also be asked to
      participate in one or both of two substudies, one to test blood samples to see how the body's
      immune system responds after administration of RTL1000, and the other to test blood samples
      to see how the body absorbs and eliminates the RTL1000.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment protocol with up to six treatment
      cohorts, each of which receives a single intravenous infusion of an escalating dose of
      RTL1000. Each dosing group will have six subjects: two who will receive a single dose of
      placebo and four who will receive a single dose of RTL1000. Subjects are observed in the
      hospital during the infusion and for 24 hours afterward, and are then followed weekly for 28
      days and at 1 and 2 months post-infusion to evaluate safety parameters.

      Objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety profile of a single dose of RTL1000
      administered by intravenous infusion, to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of RTL1000 in a
      subset of subjects, and to evaluate the feasibility of assessing immunologic parameters in a
      subset of subjects.

      Endpoints include vital signs, electrocardiogram and physical examination results, adverse
      events, and serious adverse events and safety laboratory parameters (e.g., clinical
      chemistries and hematology values). Disease parameters, such as neurological findings,
      expanded disability status scale (EDSS), 25-ft timed walk, 9-hole peg test, and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) will be measured to ensure that study treatment does not make disease
      worse. Subjects will also be tested at the beginning and end of the study for antibodies to
      the drug and its components.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        A specific blood cell type called HLA-DR2 may be required in order for RTL1000 to work. For
        that reason, all subjects will be tested for HLA-DR2 and only those subjects who test
        positive (about 50%) will undergo further tests to determine if they meet inclusion and
        exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Fulfill McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of chronic progressive or relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis

          -  EDSS score of 0.0 to 6.5

          -  No clinical exacerbations within the 8 weeks before administration of RTL1000

          -  HLA-DR2 positive, as confirmed by study reference laboratory

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of administration of RTL1000 and negative
