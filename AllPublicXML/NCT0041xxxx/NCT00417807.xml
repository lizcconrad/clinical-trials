  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, non-comparative study conducted to investigate the activity and safety of
      imatinib mesylate in refractory desmoplastic small round cell tumors expressing PDGF-R.
      Patients will be treated up to 12 months, or to disease progression. Tumor will be evaluated
      according to Recist criteria
