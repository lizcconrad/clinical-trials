  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This is the first study, that we are aware of, that will evaluate the efficacy of IgIV
           in patients with IgG subclass deficiency.

        -  Will provide data for further collaboration in extending study to involve other
           immunological centers in the United States to study patients with similar disease.

      *10 consenting adults (18 or older) will receive IgIV (Gamunex 10%) monthly at a dose of
      400mg/kg body weight IV at 3ml/minute. Comprehensive labs will be monitored at each visit, as
      well as clinical eval, plus patients will complete a questionnaire each time. There is also a
      3 month follow-up visit after completion of therapy. Specific xrays will be done at the
      beginning and with the last treatment.
