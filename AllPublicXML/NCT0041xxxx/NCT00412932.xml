  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 14 week study will examine the ability of olmesartan medoxomil to lower the blood
      pressure of patients 65 years of age or older with high blood pressure. The medication being
      tested has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of high blood pressure.

             150 mmHg but less than 200 mm Hg and a mean seated diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP)
             less than or equal to 109 mmHg following a 2-3 week single blind placebo run-in
             period.

          3. The difference in MSSBP between visits 2 and 3 or between visits 3 and 3x must be less
             than or equal to 10 mmHg.

          4. Patients with a mean daytime (8am-4pm) systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or
             equal to 140 mmHg and less than or equal to 199 mmHg and a mean daytime diastolic
             blood pressure (DBP) less than or equal to 109 mmHg as measured by an ambulatory blood
             pressure monitoring device (ABPM) following placebo run-in period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the last one year.

          2. History of myocardial infarction, angina, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass

          3. Severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 115 mmHg or systolic blood
             pressure greater than or equal to 200 mmHg).

          4. Patients with secondary hypertension of any etiology, such as renal disease,
             pheochromocytoma or Cushing's syndrome.

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited at 37 US sites (private medical practices and small clinics) over 13 months (Nov 29,06 to Dec 28,07) from each physician’s clientele base. Approximately 200 eligible participants, men and women at least 65 years of age with hypertension or uncontrolled hypertension on current medication, were to receive active treatment</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After 3-4 weeks of placebo, patients with a systolic pressure (SBP) ≥150 ≤199mmHg and diastolic pressure (DBP) ≤109 mmHg at the last 2 visits, and 8-hr daytime SBP &gt;140 and ≤199 mmHg and DBP ≤109 mmHg by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were entered.All started with Olmesartan 20 mg and were titrated if their blood pressure was not controlled</pre_assignment_details>

After 6 weeks they were titrated to the next step which now included Olm 40 mg + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg if their blood pressure was not controlled. After 9 weeks they were titrated to the next step which now included Olm 40 mg + HCTZ 25 mg if their blood pressure was not controlled.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Who Achieved Mean Nighttime (10pm - 6am) Ambulatory Blood Pressure of &lt;140/90 mm Hg, Systolic Blood Pressure &lt;140 mm Hg, and Diastolic Blood Pressure &lt;90 mm Hg After 12 Weeks of Active Treatment.</title>
        <description>All participants started the treatment arm with 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil (Olm). If their blood pressure was not controlled, participants were titrated at 3-week intervals to: Olm 40 mg, then, if needed Olm 40 mg + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg, then, if needed Olm 40 mg + HCTZ 25 mg This outcome measure included all participants at the end of the 12-week treatment period regardless of whether or not they were titrated. They had to have both baseline and 12-week ambulatory blood pressure measurements.</description>
