      This is a randomised and open-label study conducted in 2 medical centers in central part of
      Taiwan. Type 2 diabetic outpatients were eligible if they were aged 30-70 years, were on
      mono- or dual oral antidiabetic drugs for at least 3 months, and had a glycated hemoglobin
      (HbA1c) value between 7.0% and 11.0%. Patients who were treated with insulin or drugs that
      promote weight loss, had impaired renal (serum creatinine concentration greater than 132.6
      μmol/l) or liver (AST or ALT 2.5 times upper limit of normal range) function, had a history
      of hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia, or women of child-bearing potential without adequate
      contraception were excluded. All patients provided their informed consent before they were
      enrolled in this study.

      After an 8-week period of metformin monotherapy (500 mg t.i.d.), all patients were randomised
      to add on either acarbose or glibenclamide. The doses of acarbose and glibenclamide were 50
      mg t.i.d. and 2.5 mg t.i.d., respectively, for 4 weeks and force-titrated to 100 mg t.i.d.
      and 5 mg t.i.d., respectively, for the last 12 weeks. A complete 72 hours of glucose
      monitoring using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system and meal tolerance test (MTT)
      after a 10-h overnight fasting were performed before randomisation and in the end of study.
      Morning urine samples were collected for measurement of 8-iso prostaglandin F2α (8-iso
      PGF2α), a commonly used parameter of oxidative stress (13-14). The primary objectives are the
      changes of MAGE obtained from CGM and urinary excretion rate of 8-iso PGF2α. The secondary
      objectives include changes of HbA1c, lipid profiles including total cholesterol, low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and
      triglycerides, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
      (hs-CRP), total adiponectin, and high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin.

          -  Patients may be included in the clinical trial only if they meet all of the following
             criteria:

               1. Male or female outpatients;

               2. Age 30 - 70 years;

               3. Patients have failed to achieve glycemic control with diet, exercise and max. 2
                  OHA; Hemoglobin A1c level between 7.0 to 11.0 % at V1 and 7-11.5 % at V4.

               4. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is over a minimum 3-month period;

               5. All patients give written informed consent;

               6. For female patients of childbearing potential, the following criteria will be
                  applied:

          -  Using adequate contraception since last menses and will continue to use adequate
             contraception during the clinical trial.

          -  Not lactating.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine) within 7 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication. (Note: the inclusion criterion 6 does not apply to menopausal female).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the clinical trial for any of the following reasons:

               1. Patients with a serum creatinine concentration greater than 132.6 mmol/L (1.5
                  mg/dL) or liver function impairment (AST and ALT 2.5 times upper limit of normal
                  range);

               2. Patients have laboratory test abnormality (biochemistry, hematology, or
                  urinalysis), which in the investigator's opinion might confound the clinical
                  trial. However, patients with hyperlipemia, elevated cholesterol or triglyceride
                  levels, or lipid metabolism disorders are eligible;

               3. Use of chronic insulin therapy;

               4. Patients with medical conditions that could promote lactic acidosis, such as
                  renal or hepatic disease, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (New York
                  Heart Association Functional Classification III and IV), or chronic obstructive
                  pulmonary disease, e.g. respiratory insufficiency, hypoxemic condition;

               5. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to metformin hydrochloride,
                  glibenclamide or acarbose;

               6. Patients receive an investigational drug within 30 days prior to admission to the
                  clinical trial;

                  investigator.
