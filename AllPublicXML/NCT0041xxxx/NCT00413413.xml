    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals. The mean of the 3 measurements was calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>A diastolic blood pressure response was defined as a msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg or a ≥ 10 mmHg decrease compared to baseline at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings.

    <description>Overall blood pressure control rate was defined as a msSBP/msDBP &lt; 140/90 mmHg at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals.

        <title>Percentage of Patients Achieving a Diastolic Blood Pressure Response at the End of the Study (Week 8)</title>
        <description>A diastolic blood pressure response was defined as a msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg or a ≥ 10 mmHg decrease compared to baseline at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals.

          <title>Percentage of Patients Achieving a Diastolic Blood Pressure Response at the End of the Study (Week 8)</title>
          <description>A diastolic blood pressure response was defined as a msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg or a ≥ 10 mmHg decrease compared to baseline at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals. The mean of the 3 measurements was calculated.</description>
          <population>Full-set analysis population: All randomized patients who had a baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement. For patients who did not complete the Week 8 assessment, a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used.</population>
