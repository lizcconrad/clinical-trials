  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to assess whether Silymarin therapy shortens illness
      or prevents complications in patients with acute hepatitis. We will specifically compare
      responses in acute hepatitis patients treated with Silymarin to those given a control
      preparation of a vitamin supplements in a double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial.

      The study is designed as a double-blinded placebo controlled trial. We compare a 4 week
      course of therapy with silymarin tablets and a low-dose vitamin preparation (placebo) and
      then follow-up for a total of 8 weeks to assess treatment response. Outcomes of our
      randomized controlled trial are improvement in symptoms and signs, normalization of liver
      functions, time to resuming normal activities, and and sense of well-being. This protocol
      follows the standard therapeutic care for acute hepatitis except that the patients will
      receive either a herbal supplement (silymarin), which many patients are taking anyway, or a
      vitamin placebo.

      Freshly collected serum will be tested for anti-HAV IgM, anti-HBc Igm, anti-HBs, HBs Ag,
      anti-HCV antibody, HCV-RNA, anti-HDV IgM, anti-HEV IgM, CMV and EBV and for alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), AST, direct and total bilirubin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients admitted to the fever hospital and presenting with symptoms and signs that
             may be consistent with a diagnosis of acute hepatitis.

          -  Recent (&lt;1 month) history of illness.

          -  Elevation of ALT &gt; 2.5 normal.

          -  At least 13 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History suggestive of severe drug-induced acute hepatitis.

          -  Children 12 years and younger.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  Suspected hypersensitivity to Silymarin or vitamin preparations.

          -  Evidence of advanced liver disease e.g. history or presence of ascitis, bleeding
             esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy.

          -  Patients who are critically ill, with multisystem failure or cancer.

          -  Substance abuse such as IV drugs.

          -  Any other conditions, which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient
             unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the patient's participation in and
             completion of the protocol.
