      Objective: To evaluate PCT as a marker of bacterial community acquired pneumonia in a Danish
      Hospital setting. To test if it is possible to reduce the use of antibiotics and the length
      of stay in hospital, and the willingness of the clinicians to take this new marker under
      advisement in their choice of treatment.

      The study is a randomised, controlled intervention study. All adult patients admitted to the
      Department of Infectious Disease at Skejby hospital suspected of a lower respiratory tract
      infection (e.g. CAP, acute exacerbation of COPD and bronchitis) are eligible for inclusion.
      Patients are randomised to have either PCT guided treatment or standard care, in which case
      the doctor will not learn the PCT test result. In the PCT group the antibiotic treatment will
      be based on serum PCT as follows: If PCT is less than 0.25 µg/L antibiotic treatment is
      discouraged; if PCT is greater than 0.25 µg/L antibiotic treatment is encouraged and if PCT
      is greater than 0.5 µg/L antibiotic treatment is strongly encouraged. The treating doctor is
      allowed to overrule the treatment guidelines. The control group will receive antibiotics
      according to usual practice.

      The primary endpoints are antibiotic use and length of stay in hospital. Secondary endpoint
      is the proportion of patients where the treating doctor chooses to disregard the guidelines.
